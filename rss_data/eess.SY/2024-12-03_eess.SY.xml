      <title>Frost/Defrost Models for Air-Source Heat Pumps with Retained Water Refreezing Considered</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyclic frosting and defrosting operations constitute a common characteristic of air-source heat pumps in cold climates during winter. Simulation models that can capture simultaneous heat and mass transfer phenomena associated with frost/defrost behaviors and their impact on the overall heat pump system performance are of critical importance to improved controls of heat delivery and frost mitigation. This paper presents a novel frost formulation using an enthalpy method to systematically capture all phase-change behaviors including frost formation and melting, retained water refreezing and melting, and water drainage during cyclic frosting and defrosting operations. A Fuzzy modeling approach is proposed to smoothly switch source terms when evaluating the dynamics of frost and water mediums for numerical robustness. The proposed frost/defrost model is incorporated into a flat-tube outdoor heat exchanger model of an automotive heat pump system model to investigate system responses under cyclic operations of frosting and reverse-cycle defrosting.</description>

      <title>Dissipative iFIR filters for data-driven design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tackle the problem of providing closed-loop stability guarantees with a scalable data-driven design. We combine virtual reference feedback tuning with dissipativity constraints on the controller for closed-loop stability. The constraints are formulated as a set of linear inequalities in the frequency domain. This leads to a convex problem that is scalable with respect to the length of the data and the complexity of the controller. An extension of virtual reference feedback tuning to include disturbance dynamics is also discussed. The proposed data-driven control design is illustrated by a soft gripper impedance control example.</description>

      <title>Localization Phenomena in Large-Scale Networked Systems: Implications for Fragility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study phenomena where some eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian are largely confined in small subsets of the graph. These localization phenomena are similar to those generally termed Anderson Localization in the Physics literature, and are related to the complexity of the structure of large graphs in still unexplored ways. Using spectral perturbation theory and pseudo-spectrum analysis, we explain how the presence of localized eigenvectors gives rise to fragilities (low robustness margins) to unmodeled node or link dynamics. Our analysis is demonstrated by examples of networks with relatively low complexity, but with features that appear to induce eigenvector localization. The implications of this newly-discovered fragility phenomenon are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transmission Switching and Busbar Splitting in Hybrid AC/DC Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by global climate goals, an increasing amount of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) is currently being installed worldwide. Especially in the context of offshore wind integration, hybrid AC/DC grids are considered to be the most effective technology to transmit this RES power over long distances. As hybrid AC/DC systems develop, they are expected to become increasingly complex and meshed as the current AC system. Nevertheless, there is still limited literature on how to optimize hybrid AC/DC topologies while minimizing the total power generation cost. For this reason, this paper proposes a methodology to optimize the steady-state switching states of transmission lines and busbar configurations in hybrid AC/DC grids. The proposed optimization model includes optimal transmission switching (OTS) and busbar splitting (BS), which can be applied to both AC and DC parts of hybrid AC/DC grids. To solve the problem, a scalable and exact nonlinear, non-convex model using a big M approach is formulated. In addition, convex relaxations and linear approximations of the model are tested, and their accuracy, feasibility, and optimality are analyzed. The numerical experiments show that a solution to the combined OTS/BS problem can be found in acceptable computation time and that the investigated relaxations and linearisations provide AC feasible results.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Prediction of Ship Maneuvering Motion using Ensemble Learning with Feedforward Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS), the accurate modeling of ship maneuvering motion for harbor maneuvers is a crucial technology. Non-parametric system identification (SI) methods, which do not require prior knowledge of the target ship, have the potential to produce accurate maneuvering models using observed data. However, the modeling accuracy significantly depends on the distribution of the available data. To address these issues, we propose a probabilistic prediction method of maneuvering motion that incorporates ensemble learning into a non-parametric SI using feedforward neural networks. This approach captures the epistemic uncertainty caused by insufficient or unevenly distributed data. In this paper, we show the prediction accuracy and uncertainty prediction results for various unknown scenarios, including port navigation, zigzag, turning, and random control maneuvers, assuming that only port navigation data is available. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the utility of the proposed method as a maneuvering simulator for assessing heading-keeping PD control. As a result, it was confirmed that the proposed method can achieve high accuracy if training data with similar state distributions is provided, and that it can also predict high uncertainty for states that deviate from the training data distribution. In the performance evaluation of PD control, it was confirmed that considering worst-case scenarios reduces the possibility of overestimating performance compared to the true system. Finally, we show the results of applying the proposed method to full-scale ship data, demonstrating its applicability to full-scale ships.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Model Predictive Control for Piecewise Affine Systems with Feasibility Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online model predictive control (MPC) for piecewise affine (PWA) systems requires the online solution to an optimization problem that implicitly optimizes over the switching sequence of PWA regions, for which the computational burden can be prohibitive. Alternatively, the computation can be moved offline using explicit MPC; however, the online memory requirements and the offline computation can then become excessive. In this work we propose a solution in between online and explicit MPC, addressing the above issues by partially dividing the computation between online and offline. To solve the underlying MPC problem, a policy, learned offline, specifies the sequence of PWA regions that the dynamics must follow, thus reducing the complexity of the remaining optimization problem that solves over only the continuous states and control inputs. We provide a condition, verifiable during learning, that guarantees feasibility of the learned policy's output, such that an optimal continuous control input can always be found online. Furthermore, a method for iteratively generating training data offline allows the feasible policy to be learned efficiently, reducing the offline computational burden. A numerical experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of the method compared to both online and explicit MPC.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Reliability of Closed-Loop Describing Function Analysis for Reset Control Applied to Precision Motion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sinusoidal Input Describing Function (SIDF) is an effective tool for control system analysis and design, with its reliability directly impacting the performance of the designed control systems. This study enhances the reliability of SIDF analysis and the performance of closed-loop reset feedback control systems, presenting two main contributions. First, it introduces a method to identify frequency ranges where SIDF analysis becomes inaccurate. Second, these identified ranges correlate with high-magnitude, high-order harmonics that can degrade system performance. To address this, a shaped reset control strategy is proposed, which incorporates a shaping filter to tune reset actions and reduce high-order harmonics. Then, a frequency-domain design procedure of a PID shaping filter in a reset control system is outlined as a case study. The PID filter effectively reduces high-order harmonics and resolves limit-cycle issues under step inputs. Finally, simulations and experimental results on a precision motion stage validate the efficacy of the proposed shaped reset control, showing enhanced SIDF analysis accuracy, improved steady-state precision over linear and reset controllers, and elimination of limit cycles under step inputs.</description>

      <title>Maintaining reliability while navigating unprecedented uncertainty: a synthesis of and guide to advances in electric sector resource adequacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliability of the electric grid has in recent years become a larger concern for regulators, planners, and consumers due to several high-impact outage events, as well as the potential for even more impactful events in the future. These concerns are largely the result of decades-old resource adequacy (RA) planning frameworks being insufficiently adapted to the current types of uncertainty faced by planners, including many sources of deep uncertainty for which probability distributions cannot be defensibly assigned. There are emerging methodologies for dealing with these new types of uncertainty in RA assessment and procurement frameworks, but their adoption has been hindered by the lack of consistent understanding of terminology related to RA and the related concept of resilience, as well as a lack of syntheses of such available methodologies. Here we provide an overview of RA and its relationship to resilience, a summary of available methods for dealing with emerging types of uncertainty faced by RA assessment, and an an overview of procurement methodologies for operationalizing RA in the context of these types of uncertainty. This paper provides a synthesis and guide for both researchers and practitioners seeking to navigate a new, much more uncertain era of power system planning.</description>

      <title>Online Voltage Regulation of Distribution Systems with Disturbance-Action Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverter-based distributed energy resources facilitate the advanced voltage control algorithms in the online setting with the flexibility in both active and reactive power injections. A key challenge is to continuously track the time-varying global optima with the robustness against dynamics inaccuracy and communication delay. In this paper, we introduce the disturbance-action controller by novelly formulating the voltage drop from loads as the system disturbance. The controller alternatively generates the control input and updates the parameters based on the interactions with grids. Under the linearized power flow model, we provide stability conditions of the control policy and the performance degradation to model inaccuracy. The simulation results on the radial distribution networks show the effectiveness of proposed controller under fluctuating loads and significant improvement on the robustness to these challenges. Furthermore, the ability of incorporating history information and generalization to various loads are demonstrated through extensive experiments on the parameter sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Adaptive Robust Optimization Model for Joint Unit Maintenance and Unit Commitment Considering Source-Load Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unit maintenance and unit commitment are two critical and interrelated aspects of electric power system operation, both of which face the challenge of coordinating efforts to enhance reliability and economic performance. This challenge becomes increasingly pronounced in the context of increased integration of renewable energy and flexible loads, such as wind power and electric vehicles, into the power system, where high uncertainty is prevalent. To tackle this issue, this paper develops a two-stage adaptive robust optimization model for the joint unit maintenance and unit commitment strategy. The first stage focuses on making joint decisions regarding unit maintenance and unit commitment, while the second stage addresses economic dispatch under the worst-case scenarios of wind power and load demand. Then a practical solution methodology is proposed to solve this model efficiently, which combines the inexact column-and-constraint generation algorithm with an outer approximation method. Finally, the economic viability and adaptability of the proposed method is demonstrated based on the RTS-79 test system.</description>

      <title>Bringing Quantum Systems under Control: A Tutorial Invitation to Quantum Computing and Its Relation to Bilinear Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing comes with the potential to push computational boundaries in various domains including, e.g., cryptography, simulation, optimization, and machine learning. Exploiting the principles of quantum mechanics, new algorithms can be developed with capabilities that are unprecedented by classical computers. However, the experimental realization of quantum devices is an active field of research with enormous open challenges, including robustness against noise and scalability. While systems and control theory plays a crucial role in tackling these challenges, the principles of quantum physics lead to a (perceived) high entry barrier for entering the field of quantum computing. This tutorial paper aims at lowering the barrier by introducing basic concepts required to understand and solve research problems in quantum systems. First, we introduce fundamentals of quantum algorithms, ranging from basic ingredients such as qubits and quantum logic gates to prominent examples and more advanced concepts, e.g., variational quantum algorithms. Next, we formalize some engineering questions for building quantum devices in the real world, which requires the careful manipulation of microscopic quantities obeying quantum effects. To this end for N-level systems, we introduce basic concepts of (bilinear) quantum systems and control theory including controllability, observability, and optimal control in a unified frame. Finally, we address the problem of noise in real-world quantum systems via robust quantum control, which relies on a set-membership uncertainty description frequently employed in control.</description>

      <title>A Control Framework for CUBESAT Rendezvous and Proximity Operations using Electric Propulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A control framework is presented to solve the rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) problem of the EP-Gemini mission. In this mission, a CubeSat chaser is controlled to approach and circumnavigate the other uncooperative CubeSat target. Such a problem is challenging because the chaser operates on a single electric propulsion thruster, for which coupling between attitude control and thrust vector, and charging of the electric propulsion system must be taken into consideration. In addition, the access to relative states in real time is not achievable due to the onboard hardware constraints of the two CubeSats. The developed control framework addresses these limitations by applying four modularized maneuver blocks to correct the chaser's mean orbit elements in sequence. The control framework is based on a relative motion called safety ellipse to ensure a low collision risk. The complete EP-Gemini mission is demonstrated by the implementation of the proposed control framework in a numerical simulation that includes high order perturbations for low Earth orbit. The simulation result shows that a safety ellipse is established after a 41-day RPO maneuver, which consumes 44$\%$ of the total fuel in terms of $\Delta V$. The resulting 3-dimensional safety ellipse circumnavigates the target with an approximate dimension of 14 km $\times$ 27 km $\times$ 8 km.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the Benefits of P2P Energy Exchanges in Resilience Enhancement of Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the adoption of distributed energy resources grows, power systems are becoming increasingly complex and vulnerable to disruptions, such as natural disasters and cyber-physical threats. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy markets offer a practical solution to enhance reliability and resilience during power outages while providing monetary and technical benefits to prosumers and consumers. This paper explores the advantages of P2P energy exchanges in active distribution networks using a double auction mechanism, focusing on improving system resilience during outages. Two pricing mechanisms distribution locational marginal price (DLMP) and average price mechanism are used to complement each other in facilitating efficient energy exchange. DLMP serves as a price signal that reflects network conditions and acts as an upper bound for bidding in the P2P market. Meanwhile, prosumers and consumers submit bids in the market and agree on energy transactions based on average transaction prices, ensuring fast matching and fair settlements. Simulation results indicate that during emergency operation modes, DLMP prices increase, leading to higher average transaction prices. Prosumers benefit from increased market clearing prices, while consumers experience uninterrupted electricity supply.</description>

      <title>Techno-Economic Assessment of Net-Zero Energy Buildings: Financial Projections and Incentives for Achieving Energy Decarbonization Goals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements, net-zero emission policies, along with declining costs of renewable energy, battery storage, and electric vehicles (EVs), are accelerating the transition toward cleaner, more resilient energy systems. This paper conducts a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of Net-Zero Energy Buildings (NZEBs) within Florida's energy transition by 2050. The analysis focuses on the financial advantages of integrating rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems, battery storage, and EVs collectively compared to reliance on grid electricity for both existing and newly built homes in Orlando, Florida. By leveraging federal incentives like the Investment Tax Credit and considering energy efficiency improvements, residents can achieve significant savings. Simulation results show that existing homes with a 9.5 kW PV system and 42.2 kWh battery are projected to generate positive returns by 2029, while newly constructed homes meet this threshold as early as 2024. Also, rooftop solar used to charge an EV can save up to 100 dollars per month for residents compared to gasoline. Combining PV and battery storage not only lowers electric bills but also enhances grid independence and resilience against grid outages. Beyond individual savings, NZEBs contribute to grid stability by reducing electricity demand and supporting utility-scale renewable applications. These advancements lower infrastructure costs, help Florida residents and utilities align with national decarbonization goals, retain approximately $23 Billion dollars within the state and foster progress toward a sustainable, low-carbon future.</description>

Abstract: The decreasing costs of photovoltaic (PV) systems and battery storage, alongside the rapid rise of electric vehicles (EVs), present a unique opportunity to revolutionize energy use in apartment complexes. Generating electricity via PV and batteries is currently cheaper and greener than relying on grid power, which is often expensive. Yet, residents in multi-building apartment complexes typically lack access to fast EV charging infrastructure. To this end, this paper investigates the feasibility and energy management of deploying commercial PV-powered battery storage and EV fast chargers within apartment complexes in Orlando, Florida, operated by complex owners. By modeling the complex as a grid-connected microgrid, it aims to meet residents' energy needs, provide backup power during emergencies, and introduce a profitable business model for property owners. To address PV power generation uncertainty, a distributionally robust chance-constrained optimization method using the Wasserstein metric is employed, ensuring robust and reliable operation. The techno-economic analysis reveals that EVs powered by PV and batteries are more cost-effective and environmentally friendly than gasoline vehicles that EV owners can save up to 100 dollars per month by saving on fuel costs. The results also show that integrating PV and battery systems reduces operational costs, lowers emissions, increases resilience, and supports EV adoption while offering a profitable business model for property owners. These findings highlight a practical and sustainable framework for advancing clean energy use in residential complexes.</description>

      <title>Online convex optimization for constrained control of nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of controlling nonlinear dynamical systems subject to state and input constraints while minimizing time-varying and a priori unknown cost functions. We propose a modular approach that combines the online convex optimization framework and reference governors to solve this problem. Our method is general in the sense that we do not limit our analysis to a specific choice of online convex optimization algorithm or reference governor. We show that the dynamic regret of the proposed framework is bounded linearly in both the dynamic regret and the path length of the chosen online convex optimization algorithm, even though the online convex optimization algorithm does not account for the underlying dynamics. We prove that a linear bound with respect to the online convex optimization algorithm's dynamic regret is optimal, i.e., cannot be improved upon. Furthermore, for a standard class of online convex optimization algorithms, our proposed framework attains a bound on its dynamic regret that is linear only in the variation of the cost functions, which is known to be an optimal bound. Finally, we demonstrate implementation and flexibility of the proposed framework by comparing different combinations of online convex optimization algorithms and reference governors to control a nonlinear chemical reactor in a numerical experiment.</description>

      <title>Dual-Use Commercial and Military Communications on a Single Platform using RAN Domain Specific Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the success of the O-RAN Alliance in developing a set of interoperable interfaces, development of unique Radio Access Network (RAN) deployments remains challenging. This is especially true for military communications, where deployments are highly specialized with limited volume. The construction and maintenance of the RAN, which is a real time embedded system, is an ill-defined NP problem requiring teams of specialized system engineers, with specialized knowledge of the hardware platform. In this paper, we introduce a RAN Domain Specific Language (RDSL(TM)) to formally describe use cases, constraints, and multi-vendor hardware/software abstraction to allow automation of RAN construction. In this DSL, system requirements are declarative, and performance constraints are guaranteed by construction using an automated system solver. Using our RAN system solver platform, Gabriel(TM) we show how a system engineer can confidently modify RAN functionality without knowledge of the underlying hardware. We show benefits for specific system requirements when compared to the manually optimized, default configuration of the Intel FlexRAN(TM), and conclude that DSL/automation driven construction of the RAN can lead to significant power and latency benefits when the deployment constraints are tuned for a specific case. We give examples of how constraints and requirements can be formatted in a "Kubernetes style" YAML format which allows the use of other tools, such as Ansible, to integrate the generation of these requirements into higher level automation flows such as Service Management and Orchestration (SMO).</description>

      <title>A Compact Hybrid Battery Thermal Management System for Enhanced Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid battery thermal management systems (HBTMS) combining active liquid cooling and passive phase change materials (PCM) cooling have shown a potential for the thermal management of lithium-ion batteries. However, the fill volume of coolant and PCM in hybrid cooling systems is limited by the size and weight of the HBTMS at high charge/discharge rates. These limitations result in reduced convective heat transfer from the coolant during discharge. The liquefaction rate of PCM is accelerated and the passive cooling effect is reduced. In this paper, we propose a compact hybrid cooling system with multi-inlet U-shaped microchannels for which the gap between channels is embedded by PCM/aluminum foam for compactness. Nanofluid cooling (NC) technology with better thermal conductivity is used. A pulsed flow function is further developed for enhanced cooling (EC) with reduced power consumption. An experimentally validated thermal-fluid dynamics model is developed to optimize operating conditions including coolant type, cooling direction, channel height, inlet flow rate, and cooling scheme. The results show that the hybrid cooling solution of NC+PCM+EC adopted by HBTMS further reduces the maximum temperature of the Li-ion battery by 3.44{\deg}C under a discharge rate of 1C at room temperature of 25{\deg}C with only a 5% increase in power consumption, compared to the conventional liquid cooling method for electric vehicles (EV). The average number of battery charges has increased by about 6 to 15 percent. The results of this study can help improve the range as well as driving safety of new energy EV.</description>

      <title>Characterizing and Modeling AI-Driven Animal Ecology Studies at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Platforms that run artificial intelligence (AI) pipelines on edge computing resources are transforming the fields of animal ecology and biodiversity, enabling novel wildlife studies in animals' natural habitats. With emerging remote sensing hardware, e.g., camera traps and drones, and sophisticated AI models in situ, edge computing will be more significant in future AI-driven animal ecology (ADAE) studies. However, the study's objectives, the species of interest, its behaviors, range, habitat, and camera placement affect the demand for edge resources at runtime. If edge resources are under-provisioned, studies can miss opportunities to adapt the settings of camera traps and drones to improve the quality and relevance of captured data. This paper presents salient features of ADAE studies that can be used to model latency, throughput objectives, and provision edge resources. Drawing from studies that span over fifty animal species, four geographic locations, and multiple remote sensing methods, we characterized common patterns in ADAE studies, revealing increasingly complex workflows involving various computer vision tasks with strict service level objectives (SLO). ADAE workflow demands will soon exceed individual edge devices' compute and memory resources, requiring multiple networked edge devices to meet performance demands. We developed a framework to scale traces from prior studies and replay them offline on representative edge platforms, allowing us to capture throughput and latency data across edge configurations. We used the data to calibrate queuing and machine learning models that predict performance on unseen edge configurations, achieving errors as low as 19%.</description>

      <title>Resilience-oriented Planning and Cost Allocation of Energy Storage Integrated with Soft Open Point Based on Resilience Insurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, frequent extreme events have put forward higher requirements for improving the resilience of distribution networks (DNs). Introducing energy storage integrated with soft open point (E-SOP) is one of the effective ways to improve resilience. However, the widespread application of E-SOP is limited by its high investment cost. Based on this, we propose a cost allocation framework and optimal planning method of E-SOP in resilient DN. Firstly, a cost allocation mechanism for E-SOP based on resilience insurance service is designed; the probability of power users purchasing resilience insurance service is determined based on the expected utility theory. Then, a four-layer stochastic distributionally robust optimization (SDRO) model is developed for E-SOP planning and insurance pricing strategy, where the uncertainty in the intensity of contingent extreme events is addressed by a stochastic optimization approach, while the uncertainty in the occurrence of outages and resilience insurance purchases resulting from a specific extreme event is addressed via a distributionally robust optimization approach. Finally, The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified on the modified IEEE 33-bus DN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a machine-learning study for solar inverter power regulation in a remote microgrid. Machine learning models for active and reactive power control are respectively trained using an ensemble learning method. Then, unlike conventional schemes that make inferences on a central server in the far-end control center, the proposed scheme deploys the trained models on an embedded edge-computing device near the inverter to reduce the communication delay. Experiments on a real embedded device achieve matched results as on the desktop PC, with about 0.1ms time cost for each inference input.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, an edge computing-based machine-learning study is conducted for solar inverter power forecasting and droop control in a remote microgrid. The machine learning models and control algorithms are directly deployed on an edge-computing device (a smart meter-concentrator) in the microgrid rather than on a cloud server at the far-end control center, reducing the communication time the inverters need to wait. Experimental results on an ARM-based smart meter board demonstrate the feasibility and correctness of the proposed approach by comparing against the results on the desktop PC.</description>

      <title>Data-driven optimal control of unknown nonlinear dynamical systems using the Koopman operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optimal control is vital for numerous applications but remains challenging for unknown systems due to the difficulties in accurately modelling dynamics and handling computational demands, particularly in high-dimensional settings. This work develops a theoretically certifiable framework that integrates a modified Koopman operator approach with model-based reinforcement learning to address these challenges. By relaxing the requirements on observable functions, our method incorporates nonlinear terms involving both states and control inputs, significantly enhancing system identification accuracy. Moreover, by leveraging the power of neural networks to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), our approach is able to achieving stabilizing control for high-dimensional dynamical systems, up to 9-dimensional. The learned value function and control laws are proven to converge to those of the true system at each iteration. Additionally, the accumulated cost of the learned control closely approximates that of the true system, with errors ranging from $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>FRIDAY: Real-time Learning DNN-based Stable LQR controller for Nonlinear Systems under Uncertain Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) is often combined with feedback linearization (FBL) for nonlinear systems that have the nonlinearity additive to the input. Conventional approaches estimate and cancel the nonlinearity based on the first principle or data-driven methods such as Gaussian Processes (GPs). However, the former needs an elaborate modeling process, and the latter provides a fixed learned model, which may be suffering when the model dynamics are changing. In this letter, we take a Deep Neural Network (DNN) using a real-time-updated dataset to approximate the unknown nonlinearity while the controller is running. Spectrally normalizing the weights in each time-step, we stably incorporate the DNN prediction to an LQR controller and compensate for the nonlinear term. Leveraging the property of the bounded Lipschitz constant of the DNN, we provide theoretical analysis and locally exponential stability of the proposed controller. Simulation results show that our controller significantly outperforms Baseline controllers in trajectory tracking cases.</description>

      <title>Real-time Traffic Simulation and Management for Large-scale Urban Air Mobility: Integrating Route Guidance and Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the spatial heterogeneity of land use patterns in most cities, large-scale UAM will likely be deployed in specific areas, e.g., inter-transfer traffic between suburbs and city centers. However, large-scale UAM operations connecting multiple origin-destination pairs raise concerns about air traffic safety and efficiency with respect to conflict movements, particularly at large conflict points similar to roadway junctions. In this work, we propose an operational framework that integrates route guidance and collision avoidance to achieve an elegant trade-off between air traffic safety and efficiency. The route guidance mechanism aims to optimize aircraft distribution across both spatial and temporal dimensions by regulating their paths (composed of waypoints). Given the optimized paths, the collision avoidance module aims to generate collision-free aircraft trajectories between waypoints in 3D space. To enable large-scale operations, we develop a fast approximation method to solve the optimal path planning problem and employ the velocity obstacle model for collision avoidance. The proposed route guidance strategy significantly reduces the computational requirements for collision avoidance. As far as we know, this work is one of the first to combine route guidance and collision avoidance for UAM. The results indicate that the framework can enable efficient and flexible UAM operations, such as air traffic assignment, congestion prevention, and dynamic airspace clearance. Compared to the management scheme based on air corridors, the proposed framework has considerable improvements in computational efficiency (433%), average travel speed (70.2%), and trip completion rate (130%). The proposed framework has demonstrated great potential for real-time traffic simulation and management in large-scale UAM systems.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Artificial Intelligence for Gear Fault Diagnosis in Motor Drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to quantify the uncertainties in fault diagnosis of motor drives using Bayesian neural networks (BNN). Conventional data-driven approaches used for fault diagnosis often rely on point-estimate neural networks, which merely provide deterministic outputs and fail to capture the uncertainty associated with the inference process. In contrast, BNNs offer a principled framework to model uncertainty by treating network weights as probability distributions rather than fixed values. It offers several advantages: (a) improved robustness to noisy data, (b) enhanced interpretability of model predictions, and (c) the ability to quantify uncertainty in the decision-making processes. To test the robustness of the proposed BNN, it has been tested under a conservative dataset of gear fault data from an experimental prototype of three fault types at first, and is then incrementally trained on new fault classes and datasets to explore its uncertainty quantification features and model interpretability under noisy data and unseen fault scenarios.</description>

      <title>RL2: Reinforce Large Language Model to Assist Safe Reinforcement Learning for Energy Management of Active Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large-scale distributed energy resources are integrated into the active distribution networks (ADNs), effective energy management in ADNs becomes increasingly prominent compared to traditional distribution networks. Although advanced reinforcement learning (RL) methods, which alleviate the burden of complicated modelling and optimization, have greatly improved the efficiency of energy management in ADNs, safety becomes a critical concern for RL applications in real-world problems. Since the design and adjustment of penalty functions, which correspond to operational safety constraints, requires extensive domain knowledge in RL and power system operation, the emerging ADN operators call for a more flexible and customized approach to address the penalty functions so that the operational safety and efficiency can be further enhanced. Empowered with strong comprehension, reasoning, and in-context learning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) provide a promising way to assist safe RL for energy management in ADNs. In this paper, we introduce the LLM to comprehend operational safety requirements in ADNs and generate corresponding penalty functions. In addition, we propose an RL2 mechanism to refine the generated functions iteratively and adaptively through multi-round dialogues, in which the LLM agent adjusts the functions' pattern and parameters based on training and test performance of the downstream RL agent. The proposed method significantly reduces the intervention of the ADN operators. Comprehensive test results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven and Stealthy Deactivation of Safety Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety filters ensure that control actions that are executed are always safe, no matter the controller in question. Previous work has proposed a simple and stealthy false-data injection attack for deactivating such safety filters. This attack injects false sensor measurements to bias state estimates toward the interior of a safety region, making the safety filter accept unsafe control actions. The attack does, however, require the adversary to know the dynamics of the system, the safety region used in the safety filter, and the observer gain. In this work we relax these requirements and show how a similar data-injection attack can be performed when the adversary only observes the input and output of the observer that is used by the safety filter, without any a priori knowledge about the system dynamics, safety region, or observer gain. In particular, the adversary uses the observed data to identify a state-space model that describes the observer dynamics, and then approximates a safety region in the identified embedding. We exemplify the data-driven attack on an inverted pendulum, where we show how the attack can make the system leave a safe set, even when a safety filter is supposed to stop this from happening.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analogue of the describing function method is developed using square waves rather than sinusoids. Static nonlinearities map square waves to square waves, and their behavior is characterized by their response to square waves of varying amplitude - their amplitude response. The output of an LTI system to a square wave input is approximated by a square wave, to give an analogue of the describing function. The classical describing function method for predicting oscillations in feedback interconnections is generalized to this square wave setting, and gives accurate predictions when oscillations are approximately square.</description>

      <title>Energy Profiling and Analysis of 5G Private Networks: Evaluating Energy Consumption Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Private 5G networks provide enhanced security, a wide range of optimized services through network slicing, reduced latency, and support for many IoT devices in a specific area, all under the owner's full control. Higher security and privacy to protect sensitive data is the most significant advantage of private networks, in e.g., smart hospitals. For long-term sustainability and cost-effectiveness of private 5G networks, analyzing and understanding the energy consumption variation holds a greater significance in reaching toward green private network architecture for 6G. This paper addresses this research gap by providing energy profiling of network components using an experimental laboratory setup that mimics real private 5G networks under various network conditions, which is a missing aspect in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the Plant Controller Communication Time-Delay Considering PMSG-Based Wind Turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The communication control delay between the inverters and the power plant controller can be caused by several factors related to the communication link between them. Under undesirable conditions, high delay values can produce oscillations in the wind power plant that can affect the rest of the power system. In this work, we present a new robust methodology for wind turbines to estimate the value of the communication control delay using PMU data. Several scenarios are considered where external faults are simulated and the performance of the algorithm is evaluated based on dynamic state estimation of the mathematical model of the wind turbine. In this paper, we have shown that the characterization of the delay can be performed offering the transmission system operator an online tool to identify the most suited communication delay for the plant controller models used in dynamic studies.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Control Systems via Neural Simulation Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transfer learning is an umbrella term for machine learning approaches that leverage knowledge gained from solving one problem (the source domain) to improve speed, efficiency, and data requirements in solving a different but related problem (the target domain). The performance of the transferred model in the target domain is typically measured via some notion of loss function in the target domain. This paper focuses on effectively transferring control logic from a source control system to a target control system while providing approximately similar behavioral guarantees in both domains. However, in the absence of a complete characterization of behavioral specifications, this problem cannot be captured in terms of loss functions. To overcome this challenge, we use (approximate) simulation relations to characterize observational equivalence between the behaviors of two systems.
  Simulation relations ensure that the outputs of both systems, equipped with their corresponding controllers, remain close to each other over time, and their closeness can be quantified {\it a priori}. By parameterizing simulation relations with neural networks, we introduce the notion of \emph{neural simulation relations}, which provides a data-driven approach to transfer any synthesized controller, regardless of the specification of interest, along with its proof of correctness. Compared with prior approaches, our method eliminates the need for a closed-loop mathematical model and specific requirements for both the source and target systems. We also introduce validity conditions that, when satisfied, guarantee the closeness of the outputs of two systems equipped with their corresponding controllers, thus eliminating the need for post-facto verification. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through case studies involving a vehicle and a double inverted pendulum.</description>

      <title>Boundary Control Behaviors of Multiple Low-cost AUVs Using Acoustic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents acoustic-based methods for the control of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV). This study proposes two different models for implementing boundary and path control on low-cost AUVs using acoustic communication and a single central acoustic beacon. Two methods are presented: the Range Variation-Based (RVB) model completely relies on range data obtained by acoustic modems, whereas the Heading Estimation-Based (HEB) model uses ranges and range rates to estimate the position of the central boundary beacon and perform assigned behaviors. The models are tested on two boundary control behaviors: Fencing and Milling. Fencing behavior ensures AUVs return within predefined boundaries, while Milling enables the AUVs to move cyclically on a predefined path around the beacon. Models are validated by successfully performing the boundary control behaviors in simulations, pool tests, including artificial underwater currents, and field tests conducted in the ocean. All tests were performed with fully autonomous platforms, and no external input or sensor was provided to the AUVs during validation. Quantitative and qualitative analyses are presented in the study, focusing on the effect and application of a multi-robot system.</description>

      <title>Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions with Diffuser for Safety-Critical Trajectory Planning at Signal-Free Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planning safe and efficient trajectories through signal-free intersections presents significant challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in dynamic, multi-task environments with unpredictable interactions and an increased possibility of conflicts. This study aims to address these challenges by developing a robust, adaptive framework to ensure safety in such complex scenarios. Existing approaches often struggle to provide reliable safety mechanisms in dynamic and learn multi-task behaviors from demonstrations in signal-free intersections. This study proposes a safety-critical planning method that integrates Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions (DHOCBF) with a diffusion-based model, called Dynamic Safety-Critical Diffuser (DSC-Diffuser), offering a robust solution for adaptive, safe, and multi-task driving in signal-free intersections. Our approach incorporates a goal-oriented, task-guided diffusion model, enabling the model to learn multiple driving tasks simultaneously from real-world data. To further ensure driving safety in dynamic environments, the proposed DHOCBF framework dynamically adjusts to account for the movements of surrounding vehicles, offering enhanced adaptability compared to traditional control barrier functions. Validity evaluations of DHOCBF, conducted through numerical simulations, demonstrate its robustness in adapting to variations in obstacle velocities, sizes, uncertainties, and locations, effectively maintaining driving safety across a wide range of complex and uncertain scenarios. Performance evaluations across various scenes confirm that DSC-Diffuser provides realistic, stable, and generalizable policies, equipping it with the flexibility to adapt to diverse driving tasks.</description>

      <title>Prognostic Framework for Robotic Manipulators Operating Under Dynamic Task Severities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic manipulators are critical in many applications but are known to degrade over time. This degradation is influenced by the nature of the tasks performed by the robot. Tasks with higher severity, such as handling heavy payloads, can accelerate the degradation process. One way this degradation is reflected is in the position accuracy of the robot's end-effector. In this paper, we present a prognostic modeling framework that predicts a robotic manipulator's Remaining Useful Life (RUL) while accounting for the effects of task severity. Our framework represents the robot's position accuracy as a Brownian motion process with a random drift parameter that is influenced by task severity. The dynamic nature of task severity is modeled using a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). To evaluate RUL, we discuss two approaches -- (1) a novel closed-form expression for Remaining Lifetime Distribution (RLD), and (2) Monte Carlo simulations, commonly used in prognostics literature. Theoretical results establish the equivalence between these RUL computation approaches. We validate our framework through experiments using two distinct physics-based simulators for planar and spatial robot fleets. Our findings show that robots in both fleets experience shorter RUL when handling a higher proportion of high-severity tasks.</description>

      <title>Context-Based Echo State Networks with Prediction Confidence for Human-Robot Shared Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight learning from demonstration (LfD) model based on reservoir computing that can learn and generate multiple movement trajectories with prediction intervals, which we call as Context-based Echo State Network with prediction confidence (CESN+). CESN+ can generate movement trajectories that may go beyond the initial LfD training based on a desired set of conditions while providing confidence on its generated output. To assess the abilities of CESN+, we first evaluate its performance against Conditional Neural Movement Primitives (CNMP), a comparable framework that uses a conditional neural process to generate movement primitives. Our findings indicate that CESN+ not only outperforms CNMP but is also faster to train and demonstrates impressive performance in generating trajectories for extrapolation cases. In human-robot shared control applications, the confidence of the machine generated trajectory is a key indicator of how to arbitrate control sharing. To show the usability of the CESN+ for human-robot adaptive shared control, we have designed a proof-of-concept human-robot shared control task and tested its efficacy in adapting the sharing weight between the human and the robot by comparing it to a fixed-weight control scheme. The simulation experiments show that with CESN+ based adaptive sharing the total human load in shared control can be significantly reduced. Overall, the developed CESN+ model is a strong lightweight LfD system with desirable properties such fast training and ability to extrapolate to the new task parameters while producing robust prediction intervals for its output.</description>

      <title>CAT-ORA: Collision-Aware Time-Optimal Formation Reshaping for Efficient Robot Coordination in 3D Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an algorithm designed to address the problem of time-optimal formation reshaping in three-dimensional environments while preventing collisions between agents. The utility of the proposed approach is particularly evident in mobile robotics, where agents benefit from being organized and navigated in formation for a variety of real-world applications requiring frequent alterations in formation shape for efficient navigation or task completion. Given the constrained operational time inherent to battery-powered mobile robots, the time needed to complete the formation reshaping process is crucial for their efficient operation, especially in case of multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed Collision-Aware Time-Optimal formation Reshaping Algorithm (CAT-ORA) builds upon the Hungarian algorithm for the solution of the robot-to-goal assignment implementing the inter-agent collision avoidance through direct constraints on mutually exclusive robot-goal pairs combined with a trajectory generation approach minimizing the duration of the reshaping process. Theoretical validations confirm the optimality of CAT-ORA, with its efficacy further showcased through simulations, and a real-world outdoor experiment involving 19 UAVs. Thorough numerical analysis shows the potential of CAT-ORA to decrease the time required to perform complex formation reshaping tasks by up to 49%, and 12% on average compared to commonly used methods in randomly generated scenarios.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Sampling for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing efficient algorithms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is fundamentally challenging due to the fact that the size of the joint state and action spaces are exponentially large in the number of agents. These difficulties are exacerbated when balancing sequential global decision-making with local agent interactions. In this work, we propose a new algorithm \texttt{SUBSAMPLE-MFQ} (\textbf{Subsample}-\textbf{M}ean-\textbf{F}ield-\textbf{Q}-learning) and a decentralized randomized policy for a system with $n$ agents. For $k\leq n$, our algorithm system learns a policy for the system in time polynomial in $k$. We show that this learned policy converges to the optimal policy in the order of $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$ as the number of subsampled agents $k$ increases. We validate our method empirically on Gaussian squeeze and global exploration settings.</description>

      <title>Remote Estimation Games with Random Walk Processes: Stackelberg Equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote estimation is a crucial element of real time monitoring of a stochastic process. While most of the existing works have concentrated on obtaining optimal sampling strategies, motivated by malicious attacks on cyber-physical systems, we model sensing under surveillance as a game between an attacker and a defender. This introduces strategic elements to conventional remote estimation problems. Additionally, inspired by increasing detection capabilities, we model an element of information leakage for each player. Parameterizing the game in terms of uncertainty on each side, information leakage, and cost of sampling, we consider the Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE) concept where one of the players acts as the leader and the other one as the follower. By focusing our attention on stationary probabilistic sampling policies, we characterize the SE of this game and provide simulations to show the efficacy of our results.</description>

      <title>Non-Terrestrial Networking for 6G: Evolution, Opportunities, and Future Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From 5G onwards, Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) have emerged as a key component of future network architectures. Leveraging Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, NTNs are capable of building a space Internet and present a paradigm shift in delivering mobile services to even the most remote regions on Earth. However, the extensive coverage and rapid movement of LEO satellites pose unique challenges for NTN networking, including user equipment (UE) access and inter-satellite delivery, which directly impact the quality of service (QoS) and data transmission continuity. This paper offers an in-depth review of advanced NTN management technologies in the context of 6G evolution, focusing on radio resource management, mobility management, and dynamic network slicing. Building on this foundation and considering the latest trends in NTN development, we then present some innovative perspectives to emerging challenges in satellite beamforming, handover mechanisms, and inter-satellite transmissions. Lastly, we identify open research issues and propose future directions aimed at advancing satellite Internet deployment and enhancing NTN performance.</description>

      <title>Inferring Short-Sightedness in Dynamic Noncooperative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic game theory is an increasingly popular tool for modeling multi-agent, e.g. human-robot, interactions. Game-theoretic models presume that each agent wishes to minimize a private cost function that depends on others' actions. These games typically evolve over a fixed time horizon, which specifies the degree to which all agents care about the distant future. In practical settings, however, decision-makers may vary in their degree of short-sightedness. We conjecture that quantifying and estimating each agent's short-sightedness from online data will enable safer and more efficient interactions with other agents. To this end, we frame this inference problem as an inverse dynamic game. We consider a specific parametrization of each agent's objective function that smoothly interpolates myopic and farsighted planning. Games of this form are readily transformed into parametric mixed complementarity problems; we exploit the directional differentiability of solutions to these problems with respect to their hidden parameters in order to solve for agents' short-sightedness. We conduct several experiments simulating human behavior at a real-world crosswalk. The results of these experiments clearly demonstrate that by explicitly inferring agents' short-sightedness, we can recover more accurate game-theoretic models, which ultimately allow us to make better predictions of agents' behavior. Specifically, our results show up to a 30% more accurate prediction of myopic behavior compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Traffic Element-Based Streetlight Control Using Neighbor Discovery Algorithm Based on IoT Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent streetlight systems divide the streetlight network into multiple sectors, activating only the streetlights in the corresponding sectors when traffic elements pass by, rather than all streetlights, effectively reducing energy waste. This strategy requires streetlights to understand their neighbor relationships to illuminate only the streetlights in their respective sectors. However, manually configuring the neighbor relationships for a large number of streetlights in complex large-scale road streetlight networks is cumbersome and prone to errors. Due to the crisscrossing nature of roads, it is also difficult to determine the neighbor relationships using GPS or communication positioning. In response to these issues, this article proposes a systematic approach to model the streetlight network as a social network and construct a neighbor relationship probabilistic graph using IoT event records of streetlights detecting traffic elements. Based on this, a multi-objective genetic algorithm based probabilistic graph clustering method is designed to discover the neighbor relationships of streetlights. Considering the characteristic that pedestrians and vehicles usually move at a constant speed on a section of a road, speed consistency is introduced as an optimization objective, which, together with traditional similarity measures, forms a multi-objective function, enhancing the accuracy of neighbor relationship discovery. Extensive experiments on simulation datasets were conducted, comparing the proposed algorithm with other probabilistic graph clustering algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can more accurately identify the neighbor relationships of streetlights compared to other algorithms, effectively achieving adaptive streetlight control for traffic elements.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Approach for Identification and Compensation of Nonlinear Distortions in Parametric Array Loudspeakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compared to traditional electrodynamic loudspeakers, the parametric array loudspeaker (PAL) offers exceptional directivity for audio applications but suffers from significant nonlinear distortions due to its inherent intricate demodulation process. The Volterra filter-based approaches have been widely used to reduce these distortions, but the effectiveness is limited by its inverse filter's capability. Specifically, its pth-order inverse filter can only compensate for nonlinearities up to the pth order, while the higher-order nonlinearities it introduces continue to generate lower-order harmonics. In contrast, this paper introduces the modern deep learning methods for the first time to address nonlinear identification and compensation for PAL systems. Specifically, a feedforward variant of the WaveNet neural network, recognized for its success in audio nonlinear system modeling, is utilized to identify and compensate for distortions in a double sideband amplitude modulation-based PAL system. Experimental measurements from 250 Hz to 8 kHz demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly reduces both total harmonic distortion and intermodulation distortion of audio sound generated by PALs, achieving average reductions to 4.55% and 2.47%, respectively. This performance is notably superior to results obtained using the current state-of-the-art Volterra filter-based methods. Our work opens new possibilities for improving the sound reproduction performance of PALs.</description>

      <title>On the Surprising Effectiveness of Spectrum Clipping in Learning Stable Linear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When learning stable linear dynamical systems from data, three important properties are desirable: i) predictive accuracy, ii) provable stability, and iii) computational efficiency. Unconstrained minimization of reconstruction errors leads to high accuracy and efficiency but cannot guarantee stability. Existing methods to remedy this focus on enforcing stability while also ensuring accuracy, but do so only at the cost of increased computation. In this work, we investigate if a straightforward approach can \textit{simultaneously} offer all three desiderata of learning stable linear systems. Specifically, we consider a post-hoc approach that manipulates the spectrum of the learned system matrix after it is learned in an unconstrained fashion. We call this approach \textit{spectrum clipping} (SC) as it involves eigen decomposition and subsequent reconstruction of the system matrix after clipping all of its eigenvalues that are larger than one to one (without altering the eigenvectors). Through detailed experiments involving two different applications and publicly available benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that this simple technique can simultaneously learn highly accurate linear systems that are provably stable. Notably, we demonstrate that SC can achieve similar or better performance than strong baselines while being \textit{orders-of-magnitude} faster. We also show that SC can be readily combined with Koopman operators to learn stable nonlinear dynamics, such as those underlying complex dexterous manipulation skills involving multi-fingered robotic hands.

      <title>Confinement Specific Design of SOI Rib Waveguides with Submicron Dimensions and Single Mode Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full-vectorial finite difference method with perfectly matched layers boundaries is used to identify the single mode operation region of submicron rib waveguides fabricated using sili-con-on-insulator material system. Achieving high mode power confinement factors is emphasized while maintaining the single mode operation. As opposed to the case of large cross-section rib waveguides, theoretical single mode conditions have been demonstrated to hold for sub-micron waveguides with accuracy approaching 100%. Both, the deeply and the shallowly etched rib waveguides have been considered and the single mode condition for entire sub-micrometer range is presented while adhering to design specific mode confinement requirements.</description>

Abstract: A theorem is proved to verify incremental stability of a feedback system via a homotopy from a known incrementally stable system. A first corollary of that result is that incremental stability may be verified by separation of Scaled Relative Graphs, correcting two assumptions in [1, Theorem 2]. A second corollary provides an incremental version of the classical IQC stability theorem.</description>

      <title>Kernel-Based Optimal Control: An Infinitesimal Generator Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for optimal control of nonlinear stochastic systems using infinitesimal generator learning within infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our learning framework leverages data samples of system dynamics and stage cost functions, with only control penalties and constraints provided. The proposed method directly learns the diffusion operator of a controlled Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation in an infinite-dimensional hypothesis space. This operator models the continuous-time evolution of the probability measure of the control system's state. We demonstrate that this approach seamlessly integrates with modern convex operator-theoretic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman recursions, enabling a data-driven solution to the optimal control problem. Furthermore, our statistical learning framework includes nonparametric estimators for uncontrolled forward infinitesimal generators as a special case. Numerical experiments, ranging from synthetic differential equations to simulated robotic systems, showcase the advantages of our approach compared to both modern data-driven and classical nonlinear programming methods for optimal control.</description>

      <title>STLGame: Signal Temporal Logic Games in Adversarial Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how to synthesize a robust and safe policy for autonomous systems under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks in adversarial settings against unknown dynamic agents. To ensure the worst-case STL satisfaction, we propose STLGame, a framework that models the multi-agent system as a two-player zero-sum game, where the ego agents try to maximize the STL satisfaction and other agents minimize it. STLGame aims to find a Nash equilibrium policy profile, which is the best case in terms of robustness against unseen opponent policies, by using the fictitious self-play (FSP) framework. FSP iteratively converges to a Nash profile, even in games set in continuous state-action spaces. We propose a gradient-based method with differentiable STL formulas, which is crucial in continuous settings to approximate the best responses at each iteration of FSP. We show this key aspect experimentally by comparing with reinforcement learning-based methods to find the best response. Experiments on two standard dynamical system benchmarks, Ackermann steering vehicles and autonomous drones, demonstrate that our converged policy is almost unexploitable and robust to various unseen opponents' policies. All code and additional experimental results can be found on our project website: https://sites.google.com/view/stlgame</description>

      <title>A slot-based energy storage decision-making approach for optimal Off-Grid telecommunication operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a slot-based energy storage approach for decision-making in the context of an Off-Grid telecommunication operator. We consider network systems powered by solar panels, where harvest energy is stored in a battery that can also be sold when fully charged. To reflect real-world conditions, we account for non-stationary energy arrivals and service demands that depend on the time of day, as well as the failure states of PV panel. The network operator we model faces two conflicting objectives: maintaining the operation of its infrastructure and selling (or supplying to other networks) surplus energy from fully charged batteries. To address these challenges, we developed a slot-based Markov Decision Process (MDP) model that incorporates positive rewards for energy sales, as well as penalties for energy loss and battery depletion. This slot-based MDP follows a specific structure we have previously proven to be efficient in terms of computational performance and accuracy. From this model, we derive the optimal policy that balances these conflicting objectives and maximizes the average reward function. Additionally, we present results comparing different cities and months, which the operator can consider when deploying its infrastructure to maximize rewards based on location-specific energy availability and seasonal variations.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a new real-time intelligent optimization algorithm to minimize the voltage harmonics of a multilevel inverter. Hybrid Genetic algorithm /Particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed in a real-time simulation to identify the best fire angels of the multilevel inverter to eliminate any destructive effect, such as dc voltage variations and changes in line and dc-link resistors. The dual objective function of harmonic minimization and voltage regulation is considered in this real-time simulation. This approach can be applied to any multilevel inverter with various numbers of levels. The validity of the proposed algorithm is proven by real-time simulation of seven and an eleven-level inverter.</description>

Abstract: We derive a sufficient condition for $k$-contraction in a generalized Lurie system~(GLS), that is, the feedback connection of a nonlinear dynamical system and a memoryless nonlinear function. For $k=1$, this reduces to a sufficient condition for standard contraction. For $k=2$, this condition implies that every bounded solution of the GLS converges to an equilibrium, which is not necessarily unique. We demonstrate the theoretical results by analyzing $k$-contraction in a biochemical control circuit with nonlinear dissipation terms.</description>

      <title>Global and Local Error-Tolerant Decentralized State Estimation under Partially Ordered Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate decentralized state estimation for a discrete event system in a setting where the information received at a coordinator may be corrupted or tampered by a malicious attacker. Specifically, a system is observed by a set of (local) observation sites (OSs) which occasionally send their recorded sequences of observations to the coordinator that is in charge of estimating the system state. The malfunctions and attacks, referred to as errors in this paper, include symbol deletions, insertions and replacements, each of which bears a positive cost. Two types of errors, global errors and local errors, are proposed to describe the impact of errors on decentralized information processing. Global errors occur when all OSs record the same error, while local errors occur when different OSs record different errors. Distinguishing these types of errors is important for a proper design of decentralized information processing (so as to be more resilient and better equipped to handle attacks and failures). For each type of error, we propose two methods to efficiently perform state estimation: one based on appropriately modifying the original system and the other based on inferring the matching behavior of the original system. For each method, we adopt an estimation-by-release methodology to design an algorithm for constructing a corresponding synchronizer for state estimation.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the design of algorithms based on systems of interacting particles to represent, approximate, and learn the optimal control law for reinforcement learning (RL). The primary contribution is that convergence rates are greatly accelerated by the interactions between particles. Theory focuses on the linear quadratic stochastic optimal control problem for which a complete and novel theory is presented. Apart from the new algorithm, sample complexity bounds are obtained, and it is shown that the mean square error scales as $1/N$ where $N$ is the number of particles. The theoretical results and algorithms are illustrated with numerical experiments and comparisons with other recent approaches, where the faster convergence of the proposed algorithm is numerically demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Mode Decomposition for Finite Discrete Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, an orthogonal mode decomposition method is proposed to decompose ffnite length real signals on both the real and imaginary axes of the complex plane. The interpolation function space of ffnite length discrete signal is constructed, and the relationship between the dimensionality of the interpolation function space and its subspaces and the band width of the interpolation function is analyzed. It is proved that the intrinsic mode is actually the narrow band signal whose intrinsic instantaneous frequency is always positive (or always negative). Thus, the eigenmode decomposition problem is transformed into the orthogonal projection problem of interpolation function space to its low frequency subspace or narrow band subspace. Different from the existing mode decomposition methods, the orthogonal modal decomposition is a local time-frequency domain algorithm. Each operation extracts a speciffc mode. The global decomposition results obtained under the precise deffnition of eigenmodes have uniqueness and orthogonality. The computational complexity of the orthogonal mode decomposition method is also much smaller than that of the existing mode decomposition methods.</description>

Abstract: This paper considers a finite sample perspective on the problem of identifying an LTI system from a finite set of possible systems using trajectory data. To this end, we use the maximum likelihood estimator to identify the true system and provide an upper bound for its sample complexity. Crucially, the derived bound does not rely on a potentially restrictive stability assumption. Additionally, we leverage tools from information theory to provide a lower bound to the sample complexity that holds independently of the used estimator. The derived sample complexity bounds are analyzed analytically and numerically.</description>

      <title>Friedkin-Johnsen Model with Diminishing Competition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter studies the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model with diminishing competition, or stubbornness. The original FJ model assumes that each agent assigns a constant competition weight to its initial opinion. In contrast, we investigate the effect of diminishing competition on the convergence point and speed of the FJ dynamics. We prove that, if the competition is uniform across agents and vanishes asymptotically, the convergence point coincides with the nominal consensus reached with no competition. However, the diminishing competition slows down convergence according to its own rate of decay. We study this phenomenon analytically and provide upper and lower bounds on the convergence rate. Further, if competition is not uniform across agents, we show that the convergence point may not coincide with the nominal consensus point. Finally, we evaluate our analytical insights numerically.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Control Observer-Based Methods for State Estimation of Lithium-Ion Batteries in Practical Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reliability, lower computational complexity, and ease of implementation of control observers make them one of the most promising methods for the state estimation of Li-ion batteries (LIBs) in commercial applications. To pave their way, this study performs a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of four main categories of control observer-based methods in different practical scenarios considering estimation accuracy, computational time convergence speed, stability, and robustness against measurement uncertainties. Observers are designed using a second-order equivalent circuit model whose observability against different scenarios is rigorously investigated to verify the feasibility of the proposed analysis. Established techniques then are validated against driving datasets and their comparative usefulness is evaluated using an experimental setup. The analysis also evaluates the adaptability of different techniques to electric vehicle field data. The results indicate better accuracy, stability, robustness, and faster convergence for the PI and PID, while the estimations of the Luenberger observers find it hard to converge against highly dynamic loadfiles. Moreover, this study also discusses the sensitivity of observer-based techniques to battery ohmic polarization and voltage-related measurement uncertainties. The most remarkable contribution of the proposed study lies in providing guidance for researchers when choosing the control observers for online state estimation of LIBs.</description>

      <title>Fixed-relative-switch strategies for learning based event-triggered control of nonlinear multiagent systems</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates event-triggered control for consensus tracking in nonlinear semi-strict-feedback multi-agent systems (MASs) with unknown states and subject to disturbances. We begin by employing radial basis function neural networks combined with the backstepping method to approximate the unknown nonlinear dynamics of the MASs, which facilitates the development of state and disturbance observers for estimation. We then propose three adaptive event-triggered control strategies: fixed-threshold, relative-threshold, and switch-threshold, whose controllers and triggering conditions are defined acocrdingly. By applying Lyapunov stability theory, we rigorously prove that all follower agents' outputs consistently track the reference of their leader, and all error signals remain uniformly bounded. Moreover, our control strategies effectively mitigate the occurrence of Zeno behaviors. To validate our control framework, an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate its desirable performance in consensus tracking and triggering efficiency.</description>

      <title>OffRAMPS: An FPGA-based Intermediary for Analysis and Modification of Additive Manufacturing Control Systems</title>

Abstract: Cybersecurity threats in Additive Manufacturing (AM) are an increasing concern as AM adoption continues to grow. AM is now being used for parts in the aerospace, transportation, and medical domains. Threat vectors which allow for part compromise are particularly concerning, as any failure in these domains would have life-threatening consequences. A major challenge to investigation of AM part-compromises comes from the difficulty in evaluating and benchmarking both identified threat vectors as well as methods for detecting adversarial actions. In this work, we introduce a generalized platform for systematic analysis of attacks against and defenses for 3D printers. Our "OFFRAMPS" platform is based on the open-source 3D printer control board "RAMPS." OFFRAMPS allows analysis, recording, and modification of all control signals and I/O for a 3D printer. We show the efficacy of OFFRAMPS by presenting a series of case studies based on several Trojans, including ones identified in the literature, and show that OFFRAMPS can both emulate and detect these attacks, i.e., it can both change and detect arbitrary changes to the g-code print commands.</description>

      <title>Exploring the 6G Potentials: Immersive, Hyper Reliable, and Low-Latency Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11051</link>

Abstract: The transition towards the sixth-generation (6G) wireless telecommunications networks introduces significant challenges for researchers and industry stakeholders. The 6G technology aims to enhance existing usage scenarios through supporting innovative applications that require stringent key performance indicators (KPIs). In some critical use cases of 6G, multiple KPIs, including immersive throughput, with an envisioned peak data rate of $1$ Tbps, hyper-reliability, in the range of $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-7}$, and hyper low-latency, between $0.1$ and $1$ ms, must be achieved simultaneously to deliver the expected service experience. However, this is challenging due to the conflicting nature of these KPIs. This article proposes a new service class of 6G as immersive, hyper reliable, and low-latency communication (IHRLLC), and introduces a potential network architecture to achieve the associated KPIs. Specifically, enhanced technologies, such as ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (umMIMO)-aided terahertz (THz) communications, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), and non-terrestrial networks (NTN), are viewed as the key enablers for achieving immersive data rates and hyper reliability. Given the computational complexity involved in employing these technologies, we propose mathematical and computational enabling technologies, such as learn-to-optimize (L2O), generative-AI (GenAI), quantum computing, and network digital twin (NDT), to complement the proposed architecture and optimize the latency.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Large Language Model-empowered Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving (AD) research, propelling its development towards intelligence and efficiency. Currently, the development of AD technology follows two main technical paths: modularization and end-to-end. Modularization decompose the driving task into modules such as perception, prediction, planning, and control, and train them separately. Due to the inconsistency of training objectives between modules, the integrated effect suffers from bias. End-to-end attempts to address this issue by utilizing a single model that directly maps from sensor data to control signals. This path has limited learning capabilities in a comprehensive set of features and struggles to handle unpredictable long-tail events and complex urban traffic scenarios. In the face of challenges encountered in both paths, many researchers believe that large language models (LLMs) with powerful reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge understanding may be the solution, expecting LLMs to provide AD systems with deeper levels of understanding and decision-making capabilities. In light of the challenges faced by both paths, many researchers believe that LLMs, with their powerful reasoning abilities and extensive knowledge, could offer a solution. To understand if LLMs could enhance AD, this paper conducts a thorough analysis of the potential applications of LLMs in AD systems, including exploring their optimization strategies in both modular and end-to-end approaches, with a particular focus on how LLMs can tackle the problems and challenges present in current solutions. Furthermore, we discuss an important question: Can LLM-based artificial general intelligence (AGI) be a key to achieve high-level AD? We further analyze the potential limitations and challenges that LLMs may encounter in promoting the development of AD technology.</description>

      <title>DistRL: An Asynchronous Distributed Reinforcement Learning Framework for On-Device Control Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14803v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On-device control agents, especially on mobile devices, are responsible for operating mobile devices to fulfill users' requests, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions. Integrating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into these agents enhances their ability to understand and execute complex commands, thereby improving user experience. However, fine-tuning MLLMs for on-device control presents significant challenges due to limited data availability and inefficient online training processes. This paper introduces DistRL, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency of online RL fine-tuning for mobile device control agents. DistRL employs centralized training and decentralized data acquisition to ensure efficient fine-tuning in the context of dynamic online interactions. Additionally, the framework is backed by our tailor-made RL algorithm, which effectively balances exploration with the prioritized utilization of collected data to ensure stable and robust training. Our experiments show that, on average, DistRL delivers a 3X improvement in training efficiency and enables training data collection 2.4X faster than the leading synchronous multi-machine methods. Notably, after training, DistRL achieves a 20% relative improvement in success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods on general Android tasks from an open benchmark, significantly outperforming existing approaches while maintaining the same training time. These results validate DistRL as a scalable and efficient solution, offering substantial improvements in both training efficiency and agent performance for real-world, in-the-wild device control tasks.</description>

      <title>An exact column generation algorithm for load balancing in capacity sharing networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00555</link>

Abstract: Capacity sharing networks are typical heterogeneous communication networks widely applied in information and communications technology (ICT) field. In such networks, resources like bandwidth, spectrum, computation and storage are shared among various communication services. Meanwhile, the issue of network congestion is always a prominent challenge. To handle network congestion essentially needs to solve the load balancing of networks. In this paper, for capacity sharing networks, we formulate their load balancing problem as a maximum multi-commodity flow problem. For such a problem, always a large-scale linear programming, the column generation algorithm is a commonly used and crucial method to solve it. In each iteration, this algorithm involves solving a linear programming subproblem and determining whether to terminate or generate a new column for inclusion in the subproblem. This iterative procedure of solving and checking continues throughout the algorithm. Nevertheless, since the checking subproblem is NP-hard, its solution significantly impacts the overall efficiency of the algorithm. In this paper, we innovatively convert the checking subproblem into a single-constrained shortest path (SCSP) subproblem. By exactly solving the SCSP subproblem, we can obtain the optimal solution to the checking subproblem with same or less computing time. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves computational efficiency comparable to heuristic algorithms while outperforming other state-of-the-art algorithms by at least an order of magnitude.</description>
