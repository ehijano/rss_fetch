      <title>False memories to fake news: The evolution of the term "misinformation" in academic literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since 2016, the term "misinformation" has become associated with a scientific paradigm that studies, at its core, people making, reading, and sharing false statements, usually on social media, and often warning of the harm to society resulting from the sum of many such events. By tracking the term through the academic literature, with special focus on the years 2011--2023, we connect the post-2016 paradigm with a strand of research dating to the Satanic panic of the 1980s. We argue that post-2016 misinformation research owes more to this intellectual lineage than is generally acknowledged, and we discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this connection. We conclude by drawing parallels between the Satanic panic and 2026, and, similarly, between misinformation research then and now.</description>

      <title>Coalgebraic analysis of social systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The algebraic analysis of social systems, or algebraic social network analysis, refers to a collection of methods designed to extract information about the structure of a social system represented as a directed graph. Central among these are methods to determine the roles that exist within a given system, and the positions. The analysis of roles and positions is highly developed for social systems that involve only pairwise interactions among actors - however, in contemporary social network analysis it is increasingly common to use models that can take into account higher-order interactions as well. In this paper we take a category-theoretic approach to the question of how to lift role and positional analysis from graphs to hypergraphs, which can accommodate higher-order interactions. We use the framework of universal coalgebra - a 'theory of systems' with origins in computer science and logic - to formalize the main concepts of role and positional analysis and extend them to a large class of structures that includes both graphs and hypergraphs. As evidence for the validity of our definitions, we prove a very general functoriality theorem that specializes, in the case of graphs, to a folkloric observation about the compatibility of positional and role analysis.</description>

      <title>Supervised tax compliance and evasion from a spatial evolutionary game perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taxation constitutes a fundamental component of modern national economic systems, exerting profound impacts on both societal functioning and governmental operations. In this paper, we employ an interdependent network approach to model the coevolution between citizens and regulators within a taxation system that fundamentally constitutes a public goods game framework with complex interactive dynamics. In a game layer, citizens engage in public goods games, facing the social dilemma of tax compliance (cooperation) versus evasion (defection). Tax compliance supports the sustainability of public finances while tax evasion presents markedly stronger short-term incentives. In a regulatory layer, fair regulators punish tax evaders, while corrupt regulators keep silent due to bribes. Governmental regulatory interventions introduce critical institutional constraints that alter the traditional equilibrium of the game. Importantly, there exists a strategy update not only among citizens but also among regulators. Our results indicate that strengthening penalties can effectively curb tax evasion, and the influence of bribery on both tax compliance rates and the proportion of fair regulators is nonlinear. Additionally, increasing regulators' salaries and intensifying the crackdown on corrupt regulators can foster the emergence of fair regulators, thereby reducing tax evasion among citizens. The results offer practical policy implications, suggesting that balanced deterrence and institutional fairness are essential to sustaining compliance, and point to the need for future empirical validation and model extensions.</description>

      <title>Three AI-agents walk into a bar . . . . `Lord of the Flies' tribalism emerges among smart AI-Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-future infrastructure systems may be controlled by autonomous AI agents that repeatedly request access to limited resources such as energy, bandwidth, or computing power. We study a simplified version of this setting using a framework where N AI-agents independently decide at each round whether to request one unit from a system with fixed capacity C. An AI version of "Lord of the Flies" arises in which controlling tribes emerge with their own collective character and identity. The LLM agents do not reduce overload or improve resource use, and often perform worse than if they were flipping coins to make decisions. Three main tribal types emerge: Aggressive (27.3%), Conservative (24.7%), and Opportunistic (48.1%). The more capable AI-agents actually increase the rate of systemic failure. Overall, our findings show that smarter AI-agents can behave dumber as a result of forming tribes.</description>

      <title>DyGnROLE: Modeling Asymmetry in Dynamic Graphs with Node-Role-Oriented Latent Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world dynamic graphs are often directed, with source and destination nodes exhibiting asymmetrical behavioral patterns and temporal dynamics. However, existing dynamic graph architectures largely rely on shared parameters for processing source and destination nodes, with limited or no systematic role-aware modeling. We propose DyGnROLE (Dynamic Graph Node-Role-Oriented Latent Encoding), a transformer-based architecture that explicitly disentangles source and destination representations. By using separate embedding vocabularies and role-semantic positional encodings, the model captures the distinct structural and temporal contexts unique to each role. Critical to the effectiveness of these specialized embeddings in low-label regimes is a self-supervised pretraining objective we introduce: Temporal Contrastive Link Prediction (TCLP). The pretraining uses the full unlabeled interaction history to encode informative structural biases, enabling the model to learn role-specific representations without requiring annotated data. Evaluation on future edge classification demonstrates that DyGnROLE substantially outperforms a diverse set of state-of-the-art baselines, establishing role-aware modeling as an effective strategy for dynamic graph learning.</description>

      <title>Simple contagion drives population-scale platform migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media platforms mediate professional communication, political expression, and community formation, making the rare instances when users collectively abandon an incumbent platform particularly consequential. Strong network effects raise switching costs and strengthen incumbents' positions, making coordinated exit difficult. Here we link 276,431 scholars on Twitter/X to their respective new profiles among the universe of all 16.7 million Bluesky accounts, tracked from January 2023 to December 2024, using a scalable, high-precision cross-platform matching pipeline. Exploiting exogenous variation from Brazil's court-ordered suspension of Twitter/X and a dynamic matching design, we show that adoption is peer-driven, treatment effects are short-lived and dose-dependent, and contagion is simple, not complex. Three patterns characterize adoption and retention. Adoption concentrates among users deeply embedded in Twitter's social graph. Public political expression predicts migration, consistent with homophilous inflows into a largely left-of-center Bluesky information space. Early reconnection with prior contacts predicts longer tenure and engagement. Our findings provide the first population-scale causal evidence of peer influence in a social media platform migration by exploiting exogenous exposure variation in a natural experiment and using daily dynamic matching. Rather than the complex contagion mechanism often emphasized in the literature, contagion is predominantly simple. Our findings recast migration as a multi-homing strategy that insures against governance uncertainty and show that users who quickly reconnect with prior contacts remain active longer on Bluesky.</description>

      <title>Media Coverage of War Victims: Journalistic Biases in Reporting on Israel and Gaza</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: October 7, 2023 marked the start of a war against Gaza, one of the most devastating conflicts in modern history, which quickly produced a stark global attitudinal divide. To examine the role of media bias in shaping public understanding of this asymmetrical war, we analyzed more than 14,000 news articles published during its first year across three major Western outlets (The New York Times, BBC, CNN) and one non-Western English-language outlet (Al Jazeera English). Focusing on media narratives surrounding Israeli and Palestinian victims, we identify three systematic biases in Western coverage: (1) Identifiable Victim Reporting: Israeli victims were substantially more likely to be depicted as identifiable individuals, whereas Palestinian victims were predominantly represented as undifferentiated collectives. (2) Equalization Bias: Despite the profound asymmetry in casualties, displacement, and other forms of suffering, Western reporting repeatedly invoked the October 7 attacks to equalize Israeli and Palestinian victimhood, even in the absence of new Israeli-casualty events. (3) One-sided Doubt Casting: Journalists disproportionately used language that casts doubt on the credibility of casualty figures and the reliability of sources when reporting Palestinian (vs. Israeli) victim counts, selectively undermining trust in information about Palestinian suffering. Across all three phenomena, these patterns were either absent or greatly attenuated in Al Jazeera English. Taken together, our analysis uncovers a coherent set of systematic biases in high-profile Western media coverage of the Gaza war, with implications for how global audiences come to understand and morally evaluate the conflict.</description>

      <title>Human-AI Synergy Supports Collective Creative Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI is increasingly transforming creativity into a hybrid human-artificial process, but its impact on the quality and diversity of creative output remains unclear. We study collective creativity using a controlled word-guessing task that balances open-endedness with an objective measure of task performance. Participants attempt to infer a hidden target word, scored based on the semantic similarity of their guesses to the target, while also observing the best guess from previous players. We compare performance and outcome diversity across human-only, AI-only, and hybrid human-AI groups. Hybrid groups achieve the highest performance while preserving high diversity of guesses. Within hybrid groups, both humans and AI agents systematically adjust their strategies relative to single-agent conditions, suggesting higher-order interaction effects, whereby agents adapt to each other's presence. Although some performance benefits can be reproduced through collaboration between heterogeneous AI systems, human-AI collaboration remains superior, underscoring complementary roles in collective creativity.</description>
