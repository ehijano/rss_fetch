      <title>JWST COMPASS: NIRSpec/G395H Transmission Observations of TOI-776 c, a 2 Rearth M Dwarf Planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atmospheres of planets between the size of Earth and Neptune at short orbital periods have been under intense scrutiny. Of the ~dozen planets in this regime with atmospheres studied so far, a few appear to have prominent molecular features while others appear relatively void of detectable atmospheres. Further work is therefore needed to understand the atmospheres of these planets, starting with observing a larger sample. To this end, we present the 3-5 micron transmission spectrum of TOI-776 c, a warm (Teq ~420 K), ~2 Rearth, ~7 Mearth planet orbiting an M1V star, measured with JWST NIRSpec/G395H. By combining two visits, we measure a median transit precision of ~18 ppm and ~32 ppm in the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors, respectively. We compare the transmission spectrum to both non-physical and physical models, and find no strong evidence for molecular features. For cloud-top pressures larger than 10^-3 bar, we rule out atmospheric metallicities less than 180-240x solar (depending on the reduction and modeling technique), which corresponds to a mean molecular weight of ~6-8 g/mol. However, we find simple atmosphere mixture models (H2O+H2/He or CO2+H2/He) give more pessimistic constraints, and caution that mean molecular weight inferences are model dependent. We compare TOI-776 c to the similar planet TOI-270 d, and discuss possible options for further constraining TOI-776 c's atmospheric composition. Overall, we suggest these TOI-776 c observations may represent a combination of planetary and stellar parameters that fall just below the threshold of detectable features in small planet spectra; finding this boundary is one of the main goals of the COMPASS program.</description>

      <title>Revised Mass and Orbit of $\varepsilon$ Eridani b: A 1 Jupiter-Mass Planet on a Near-Circular Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mature Jovian planet $\varepsilon$ Eridani b orbits one of the closest sun-like stars at a moderate separation of 3.5 AU, presenting one of the best opportunities to image a true analog to a solar system planet. We perform a thorough joint reanalysis and cross-validation of all available archival radial velocity and astrometry data, combining data from eight radial velocity instruments and four astrometric sources (Hipparcos, Hubble FGS, Gaia DR2, and Gaia DR3). We incorporate methodological advances that impact our findings including a principled treatment of correlation between Gaia DR2 and DR3 velocity and corrections for the changing light-travel time to this high proper motion system. We revise the planet's mass upward to $0.98 \pm 0.09 \, \mathrm{M_{jup}}$ and find that its orbit is nearly circular and close to coplanar with the outer debris disk. We further present one of the first models of an exoplanet orbit exclusively from absolute astrometry and independently confirm the planet's orbital period. We make specific predictions for the planet's location at key imaging epochs from past and future observing campaigns. We discuss and resolve tensions between previous works regarding the eccentricity, inclination, and mass. Our results further support that $\varepsilon$ Eridani b is one of the closest analogs to a Solar System planet yet detected around a nearby star.</description>

      <title>Internal Heat and Energy Imbalance of Uranus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With its extreme axial tilt, radiant energy budget and internal heat of Uranus remain among the most intriguing mysteries of our Solar System. Here, we present the global radiant energy budget spanning a complete orbital period, revealing significant seasonal variations driven primarily by the highly variable solar flux. Despite these fluctuations, emitted thermal power consistently exceeds absorbed solar power, indicating a net energy loss and ongoing global cooling. Based on the seasonal variations of radiant energy budget, we determine a statistically significant internal heat flux. This finding resolves a long-standing debate over whether Uranus possesses internal heat. We also examine the energy budget of the weather layer by combining the internal heat with the radiant energies, revealing significant energy imbalances at both global and hemispheric scales. These global and hemispheric imbalances should be considered in theoretical and numerical models. The Uranus flagship mission, as recommended by the recent survey, will provide crucial observations to address more unresolved questions and advance our understanding of this enigmatic ice giant.</description>

      <title>Multibeam SETI Observations toward Nearby M dwarfs with FAST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) targeted searches aim to observe specific areas and objects to find possible technosignatures. Many SETI researches have focused on nearby stars and their planets in recent years. In this paper, we report a targeted SETI observations using the most sensitive L-band Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) toward three nearby M dwarfs, all of which have been discovered exoplanet candidates. The minimum equivalent isotropic radiant power of the lower limit from the three sources we can detect is $6.19 \times 10^{8}$ W, which is well within the reach of current human technology. Applying the multibeam coincidence matching (MBCM) blind search mode, we search for narrowband drifting signals across 1.05-1.45 GHz in each of the two orthogonal linear polarization directions. An unusual signal at 1312.50 MHz detected from the observation toward AD Leo originally piqued our interest. However, we finally eliminate the possibility of an extraterrestrial origin based on much evidence, such as the polarization, frequency, and beam coverage characteristics.</description>

      <title>Probing the Origins I: Generalised Additive Model inference of birth radii for Milky Way stars in the solar vicinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a Generalised Additive Model (GAM) to address the limitations inherent in radial metallicity gradients predicted by chemical evolution models, thereby facilitating the estimation of birth radii for the thin disc stars in our sample based on their ages and chemical composition. We then juxtapose the birth radius predictions derived from the GAM with the calculated guiding radii, among other dynamic parameters. Metal-rich stars, formed in the inner regions of the Milky Way, seem to be predominantly churned outward. Their metal-poor counterparts, formed in the outer thin disc, exhibit the opposite behaviour. The proportion of blurred/undisturbed stars generally increases with decreasing metallicity when compared to their churned counterparts. Approximately $3/4$ of the sample has been affected by (inward or outward) churning, while the remaining $\sim 1/4$ has either been influenced by blurring or remained undisturbed. These percentages vary considerably across different metallicity-stratified groups. Also, a large age gap is identified between churned and blurred/undisturbed sub-samples within each HC-based group, being the outward-churned stars systematically the oldest, inward-churned stars the youngest, and blurred/undisturbed stars in intermediate ages. We also detect significant differences in angular momenta in the $z$ component, for stars that have either churned inward or outward, when compared to their blurred/undisturbed counterparts. Additionally, we observe the potential effects of the pericentric passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy in our most metal-poor subset of stars, formed in the outer disc. Finally, we estimate that the Sun's most probable birth radius is $7.08 \pm 0.24$ kpc, with a 3$\sigma$ range spanning from 6.46 to 7.81 kpc, in agreement with previous studies.</description>

      <title>Simple molecules and complex chemistry in a protoplanetary disk: A JWST investigation of the highly inclined disk d216-0939</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the number of detected molecules, particularly complex organic molecules, in the solid-state in astrophysical environments is still rather limited, laboratory experiments and astrochemical models predict many potential candidates. Detection of molecules in protoplanetary disks provides a bridge between the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium and the chemistry of planets and their atmospheres. The excellent spectral sensitivity, broad wavelength coverage and high spatial resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allows for making progress in exploring chemical compositions of various astrophysical environments including planet-forming disks. They are a prerequisite for probing the disk content by means of sensitive absorption studies. In this paper, we present initial results of the JWST Cycle 1 GO program 1741 on d216-0939, a highly inclined TTauri disk located in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula Cluster. We utilise the NIRSpec and MIRI integral field unit spectrographs to cover its spectrum from 1.7 to 28~$\mu$m. In the d216-0939 disk, we give assignments of the composition of silicate grains. We unambiguously detect solid-state features of H$_2$O, CO$_2$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, CO, OCN$^-$, and tentatively OCS; species that had been detected recently also in other circumstellar disks. For the first time in disks, we provide unique detections of ices carrying NH$_4^+$ and the complex organic molecule ammonium carbamate (NH$_4^+$NH$_2$COO$^-$). The latter detections speak for a very efficient NH$_3$ chemistry in the disk. We also show the very important role of scattering in the analysis of observational spectra of highly inclined disks.</description>

      <title>Orbital inclination of astrometric binaries and the dearth of face-on orbits in Gaia DR3 solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orbital solutions for astrometric (unresolved) binary stars provided in the Gaia mission Data Release 3 reveal an obvious deficit of face-on orbits with line-of-sight inclinations close to 0 or $\pi$. This is shown to be an intrinsic mathematical feature of the orbit estimation technique involving the intermediate Thiele-Innes parameters, which are transformed to the Campbell geometric parameters. A direct condition equation defining the inclination angle via the Thiele-Innes values independently of the other orbital elements is used to investigate the origin of this near-degeneracy for face-on orbits. The emerging bias and correlation of inclination and semimajor axis are illustrated using Monte Carlo simulations for two specific template configurations representing face-on and edge-on orbits. The results have significant impact on the interpretation and follow-up confirmation of Gaia-detected binary systems, including candidate exoplanets and brown dwarf companions.</description>

      <title>Ariel stellar characterisation III. Fast rotators and new FGK stars in the Ariel Mission Candidate Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next mission dedicated to the study of planetary atmospheres is the Ariel space mission, planned for launch in 2029, which will observe a variety of planetary systems belonging to different classes around stars with spectral types from M to A. To optimise the scientific outcome of the mission, such stars need to be homogeneously characterised beforehand. In this work, we focus on a methodology based on spectral synthesis for the characterisation of FGK-type stars from the Ariel Tier 1 Mission Candidate Sample (MCS) which exhibit fast rotation. In addition, we analyse slow-rotating FGK-type stars, with either new observations or archival spectra available, consistently as in our previous work using the equivalent width (EW) analysis. To ensure consistency between our methods, we re-analysed a sample of FGK-type stars with the spectral synthesis method and compared it to our previous work. The results of our analysis show excellent agreement with the previous set of derived parameters. We also computed their orbital parameters establishing whether they belong to the Galactic thin or thick discs. With the current set of stellar parameters, we almost double the analysed hosts in the Ariel MCS to 353 stars in total. Using our homogeneous set of stellar parameters, we studied the correlations between stellar and planetary properties for the Ariel MCS analysed so far. We confirmed a close relationship between stellar mass (up to 1.8 solar masses) and giant planet radius, with more inflated planets at lower metallicity. We confirm that giant planets are more frequent around more metal-rich stars that belong to the thin disc, while lower-mass planets are also found in more metal-poor environments, and are more frequent than giant planets in the thick disc as also seen in other works in the literature.</description>

      <title>ALMA reveals thermal and non-thermal desorption of methanol ice in the HD 100546 protoplanetary disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Methanol (CH$_3$OH) and formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) are chemically coupled organic molecules proposed to act as an intermediate step between simple molecules and more complex prebiotic compounds. Their abundance distributions across disks regulate the prebiotic potential of material at different disk radii. We present observations of multiple methanol and formaldehyde transitions toward the Herbig Ae disk HD 100546 obtained with ALMA, building upon the previous serendipitous detection of methanol in this source. We find that methanol has a higher rotational temperature ($T_\mathrm{rot}$) than formaldehyde towards both the centrally concentrated emission component in the inner disk ($0-110$ au) and a radially separate dust ring farther out in the disk ($180-260$ au). $T_\mathrm{rot}$ decreases for methanol and formaldehyde from the inner ($152^{+35}_{-27}$ K and $76^{+9}_{-8}$ K) to the outer disk ($52^{+8}_{-6}$ K and $31^{+2}_{-2}$ K), suggesting that we are tracing two different chemical environments. $T_\mathrm{rot}$ for both species in the inner disk is consistent with thermal desorption as the origin, while the outer disk reservoir is driven by non-thermal desorption. The CH$_3$OH/H$_2$CO column density ratio decreases from $14.6^{+5.2}_{-4.6}$ in the inner disk to $1.3^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ in the outer disk, consistent with modelling predictions. The CH$_3$OH/H$_2$CO column density ratio for the inner disk is consistent with the median value in the range of column density ratios compiled from Solar System comets which would have formed at a similar distance. This supports the notion that interstellar ice is inherited and preserved by protoplanetary disks around solar-mass and intermediate-mass stars as we are seeing 'fresh' ice sublimation, as well as providing more evidence for the presence of prebiotic precursor molecules in planet-forming regions.</description>

      <title>HCN and C2H2 in the atmosphere of a T8.5+T9 brown dwarf binary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: T-type brown dwarfs present an opportunity to explore atmospheres teeming with molecules such as H2O, CH4 and NH3, which exhibit a wealth of absorption features in the mid-infrared. With JWST, we can finally explore this chemistry in detail, including for the coldest brown dwarfs that were not yet discovered in the Spitzer era. This allows precise derivations of the molecular abundances, which in turn informs our understanding of vertical transport in these atmospheres and can provide clues about the formation of cold brown dwarfs and exoplanets. This study presents the first JWST/MRS mid-IR spectrum (R ~ 1500-3000) of a T-dwarf: the T8.5+T9 brown dwarf binary WISE J045853.90+643451.9. We fit the spectrum using a parameterized P-T profile and free molecular abundances (i.e., a retrieval analysis), treating the binary as unresolved. We find a good fit with a cloud-free atmosphere and identify H2O, CH4 and NH3 features. Moreover, we make the first detections of HCN and C2H2 (at 13.4$\sigma$ and 9.5$\sigma$ respectively) in any brown dwarf atmosphere. The detection of HCN suggests intense vertical mixing ($K_{zz}\sim10^{11}$cm$^2$s$^{-1}$), challenging previous literature derivations of $K_{zz}$ values for T-type brown dwarfs. Even more surprising is the C2H2 detection, which cannot be explained with existing atmospheric models for isolated objects. This result challenges model assumptions about vertical mixing, and/or our understanding of the C2H2 chemical network, or might hint towards a more complex atmospheric processes such as magnetic fields driving aurorae, or lightning driving ionization. These findings open a new frontier in studying carbon chemistry within brown dwarf atmospheres.</description>

      <title>TOI-6324b: An Earth-Mass Ultra-Short-Period Planet Transiting a Nearby M Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16087v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the confirmation of TOI-6324 b, an Earth-sized (1.059 $\pm$ 0.041 R$_\oplus$) ultra-short-period (USP) planet orbiting a nearby ($\sim$20 pc) M dwarf. Using the newly commissioned Keck Planet Finder (KPF) spectrograph, we have measured the mass of TOI-6324 b 1.17 $\pm$ 0.22 M$_\oplus$. Because of its extremely short orbit of just $\sim$6.7 hours, TOI-6324 b is intensely irradiated by its M dwarf host, and is expected to be stripped of any thick, H/He envelope. We were able to constrain its interior composition and found an iron core mass fraction (CMF = 27$\pm$37%) consistent with that of Earth ($\sim$33%) and other confirmed USPs. TOI-6324 b is the closest to Earth-sized USP confirmed to date. TOI-6324 b is a promising target for JWST phase curve and secondary eclipse observations (Emission Spectroscopy Metric = 25) which may reveal its surface mineralogy, day-night temperature contrast, and possible tidal deformation. From 7 sectors of TESS data, we report a tentative detection of the optical phase curve variation with an amplitude of 42$\pm$28 ppm.</description>

      <title>Origin and Evolution of Angular Momentum of Class II Disks</title>

Abstract: Context: While class II pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars have already accreted most of their mass, the continued inflow of fresh material via Bondi-Hoyle accretion acts as an additional mass reservoir for their circumstellar disks. This may explain the observed accretion rates of PMS stars, as well as observational inconsistencies in the mass and angular momentum balance of their disks. Aims: Using a new simulation that reproduces the stellar initial mass function (IMF), we want to quantify the role of Bondi-Hoyle accretion in the formation of class II disks, as well as address the prospect of its observational detection with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Methods: We studied the mass and angular momentum of the accreting gas using passively advected tracer particles in the simulation, and we carried out radiative transfer calculations of near-infrared scattering to generate synthetic JWST observations of Bondi-Hoyle trails of PMS stars. Results: Gas accreting on class II PMS stars approximately 1 Myr after their formation has enough mass and angular momentum to strongly affect the evolution of the preexisting disks. The accreted angular momentum is large enough to also explain the observed size of class II disks. The orientation of the angular momentum vector can differ significantly from that of the previously accreted gas, which may result in a significant disk warping or misalignment. We also predict that JWST observations of class II stars will be able to detect Bondi-Hoyle trails with a 80%-100% success rate with only a 2 min exposure time, depending on the filter, if stars with both an accretion rate \dot{M} &gt; 5e-10 Msol/yr and a luminosity L &gt; 0.5 Lsol are selected.</description>
