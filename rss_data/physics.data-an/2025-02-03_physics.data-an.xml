      <title>Complex network approaches to nonlinear time series analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade, there has been a growing body of literature addressing the utilization of complex network methods for the characterization of dynamical systems based on time series. While both nonlinear time series analysis and complex network theory are widely considered to be established fields of complex systems sciences with strong links to nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics, the thorough combination of both approaches has become an active field of nonlinear time series analysis, which has allowed addressing fundamental questions regarding the structural organization of nonlinear dynamics as well as the successful treatment of a variety of applications from a broad range of disciplines. In this report, we provide an in-depth review of existing approaches of time series networks, covering their methodological foundations, interpretation and practical considerations with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the state-of-the-art of nonlinear time series analysis and the theory of complex networks, we focus on three main network approaches, namely, phase space based recurrence networks, visibility graphs and Markov chain based transition networks, all of which have made their way from abstract concepts to widely used methodologies. These three concepts, as well as several variants thereof will be discussed in great detail regarding their specific properties, potentials and limitations. More importantly, we emphasize which fundamental new insights complex network approaches bring into the field of nonlinear time series analysis. In addition, we summarize examples from the wide range of recent applications of these methods, covering rather diverse fields like climatology, fluid dynamics, neurophysiology, engineering and economics, and demonstrating the great potentials of time series networks for tackling real-world contemporary scientific problems.</description>

      <title>The Atlas for the Aspiring Network Scientist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.00863v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network science is the field dedicated to the investigation and analysis of complex systems via their representations as networks. We normally model such networks as graphs: sets of nodes connected by sets of edges and a number of node and edge attributes. This deceptively simple object is the starting point of never-ending complexity, due to its ability to represent almost every facet of reality: chemical interactions, protein pathways inside cells, neural connections inside the brain, scientific collaborations, financial relations, citations in art history, just to name a few examples. If we hope to make sense of complex networks, we need to master a large analytic toolbox: graph and probability theory, linear algebra, statistical physics, machine learning, combinatorics, and more.
  This book aims at providing the first access to all these tools. It is intended as an "Atlas", because its interest is not in making you a specialist in using any of these techniques. Rather, after reading this book, you will have a general understanding about the existence and the mechanics of all these approaches. You can use such an understanding as the starting point of your own career in the field of network science. This has been, so far, an interdisciplinary endeavor. The founding fathers of this field come from many different backgrounds: mathematics, sociology, computer science, physics, history, digital humanities, and more. This Atlas is charting your path to be something different from all of that: a pure network scientist.</description>
