      <title>Non-linear Faraday Precession of Light Polarization in Time-Reversal Invariant Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of electromagnetic waves through materials displaying a non-linear Hall effect. The coupled Maxwell-Boltzmann equations for traveling waves can be mapped onto ordinary differential equations that resemble those for the motion of a pendulum. In the weakly non-linear regime relevant for most experiments, we find that the polarization of light displays a Faraday-like precession of its polarization direction that swings back and forth around the direction of Berry dipole vector as the light beam traverses the material. This occurs concomitantly with an oscillation of its degree of polarization, with a characteristic frequency that increases linearly with the intensity of the traveling wave. These effects could be observed by measuring thickness dependent Faraday rotations as well as the emission of lower frequency radiation associated with the polarization oscillations in materials displaying the non-linear Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Dirac points and Weyl phase in a honeycomb altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a graphene derivative displaying novel topological phenomena without the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a collinear altermagnet. By investigating the retarded and advanced Green's functions, we calculate the spectral density and amplitude of wave function whose exact solutions are analytically obtained. The altermagnetism breaks the intrinsic time-reversal symmetry, guaranteeing the formation of pairs of Weyl points associated with the internal spin structure chiralities. We demonstrate the evolution of Dirac and Weyl crossings, in which spontaneous Hall effect is controlled by the chiral edge modes. Topological phase transitions are characterized by the high Chern numbers preserving the non-intersecting flows of Wannier centers over occupied bands. We illustrate possible experiments to realize topologically altermagnetic responses according to the bulk-boundary correspondence.</description>

      <title>Density of states and differential entropy in the Dirac materials in crossed magnetic and in-plane electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density of states and differential entropy per particle are analyzed for Dirac-like electrons in graphene subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field and an in-plane electric field. For comparison, the derived density of states is contrasted with the well-known case of nonrelativistic electrons in crossed magnetic and electric fields. The study considers ballistic electrons and also includes the effect of small impurity scattering. In the latter case, the limit of zero magnetic field and the so-called collapse of Landau levels in graphene are examined analytically. By comparing the results with numerical calculations on graphene ribbons, we demonstrate that the Landau state counting procedure must be modified for Dirac-like electrons, leading to a field-dependent Landau level degeneracy factor. Additionally, it is shown that peaks in the differential entropy arise from the dispersionless surface mode localized at the zigzag edges of the ribbon.</description>

      <title>Electric field control of the exchange field of a single spin impurity on a surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric control of spins offers faster switching and more localized manipulation compared to magnetic fields. In this work, we investigate static electric field effects on electron spin resonance of single molecules and atoms using scanning tunneling microscopy. We observe significant resonance frequency shifts when varying the applied DC voltage. These shifts cannot be adequately explained by g-factor changes or adsorbate displacement. Instead, we propose a model based on the control of the magnetic exchange field exerted to the spin impurity by the static electric field, which accurately reproduces the static electric field dependence of the resonance frequency. Our work provides crucial insights into electric field influence on surface spins, advancing fundamental understanding for many quantum technologies with efficient spin control via electric fields.</description>

      <title>Floquet-Bloch Valleytronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driving quantum materials out-of-equilibrium makes it possible to generate states of matter inaccessible through standard equilibrium tuning methods. Upon time-periodic coherent driving of electrons using electromagnetic fields, the emergence of Floquet-Bloch states enables the creation and control of exotic quantum phases. In transition metal dichalcogenides, broken inversion symmetry within each monolayer results in a non-zero Berry curvature at the K and K$^{\prime}$ valley extrema, giving rise to chiroptical selection rules that are fundamental to valleytronics. Here, we bridge the gap between these two concepts and introduce Floquet-Bloch valleytronics. Using time- and polarization-resolved extreme ultraviolet momentum microscopy combined with state-of-the-art ab initio theory, we demonstrate the formation of valley-polarized Floquet-Bloch states in 2H-WSe$_2$ upon below-bandgap coherent electron driving with chiral light pulses. We investigate quantum path interference between Floquet-Bloch and Volkov states, showing that this interferometric process depends on the valley pseudospin and light polarization-state. Conducting extreme ultraviolet photoemission circular dichroism in these nonequilibrium settings reveals the potential for controlling the orbital character of Floquet-engineered states. These findings link Floquet engineering and quantum geometric light-matter coupling in two-dimensional materials. They can serve as a guideline for reaching novel out-of-equilibrium phases of matter by dynamically breaking symmetries through coherent dressing of winding Bloch electrons with tailored light pulses.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Investigations of Multiple Environments in Er:CaWO4 through Charge Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed spectroscopic study of the $^4\mathrm{I}_{13/2}$ and $^4\mathrm{I}_{15/2}$ Er$^{3+}$ multiplets of Er:CaWO$_4$ grown without a co-dopant. Using photoluminescence and photoluminescence excitation measurements, we find multiple environments into which the Erbium ions are incorporated in the crystal. For the four most prevalent environments, we provide a complete assignment of the $^4\mathrm{I}_{13/2}$ and $^4\mathrm{I}_{15/2}$ sublevel energies. Polarization-dependent absorption and emission spectroscopy allow us to identify the irreducible representations of the states and determine the dipole nature of transitions. In addition, we compare the different relaxation paths within $^4\mathrm{I}_{13/2}$ and $^4\mathrm{I}_{15/2}$ multiplets via line broadening and lifetime measurements. Finally, spectral, lifetime, and polarization measurements indicate similarities between the studied environments.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Proximity Effect in Two-Dimensional Hole Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technology involving hybrid superconductor-semiconductor materials is a promising avenue for engineering quantum devices for information storage, manipulation, and transmission. Proximity-induced superconducting correlations are an essential part of such devices. While the proximity effect in the conduction band of common semiconductors is well understood, its manifestation in confined hole gases, realized for instance in germanium, is an active area of research. Lower-dimensional hole-based systems, particularly in germanium, are emerging as an attractive platform for a variety of solid-state quantum devices, due to their combination of efficient spin and charge control and long coherence times. The recent experimental realization of the proximity effect in germanium thus calls for a theoretical description that is tailored to hole gases. In this work, we propose a simple model to describe proximity-induced superconductivity in two-dimensional hole gases, incorporating both the heavy-hole (HH) and light-hole (LH) bands. We start from the Luttinger-Kohn model, introduce three parameters that characterize hopping across the superconductor-semiconductor interface, and derive explicit intraband and interband effective pairing terms for the HH and LH bands. Unlike previous approaches, our theory provides a quantitative relationship between induced pairings and interface properties. Restricting our general model to an experimentally relevant case where only the HH band crosses the chemical potential, we predict the coexistence of $s$-wave and $d$-wave singlet pairings, along with triplet-type pairings, and modified Zeeman and Rashba spin-orbit couplings. Our model thus presents a starting point for theoretical modeling of quantum devices based on proximitized hole gases, fueling further progress in quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-assisted preparation of topological boundary states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust states emerging at the boundaries of a system are an important hallmark of topological matter. Here, using the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Kitaev chain as examples, we study the impact of a type of experimentally realizable bond dissipation on topological systems by calculating the steady-state density matrix, and demonstrate that such dissipation applied near the system boundary can assist in preparing topological edge states of the parent Hamiltonian, irrespective of the initial state or filling. This effect stems from the matching between the phase distribution encoded in the topological edge states and the target state prepared through bond dissipation. This work provides new insights into the preparation of topological edge states, particularly in the context of Majorana zero modes.</description>

      <title>Ternary Stochastic Neuron -- Implemented with a Single Strained Magnetostrictive Nanomagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic neurons are extremely efficient hardware for solving a large class of problems and usually come in two varieties -- "binary" where the neuronal statevaries randomly between two values of -1, +1 and "analog" where the neuronal state can randomly assume any value between -1 and +1. Both have their uses in neuromorphic computing and both can be implemented with low- or zero-energy-barrier nanomagnets whose random magnetization orientations in the presence of thermal noise encode the binary or analog state variables. In between these two classes is n-ary stochastic neurons, mainly ternary stochastic neurons (TSN) whose state randomly assumes one of three values (-1, 0, +1), which have proved to be efficient in pattern classification tasks such as recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST data set or patterns from the CIFAR-10 data set. Here, we show how to implement a TSN with a zero-energy-barrier (shape isotropic) magnetostrictive nanomagnet subjected to uniaxial strain.</description>

      <title>Emergent Weyl-like points in periodically modulated systems and Floquet engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a three-dimensional topological phase resembling a Weyl semimetal, modulated by a periodic potential and engineered through Floquet dynamics. This system is constructed by stacking two-dimensional Chern insulators and hosts Weyl-like points defined in the parameter space $(k_x, k_y, z)$, distinct from conventional Weyl points in momentum space $(k_x, k_y, k_z)$. The Weyl-semimetal-like phase exhibits characteristics akin to those of Weyl semimetals, including linear dispersion near the Weyl-like points, nontrivial bulk topology, and the presence of Fermi arcs connecting the Weyl-like points. Unlike traditional Weyl semimetals, these features manifest in real space rather than momentum space. Additionally, we compute the layer-resolved Floquet Hall conductivity and demonstrate that the positions of the Weyl-like points can be controlled via high-frequency laser pumping.</description>

      <title>Gauge-invariant projector calculus for quantum state geometry and applications to observables in crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The importance of simple geometrical invariants, such as the Berry curvature and quantum metric, constructed from the Bloch states of a crystal has become well-established over four decades of research. More complex aspects of geometry emerge in properties linking multiple bands, such as optical responses. In the companion work [arXiv:2409.16358], we identified novel multi-state geometrical invariants using an explicitly gauge-invariant formalism based on projection operators, which we used to clarify the relation between the shift current and the theory of electronic polarization among other advancements for second-order non-linear optics. Here, we provide considerably more detail on the projector formalism and the geometrical invariants arising in the vicinity of a specific value of crystal momentum. We combine the introduction to multi-state quantum geometry with broadly relevant algebraic relationships and detailed example calculations, enabling extensions toward future applications to topological and geometrical properties of insulators and metals.</description>

      <title>Itinerant Ferromagnetism from One-Dimensional Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a universal kinetic mechanism for a half-metallic ferromagnet -- a metallic state with full spin polarization -- arising from strong on-site Coulomb repulsions between particles that exhibit constrained one-dimensional (1D) dynamics. We illustrate the mechanism in the context of a solvable model on a Lieb lattice in which doped electrons have 1D mobility. Such 1D motion is shown to induce only multi-spin ring exchanges of even parity, which mediate ferromagnetism and result in a unique half-metallic ground state. In contrast to the Nagaoka mechanism of ferromagnetism, this result pertains to any doped electron density in the {\it thermodynamic} limit. We explore various microscopic routes to such (approximate) 1D dynamics, highlighting two examples: doped holes in the strong-coupling limit of the Emery model and vacancies in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. Finally, we demonstrate an intriguing exact equivalence between the bosonic and fermionic versions of these models, which implies a novel mechanism for the conjectured Bose metallic phase.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime on a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, topological invariants, flat bands, and topological quantized current in the incommensurate regimes.</description>

      <title>Self-correcting GKP qubit in a superconducting circuit with an oscillating voltage bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple circuit architecture for a dissipatively error corrected Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubit. The device consists of a electromagnetic resonator with impedance $h/2e^2\approx 12.91\,{\rm k}\Omega$ connected to a Josephson junction with a voltage bias oscillating at twice the resonator frequency. For large drive amplitudes, the circuit is effectively described by the GKP stabilizer Hamiltonian, whose low-energy subspace forms the code space for a qubit protected against phase-space local noise. The GKP states in the codespace can be dissipatively stabilized and error corrected by coupling the resonator to a bath through a bandpass filter; a resulting side-band cooling effect stabilizes the system in the GKP code space, dissipatively correcting it against both bit and phase flip errors. Simulations show that this dissipative error correction can enhance coherence time by factor $\sim 1000$ with NbN-based junctions, for operating temperatures in the $\sim 100\,{\rm mK}$ range. The scheme can be used to stabilize both square- and hexagonal-lattice GKP codes. Finally, a Josephson current based readout scheme, and dissipatively corrected single-qubit Clifford gates are proposed.</description>

      <title>Water under hydrophobic confinement: entropy and diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of liquid water are known to change drastically in confined geometries. A most interesting and intriguing phenomenon is that the diffusion of water is found to be strongly enhanced by the proximity of a hydrophobic confining wall relative to the bulk diffusion. We report a molecular dynamics simulation using a classical water model investigating the water diffusion near a non-interacting smooth confining wall, which is assumed to imitate a hydrophobic surface. A pronounced diffusion enhancement is observed in the water layers adjacent to the wall. We present evidence that the observed diffusion enhancement can be accounted for, with numerical accuracy, using the universal scaling law for liquid diffusion that relates the liquid diffusion rate to the excess entropy. These results show that the scaling law, that has so far only been used for the description of the diffusion in simple liquids, can successfully describe the diffusion in water. It is thus shown that the law can be used for the description of water dynamics under nano-scale confinement which is currently a subject of intense research activity.</description>

      <title>Impact of the exciton fine structure splitting and measurement orientations on the robustness of cryptographic keys generated via the quantum protocol E91</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photons and optical circuits are among the most promising platforms for implementation of quantum technologies, because of its potential use in quantum computing, quantum cryptography and long-distance quantum communication. One of the main requirements to achieve reliable quantum communications are on-demand sources of highly entangled photon pairs, and semiconductor quantum dots have emerged as prominent candidates to satisfy the necessary conditions of brightness and entanglement fidelity. However, in most cases the biexciton-exciton-vacuum cascade produces a pair of maximally polarization-entangled photons with a dephasing, due to the exciton fine structure splitting. This work focuses on the performance of the E91 quantum key distribution protocol under the variation of two elements: first, the phase in the input state when the protocol is implemented using entangled photons generated via the radiative cascade, and second, the relative directions of the polarization analyzers. We obtain analytical expressions for the protocol's secret key rate and Bell's parameter as functions of the studied phase and angles. Then, we validate those expressions by means of a quantum computational implementation with the IBM's API Qiskit. Our results show that the performance of the quantum transmission is highly impacted by the product between the exciton lifetime and the quantum dot's fine structure splitting and that such an impact may be modulated through the orientation of the polarizers. These findings provide important insight for the scalable implementation of quantum key distribution protocols with quantum dots as entanglement sources.</description>

      <title>Nonuniform Parafermion Chains: Low-Energy Physics and Finite-Size Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonuniform $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetric Kitaev chain, comprising alternating topological and normal regions, hosts localized states known as edge-zero modes (EZMs) at its interfaces. These EZMs can pair to form qubits that are resilient to quantum decoherence, a feature expected to extend to higher symmetric chains, i.e., parafermion chains. However, finite-size effects may impact this ideal picture. Diagnosing these effects requires first a thorough understanding of the low-energy physics where EZMs may emerge. Previous studies have largely focused on uniform chains, with nonuniform cases inferred from these results. While recent work [Narozhny, Sci. Rep. 7, 1447 (2017)] provides an insightful analytical solution for a nonuniform $\mathbb{Z}_2$ chain with two topological regions separated by a normal one, its complexity limits its applicability to chains with more regions or higher symmetries. Here, we present a new approach based on decimating the highest-energy terms, facilitating the scalable analysis of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ chains with any number of regions. We provide analytical results for both $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and$\mathbb{Z}_3$ chains, supported by numerical findings, and identify the critical lengths necessary to preserve well-separated EZMs.</description>

      <title>Winding number on 3D lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple numerical method which computes an approximate value of the winding number of a mapping from 3D torus~$T^3$ to the unitary group~$U(N)$, when $T^3$ is approximated by discrete lattice points. Our method consists of a ``tree-level improved'' discretization of the winding number and the gradient flow associated with an ``over-improved'' lattice action. By employing a one-parameter family of mappings from $T^3$ to $SU(2)$ with known winding numbers, we demonstrate that the method works quite well even for coarse lattices, reproducing integer winding numbers in a good accuracy. Our method can trivially be generalized to the case of higher-dimensional tori.</description>

      <title>Advanced Design of Self-Healing Dielectric Capacitors: New Universal Concept and Computational Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new computational method is herein discussed to systemize the development of new dielectric capacitor designs. The method predicts the identities and amounts of (1) gaseous products of decomposition, (2) the volume of the emerged solid phase, coined soot, (3) the band gaps of the soot samples, and (4) the electrical conductivity of the soot. The predictions can be made by using electronic-structure methods of atomistic simulations combined with the exploration of the potential energy landscape. The work discusses and rates the relative importance of each of the four introduced descriptors to unequivocally characterize possible capacitor designs. The concept is addressed to researchers working with enhanced energy storage designs and electrical engineers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin and orbital are two basic degrees of freedom, which play significant roles in exploring exotic quantum phases in optical lattices with synthetic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and high orbital bands, respectively. Here, we propose an orbital optical Raman lattice to study exotic high-orbital Bose condensates with Raman-induced SOC in a square lattice. We find that both the SOC and p-orbital interactions influence the condensed state of bosons. Their interplay results in two novel high-orbital many-body quantum phases: the uniform angular momentum superfluid phase, which features a global topological chiral orbital current, and the two-dimensional spin-orbital supersolid phase, which is characterized by the spin and orbital angular momentum density wave patterns. The former has topological Bogoliubov excitations characterized by a uniform Chern number, while the spin-orbital supersolid phase hosts topological excitations with opposite Chern numbers which respectively protect the chiral and antichiral edge modes in the neighboring supersolid clusters. Our findings may inspire a new avenue for exploring exotic SOC and high-orbital physics in optical lattices, and shall also advance the experimental progress of novel supersolids in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Differential Magnetic Force Microscopy with a Switchable Tip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The separation of physical forces acting on the tip of a magnetic force microscope (MFM) is essential for correct magnetic imaging. Electrostatic forces can be modulated by varying the tip-sample potential and minimized to map the local Kelvin potential. However, distinguishing magnetic forces from van der Waals forces typically requires two measurements with opposite tip magnetizations under otherwise identical measurement conditions. Here, we present an inverted magnetic force microscope where the sample is mounted on a flat cantilever for force sensing, and the magnetic tip is attached to a miniaturized electromagnet that periodically flips the tip magnetization. This setup enables the extraction of magnetic tip-sample interactions from the sidebands occurring at the switching rate in the cantilever oscillation spectrum. Our method achieves the separation of magnetic signals from other force contributions in a single-scan mode. Future iterations of this setup may incorporate membrane, trampoline, or string resonators with ultra-high quality factors, potentially improving measurement sensitivity by up to three orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art MFM systems using cantilevers.</description>

      <title>Four-fold Anisotropic Magnetoresistance in Antiferromagnetic Epitaxial Thin Films of MnPt$_{x}$Pd$_{1-x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets are emerging as promising alternatives to ferromagnets in spintronics applications. A key feature of antiferromagnets is their anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR), which has the potential to serve as a sensitive marker for the antiferromagnetic order parameter. However, the underlying origins of this behavior remain poorly understood. In this study, we report the observation of AMR in epitaxial thin films of the collinear L1$_{0}$ antiferromagnet MnPt$_{x}$Pd$_{1-x}$. In thicker films, the AMR is dominated by a non-crystalline two-fold component. As the film thickness is reduced, however, a crystalline four-fold component emerges, accompanied by the appearance of uncompensated magnetic moment, which strongly modifies the magnetotransport properties in the thinner films. We demonstrate that interfacial interactions lead to a large density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level. This enhanced DOS, combined with disorder in thinner films, stabilizes the uncompensated moment and induces a four-fold modulation of the DOS as the Neel vector rotates, explaining the observed AMR behavior.</description>

      <title>Ultralow Voltage Operation of p- and n-FETs Enabled by Self-Formed Gate Dielectric and Metal Contacts on 2D Tellurium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ongoing demand for more energy-efficient, high-performance electronics is driving the exploration of innovative materials and device architectures, where interfaces play a crucial role due to the continuous downscaling of device dimensions. Tellurium (Te), in its two-dimensional (2D) form, offers significant potential due to its high carrier mobility and ambipolar characteristics, with the carrier type easily tunable via surface modulation. In this study, we leverage atomically controlled material transformations in 2D Te to create intimate junctions, enabling near-ideal field-effect transistors (FETs) for both n-type and p-type operation. A NiTex-Te contact provides highly transparent interfaces, resulting in low contact resistance, while the TiOx-Te gate dielectric forms an ultraclean interface with a capacitance equivalent to 0.88 nm equivalent oxide thickness (EOT), where the quantum capacitance of Te is observed. Subthreshold slopes (SS) approach the Boltzmann limit, with a record-low SS of 3.5 mV/dec achieved at 10 K. Furthermore, we demonstrate 2D Te-based complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) inverters operating at an ultralow voltage of 0.08 V with a voltage gain of 7.1 V/V. This work presents a promising approach to forming intimate dielectric/semiconductor and metal/semiconductor junctions for next-generation low-power electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Quantized Hall drift in a frequency-encoded photonic Chern insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prospect of developing more efficient classical or quantum photonic devices through the suppression of backscattering is a major driving force for the field of topological photonics. However, genuine protection against backscattering in photonics requires implementing architectures with broken time-reversal which is technically challenging. Here, we make use of a frequency-encoded synthetic dimension scheme in an optical fibre loop platform to experimentally realise a photonic Chern insulator inspired from the Haldane model where time-reversal is explicitly broken through temporal modulation. The bands' topology is assessed by reconstructing the Bloch states' geometry across the Brillouin zone. We further highlight its consequences by measuring a driven-dissipative analogue of the quantized transverse Hall conductivity. Our results thus open the door to harnessing topologically protected unidirectional transport of light in frequency-multiplexed photonic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We spatially resolve photocarrier dynamics in halide perovskites using time-resolved electrostatic force microscopy (trEFM) to map surface potential equilibration during photoexcitation. Following treatment with different surface passivation agents, we show that trEFM probes dynamics directly related to surface recombination velocity and carrier lifetimes correlated with time-resolved photoluminescence. Our results reveal nanoscale variations in recombination dynamics following surface passivation. We also observe heterogeneity in surface potential equilibration times dependent on perovskite film morphology. We combine wavelength- and intensity-dependent measurements with drift-diffusion simulations to disentangle the influence of carrier recombination and ion migration on surface potential equilibration. These results demonstrate that we can use mechanical detection to image electronic carrier recombination dynamics in perovskites below the optical diffraction limit while also showing the potential for future improvements in heterogeneity of surface passivation.</description>

Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect is a phenomenon in which an extensive number of states accumulates at the boundaries of a system. It has been associated to nontrivial topology, with nonzero bulk invariants predicting its appearance and its position in real space. Here, we demonstrate that the non-Hermitian skin effect has weaker bulk-edge correspondence than topological insulators: when translation symmetry is broken by a single non-Hermitian impurity, skin modes are depleted at the boundary and accumulate at the impurity site, without changing any bulk invariant. Similarly, a single non-Hermitian impurity may deplete the states from a region of Hermitian bulk.</description>

Abstract: We address the experimentally relevant situation, where a non-equilibrium state is created at the edge of a quantum Hall system by injecting charge current into a chiral edge state with the help of a quantum point contact, quantum dots, or mesoscopic Ohmic contact. We show that the commonly accepted picture of the full equilibration of a non-equilibrium state at finite distances longer than a characteristic length scale contradicts to the charge conservation requirement. We use a phenomenological transmission line model to account for the local equilibration process and the charge and energy conserving dynamics of the collective mode. By solving this model in the limit of long distances $L$ from the injection point, we demonstrate that the correction of the electron distribution function to its eventual equilibrium form scales down slowly as $1/\sqrt{L}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The robustness of topological properties, such as quantized currents, generally depends on the existence of gaps surrounding the relevant energy levels or on symmetry-forbidden transitions. Here, we observe quantized currents that survive the addition of bounded local disorder beyond the closing of the relevant instantaneous energy gaps in a driven Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper chain, a prototypical model of quasiperiodic systems. We explain the robustness using a local picture in \textit{configuration-space} based on Landau-Zener transitions, which rests on the Anderson localisation of the eigenstates. Moreover, we propose a protocol, directly realizable in for instance cold atoms or photonic experiments, which leverages this stability to prepare topological many-body states with high Chern numbers and opens new experimental avenues for the study of both the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects.</description>

      <title>Quantum-dot-based Kitaev chains: Majorana quality measures and scaling with increasing chain length</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realizing Majorana bound states (MBSs) in short, well-controllable chains of coupled quantum dots sidesteps the problem of disorder, but requires fine-tuning and does not give the true topological protection inherent to long chains. Here, we introduce a new quality measure that is applicable also in the presence of strong electron-electron interactions and that quantifies the closeness to topological protection of finetuned MBSs in short quantum-dot chains. We call this measure local distinguishability because it puts a bound to the degree an arbitrary local measurement can distinguish between two states. We study the local distinguishability for quantum-dot chains of different length. The three-dot chain is studied in detail, and we find that it may not always be an improvement over the two-dot case, a fact that can be understood within an effective model derived from perturbation theory. For longer chains, the local distinguishability vanishes exponentially, signalling a transition to a topological phase with two ground states that cannot be distinguished by any local measurement.</description>

Abstract: A striking general bound on the energy gap in topological matter was recently discovered in Ref. [Onishi and Fu, Phys. Rev. X {\bf 14}, 011052 (2024)]. A non-trivial indirect derivation builds on the properties of optical conductivity at an arbitrary frequency. We propose a simpler derivation, allowing multiple generalizations, such as a universal bound on a gap in anisotropic systems, systems with multiple charge carrier types, and topological systems with zero Hall conductance. The derivation builds on the observation that the bound equals $\hbar$ times the ratio of the force by the external electric field on the charge carriers and their total kinematic momentum in the direction perpendicular to the force.</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering of topological phase transitions in quantum spin Hall $\alpha$-$T_{3}$ system</title>

Abstract: Floquet engineering of topological phase transitions driven by a high-frequency time-periodic field is a promising approach to realizing new topological phases of matter distinct from static states. Here, we theoretically investigate Floquet engineering topological phase transitions in the quantum spin Hall $\alpha$-$T_{3}$ system driven by an off-resonant circularly polarized light. In addition to the quantum spin (anomalous) Hall insulator phase with multiple helical (chiral) edge states, spin-polarized topological metallic phases are observed, where the bulk topological band gap of one spin sub-band overlaps with the other gapless spin sub-band. Moreover, with a staggered potential, the topological invariants of the system depend on whether the middle band is occupied because of the breaking of symmetry with respect to the center of energy-momentum plane. Our work highlights the significance of Floquet engineering in realizing new topological phases in $\alpha$-$T_{3}$ lattices.</description>

      <title>Focused deposition of levitated nanoscale Au droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a method for depositing nanoscale liquid Au droplets, initially levitated in an ion trap in high vacuum, onto a remote substrate. A levitated Au nanosphere is melted, expelled from the trap, and maintained in the molten state with a laser directed along the droplet trajectory until it reaches the substrate and rapidly solidifies. Also during transit, the charged droplets are focused to a small region of the substrate with an electrostatic lens. After deposition, the substrate can be removed from the vacuum chamber and imaged and analyzed by techniques such as electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. Over 90% of launched particles are deposited on the substrate, and when the lens is focused, particles land in a region of diameter 120 $\mu$m after traversing a distance of 236 mm. Our technique is of value for analysis of materials prepared or processed while levitated that can be melted. Also, Au droplets may be useful as tracers for future experiments involving smaller projectiles or oriented solids.</description>

      <title>Crossed Andreev reflection revealed by self-consistent Keldysh-Usadel formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a process that creates entanglement between spatially separated electrons and holes. Such entangled pairs have potential applications in quantum information processing, and it is therefore relevant to determine how the probability for CAR can be increased. CAR competes with another non-local process called elastic cotunneling (EC), which does not create entanglement. In conventional normal metal/superconductor/normal metal heterostructures, earlier theoretical work predicted that EC dominates over CAR. Nevertheless, we show numerically that when the Keldysh-Usadel equations are solved self-consistently in the superconductor, CAR can dominate over EC. Self-consistency is necessary both for the conversion from a quasiparticle current to a supercurrent and to describe the spatial variation of the order parameter correctly. A requirement for the CAR probability to surpass the EC probability is that the inverse proximity effect is small. Otherwise, the subvoltage density of states becomes large and EC is strengthened by quasiparticles flowing through the superconductor. Therefore, CAR becomes dominant in the non-local transport with increasing interface resistance and length of the superconducting region. Our results show that even the simplest possible experimental setup with easily accessible normal metals and superconductors can provide dominant CAR by designing the experimental parameters correctly. We also find that spin-splitting in the superconductor increases the subvoltage density of states, and thus always favors EC over CAR. Finally, we tune the chemical potential in the leads such that transport is governed by electrons of one spin type. This can increase the CAR probability at finite values of the spin-splitting compared to using a spin-degenerate voltage bias, and provides a way to control the spin of the conduction electrons electrically.</description>

      <title>Extraction and Simulation of the Impact of Flux Trapping in Moats of AC-Biased Shift Registers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moats in superconducting ground planes are used to trap magnetic flux away from sensitive parts of superconductor integrated circuits. We simulate the effect of magnetic flux trapped in moats on the operating margins of ac-biased SFQ shift registers (ShReg) with two ground planes for various congruent moat geometries, moat sizes, locations in the ShReg cells, number and polarity of the trapped of fluxons. Using inductance extractor InductEx, we extract mutual couplings between the moats and the ShReg inductors and include them in the refined netlist. Then, we use JoSim to simulate the circuit operation and find the threshold ac clock amplitude above which the register starts to operate correctly. The relative change in this threshold is used to characterize the influence of flux trapping on the circuit operation. Monte-Carlo simulations are used to investigate the effect of the circuit parameter variations on the statistics of the threshold, using the standard deviation of the Josephson junction critical current and of the circuit inductance extracted from the fabrication process control monitors. The obtained distributions are compared with the independently measured distributions of the threshold amplitude for the individual cells of ac-biased shift registers with 108,500 Josephson junctions. The results show that flux trapping in properly designed moats have a very small effect on the operation margins of the large-scale shift registers whereas the main contribution to the cell-to-cell variation of the threshold comes from the variation of the junctions' critical currents.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved photon statistics of general nanophotonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While experimental measurements of photon correlations have become routine in laboratories, theoretical access to these quantities for the light generated in complex nanophotonic devices remains a major challenge. Current methods are limited to specific simplified cases and lack generality. Here we present a novel method that provides access to photon statistics resolved in space and frequency in arbitrary electromagnetic environments. Within the macroscopic QED framework, we develop a practical tool to compute electric field correlations for complex quantum systems by including lossy two-level systems that act as field detectors within the system. To make the implementation feasible, we use a recently developed multi-emitter few-mode quantization method to correctly account for fully retarded light propagation to the detectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique by studying the photon correlations of one and two emitters in close proximity to a plasmonic nanoparticle. The simulations show that even in these relatively simple configurations, the light statistics exhibit a strong angular dependence. These results highlight the importance of going beyond conventional quantum-optical approaches to fully capture the analyzed physical effects and enable the study of the quantum light generation in realistic nanophotonic devices.</description>
