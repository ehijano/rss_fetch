      <title>Benchmarking deep learning models for bearing fault diagnosis using the CWRU dataset: A multi-label approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for modeling the problem of fault diagnosis using the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing fault dataset. Although the dataset is considered a standard reference for testing new algorithms, the typical dataset division suffers from data leakage, as shown by Hendriks et al. (2022) and Abburi et al. (2023), leading to papers reporting over-optimistic results. While their proposed division significantly mitigates this issue, it does not eliminate it entirely. Moreover, their proposed multi-class classification task can still lead to an unrealistic scenario by excluding the possibility of more than one fault type occurring at the same or different locations. As advocated in this paper, a multi-label formulation (detecting the presence of each type of fault for each location) can solve both issues, leading to a scenario closer to reality. Additionally, this approach mitigates the heavy class imbalance of the CWRU dataset, where faulty cases appear much more frequently than healthy cases, even though the opposite is more likely to occur in practice. A multi-label formulation also enables a more precise evaluation using prevalence-independent evaluation metrics for binary classification, such as the ROC curve. Finally, this paper proposes a more realistic dataset division that allows for more diversity in the training dataset while keeping the division free from data leakage. The results show that this new division can significantly improve performance while enabling a fine-grained error analysis. As an application of our approach, a comparative benchmark is performed using several state-of-the-art deep learning models applied to 1D and 2D signal representations in time and/or frequency domains.</description>

      <title>Hybrid PHD-PMB Trajectory Smoothing Using Backward Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probability hypothesis density (PHD) and Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) filters are two popular set-type multi-object filters. Motivated by the fact that the multi-object filtering density after each update step in the PHD filter is a PMB without approximation, in this paper we present a multi-object smoother involving PHD forward filtering and PMB backward smoothing. This is achieved by first running the PHD filtering recursion in the forward pass and extracting the PMB filtering densities after each update step before the Poisson Point Process approximation, which is inherent in the PHD filter update. Then in the backward pass we apply backward simulation for sets of trajectories to the extracted PMB filtering densities. We call the resulting multi-object smoother hybrid PHD-PMB trajectory smoother. Notably, the hybrid PHD-PMB trajectory smoother can provide smoothed trajectory estimates for the PHD filter without labeling or tagging, which is not possible for existing PHD smoothers. Also, compared to the trajectory PHD filter, which can only estimate alive trajectories, the hybrid PHD-PMB trajectory smoother enables the estimation of the set of all trajectories. Simulation results demonstrate that the hybrid PHD-PMB trajectory smoother outperforms the PHD filter in terms of both state and cardinality estimates, and the trajectory PHD filter in terms of false detections.</description>

      <title>Dreamer: Dual-RIS-aided Imager in Complementary Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a promising auxiliary technology for radio frequency imaging. However, existing works face challenges of faint and intricate back-scattered waves and the restricted field-of-view (FoV), both resulting from complex target structures and a limited number of antennas. The synergistic benefits of multi-RIS-aided imaging hold promise for addressing these challenges. Here, we propose a dual-RIS-aided imaging system, Dreamer, which operates collaboratively in complementary modes (reflection-mode and transmission-mode). Dreamer significantly expands the FoV and enhances perception by deploying dual-RIS across various spatial and measurement patterns. Specifically, we perform a fine-grained analysis of how radio-frequency (RF) signals encode scene information in the scattered object modeling. Based on this modeling, we design illumination strategies to balance spatial resolution and observation scale, and implement a prototype system in a typical indoor environment. Moreover, we design a novel artificial neural network with a CNN-external-attention mechanism to translate RF signals into high-resolution images of human contours. Our approach achieves an impressive SSIM score exceeding 0.83, validating its effectiveness in broadening perception modes and enhancing imaging capabilities. The code to reproduce our results is available at https://github.com/fuhaiwang/Dreamer.</description>

      <title>Preictal Period Optimization for Deep Learning-Based Epileptic Seizure Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of epileptic seizures could prove critical for improving patient safety and quality of life in drug-resistant epilepsy. Although deep learning-based approaches have shown promising seizure prediction performance using scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, substantial limitations still impede their clinical adoption. Furthermore, identifying the optimal preictal period (OPP) for labeling EEG segments remains a challenge. Here, we not only develop a competitive deep learning model for seizure prediction but, more importantly, leverage it to demonstrate a methodology to comprehensively evaluate the predictive performance in the seizure prediction task. For this, we introduce a CNN-Transformer deep learning model to detect preictal spatiotemporal dynamics, alongside a novel Continuous Input-Output Performance Ratio (CIOPR) metric to determine the OPP. We trained and evaluated our model on 19 pediatric patients of the open-access CHB-MIT dataset in a subject-specific manner. Using the OPP of each patient, preictal and interictal segments were correctly identified with an average sensitivity of 99.31%, specificity of 95.34%, AUC of 99.35%, and F1- score of 97.46%, while prediction time averaged 76.8 minutes before onset. Notably, our novel CIOPR metric allowed outlining the impact of different preictal period definitions on prediction time, accuracy, output stability, and transition time between interictal and preictal states in a comprehensive and quantitative way and highlighted the importance of considering both inter- and intra-patient variability in seizure prediction.</description>

      <title>Enhancing K-user Interference Alignment for Discrete Constellations via Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a K-user interference channel where interference among the users is neither too strong nor too weak, a scenario that is relatively underexplored in the literature. We propose a novel deep learning-based approach to design the encoder and decoder functions that aim to maximize the sumrate of the interference channel for discrete constellations. We first consider the MaxSINR algorithm, a state-of-the-art linear scheme for Gaussian inputs, as the baseline and then propose a modified version of the algorithm for discrete inputs. We then propose a neural network-based approach that learns a constellation mapping with the objective of maximizing the sumrate. We provide numerical results to show that the constellations learned by the neural network-based approach provide enhanced alignments, not just in beamforming directions but also in terms of the effective constellation at the receiver, thereby leading to improved sum-rate performance.</description>

      <title>Robust Secure ISAC: How RSMA and Active RIS Manage Eavesdropper's Spatial Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) into integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) presents a significant security challenge, particularly in scenarios where the location of a potential eavesdropper (Eve) is unidentified. Splitting users' messages into common and private streams exposes them to eavesdropping, with the common stream dedicated for sensing and accessible to multiple users. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach that leverages active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided beamforming and artificial noise (AN) to enhance the security of RSMA-enabled ISAC. Specifically, we first derive the ergodic private secrecy rate (EPSR) based on mathematical approximation of the average Eve channel gain. An optimization problem is then formulated to maximize the minimum EPSR, while satisfying the minimum required thresholds on ergodic common secrecy rate, radar sensing and RIS power budget. To address this non-convex problem, a novel optimization strategy is developed, whereby we alternatively optimize the transmit beamforming matrix for the common and private streams, rate splitting, AN, RIS reflection coefficient matrix, and radar receive beamformer. Successive convex approximation (SCA) and Majorization-Minimization (MM) are employed to convexify the beamforming and RIS sub-problems. Simulations are conducted to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed framework against established benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Channel Shaping Using Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface: Analysis, Optimization, and Enhanced Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the capability of a passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) to redistribute the singular values of point-to-point Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels for achieving power and rate gains. We depart from the conventional Diagonal (D)-RIS with diagonal phase shift matrix and adopt a Beyond Diagonal (BD) architecture that offers greater wave manipulation flexibility through element-wise connections. Specifically, we first provide shaping insights by characterizing the channel singular value regions attainable by D-RIS and BD-RIS via a novel geodesic optimization. Analytical singular value bounds are then derived to explore their shaping limits in typical deployment scenarios. As a side product, we tackle BD-RIS-aided MIMO rate maximization problem by a local-optimal Alternating Optimization (AO) and a shaping-inspired low-complexity approach. Results show that compared to D-RIS, BD-RIS significantly improves the dynamic range of all channel singular values, the trade-off in manipulating them, and thus the channel power and achievable rate. Those observations become more pronounced when the number of RIS elements and MIMO dimensions increase. Of particular interest, BD-RIS is shown to activate multi-stream transmission at lower transmit power than D-RIS, hence achieving the asymptotic Degrees of Freedom (DoF) at low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) thanks to its higher flexibility of shaping the distribution of channel singular values.</description>

      <title>Variation Bayesian Interference for Multiple Extended Targets or Unresolved Group Targets Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a tracking method for multiple extended targets or unresolvable group targets based on the Variational Bayesian Inference (VBI). Firstly, based on the most commonly used Random Matrix Model (RMM), the joint states of a single target are modeled as a Gamma Gaussian Inverse Wishart (GGIW) distribution, and the multi-target joint association variables are involved in the estimation together as unknown information with a prior distribution. A shape evolution model and VBI are employed to address the shortcomings of the RMM. Through the VBI, we can derive the approximate variational posterior for the exact multi-target posterior. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of the method in real-world tracking scenarios, we present two potential lightweight schemes. The first is based on clustering, which effectively prunes the joint association events. The second is a simplification of the variational posterior through marginal association probabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using simulation experiments, and the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and adaptability. This manuscript is only a preprint version, a completer and more official version will be uploaded as soon as possible</description>

      <title>Can all variations within the unified mask-based beamformer framework achieve identical peak extraction performance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates mask-based beamformers (BFs), which estimate filters for target sound extraction (TSE) using time-frequency masks. Although multiple mask-based BFs have been proposed, no consensus has been established on the best one for target-extracting performance. Previously, we found that maximum signal-to-noise ratio and minimum mean square error (MSE) BFs can achieve the same extraction performance as the theoretical upper-bound performance, with each BF containing a different optimal mask. However, these remarkable findings left two issues unsolved: only two BFs were covered, excluding the minimum variance distortionless response BF; and ideal scaling (IS) was employed to ideally adjust the output scale, which is not applicable to realistic scenarios. To address these coverage and scaling issues, this study proposes a unified framework for mask-based BFs comprising two processes: filter estimation that can cover all BFs and scaling applicable to realistic scenarios by employing a mask to generate a scaling reference. We also propose a methodology to enumerate all possible BFs and derive 12 variations. Optimal masks for both processes are obtained by minimizing the MSE between the target and BF output. The experimental results using the CHiME-4 dataset suggested that 1) all 12 variations can achieve the theoretical upper-bound performance, and 2) mask-based scaling can behave as IS. These results can be explained by considering the practical parameter count of the masks. These findings contribute to 1) designing a TSE system, 2) estimating the extraction performance of a BF, and 3) improving scaling accuracy combined with mask-based scaling. The contributions also apply to TSE methods based on independent component analysis, as the unified framework covers them too.</description>

      <title>Addressing Out-of-Distribution Challenges in Image Semantic Communication Systems with Multi-modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication is a promising technology for next-generation wireless networks. However, the out-of-distribution (OOD) problem, where a pre-trained machine learning (ML) model is applied to unseen tasks that are outside the distribution of its training data, may compromise the integrity of semantic compression. This paper explores the use of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to address the OOD issue in image semantic communication. We propose a novel "Plan A - Plan B" framework that leverages the broad knowledge and strong generalization ability of an MLLM to assist a conventional ML model when the latter encounters an OOD input in the semantic encoding process. Furthermore, we propose a Bayesian optimization scheme that reshapes the probability distribution of the MLLM's inference process based on the contextual information of the image. The optimization scheme significantly enhances the MLLM's performance in semantic compression by 1) filtering out irrelevant vocabulary in the original MLLM output; and 2) using contextual similarities between prospective answers of the MLLM and the background information as prior knowledge to modify the MLLM's probability distribution during inference. Further, at the receiver side of the communication system, we put forth a "generate-criticize" framework that utilizes the cooperation of multiple MLLMs to enhance the reliability of image reconstruction.</description>

      <title>FAST-GSC: Fast and Adaptive Semantic Transmission for Generative Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapidly evolving field of generative artificial intelligence technology has introduced innovative approaches for developing semantic communication (SemCom) frameworks, leading to the emergence of a new paradigm-generative SemCom (GSC). However, the complex processes involved in semantic extraction and generative inference may result in considerable latency in resource-constrained scenarios. To tackle these issues, we introduce a new GSC framework that involves fast and adaptive semantic transmission (FAST-GSC). This framework incorporates one innovative communication mechanism and two enhancement strategies at the transmitter and receiver, respectively. Aiming to reduce task latency, our communication mechanism enables fast semantic transmission by parallelizing the processes of semantic extraction at the transmitter and inference at the receiver. Preliminary evaluations indicate that while this mechanism effectively reduces task latency, it could potentially compromise task performance. To address this issue, we propose two additional methods for enhancement. First, at the transmitter, we employ reinforcement learning to discern the intrinsic temporal dependencies among the semantic units and design their extraction and transmission sequence accordingly. Second, at the receiver, we design a semantic difference calculation module and propose a sequential conditional denoising approach to alleviate the stringent immediacy requirement for the reception of semantic features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed architecture achieves a performance score comparable to the conventional GSC architecture while realizing a 52% reduction in residual task latency that extends beyond the fixed inference duration.</description>

      <title>Uplink Transmit Power Optimization for Distributed Massive MIMO Systems with 1-Bit ADCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of uplink transmit power optimization in distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output systems, where remote radio heads (RRHs) are equipped with 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). First, in a scenario where a single RRH serves a single user equipment (UE), the signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) is shown to be a non-monotonic and unimodal function of the UE transmit power due to the quantization distortion (QD). Upon the introduction of multiple RRHs, adding properly tuned dithering at each RRH is shown to render the SNDR at the output of the joint receiver unimodal. In a scenario with multiple RRHs and UEs, considering the non-monotonic nature of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-and-distortion ratio (SINDR), both the UE transmit powers and the RRH dithering levels are jointly optimized subject to the min-power and max-min-SINDR criteria, while employing Bussgang-based maximum ratio combining (BMRC) and minimum mean squared error (BMMSE) receivers. To this end, gradient and block coordinate descent methods are introduced to tune the UE transmit powers, whereas a line search coupled with gradient updates is used to adjust the RRH dithering levels. Numerical results demonstrate that jointly optimizing the UE transmit power and the RRH dithering levels can significantly enhance the system performance, thus facilitating joint reception from multiple RRHs across a range of scenarios. Comparing the BMMSE and BMRC receivers, the former offers a better interference and QD alleviation while the latter has a lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna-Enhanced Wireless Communications: General Architectures and Implementation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs), traditionally explored in antenna design, have recently garnered significant attention in wireless communications due to their ability to dynamically adjust the antenna positions to changes in the propagation environment. However, previous research has primarily focused on characterizing the performance limits of various MA-assisted wireless communication systems, with less emphasis on their practical implementation. To address this gap, in this article, we propose several general MA architectures that extend existing designs by varying several key aspects to cater to different application scenarios and tradeoffs between cost and performance. Additionally, we draw from fields such as antenna design and mechanical control to provide an overview of candidate implementation methods for the proposed MA architectures, utilizing either direct mechanical or equivalent electronic control. Simulation results are finally presented to support our discussion.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive research on jamming attacks on wireless communication systems, the potential of machine learning for amplifying the threat of such attacks, or our ability to mitigate them, remains largely untapped. A key obstacle to such research has been the absence of a suitable framework. To resolve this obstacle, we release PyJama, a fully-differentiable open-source library that adds jamming and anti-jamming functionality to NVIDIA Sionna. We demonstrate the utility of PyJama (i) for realistic MIMO simulations by showing examples that involve forward error correction, OFDM waveforms in time and frequency, realistic channel models, and mobility; and (ii) for learning to jam. Specifically, we use stochastic gradient descent to optimize jamming power allocation over an OFDM resource grid. The learned strategies are non-trivial, intelligible, and effective.</description>

Abstract: As our cities become more intelligent and more connected with new technologies like 6G, improving communication between vehicles and infrastructure is essential while reducing energy consumption. This study proposes a secure framework for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) backscattering near an eavesdropping vehicle to maximize the sum secrecy rate of V2I backscatter communication over multiple coherence slots. This sustainable framework aims to jointly optimize the reflection coefficients at the backscattering vehicle, carrier emitter power, and artificial noise at the infrastructure, along with the target vehicle's linear trajectory in the presence of an eavesdropping vehicle in the parallel lane. To achieve this optimization, we separated the problem into three parts: backscattering coefficient, power allocation, and trajectory design problems. We respectively adopted parallel computing, fractional programming, and finding all the candidates for the global optimal solution to obtain the global optimal solution for these three problems. Our simulations verified the fast convergence of our alternating optimization algorithm and showed that our proposed secure V2I backscattering outperforms the existing benchmark by over 4.7 times in terms of secrecy rate for 50 slots. Overall, this fundamental research on V2I backscattering provided insights to improve vehicular communication's connectivity, efficiency, and security.</description>

      <title>Pulse Shaping for Random ISAC Signals: The Ambiguity Function Between Symbols Matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has emerged as a pivotal enabling technology for next-generation wireless networks. Despite the distinct signal design requirements of sensing and communication (S&amp;C) systems, shifting the symbol-wise pulse shaping (SWiPS) framework from communication-only systems to ISAC poses significant challenges in signal design and processing This paper addresses these challenges by examining the ambiguity function (AF) of the SWiPS ISAC signal and introducing a novel pulse shaping design for single-carrier ISAC transmission. We formulate optimization problems to minimize the average integrated sidelobe level (ISL) of the AF, as well as the weighted ISL (WISL) while satisfying inter-symbol interference (ISI), out-of-band emission (OOBE), and power constraints. Our contributions include establishing the relationship between the AFs of both the random data symbols and signaling pulses, analyzing the statistical characteristics of the AF, and developing algorithmic frameworks for pulse shaping optimization using successive convex approximation (SCA) and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approaches. Numerical results are provided to validate our theoretical analysis, which demonstrate significant performance improvements in the proposed SWiPS design compared to the root-raised cosine (RRC) pulse shaping for conventional communication systems.</description>

      <title>The Rlign Algorithm for Enhanced Electrocardiogram Analysis through R-Peak Alignment for Explainable Classification and Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings have long been vital in diagnosing different cardiac conditions. Recently, research in the field of automatic ECG processing using machine learning methods has gained importance, mainly by utilizing deep learning methods on raw ECG signals. A major advantage of models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is their ability to effectively process biomedical imaging or signal data. However, this strength is tempered by challenges related to their lack of explainability, the need for a large amount of training data, and the complexities involved in adapting them for unsupervised clustering tasks. In addressing these tasks, we aim to reintroduce shallow learning techniques, including support vector machines and principal components analysis, into ECG signal processing by leveraging their semi-structured, cyclic form. To this end, we developed and evaluated a transformation that effectively restructures ECG signals into a fully structured format, facilitating their subsequent analysis using shallow learning algorithms. In this study, we present this adaptive transformative approach that aligns R-peaks across all signals in a dataset and resamples the segments between R-peaks, both with and without heart rate dependencies. We illustrate the substantial benefit of this transformation for traditional analysis techniques in the areas of classification, clustering, and explainability, outperforming commercial software for median beat transformation and CNN approaches. Our approach demonstrates a significant advantage for shallow machine learning methods over CNNs, especially when dealing with limited training data. Additionally, we release a fully tested and publicly accessible code framework, providing a robust alignment pipeline to support future research, available at https://github.com/ imi-ms/rlign.</description>

      <title>On-the-fly spectral unmixing based on Kalman filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces an on-the-fly (i.e., online) linear unmixing method which is able to sequentially analyze spectral data acquired on a spectrum-by-spectrum basis. After deriving a sequential counterpart of the conventional linear mixing model, the proposed approach recasts the linear unmixing problem into a linear state-space estimation framework. Under Gaussian noise and state models, the estimation of the pure spectra can be efficiently conducted by resorting to Kalman filtering. Interestingly, it is shown that this Kalman filter can operate in a lower-dimensional subspace while ensuring the nonnegativity constraint inherent to pure spectra. This dimensionality reduction allows significantly lightening the computational burden, while leveraging recent advances related to the representation of essential spectral information. The proposed method is evaluated through extensive numerical experiments conducted on synthetic and real Raman data sets. The results show that this Kalman filter-based method offers a convenient trade-off between unmixing accuracy and computational efficiency, which is crucial for operating in an on-the-fly setting. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first operational method which is able to solve the spectral unmixing problem efficiently in a dynamic fashion. It also constitutes a valuable building block for benefiting from acquisition and processing frameworks recently proposed in the microscopy literature, which are motivated by practical issues such as reducing acquisition time and avoiding potential damages being inflicted to photosensitive samples.</description>

      <title>Mobile-to-Mobile Uncorrelated Scatter Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a complete analytic probability based description of mobile-to-mobile uncorrelated scatter channels. The correlation based description introduced by Bello and Matz is thus complemented by the presented probabilistic description leading to a common theoretical description of uncorrelated scatter channels. Furthermore, we introduce novel twodimensional hybrid characteristic probability density functions, which remain a probability density in one of the variables and a characteristic function in the other variable. Such a probability based description allows us to derive a mathematical model, in which the attenuation of the scattering components is inherently included in these two-dimensional functions. Therefore, there is no need to determine the path loss exponent. Additionally, the Doppler probability density function with the inclusion of the path loss leads to a concave function of the Doppler spectrum, which is quite different from the Jakes and Doppler spectra and can be directly parameterized by the velocity vectors and geometry of the scattering plane. Thus, knowing those parameters permits the theoretical computation of the Doppler spectra and temporal characteristic functions. Finally, we present a comparison between the computed probability based theoretical results and measurement data for a generic mobile-to-mobile channel. The agreement between the two shows the usefulness of the probability based description and confirms new shapes of the Doppler power spectra.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Distributed Beamforming Using High-Accuracy Synchronization and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-node, multi-objective open-loop microwave distributed beamforming system based on high-accuracy wireless synchronization and localization. Distributed beamforming requires accurate coordination of the spatial and electrical states of the individual elements within the array to achieve and maintain coherent beamforming at intended destinations. Of the basic coordination aspects, time synchronization and localization of the elements are among the most critical to support beamforming of modulated waveforms to destinations in both the near-field and far-field of the array. In this work, we demonstrate multi-objective distributed beamforming from a three-node distributed phased array consisting of software-defined radios that leverages high-accuracy wireless time coordination for both time synchronization and two-dimensional localization of the elements. We use a spectrally-sparse two-tone waveform for high-accuracy inter-node range estimation combined with a linear-frequency modulated waveform to mitigate multipath interference. Localization is performed in a centralized format, where one node is designated as the origin and the remaining nodes build the array geometry relative to the origin, from which we obtain localization accuracy of less than 1 cm. We implement a near-field multi-objective beamformer based on the location estimates, which enables the simultaneous steering of a beam and a null to two receiving antennas. Multi-objective beamforming of pulsed waveforms at a carrier frequency of 2.1 GHz is demonstrated in cases where one of the nodes in the distributed antenna array is moved, and where the targets (the two receiving antennas) are moved.</description>

      <title>Metasurface Energy Harvesters: State-of-the-Art Designs and Their Potential for Energy Sustainable Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurface Energy Harvesters (MEHs) have emerged as a prominent enabler of highly efficient Radio Frequency (RF) energy harvesters. This survey delves into the fundamentals of the MEH technology, providing a comprehensive overview of their working principle, unit cell designs and prototypes over various frequency bands, as well as state-of-the art modes of operation. Inspired by the recent academic and industrial interest on Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs)for the upcoming sixth-Generation (6G) of wireless networks, we study the interplay between this technology and MEHs aiming for energy sustainable RISs power by metasurface-based RF energy harvesting. We present a novel hybrid unit cell design capable of simultaneous energy harvesting and 1-bit tunable reflection whose dual-functional response is validated via full-wave simulations. Then, we conduct a comparative collection of real-world measurements for ambient RF power levels and power consumption budgets of reflective RISs to unveil the potential for a self-sustainable RIS via ambient RF energy harvesting. The paper is concluded with an elaborative discussion on open design challenges and future research directions for MEHs and energy sustainable hybrid RISs.</description>

      <title>A Minibatch Alternating Projections Algorithm for Robust and Efficient Magnitude Least-Squares RF Pulse Design in MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A magnitude-least-squares radiofrequency pulse design algorithm is reported which uses interleaved exact and stochastically-generated inexact updates to escape local minima and find low-cost solutions. Inexact updates are performed using a small randomly selected minibatch of the available B1+ measurements to update RF pulse weights, which perturbs the sequence of alternating projections. Applications to RF shimming, parallel transmit spokes RF pulse design, and spectral-spatial RF pulse design are considered. Numerical and simulation studies characterized the optimal minibatch size, which was found to consistently produce lower power and lower RMSE solutions across subjects, coil geometries, B1+ resolutions and orientations. The method was validated in-vivo at 7 Tesla and produced improvements in image quality in a slice-by-slice RF-shimmed imaging sequence. Compared to conventional methods, the pulse design method can more robustly design RF pulses that correct for B1+ inhomogeneities at ultra-high field strengths, and enable pulse designs to be completed with increased computational efficiency</description>

      <title>Towards Realistic Emotional Voice Conversion using Controllable Emotional Intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realistic emotional voice conversion (EVC) aims to enhance emotional diversity of converted audios, making the synthesized voices more authentic and natural. To this end, we propose Emotional Intensity-aware Network (EINet), dynamically adjusting intonation and rhythm by incorporating controllable emotional intensity. To better capture nuances in emotional intensity, we go beyond mere distance measurements among acoustic features. Instead, an emotion evaluator is utilized to precisely quantify speaker's emotional state. By employing an intensity mapper, intensity pseudo-labels are obtained to bridge the gap between emotional speech intensity modeling and run-time conversion. To ensure high speech quality while retaining controllability, an emotion renderer is used for combining linguistic features smoothly with manipulated emotional features at frame level. Furthermore, we employ a duration predictor to facilitate adaptive prediction of rhythm changes condition on specifying intensity value. Experimental results show EINet's superior performance in naturalness and diversity of emotional expression compared to state-of-the-art EVC methods.</description>

      <title>Unified Far-Field and Near-Field in Holographic MIMO: A Wavenumber-Domain Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article conceives a unified representation for near-field and far-field holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) channels, addressing a practical design dilemma: "Why does the angular-domain representation no longer function effectively?" To answer this question, we pivot from the angular domain to the wavenumber domain and present a succinct overview of its underlying philosophy. In re-examining the Fourier plane-wave series expansion that recasts spherical propagation waves into a series of plane waves represented by Fourier harmonics, we characterize the HMIMO channel employing these Fourier harmonics having different wavenumbers. This approach, referred to as the wavenumebr-domain representation, facilitates a unified view across the far-field and the near-field. Furthermore, the limitations of the DFT basis are demonstrated when identifying the sparsity inherent to the HMIMO channel, motivating the development of a wavenumber-domain basis as an alternative. We then present some preliminary applications of the proposed wavenumber-domain basis in signal processing across both the far-field and near-field, along with several prospects for future HMIMO system designs based on the wavenumber domain.</description>

      <title>A Convex-Nonconvex Framework for Enhancing Minimization Induced Penalties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for nonconvex enhancement of minimization induced (MI) penalties while preserving the overall convexity of associated regularization models. MI penalties enable the adaptation to certain signal structures via minimization, but often underestimate significant components owing to convexity. To overcome this shortcoming, we design a generalized Moreau enhanced minimization induced (GME-MI) penalty by subtracting from the MI penalty its generalized Moreau envelope. While the proposed GME-MI penalty is nonconvex in general, we derive an overall convexity condition for the GME-MI regularized least-squares model. Moreover, we present a proximal splitting algorithm with guaranteed convergence to a globally optimal solution of the GME-MI model under the overall convexity condition. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>TADA: Temporal Adversarial Data Augmentation for Time Series Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain generalization involves training machine learning models to perform robustly on unseen samples from out-of-distribution datasets. Adversarial Data Augmentation (ADA) is a commonly used approach that enhances model adaptability by incorporating synthetic samples, designed to simulate potential unseen samples. While ADA effectively addresses amplitude-related distribution shifts, it falls short in managing temporal shifts, which are essential for time series data. To address this limitation, we propose the Temporal Adversarial Data Augmentation for time teries Data (TADA), which incorporates a time warping technique specifically targeting temporal shifts. Recognizing the challenge of non-differentiability in traditional time warping, we make it differentiable by leveraging phase shifts in the frequency domain. Our evaluations across diverse domains demonstrate that TADA significantly outperforms existing ADA variants, enhancing model performance across time series datasets with varied distributions.</description>

      <title>Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) in Low Altitude Platforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the problem of utilizing Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) technology in Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), with a particular focus on aerial access networks. We consider an Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based wireless network comprised of two layers of UAVs: (a) a lower layer consisting a number of flying users and a UAV Base Station (BS) that provides coverage for terrestrial users and, (b) an upper layer designated to provide both wireless access for flying users and backhaul connectivity for UAV BS. By adopting IAB technology, the backhaul and access links collaboratively share their resources, enabling aerial backhauling and the utilization of the same infrastructure and frequency resources for access links. A sum-rate maximization problem is formulated by considering aerial backhaul constraints to optimally allocate the frequency spectrum between aerial and terrestrial networks. We decompose the resulting non-convex optimization problem into two sub-problems of beamforming and spectrum allocation and then propose efficient solutions for each. Numerical results in different scenarios yield insightful findings about the effectiveness of using the IAB technique in aerial networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is recognized as one of the key enabling technologies for sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication networks, facilitating diverse emerging applications and services in an energy and cost-efficient manner. This paper proposes a multi-user multi-target ISAC system to enable full-space coverage for communication and sensing tasks. The proposed system employs a hybrid simultaneous transmission and reflection reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) comprising active transmissive and passive reflective elements. In the proposed scheme, the passive reflective elements support communication and sensing links for nearby communication users and sensing targets, while low-power active transmissive elements are deployed to improve sensing performance and overcome high path attenuation due to multi-hop transmission for remote targets. Moreover, to optimize the transmissive/reflective coefficients of the hybrid STAR-RIS, a semi-definite relaxation (SDR)-based algorithm is proposed. Furthermore, to evaluate sensing performance, signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) and Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) metrics have been derived and investigated via conducting extensive computer simulations.</description>

      <title>DSP-informed bandwidth extension using locally-conditioned excitation and linear time-varying filter subnetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a dual-stage architecture for bandwidth extension (BWE) increasing the effective sampling rate of speech signals from 8 kHz to 48 kHz. Unlike existing end-to-end deep learning models, our proposed method explicitly models BWE using excitation and linear time-varying (LTV) filter stages. The excitation stage broadens the spectrum of the input, while the filtering stage properly shapes it based on outputs from an acoustic feature predictor. To this end, an acoustic feature loss term can implicitly promote the excitation subnetwork to produce white spectra in the upper frequency band to be synthesized. Experimental results demonstrate that the added inductive bias provided by our approach can improve upon BWE results using the generators from both SEANet or HiFi-GAN as exciters, and that our means of adapting processing with acoustic feature predictions is more effective than that used in HiFi-GAN-2. Secondary contributions include extensions of the SEANet model to accommodate local conditioning information, as well as the application of HiFi-GAN-2 for the BWE problem.</description>

      <title>Self-Sustainable Metasurface-Assisted mmWave Indoor Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the design of a metasurface-assisted system for indoor environments, it is essential to take into account not only the performance gains and coverage extension provided by the metasurface but also the operating costs brought by its reconfigurability, such as powering and cabling. These costs can present challenges, particularly in indoor dense spaces (IDSs). A self-sustainable metasurface (SSM), which retains reconfigurability unlike a static metasurface (SMS), achieves a lower operating cost than a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) by being self-sustainable through power harvesting. In this paper, in order to find a better trade-off between metasurface gain, coverage, and operating cost, the design and performance of an SSM-assisted indoor mmWave communication system are investigated. We first simplify the design of the SSM-assisted system by considering the use of SSMs in a preset-based manner and the formation of coverage groups by associating SSMs with the closest user equipments (UEs). We propose a two-stage iterative algorithm to maximize the minimum data rate in the system by jointly deciding the association between the UEs and the SSMs, the phase-shifts of the SSMs, and allocating time resources for each UE. The non-convexities that exist in the proposed optimization problem are tackled using the feasible point pursuit successive convex approximation method and the concave-convex procedure. To understand the best scenario for using SSM, the resulting performance is compared with that achieved with RIS and SMS. Our numerical results indicate that SSMs are best utilized in a small environment where self-sustainability is easier to achieve when the budget for operating costs is tight.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Achievable DoF Bounds for Cache-Aided MIMO Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating coded caching (CC) into multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications may significantly enhance the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) of the wireless networks. In this paper, we consider a cache-aided MIMO configuration with a CC gain $t$, where a server with $L$ Tx antennas communicates with $K$ users, each with $G$ Rx antennas. In the proposed content-aware MIMO strategy, we carefully adjust the number of users $\Omega$ and the number of parallel streams decoded by each user $\beta$ served in each transmission to maximize the DoF. As a result, we achieve a DoF of ${\max_{\beta, \Omega }}{\Omega \beta}$, where ${\beta \le \mathrm{min}\big(G,\frac{L \binom{\Omega-1}{t}}{1 + (\Omega - t-1)\binom{\Omega-1}{t}}\big)}$. To prove the achievability of the proposed DoF bound, we provide a novel transmission strategy based on the simultaneous unicasting of multiple data streams. In this strategy, the missing data packets are scheduled such that the number of parallel streams per transmission is maximized while the decodability of all useful terms by each target user is guaranteed. Numerical simulations validate the findings, confirming the enhanced DoF and improved performance of the proposed design.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Speech Separation Models for Similar-pitch Speakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-channel speech separation is a crucial task for enhancing speech recognition systems in multi-speaker environments. This paper investigates the robustness of state-of-the-art Neural Network models in scenarios where the pitch differences between speakers are minimal. Building on earlier findings by Ditter and Gerkmann, which identified a significant performance drop for the 2018 Chimera++ under similar-pitch conditions, our study extends the analysis to more recent and sophisticated Neural Network models. Our experiments reveal that modern models have substantially reduced the performance gap for matched training and testing conditions. However, a substantial performance gap persists under mismatched conditions, with models performing well for large pitch differences but showing worse performance if the speakers' pitches are similar. These findings motivate further research into the generalizability of speech separation models to similar-pitch speakers and unseen data.</description>

      <title>Broad and Spectral-Efficient Beamforming for the Uni-polarized Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is composed of low-cost elements that manipulate the propagation environment from a transmitter by intelligently applying phase shifts to incoming signals before they are reflected. This paper explores a uni-polarized RIS with linear shape aimed at transmitting a common signal to multiple user equipments (UEs) spread across a wide angular region. To achieve uniform coverage, the uni-polarized RIS is designed to emit a broad and spectral-efficient beam featuring a spatially flat-like array factor, diverging from the conventional narrow beam approach. To achieve this objective, we start by deriving probabilistic lower and upper bounds for the average spectral efficiency (SE) delivered to the UEs. Leveraging the insights from the lower bound, we focus on optimizing the minimum value of the power domain array factor (PDAF) across a range of azimuth angles from \(-\frac{\pi}{2}\) to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). We employ the continuous genetic algorithm (CGA) for this optimization task, aiming to improve the SE delivered to the UEs while also creating a wide beam. Extensive simulation experiments are carried out to assess the performance of the proposed code, focusing on key metrics such as the minimum and average values of the PDAF and the SE delivered to the UEs. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed code enhances the minimum SE delivered to the UEs while maintaining the desired attribute of a broad beam. This performance is notably superior to that of established codes, including the Barker, Frank, and Chu codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a promising technology in wireless communications. Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RISs) in particular have garnered significant attention due to their dual capabilities of simultaneous transmission and reflection, underscoring their potential applications in critical scenarios within the forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) technology landscape. Moreover, full-duplex (FD) systems have emerged as a breakthrough research direction in wireless transmission technology due to their high spectral efficiency. This paper explores the application potential of STAR-RIS in FD systems for future wireless communications, presenting an innovative technology that provides robust self-interference cancellation (SIC) capabilities for FD systems. We utilize the refraction functionality of STAR-RIS enhances the transmission capacity of FD systems, while its reflection functionality is used to eliminate self interference within the FD system. We delve into the applications of two different types of STAR-RIS in FD systems and compare their performance through simulations. Furthermore, we discuss the performance differences of STAR-RIS empowered FD systems under various configurations in a case study, and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed deep learning-based optimization algorithm. Finally, we discuss possible future research directions for STAR-RIS empowered FD systems.</description>

      <title>A Finger on the Pulse of Cardiovascular: Estimating Blood Pressure with Smartphone Photoplethysmography-Based Pulse Waveform Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing mobile phone cameras for continuous blood pressure(BP) monitoring presents a cost-effective and accessible approach, yet it is challenged by limitations in accuracy and interpretability. This study introduces four innovative strategies to enhance smartphone-based photoplethysmography for BP estimation(SPW-BP), addressing the interpretability-accuracy dilemma: First, we employ often-neglected data quality improvement techniques, such as height normalization, corrupt data removal, and boundary signal reconstruction; second, we conduct an in-depth analysis of over twenty waveform indicators across three categories to identify the most predictive features; third, we employ SHapley Additive exPlanations(SHAP) analysis to ensure the transparency and explainability of machine learning outcomes; and fourth, we utilize Bland-Altman analysis alongside AAMI and BHS standards for comparative evaluation. Analysis of data from 127 participants demonstrated a significant correlation between smartphone-captured waveform features and those from standard BP monitoring devices. Employing multiple linear regression within a cross-validation framework, waveform variables predicted systolic blood pressure(SBP) with a mean absolute error(MAE) of 9.86 6.78 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure(DBP) with an MAE of 8.01 5.15 mmHg. Further application of Random Forest models significantly improved the prediction MAE for SBP to 8.91 6.30 mmHg and for DBP to 6.68 4.54 mmHg, indicating enhanced predictive accuracy. Correlation and SHAP analysis identified key features for improving BP estimation. However, Bland-Altman analysis revealed systematic biases, and MAE analysis showed that the results did not meet AAMI and BHS accuracy standards. Our findings highlight the potential of SPW-BP, yet suggest that smartphone PPG technology is not yet a viable alternative to traditional medical devices for BP measurement.</description>

      <title>Variational Bayesian Learning based Joint Localization and Path Loss Exponent with Distance-dependent Noise in Wireless Sensor Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the challenge of jointly optimizing location and path loss exponent (PLE) in distance-dependent noise. Departing from the conventional independent noise model used in localization and path loss exponent estimation problems, we consider a more realistic model incorporating distance-dependent noise variance, as revealed in recent theoretical analyses and experimental results. The distance-dependent noise introduces a complex noise model with unknown noise power and PLE, resulting in an exceptionally challenging non-convex and nonlinear optimization problem. In this study, we address a joint localization and path loss exponent estimation problem encompassing distance-dependent noise, unknown parameters, and uncertainties in sensor node locations. To surmount the intractable nonlinear and non-convex objective function inherent in the problem, we introduce a variational Bayesian learning-based framework that enables the joint optimization of localization, path loss exponent, and reference noise parameters by leveraging an effective approximation to the true posterior distribution. Furthermore, the proposed joint learning algorithm provides an iterative closed-form solution and exhibits superior performance in terms of computational complexity compared to existing algorithms. Computer simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm approaches the performance of the Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound (BCRB), achieves localization performance comparable to the (maximum likelihood-Gaussian message passing) ML-GMP algorithm in some cases, and outperforms the other comparison algorithm in all cases.</description>

      <title>Physics-compliant diagonal representation of beyond-diagonal RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-compliant models of RIS-parametrized channels assign a load-terminated port to each RIS element. For conventional diagonal RIS (D-RIS), each auxiliary port is terminated by its own independent and individually tunable load (i.e., independent of the other auxiliary ports). For beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), the auxiliary ports are terminated by a tunable load circuit which couples the auxiliary ports to each other. Here, we point out that a physics-compliant model of the load circuit of a BD-RIS takes the same form as a physics-compliant model of a D-RIS-parametrized radio environment: a multi-port network with a subset of ports terminated by individually tunable loads (independent of each other). Consequently, we recognize that a BD-RIS-parametrized radio environment can be understood as a multi-port cascade network (i.e., the cascade of radio environment with load circuit) terminated by individually tunable loads (independent of each other). Hence, the BD-RIS problem can be mapped into the original D-RIS problem by replacing the radio environment with the cascade of radio environment and load circuit. The insight that BD-RIS can be physics-compliantly analyzed with the conventional D-RIS formalism implies that (i) the same optimization protocols as for D-RIS can be used for the BD-RIS case, and (ii) it is unclear if existing comparisons between BD-RIS and D-RIS are fair because for a fixed number of RIS elements, a BD-RIS has usually more tunable lumped elements.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication for Cooperative Multi-Task Processing over Wireless Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08483v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigated semantic communication for multi-task processing using an information-theoretic approach. We introduced the concept of a "semantic source", allowing multiple semantic interpretations from a single observation. We formulated an end-to-end optimization problem taking into account the communication channel, maximizing mutual information (infomax) to design the semantic encoding and decoding process exploiting the statistical relations between semantic variables. To solve the problem we perform data-driven deep learning employing variational approximation techniques. Our semantic encoder is divided into a common unit and multiple specific units to facilitate cooperative multi-task processing. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed semantic source and system design when statistical relationships exist, comparing cooperative task processing with independent task processing. However, our findings highlight that cooperative multi-tasking is not always beneficial, emphasizing the importance of statistical relationships between tasks and indicating the need for further investigation into the semantically processing of multiple tasks.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Non-Orthogonal Unicast Multicast: An Experimental Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal unicast multicast (NOUM) is a variant of multi-antenna multi-user communications where the users desire a shared message (multicast) in addition to their respective unique messages (unicast). The multicast rate is capped in many emerging NOUM applications, such as live-event broadcasting, location-based services and vehicular communications. Given this constraint, we experimentally show that when the user channels are highly correlated, Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA)-based NOUM can meet the multicast rate while supporting a larger unicast sum rate than multi-user linear precoding (MULP)-based NOUM and orthogonal unicast multicast.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a movable-antenna (MA) array empowered integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) over low-altitude platform (LAP) system to support low-altitude economy (LAE) applications. In the considered system, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is dispatched to hover in the air, working as the UAV-enabled LAP (ULAP) to provide information transmission and sensing simultaneously for LAE applications. To improve the throughput capacity and meet the requirement of the sensing beampattern threshold, we formulate a data rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit information and sensing beamforming, and the antenna positions of the MA array. Since the data rate maximization problem is non-convex with highly coupled variables, we propose an efficient alternation optimization based algorithm, which iteratively optimizes parts of the variables while fixing the others. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed MA array-based scheme in terms of the achievable data rate and beamforming gain compared with two benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Rational-Exponent Filters with Applications to Generalized Auditory Filterbanks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present filters with rational exponents in order to provide a continuum of filter behavior not classically achievable. We discuss their stability, the flexibility they afford, and various representations useful for analysis, design and implementations. We do this for a generalization of second order filters which we refer to as rational-exponent Generalized Auditory Filters/Filterbanks (GAFs) that are useful for a diverse array of applications. We present equivalent representations for rational-order GAFs in the time and frequency domains: transfer functions, impulse responses, and integral expressions - the last of which allows for efficient real-time processing without preprocessing requirements. Rational-exponent filters enable filter characteristics to be on a continuum rather than limiting them to discrete values thereby resulting in greater flexibility in the behavior of these filters. In the case of GAFs, this allows for having arbitrary continuous rather than discrete values for filter characteristics such as (1) the ratio of 3dB quality factor to maximum group delay - particularly important for filterbanks which have simultaneous requirements on frequency selectivity and synchronization; and (2) the ratio of 3dB to 15dB quality factors that dictates the shape of the frequency response magnitude.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem Using the Koopman Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of signal processing, the sampling theorem plays a fundamental role for signal reconstruction as it bridges the gap between analog and digital signals. Following the celebrated Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, generalizing the sampling theorem to non-band-limited signals remains a major challenge. In this work, a generalized sampling theorem, which builds upon the Koopman operator, is proposed for signals in a generator-bounded space. It naturally extends the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem in that: 1) for band-limited signals, the lower bounds of the sampling frequency and the reconstruction formulas given by these two theorems are exactly the same; 2) the Koopman operator-based sampling theorem can also provide a finite bound of the sampling frequency and a reconstruction formula for certain types of non-band-limited signals, which cannot be addressed by Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. These non-band-limited signals include, but are not limited to, the inverse Laplace transform with limit imaginary interval of integration, and linear combinations of complex exponential functions. Furthermore, the Koopman operator-based reconstruction method is supported by theoretical results on its convergence. This method is illustrated numerically through several examples, demonstrating its robustness against low sampling frequencies.</description>

Abstract: Predicting the performance of traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) based on nonlinear elements like superconducting Josephson junctions (JJs) is vital for qubit read-out in quantum computers. The purpose of this article is twofold: (a) to demonstrate how nonlinear inductors based on combinations of JJs can be modeled in commercial circuit simulators, and (b) to show how the harmonic balance (HB) is used in the reliable prediction of the amplifier performance e.g., gain and pump harmonic power conversion. Experimental characterization of two types of TWPA architectures is compared with simulations to showcase the reliability of the HB method. We disseminate the modeling know-how and techniques to new designers of parametric amplifiers.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of signal estimation in a generalized linear model (GLM). GLMs include many canonical problems in statistical estimation, such as linear regression, phase retrieval, and 1-bit compressed sensing. Recent work has precisely characterized the asymptotic minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) for GLMs with i.i.d. Gaussian sensing matrices. However, in many models there is a significant gap between the MMSE and the performance of the best known feasible estimators. In this work, we address this issue by considering GLMs defined via spatially coupled sensing matrices. We propose an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for estimation and prove that with a simple choice of spatially coupled design, the MSE of a carefully tuned AMP estimator approaches the asymptotic MMSE in the high-dimensional limit. To prove the result, we first rigorously characterize the asymptotic performance of AMP for a GLM with a generic spatially coupled design. This characterization is in terms of a deterministic recursion (`state evolution') that depends on the parameters defining the spatial coupling. Then, using a simple spatially coupled design and a judicious choice of functions for the AMP algorithm, we analyze the fixed points of the resulting state evolution and show that it achieves the asymptotic MMSE. Numerical results for phase retrieval and rectified linear regression show that spatially coupled designs can yield substantially lower MSE than i.i.d. Gaussian designs at finite dimensions when used with AMP algorithms.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-aware transfer across tasks using hybrid model-based successor feature reinforcement learning</title>

Abstract: Sample efficiency is central to developing practical reinforcement learning (RL) for complex and large-scale decision-making problems. The ability to transfer and generalize knowledge gained from previous experiences to downstream tasks can significantly improve sample efficiency. Recent research indicates that successor feature (SF) RL algorithms enable knowledge generalization between tasks with different rewards but identical transition dynamics. It has recently been hypothesized that combining model-based (MB) methods with SF algorithms can alleviate the limitation of fixed transition dynamics. Furthermore, uncertainty-aware exploration is widely recognized as another appealing approach for improving sample efficiency. Putting together two ideas of hybrid model-based successor feature (MB-SF) and uncertainty leads to an approach to the problem of sample efficient uncertainty-aware knowledge transfer across tasks with different transition dynamics or/and reward functions. In this paper, the uncertainty of the value of each action is approximated by a Kalman filter (KF)-based multiple-model adaptive estimation. This KF-based framework treats the parameters of a model as random variables. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at formulating a hybrid MB-SF algorithm capable of generalizing knowledge across large or continuous state space tasks with various transition dynamics while requiring less computation at decision time than MB methods. The number of samples required to learn the tasks was compared to recent SF and MB baselines. The results show that our algorithm generalizes its knowledge across different transition dynamics, learns downstream tasks with significantly fewer samples than starting from scratch, and outperforms existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Kalman Filtering Meets Gaussian Process SSM for Non-Mean-Field and Online Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05910v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) represent a versatile class of data-driven nonlinear dynamical system models. However, the presence of numerous latent variables in GPSSM incurs unresolved issues for existing variational inference approaches, particularly under the more realistic non-mean-field (NMF) assumption, including extensive training effort, compromised inference accuracy, and infeasibility for online applications, among others. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by incorporating the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), a well-established model-based filtering technique, into the NMF variational inference framework to approximate the posterior distribution of the latent states. This novel marriage between EnKF and GPSSM not only eliminates the need for extensive parameterization in learning variational distributions, but also enables an interpretable, closed-form approximation of the evidence lower bound (ELBO). Moreover, owing to the streamlined parameterization via the EnKF, the new GPSSM model can be easily accommodated in online learning applications. We demonstrate that the resulting EnKF-aided online algorithm embodies a principled objective function by ensuring data-fitting accuracy while incorporating model regularizations to mitigate overfitting. We also provide detailed analysis and fresh insights for the proposed algorithms. Comprehensive evaluation across diverse real and synthetic datasets corroborates the superior learning and inference performance of our EnKF-aided variational inference algorithms compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Face-Masked Speech Enhancement Using Generative Adversarial Networks With Human-in-the-Loop Assessment Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01939</link>

Abstract: The utilization of face masks is an essential healthcare measure, particularly during times of pandemics, yet it can present challenges in communication in our daily lives. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach known as the human-in-the-loop StarGAN (HL-StarGAN) face-masked speech enhancement method. HL-StarGAN comprises discriminator, classifier, metric assessment predictor, and generator that leverages an attention mechanism. The metric assessment predictor, referred to as MaskQSS, incorporates human participants in its development and serves as a "human-in-the-loop" module during the learning process of HL-StarGAN. The overall HL-StarGAN model was trained using an unsupervised learning strategy that simultaneously focuses on the reconstruction of the original clean speech and the optimization of human perception. To implement HL-StarGAN, we curated a face-masked speech database named "FMVD," which comprises recordings from 34 speakers in three distinct face-masked scenarios and a clean condition. We conducted subjective and objective tests on the proposed HL-StarGAN using this database. The outcomes of the test results are as follows: (1) MaskQSS successfully predicted the quality scores of face mask voices, outperforming several existing speech assessment methods. (2) The integration of the MaskQSS predictor enhanced the ability of HL-StarGAN to transform face mask voices into high-quality speech; this enhancement is evident in both objective and subjective tests, outperforming conventional StarGAN and CycleGAN-based systems.</description>

      <title>Snail-Radar: A large-scale diverse dataset for the evaluation of 4D-radar-based SLAM systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 4D radars are increasingly favored for odometry and mapping of autonomous systems due to their robustness in harsh weather and dynamic environments. Existing datasets, however, often cover limited areas and are typically captured using a single platform. To address this gap, we present a diverse large-scale dataset specifically designed for 4D radar-based localization and mapping. This dataset was gathered using three different platforms: a handheld device, an e-bike, and an SUV, under a variety of environmental conditions, including clear days, nighttime, and heavy rain. The data collection occurred from September 2023 to February 2024, encompassing diverse settings such as roads in a vegetated campus and tunnels on highways. Each route was traversed multiple times to facilitate place recognition evaluations. The sensor suite included a 3D lidar, 4D radars, stereo cameras, consumer-grade IMUs, and a GNSS/INS system. Sensor data packets were synchronized to GNSS time using a two-step process: a convex hull algorithm was applied to smooth host time jitter, and then odometry and correlation algorithms were used to correct constant time offsets. Extrinsic calibration between sensors was achieved through manual measurements and subsequent nonlinear optimization. The reference motion for the platforms was generated by registering lidar scans to a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) point cloud map using a lidar inertial odometry (LIO) method in localization mode. Additionally, a data reversion technique was introduced to enable backward LIO processing. We believe this dataset will boost research in radar-based point cloud registration, odometry, mapping, and place recognition.</description>
