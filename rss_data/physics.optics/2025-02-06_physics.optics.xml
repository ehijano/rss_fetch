      <title>Strong Long-Wave Infrared Optical Response in a Topological Semiconductor with a Mexican Hat Band Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light sources and photodetectors operating in the far- to mid-infrared (FIR/MIR) band ($8$-$12~\rm \mu m$, $0.1$-$0.15~\rm eV$) remain relatively poorly developed compared to their counterparts operating in the visible and near-infrared ranges, despite extensive application potential for thermal imaging, standoff sensing, and other technologies. This is attributable in part to the lack of narrow-gap materials ($&lt;0.1~\rm eV$) with high optical gain and absorption. In this work, a narrow-gap semiconductor, $\rm Pb_{0.7}Sn_{0.3}Se$, is demonstrated to exhibit an optical response $&gt;10\times$ larger than that of $\rm Hg_{x}Cd_{1-x}Te$ (MCT), the dominant material for FIR/MIR photodetectors. A previous theoretical investigation indicated that chalcogen $p$ and metal $d$ band inversion in this material creates a Mexican hat band structure (MHBS), which results in a dramatic increase in the joint density of states at the optical transition edge compared to typical semiconductors. This prediction is experimentally validated here using single-crystal specimens of $\rm Pb_{0.7}Sn_{0.3}Se$ measured using temperature-dependent spectroscopic ellipsometry over a wavelength range of $1.7$-$20~\rm \mu m$ ($0.73$-$0.062~\rm eV$). These measurements demonstrate a large enhancement in extinction coefficient and refractive index characteristic of a MHBS in the vicinity of the absorption edge, in agreement with theoretical predictions. The realization of topological semiconductors with a MHBS is expected to lead to high-efficiency detectors operating in the FIR/MID range.</description>

      <title>Experimental generation of optimally chiral azimuthally-radially polarized beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement a paraxial azimuthally-radially polarized beam (ARPB), a novel class of structured light beams that can be optimal chiral (OC), leading to maximum chirality density at a given energy density. By using vectorial light shaping techniques, we successfully generated a paraxial ARPB with precise control over its features, validating theoretical predictions. Our findings demonstrate the ability to finely adjust the chirality density of the ARPB across its entire range by manipulating a single beam parameter. Although our experimental investigations are primarily focused on the transverse plane, we show that fields whose transverse components satisfy the optimal chirality condition are optimally chiral in all directions, and our results highlight the promising potential of OC structured light for applications in the sensing and manipulation of chiral particles. We show that optical chirality is more general than the concept of handedness. This work represents a significant advancement toward practical optical enantioseparation and enantiomer detection at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Tunable Tamm plasmon polariton based planar hot-electron photodetector from O- to U- telecommunication band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing tunable photodetectors that can operate over a wide range of wavelengths and integrating them into integrated circuits is a significant challenge in today's technology. These devices must be miniaturized, inexpensive, and easily manufactured. To address this challenge, we propose the development of a tunable planar hot-electron photodetector based on Tamm plasmon polariton. The tuning of the operational wavelength is achieved by incorporation of a material with a phase transition, Sb2S3, into Tamm plasmon polariton based structure. This allows for tuning of the detection wavelength over a broad range, encompassing all bands of the telecommunications spectrum.</description>

      <title>A High-resolution Microcavity Transmission Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral analysis is one of the most powerful tools for studying and understanding matter. Traditional mode-locked optical frequency combs, which feature broad spectra and low repetition rates, have enabled high-precision absorption measurements through dual-comb techniques. These combs have found applications in trace gas detection, spectral imaging, and isotope analysis. However, their complexity, bulkiness, and large size limit their use outside laboratories. In contrast, low-noise optical frequency combs generated by optical micro-resonators offer significant potential advantages for spectroscopy due to their chip-scale size and lightweight design. We present a microcavity-based transmission spectrometer using a single silicon nitride microcavity soliton, achieving a 4 THz bandwidth with 200 kHz resolution. This system combines the stable dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) comb from a silicon nitride micro-resonator with the dual-sideband scanning from an intensity electro-optic modulator (EOM), transferring sub-Hz RF precision to the optical domain. The resulting frequency-modulated (FM) comb inherits the high precision of the RF domain, with optical accuracy dominated by the pump laser and repetition rate stability. The DKS comb allows independent locking of the pump laser and repetition rate, facilitating ultra-precise FM comb generation. The frequency-modulated comb is then imaged onto a 2D CCD array using a VIPA in tandem with a diffraction grating, enabling the recording of a composite spectrum during scanning. It is anticipated that using an ultra-narrow linewidth laser locked to an ultra-stable cavity as the pump source could enable Hz-level precision and stability. Given the integration advantages of the key components in this approach, it holds significant potential for future miniaturization, offering vast possibilities for compact, high-precision spectroscopic measurements.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical refractive index measurements of pure water via Z-scan technique at 800 nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determination of the nonlinear optical coefficient \( n_2 \) of pure water is of great interest for applications such as imaging biological systems, performing femtosecond laser surgery, and underwater ablation. Traditionally, probing third-order nonlinearity while eliminating the thermo-optic effect requires high pulse energy and low repetition rate laser sources. In this article, a low-cost, simple, and versatile third-order nonlinear characterization technique for the Z-scan closed-aperture mode has been developed to determine the nonlinear refractive index of pure water at 800 nm, with a pump duration of 140 fs and a repetition rate of 80 MHz. Experimental results reveal an \( n_2 \) value of \( (8 \pm 1.4) \times 10^{-20} \) m\(^2\)/W. The influence of higher-order nonlinearities such as \( \chi^5 \) was assessed, showing no significant contribution within the examined intensity range. This work paves the way for the use of low-power and high-repetition-rate systems for characterizing third-order nonlinear optical materials.</description>

      <title>Universal Kerr-thermal dynamics of self-injection-locked microresonator dark pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microcombs, formed in optical microresonators driven by continuous-wave lasers, are miniaturized optical frequency combs with small size, weight and power consumption. Leveraging integrated photonics and laser self-injection locking (SIL), compact and robust microcombs can be constructed via hybrid integration of a semiconductor laser with a chip-based microresonator. While the current linear SIL theory has successfully addressed the linear coupling between the laser cavity and the external microresonator, it fails to manage the complicated nonlinear processes, especially regarding to dark-pulse microcomb formation. Here, we investigate -- theoretically, numerically and experimentally -- the Kerr-thermal dynamics of a semiconductor laser self-injection-locked to an integrated silicon nitride microresonator. We unveil intriguing yet universal dark-pulse formation and switching behaviour with discrete steps, and establish a theoretical model scrutinizing the synergy of laser-microresonator mutual coupling, Kerr nonlinearity, photo-thermal effect. Numerical simulation confirms the experimental result and identifies the origins. Exploiting this unique phenomenon, we showcase an application on low-noise photonic microwave generation with phase noise purified by 23.5 dB. Our study not only add critical insight of pulse formation in laser-microresonator hybrid systems, but also enables all-passive, photonic-chip-based microwave oscillators with high spectral purity.</description>

      <title>Brillouin-Induced Kerr Frequency Comb in normal dispersion fiber Fabry Perot resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the generation of a stable, broadband frequency comb, covering more than 10 THz, using a normal dispersion fiber Fabry-Perot resonator with a high quality factor of 69 millions. This platform ensures robust and easy integration into photonic devices via FC/PC connectors, and feature quality factors comparable to those of microresonators. We demonstrate a passive mode-locking phenomenon induced by the coherent interaction of the Kerr effect and Brillouin scattering, which generates a frequency comb with a repetition rate exceeding the free spectral range of the cavity. This parametric process modulates the continuous wave (CW) pump and can then be transformed into a train of almost square-wave pulses thanks to the generation of switching waves. Our results are supported by advanced numerical simulations, and theoretical derivations that include the Brillouin effect in the Fabry-Perot configuration. The very high stable feature of this optical frequency comb lying in the GHz range is critical to several applications ranging from telecommunication, spectroscopy and advanced microwave generation.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Generation of Fano Resonance with No Symmetry Breaking in THz Hybrid Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fano resonance, arising from the interference between a discrete resonance and a continuum of states, results in sharp and asymmetric line shapes and has significant applications in advanced photonic devices, particularly in sensing, filtering, and nonlinear optics. Nowadays, metasurfaces comprised of engineering microstructures play a crucial role in generation and manipulation of Fano resonance in photonics. However, current metasurfaces dominantly rely on local symmetry breaking of the microstructures to induce Fano resonances, which significant limits their tunability and scalable fabrication for practical applications. To address the challenge, a metal-dielectric hybrid metasurface is demonstrated to achieve nonlocal generation of Fano resonance with no symmetry breaking in the terahertz (THz) band. The Fano resonance, including its existence and peak frequency, is sensitively controlled by the thickness and dielectric constant of the dielectric layer, which is experimentally observed. Our analysis elucidates that the metallic layer with a pair of dumbbell holes leads to the band folding and coupling of guided modes within the dielectric layer. When the thickness or dielectric constant surpasses a critical value, the guided mode resonance falls below the diffraction limit, resulting in a unique nonlocal Fano resonance due to the interaction between the resonance and background transmission facilitated by dumbbell holes. Furthermore, the Fano transmission peak corresponds to an anapole excitation, revealed by multipole calculations. Benefiting from the ability to control the Fano resonance with no symmetry breaking, the proposed hybrid THz metasurface will advance broad applications in the fields of sensors, optical switches, and tunable filters.</description>

      <title>Metasurface Dome for Above-the-Horizon Grating Lobes Reduction in 5G-NR Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of 5G New Radio (NR) spectrum around 26 GHz is currently raising the quest on its compatibility with the well-established Earth Exploration-Satellite Service (EESS), which may be blinded by the spurious radiation emitted Above-the-Horizon (AtH) by Base Station (BS) antennas. Indeed, AtH grating lobes are often present during cell scanning due to the large inter-element spacing in BS array antennas for achieving higher gains with a reduced number of RF chains. In this letter, we propose an approach based on an electrically thin metasurface-based dome for the reduction of AtH grating lobes in 5G-NR BS antennas. The proposed scanning range shifting approach exploits the natural lower amplitude of the grating lobes when the antenna array scans in an angular region closer to the broadside direction. The grating lobe reduction is here demonstrated considering a 1x4 phased linear antenna array operating under dual-liner 45deg-slant polarization. A simple design procedure for designing the metasurface dome is reported, together with the antenna performances, evaluated through a proper set of numerical experiments. It is shown that the grating lobe radiation towards the satellite region is significantly reduced, whereas the overall insertion loss is moderate.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian perspective on single-shot laser characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Bayesian framework for measuring spatio-temporal couplings (STCs) in ultra-intense lasers that reconceptualizes what constitutes a 'single-shot' measurement. Moving beyond traditional distinctions between single- and multi-shot devices, our approach provides rigorous criteria for determining when measurements can truly resolve individual laser shots rather than statistical averages. This framework shows that single-shot capability is not an intrinsic device property but emerges from the relationship between measurement precision and inherent parameter variability. Implementing this approach with a new measurement device at the ATLAS-3000 petawatt laser, we provide the first quantitative uncertainty bounds on pulse front tilt and curvature. Notably, we observe that our Bayesian method reduces uncertainty by up to 60% compared to traditional approaches. Through this analysis, we reveal how the interplay between measurement precision and intrinsic system variability defines achievable resolution -- insights that have direct implications for applications where precise control of laser-matter interaction is critical.</description>

      <title>Optical bound states in the continuum in subwavelength gratings made of an epitaxial van der Waals material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High refractive index (4.4 at 1100 nm), negligibly small absorption in near-infrared spectral range, and ease of processing make MoSe$_2$ a perfect material for applications in near-infrared photonics. So far, implementation of MoSe$_2$-based photonic structures has been hindered by the lack of large surface MoSe$_2$ substrates. The use of molecular beam epitaxy allows the production of homogeneous layers of MoSe$_2$ with a few-inch surface and a thickness controlled at the sub-nm level. In the present work, we design by theoretical calculations and fabricate by a simple lithography process an ultrathin subwavelength grating out of 42-nm thick, epitaxially-grown MoSe$_2$ layer. Our polarization-resolved reflectivity measurements confirm that the gratings host a peculiar type of a confined optical mode that is a bound state in the continuum. Moreover, the fabricated structures enhance the efficiency of the third harmonic generation by over three orders of magnitude as compared to the unstructured MoSe$_2$ layer. The presented results are promising for the realization of flat, ultra-compact devices for lasing, wavefront control, and higher-order topological states of the light.</description>

      <title>Revisiting PSF models: unifying framework and high-performance implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization microscopy often relies on detailed models of point spread functions. For applications such as deconvolution or PSF engineering, accurate models for light propagation in imaging systems with high numerical aperture are required. Different models have been proposed based on 2D Fourier transforms or 1D Bessel integrals. The most precise ones combine a vectorial description of the electric field and precise aberration models. However, it may be unclear which model to choose, as there is no comprehensive comparison between the Fourier and Bessel approaches yet. Moreover, many existing libraries are written in Java (e.g. our previous PSF generator software) or MATLAB, which hinders the integration into deep learning algorithms. In this work, we start from the original Richards-Wolf integral and revisit both approaches in a systematic way. We present a unifying framework in which we prove the equivalence between the Fourier and Bessel strategies and detail a variety of correction factors applicable to both of them. Then, we provide a high-performance implementation of our theoretical framework in the form of an open-source library that is built on top of PyTorch, a popular library for deep learning. It enables us to benchmark the accuracy and computational speed of different models, thus allowing for an in-depth comparison of the existing models for the first time. We show that the Bessel strategy is optimal for axisymmetric beams while the Fourier approach can be applied to more general scenarios. Our work enables efficient PSF computation on CPU or GPU, which can then be included in simulation and optimization pipelines.</description>

      <title>Spin photonic topological metasurface based on kagome lattice and leaky-wave application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging field of topological metasurfaces offers unique advantages, particularly in robustness against backscattering in low-profile structures. The lattice configuration of these structures significantly influences the ability to achieve sharp turns in the propagation path. One of the most studied lattices in condensed matter physics is the kagome lattice, characterized by its hexagonal Brillouin zone, which displays a Dirac cone in its dispersion diagram. Previous research on kagome lattices in photonic topological insulators has primarily focused on valley types of insulators. This article introduces a spin topological metasurface based on the kagome lattice and its unit cell, enabling a broad range of sharp turns and propagation paths. The unit cell is compared to its hexagonal and 60-degree rhombic counterparts, and a parametric study of its dimensions is conducted. As a result of this research, a new X-band leaky-wave antenna designed in the kagome lattice with an armchair arrangement interface has been developed. This antenna provides two forward and two backward beams, each pair achieving an approximately 50-degree scan within the 8.8 to 11.1 GHz bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Temporal multilayer structures for designing higher-order transfer functions using time-varying metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal metamaterials are artificial materials whose electromagnetic properties change over time. In analogy with spatial media and metamaterials, where their properties change smoothly or abruptly over space, temporal metamaterials can exhibit a smooth variation over time, realizing a temporal non-homogeneous medium, or a stepwise transition, realizing the temporal version of dielectric slabs or multilayer structures. In this Letter, we focus our attention on temporal multilayer structures, and we propose the synthesis of higher-order transfer functions by modeling the wave propagation through a generalized temporal multilayer structure, consisting of a cascade over time of different media. The tailoring of the scattering response of temporal structure as a function of frequency is presented, deriving the corresponding scattering coefficients for a properly designed set of medium properties, i.e., permittivity and permeability, and application time, in analogy with what is typically done in optical and electromagnetic spatial multilayered structures. This allows us to design novel electromagnetic and optical devices with higher-order transfer functions by exploiting the temporal dimension instead of the spatial one.</description>

      <title>Spatial-offset pump-probe imaging of nonradiative dynamics at optical resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonradiative photothermal (PT) and photoacoustic (PA) processes have found widespread applications in imaging, stimulation, and therapy. Mapping the generation and propagation of PA and PT waves with resolution is important to elucidate how these fields interact with biological systems. To this end, we introduce spatial offset pump-probe imaging (SOPPI). By spatially offsetting the pump beam and the probe beam, SOPPI can image simultaneously PA and PT wave propagation with nanosecond temporal resolution, micrometer spatial resolution, 65 MHz detection bandwidth, and a sensitivity of 9.9 Pa noise equivalent pressure. We first map the PA and PT evolution from a fiber emitter, and how the wave interacting with a mouse skull and brain slices. SOPPI imaging of PA waves from a tapered fiber with water as an absorber shows a wavelength-dependent generation, evanescent wave generated PA, and back-propagated acoustic Mach Cone. At last, a SOPPI-PACT is developed to reconstruct the pigment distribution inside a zebrafish larva with high precision and signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the hyperpolarizability of crystals with quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that higher-order electric susceptibilities in crystals can be enhanced and understood through nontrivial topological invariants and quantum geometry, using one-dimensional $\pi$-conjugated chains as representative model systems. First, we show that the crystalline-symmetry-protected topology of these chains imposes a lower bound on their quantum metric and hyperpolarizabilities. Second, we employ numerical simulations to reveal the tunability of non-linear, quantum geometry-driven optical responses in various one-dimensional crystals in which band topology can be externally controlled. Third, we develop a semiclassical picture to deliver an intuitive understanding of these effects. Our findings offer a firm interpretation of otherwise elusive experimental observations of colossal hyperpolarizabilities and establish guidelines for designing topological materials of any dimensionality with enhanced non-linear optical properties.</description>

      <title>Temperature-dependent radiative lifetime measurement of the $6^1\Sigma_g^+(v=9,J=31)$ state of sodium molecules</title>

Abstract: We report the measurement of radiative lifetimes of the $6^1\Sigma_g^+(v=9,J=31)$ state of gas-phase molecular sodium using a high-resolution double-resonance spectroscopy. Measurements were done using a time-correlated photon counting technique at various pressures and temperatures. Lifetimes were extracted from extrapolations to the zero buffer gas pressure, called Stern-Volmer plot, and the temperature-dependence of the radiative lifetimes were measured over a temperature range from 593 K to 653 K. Our result agrees well within the error limits with the theoretical calculations.</description>

      <title>Discrete chiral ballistic polariton laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light appears when the phase of an electromagnetic wavefront winds around its direction of propagation, also known as optical vorticity. Contrary to the binary-valued photon spin, the integer-valued optical vortex charge is unbounded with many advantages in optical communication and trapping and enhancing the capacity of data encoding and multiplexing. Singular optoelectronic and chiroptic quantum technologies rely on the development of coherent and compact light sources of well-defined and reconfigurable OAM. We propose an optically tunable discrete chiral exciton-polariton microlaser that leverages strong spin-dependent polariton interactions, structured pumping, and inherent cavity photon spin-to-angular momentum conversion to emit coherent nonlinear light of variable OAM. By choosing pumping patterns with broken inversion symmetry in the microcavity plane we invoke geometric frustration between spinor ballistic condensates which spontaneously obtain a high-charge circulating current locked with the pump polarization. Our optically configurable system requires only a planar cavity thus avoiding the need for specialized irreversible cavity patterning or metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of surface lattice resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collective interactions of nanoparticles arranged in periodic structures give rise to high-$Q$ in-plane diffractive modes known as surface lattice resonances (SLRs). While these resonances and their broader implications have been extensively studied within the framework of classical electrodynamics and linear response theory, a quantum optical theory capable of describing the dynamics of these structures, especially in the presence of material nonlinearities, beyond the use of \textit{ad hoc} few-mode approximations is largely missing. To this end, we consider here a lattice of metallic nanoparticles coupled to the background electromagnetic field and derive the quantum input-output relations within the electric dipole approximation. As a first application, we discuss coupling of the nanoparticle array to an external array of emitters and illustrate how the formalism can be extended to molecular optomechanics. Specifically, we show how the high $Q$-factors provided by SLRs can facilitate coupling between the nanoparticle array and collective vibrational modes. Finally, we examine a scenario in which the metallic nanoparticles themselves are replaced with saturable excitonic emitters, illustrating how the nonlinearity of the emitters can be used to switch the SLR condition between different electronic transitions. Our work provides a seamless framework to rigorously model SLR phenomena with quantum emitters without resorting to phenomenological treatments of either the electromagnetic environment or the material degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Maxwell-Vlasov-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (VUU) Simulation for Coupled Laser-Electron Dynamics in a Metal Irradiated by Ultrashort Intense Laser Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The description of electron-electron scattering presents challenges in the microscopic modeling of the interaction of ultrashort intense laser pulses with solids. We extend the semiclassical approach based on the Vlasov equation [Phys. Rev. B 104, 075157(2021)] to account for dynamic electron-electron scattering by introducing the Vlasov-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (VUU) equation. We further couple the VUU equation with Maxwell's equations to describe the laser pulse propagation. We apply the present approach to simulate laser-electron interactions in bulk and thin-film aluminum, focusing on energy absorption and transport. Our calculation results reveal that electron-electron scattering affects energy absorption more significantly under p-polarization than under s-polarization, highlighting the role of the non-uniform surface potential. Our simulations also show that the energy transport extends beyond the optical penetration depth, which is consistent with observations in previous laser ablation experiments. The developed Maxwell-VUU approach is expected to advance the understanding of intense laser-material interactions not only as a cost-effective alternative to the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), but also by incorporating fermionic two-body collisions whose description is limited in TDDFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted photons carrying orbital angular momentum, which have potential applications spanning diverse fields, have been extensively studied since the theoretical work of Allen \textit{et al}. in 1992. Various methods for direct producing twisted photons have been explored, leveraging the rotational (spiral) motion of relativistic electrons in phenomena such as undulator radiation. In the present study, transition radiation carrying orbital angular momentum is observed for the first time. This radiation was generated by 220 MeV electrons incident on an Au-coated Si wafer. The orbital angular momentum was measured by analyzing the diffraction patterns produced as the radiation passed through a triangular aperture and a double slit. These results demonstrate that twisted photons can also be generated through the interaction of rectilinearly moving electrons with a solid target.</description>

Abstract: Circularly polarized light offers opportunities to probe symmetry-dependent properties of matter such as chirality and spin. Circular dichroism measurements typically require further intrinsic or extrinsic breaking of symmetry by e.g. enantiomeric excess, orientation, magnetic fields or direction-sensitive detectors. Here we introduce circular-dichroic attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy by leveraging the angular momentum of two circular-polarized pulses, both pump and probe, in an isotropic medium, optically orienting the angular momentum of excited states on an attosecond timescale. We investigate a circular-dichroic measurement of the attosecond transient absorption of He Rydberg states. By limiting the allowed pathways via dipole selection rules for co- and counter-rotating circular polarized NIR and XUV pulses, different spectral reshapings of the XUV transient absorption due to the AC Stark effect are observed. Paired with time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation calculations, the results show the role of selection and propensity rules and open up new opportunities to study coupling pathways of excited states as well as spin-dependent dynamics in atoms and beyond via attosecond optical orientation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confining electromagnetic fields inside an optical cavity can enhance the light-matter coupling between quantum materials embedded inside the cavity and the confined photon fields. When the interaction between the matter and the photon fields is strong enough, even the quantum vacuum field fluctuations of the photons confined in the cavity can alter the properties of the cavity-embedded solid-state materials at equilibrium and room temperature. This approach to engineering materials with light avoids fundamental issues of laser-induced transient matter states. To clearly differentiate this field from phenomena in driven systems, we call this emerging field cavity materials engineering. In this review, we first present theoretical frameworks, especially, ab initio methods, for describing light-matter interactions in solid-state materials embedded inside a realistic optical cavity. Next, we overview a few experimental breakthroughs in this domain, detailing how the ground state properties of materials can be altered within such confined photonic environments. Moreover, we discuss state-of-the-art theoretical proposals for tailoring material properties within cavities. Finally, we outline the key challenges and promising avenues for future research in this exciting field.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Analysis of the Non-Hermitian Electro-Optic Effect in Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how crystal symmetry tailors the non-Hermitian electro-optic effect driven by the Berry curvature dipole. Specifically, we demonstrate the critical influence of the material's point group symmetry and external electric biases in shaping this effect, leading to current-induced optical gain and non-reciprocal optical responses. Through a symmetry-based analysis of the crystallographic point groups, we identify how different symmetries affect the electro-optic response, enabling the engineering of polarization-dependent optical gain without the need for gyrotropic effects. In particular, we demonstrate that the non-Hermitian electro-optic response in a broad class of crystals is characterized by linear dichroic gain. In this type of response, the eigenpolarizations that activate the gain or dissipation are linearly polarized. Depending on the specific symmetry point group, it is possible to achieve gain (or dissipation) for all eigenpolarizations or to observe polarization-dependent gain and dissipation. Weyl semimetals emerge as promising candidates for realizing significant non-Hermitian electro-optic effects and linear dichroic gain. We further examine practical applications by studying the reflectance of biased materials in setups involving mirrors, demonstrating how optical gain and attenuation can be controlled via symmetry and bias configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03413v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization entangled photons are the key ingredients of various protocols in quantum computation and quantum key distribution. In particular, for key distributions, a near-unity degree of polarization entanglement is one of the requirements for minimizing the qubit error rates. In this work, we theoretically investigate the polarization entangled photon pairs emitted by a quantum-dot radiative cascade embedded in a micropillar cavity. We develop a polaron master equation theory for incorporating the unavoidable exciton-phonon coupling and investigate the role of phonon-mediated processes and phonon-bath temperature on the degree of entanglement. We show that the phonon-coupling introduces the one-photon and two-photon incoherent processes, as well as the cross-coupling between the two exciton states. It is shown that the phonon-mediated coupling along with the ac-Stark shift and multiphoton emission significantly degrade the entanglement at higher temperatures. Finally, we consider a BBM92 quantum key distribution protocol to investigate the qubit error rate for the given degree of entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optoacoustic (OA) imaging combined with reversibly photoswitchable proteins has emerged as a promising technology for the high-sensitivity and multiplexed imaging of cells in live tissues in preclinical research. Through carefully-designed illumination schedules of ON and OFF laser pulses, the resulting OA signal is a multiplex of different reporter species and the background. We propose a model-based variational framework to computationally unmix and image different species of photo-switching reporters using optoacoustic tomography. It is based on a detailed mathematical description of the photo-switching mechanism, which models how relevant physical parameters such as the kinetic constants and light fluence impact the switching signal. We introduce an algorithm that operates on images, as opposed to traditional pixelwise approaches. It takes the form of an iterative inversion combined with tailored $\ell_1$ and total-variation regularization to increase the robustness to noise and to improve the unmixing quality. We show that our method is able to disentangle multiple spatially overlapping labels and to recover continuous maps of quantities of interest on controlled phantoms and mice experiments.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the feasibility of cooling of classical motion of a micro- to nano-sized magnetic particle, levitated inside a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber. The cooling action is implemented by means of controlling the phase of one of the counter-propagating fiber guided waves. Direct imaging of the particle's position, followed by the subsequent updating of the control laser's phase leads to Stokes type of cooling force. We provide estimates of cooling efficiency and final achievable temperature, taking into account thermal and detection noise sources. Our results bring forward an important step towards using trapped micro-magnets in sensing, testing the fundamental physics and preparing the quantum states of magnetization.</description>

      <title>Geometry Dependent Localization of Surface Plasmons on Random Gold Nanoparticle Assemblies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assemblies of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) support hybridized modes of localized surface plasmons (LSPs), which delocalize in geometrically well-ordered arrangements. Here, the hybridization behavior of LSPs in geometrically completely disordered arrangements of Au NPs fabricated by an e-beam synthesis method is studied. Employing electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope in combination with numerical simulations, the disorder-driven spatial and spectral localization of the coupled LSP modes that depend on the NP thickness is revealed. Below 0.4 nm sample thickness (flat NPs), localization increases towards higher hybridized LSP mode energies. In comparison, above 10 nm thickness, a decrease of localization (an increase of delocalization) with higher mode energies is observed. In the intermediate thickness regime, a transition of the energy dependence of the localization between the two limiting cases, exhibiting a transition mode energy with minimal localization, is observed. This behavior is mainly driven by the energy and thickness dependence of the polarizability of the individual NPs.</description>

      <title>Large mode volume integrated Brillouin lasers for scalable ultra-Low linewidth and high power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating ultra-low linewidths and high output power in an integrated single mode laser remains a critical challenge for future compact, portable, precision applications. Moreso, achieving these characteristics in a laser design that enables scaling to lower linewidths and higher power, and implementation in a wafer-scale integration platform that can operate from visible to near-IR and be integrated with other components. Such an advance could impact a wide array of applications including atomic and quantum sensing and computing, metrology, coherent fiber communications and sensing, and ultra-low-noise mmWave and RF generation. Yet, achieving these goals in an integrated laser has remained elusive. Here, we report a class of integrated laser that overcomes these limitations, with demonstration of a 31 mHz instantaneous linewidth, the lowest linewidth to date to the best of our knowledge, with 41 mW output power and 73 dB sidemode suppression ratio and can be tuned across a 22.5 nm range. This performance is possible due to Brillouin nonlinear dynamics that occurs within a large mode volume, nonlinear photon-phonon, MHz-scale-FSR, ultra-low loss silicon nitride resonator cavity. This laser design can scale to a new operating regime of mHz fundamental linewidth and Watt class lasers. Such lasers hold promise to unlock new sensitivity and fidelity for precision quantum experiments, portable precision applications, and atomic, molecular, and optical physics.</description>

      <title>Propagation through metamaterial temporal slabs: transmission, reflection and special cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04280</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.04280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-varying metamaterials are artificial materials whose electromagnetic properties change over time. Similar to a spatial medium discontinuity, a sudden change in time of the metamaterial refractive index induces the generation of a reflected and refracted light waves. The relationship between the incident and emerging fields at one temporal interface has been subject of investigation in earlier studies. Here, we extend the study to a temporal slab, i.e., a uniform homogeneous medium that is present in the whole space for a limited time. The scattering coefficients have been derived as a function of the refractive indices and application time, demonstrating that the response of the temporal slab can be controlled through the application time, which acts similarly to the electrical thickness of conventional spatial slabs. The results reported in this letter pave the way to novel devices based on temporal discontinuities, such as temporal matching networks, Bragg grating, dielectric mirrors, which exhibit zero space occupancy by exploiting the time dimension, instead of the spatial one.</description>

      <title>Vector Magnetometry Using Shallow Implanted NV Centers in Diamond with Waveguide-Assisted Dipole Excitation and Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On-chip magnetic field sensing with Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond requires scalable integration of 3D waveguides into diamond substrates. Here, we develop a sensing array device with an ensemble of shallow implanted NV centers integrated with arrays of laser-written waveguides for excitation and readout of NV signals. Our approach enables an easy-to-operate on-chip magnetometer with a pixel size proportional to the Gaussian mode area of each waveguide. The performed continuous wave optically detected magnetic resonance on each waveguide gives an average dc-sensitivity value of $195 \pm 3 {nT}/\sqrt{Hz}$, which can be improved with lock-in-detection or pulsed-microwave sequences. We apply a magnetic field to separate the four NV crystallographic orientations of the magnetic resonance and then utilize a DC current through a straight wire antenna close to the waveguide to prove the sensor capabilities of our device. We reconstruct the complete vector magnetic field in the NV crystal frame using three different NV crystallographic orientations. By knowing the polarization axis of the waveguide mode, we project the magnetic field vector into the lab frame.</description>

      <title>Probing the axion-photon coupling with space-based gravitational waves detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple modification of space-based gravitational wave (GW) detector optical benches which would enable the measurement of vacuum birefringence of light induced by axion dark matterthrough its coupling to electromagnetism. Specifically, we propose to change a half-wave plate by a circular polarizer. While marginally affecting the sensitivity to GW by a factor $\sqrt{2}$, we show that such an adjustment would make future detectors such as LISA, TianQin, Taiji and Big-Bang Observer the most sensitive experiments at low axion masses</description>

      <title>Ultrafast All-Optical Measurement of Squeezed Vacuum in a Lithium Niobate Nanophotonic Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Squeezed vacuum, a fundamental resource for continuous-variable quantum information processing, has been used to demonstrate quantum advantages in sensing, communication, and computation. While most experiments use homodyne detection to characterize squeezing and are therefore limited to electronic bandwidths, recent experiments have shown optical parametric amplification (OPA) to be a viable measurement strategy. Here, we realize OPA-based quantum state tomography in integrated photonics and demonstrate the generation and all-optical Wigner tomography of squeezed vacuum in a nanophotonic circuit. We employ dispersion engineering to enable the distortion-free propagation of femtosecond pulses and achieve ultrabroad operation bandwidths, effectively lifting the speed restrictions imposed by traditional electronics on quantum measurements with a theoretical maximum clock speed of 6.5 THz. We implement our circuit on thin-film lithium niobate, a platform compatible with a wide variety of active and passive photonic components. Our results chart a course for realizing all-optical ultrafast quantum information processing in an integrated room-temperature platform.</description>

      <title>Enhanced quantum magnetometry with a laser-written integrated photonic diamond chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An ensemble of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond can act as a precise quantum sensor even under ambient conditions. In particular, to optimize thier sensitivity, it is crucial to increase the number of spins sampled and maximize their coupling to the detection system, without degrading their spin properties. In this paper, we demonstrate enhanced quantum magnetometry via a high-quality buried laser-written waveguide in diamond with a 4.5 ppm density of nitrogen-vacancy centers. We show that the waveguide-coupled nitrogen-vacancy centers exhibit comparable spin coherence properties as that of nitrogen-vacancy centers in pristine diamond using time-domain optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Waveguide-enhanced magnetic field sensing is demonstrated in a fiber-coupled integrated photonic chip, where probing an increased volume of high-density spins results in 63 pT$.$Hz $^{-1/2}$ of DC-magnetic field sensitivity and 20 pT$.$Hz $^{-1/2}$ of AC magnetic field sensitivity. This on-chip sensor realizes at least an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared to the conventional confocal detection setup, paving the way for microscale sensing with nitrogen-vacancy ensembles.</description>
