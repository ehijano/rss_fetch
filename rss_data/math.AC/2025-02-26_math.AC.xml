      <title>Betti elements and full atomic support in rings and monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several papers in the recent literature have studied factorization properties of affine monoids using the monoid's Betti elements. In this paper, we extend this study to more general rings and monoids. We open by demonstrating the issues with computing the complete set of Betti elements of a general commutative cancellative monoid, and as an example compute this set for an algebraic number ring of class number two. We specialize our study to the case where the monoid has a single Betti element, before examining monoids with full atomic support (that is, when each Betti element is divisible by every atom). For such a monoid, we show that the catenary degree, tame degree, and omega value agree and can be computed using the monoid's set of Betti elements. We close by considering Betti elements in block monoids, giving a "Carlitz-like" characterization of block monoids with full atomic support and proving that these are precisely the block monoids having a unique Betti element.</description>

      <title>Semiprime-ideal variants of theorems of Vukman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be an associative ring with a nonzero ideal $I$ and a semiprime ideal $T$ such that $T\subsetneq I.$ Let $K$ be a nonempty subset of $R$ and $d:R\to R$ be a derivation of $R$, if $[d(x),x]\in T$ for all $x\in K,$ then $d$ is said to be a $T$-commuting derivation on $K.$ The main purpose of this paper is to show that if char$(R/T)\neq 2$ and any of ~$[[d(x),x],x]\in T,$~ $[d(x),x]d(x)\in T,$~ $d(x)[d(x),x]\in T$ holds on $I,$ then $d$ is $T$-commuting on $I$. Consequently, we extend some known results of Vukman \cite{Vukman1990}.</description>

      <title>An upper bound for the multiplicity of one-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we provide an upper bound for the multiplicity of a one-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay ring (under certain conditions), describe the rings attaining the equality for this bound, and outline a connection with Wilf's conjecture for numerical semigroup rings. We also discuss these assumptions in higher dimension, proving that they are never satisfied if the dimension is larger than one, and provide some examples of rings which are not Cohen-Macaulay but still satisfy our bound.</description>

      <title>Artinian Gorenstein algebras with binomial Macaulay dual generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper initiates a systematic study for key properties of Artinian Gorenstein \(K\)-algebras having binomial Macaulay dual generators. In codimension 3, we demonstrate that all such algebras satisfy the strong Lefschetz property, can be constructed as a doubling of an appropriate 0-dimensional scheme in \(\mathbb{P}^2\), and we provide an explicit characterization of when they form a complete intersection. For arbitrary codimension, we establish sufficient conditions under which the weak Lefschetz property holds and show that these conditions are optimal.</description>

      <title>The Determinantal Matroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the algebraic matroid induced by the ideal of (r+1)-minors of a matrix of variables over a field. This is inherently connected to the bounded-rank matrix completion problem, in which the aim is to complete a partially observed rank r matrix. We give criteria that detect dependent sets in the matroid, we describe a family of bases of the matroid, and we study the question of unique completability.</description>

      <title>Square-free powers of Cohen-Macaulay simplicial forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $I(\Delta)^{[k]}$ denote the $k^{\text{th}}$ square-free power of the facet ideal of a simplicial complex $\Delta$ in a polynomial ring $R$. Square-free powers are intimately related to the `Matching Theory' and `Ordinary Powers'. In this article, we show that if $\Delta$ is a Cohen-Macaulay simplicial forest, then $R/I(\Delta)^{[k]}$ is Cohen-Macaulay for all $k\ge 1$. This result is quite interesting since all ordinary powers of a graded radical ideal can never be Cohen-Macaulay unless it is a complete intersection. To prove the result, we introduce a new combinatorial notion called special leaf, and using this, we provide an explicit combinatorial formula of $\mathrm{depth}(R/I(\Delta)^{[k]})$ for all $k\ge 1$, where $\Delta$ is a Cohen-Macaulay simplicial forest. As an application, we show that the normalized depth function of a Cohen-Macaulay simplicial forest is nonincreasing.</description>

      <title>On the number of minimal and next-to-minimal weight codewords of toric codes over hypersimplices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Toric codes are a type of evaluation code introduced by J.P. Hansen in 2000. They are produced by evaluating (a vector space composed by) polynomials at the points of $(\mathbb{F}_q^*)^s$, the monomials of these polynomials being related to a certain polytope. Toric codes related to hypersimplices are the result of the evaluation of a vector space of homogeneous monomially square-free polynomials of degree $d$. The dimension and minimum distance of toric codes related to hypersimplices have been determined by Jaramillo et al. in 2021. The next-to-minimal weight in the case $d = 1$ has been determined by Jaramillo-Velez et al. in 2023, and has been determined in the cases where $3 \leq d \leq \frac{s - 2}{2}$ or $\frac{s + 2}{2} \leq d &lt; s$, by Carvalho and Patanker in 2024. In this work we characterize and determine the number of minimal (respectively, next-to-minimal) weight codewords when $3 \leq d &lt; s$ (respectively, $3 \leq d \leq \frac{s - 2}{2}$ or $\frac{s + 2}{2} \leq d &lt; s$).</description>

      <title>Graph rings and ideals: Wolmer Vasconcelos' contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06270v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a survey article featuring some of Wolmer Vasconcelos' contributions to commutative algebra, and explaining how Vasconcelos' work and insights have contributed to the development of commutative algebra and its interaction with other areas to the present. We discuss the Vasconcelos' function and the Vasconcelos' number (v-number for short) of graded ideals and their relation to coding theory, and the interplay of Simis and normal monomial ideals with combinatorial optimization problems, blowup algebras, and resurgence theory. The regularity of subrings of normal k-uniform monomial ideals is shown to be a monotone function, and we give a normality criterion for edge ideals of graphs using Ehrhart rings.</description>

      <title>Factoring sparse polynomials fast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a sparse polynomial in several variables given explicitly as a sum of non-zero terms with coefficients in an effective field. In this paper, we present several algorithms for factoring such polynomials and related tasks (such as gcd computation, square-free factorization, content-free factorization, and root extraction). Our methods are all based on sparse interpolation, but follow two main lines of attack: iteration on the number of variables and more direct reductions to the univariate or bivariate case. We present detailed probabilistic complexity bounds in terms of the complexity of sparse interpolation and evaluation.</description>

      <title>Numerical semigroups, polyhedra, and posets IV: walking the faces of the Kunz cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A numerical semigroup is a cofinite subset of $\mathbb Z_{\ge 0}$ containing $0$ and closed under addition. Each numerical semigroup $S$ with smallest positive element $m$ corresponds to an integer point in the Kunz cone $\mathcal C_m \subseteq \mathbb R^{m-1}$, and the face of $\mathcal C_m$ containing that integer point determines certain algebraic properties of $S$. In this paper, we introduce the Kunz fan, a pure, polyhedral cone complex comprised of a faithful projection of certain faces of $\mathcal C_m$. We characterize several aspects of the Kunz fan in terms of the combinatorics of Kunz nilsemigroups, which are known to index the faces of $\mathcal C_m$, and our results culminate in a method of "walking" the face lattice of the Kunz cone in a manner analogous to that of a Gr\"obner walk. We apply our results in several contexts, including a wealth of computational data obtained from the aforementioned "walks" and a proof of a recent conjecture concerning which numerical semigroups achieve the highest minimal presentation cardinality when one fixes the smallest positive element and the number of generators.</description>

      <title>Injectives obstruct Fourier-Mukai functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use injectives as a big tilting object to obstruct liftability of exact functors to the $\dg$-level.
  We use the inclusion of injectives into the canonical heart as a replacement for tilting objects in computations of the characteristic morphism. Then we apply this construction to proofs of non-liftability of candidate non-Fourier-Mukai functors, i.e.\ functors that do not admit an $\Ainfty$/$\dg$-lift. This approach allows explicit computation of the obstruction against an $\Ainfty$-lift. We in particular observe that this computation gives for smooth degree $d&gt;2$ hypersurfaces an abundance of non-Fourier-Mukai functors.</description>
