      <title>Financial climate risk: a review of recent advances and key challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The document provides an overview of financial climate risks. It delves into how climate change impacts the global financial system, distinguishing between physical risks (such as extreme weather events) and transition risks (stemming from policy changes and economic transitions towards low carbon technologies). The paper underlines the complexity of accurately defining financial climate risk, citing the integration of climate science with financial risk analysis as a significant challenge. The paper highlights the pivotal role of microfinance institutions (MFIs) in addressing financial climate risk, especially for populations vulnerable to climate change. The document emphasizes the importance of updating risk management practices within MFIs to explicitly include climate risk assessments and suggests leveraging technology to improve these practices.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT Can Predict the Future when it Tells Stories Set in the Future About the Past</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates whether OpenAI's ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 can accurately forecast future events using two distinct prompting strategies. To evaluate the accuracy of the predictions, we take advantage of the fact that the training data at the time of experiment stopped at September 2021, and ask about events that happened in 2022 using ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4. We employed two prompting strategies: direct prediction and what we call future narratives which ask ChatGPT to tell fictional stories set in the future with characters that share events that have happened to them, but after ChatGPT's training data had been collected. Concentrating on events in 2022, we prompted ChatGPT to engage in storytelling, particularly within economic contexts. After analyzing 100 prompts, we discovered that future narrative prompts significantly enhanced ChatGPT-4's forecasting accuracy. This was especially evident in its predictions of major Academy Award winners as well as economic trends, the latter inferred from scenarios where the model impersonated public figures like the Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell. These findings indicate that narrative prompts leverage the models' capacity for hallucinatory narrative construction, facilitating more effective data synthesis and extrapolation than straightforward predictions. Our research reveals new aspects of LLMs' predictive capabilities and suggests potential future applications in analytical contexts.</description>

      <title>International environmental treaties: An honest or a misguided effort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change and environmental concerns represent a global crisis accompanied by significant economic challenges. Regular international conferences held to address these issues, such as in the UK (2021) and Egypt (2022), spark debate about the effectiveness and practicality of international commitments. This study examines international treaties from a different perspective, emphasizing the need to understand the power dynamics and stakeholder interests that delay logical actions to mitigate anthropogenic contributions to climate change and their impacts. Environmental and social concerns tend to increase within nations as their economies develop, where they fight to keep acceptable standards of living while reducing emissions volume. So, nations play disproportionate roles in global decision-making based on the size of their economies. Addressing climate change requires a paradigm shift to emphasize acknowledging and adhering to global commitments through civil pressure, rather than relying on traditional yet biased systems of international political diplomacy. Here, climate-friendly actions are evaluated and ideas to promote such activities are proposed. We introduce a "transition regime" as a solution to this metastasis challenge which gradually infects all nations.</description>

      <title>Short, Disclose, and Distort</title>

Abstract: We investigate the voluntary disclosure decision of activist speculators under uncertainty about information endowment (Dye 1985). In our model, a speculator first uncovers initial evidence about the target firm and then seeks additional information to help interpret the initial evidence. The speculator takes a position in the firm's stock, then voluntarily discloses some or all of their findings, and finally closes their position after the disclosure. We present three main findings. First, the speculator will always disclose the initial evidence, even though the market is uncertain about whether the speculator possesses such evidence. Second, the speculator's disclosure strategy of the additional information increases stock price volatility: they disclose extreme news and withhold moderate news. Third, this distortion in disclosure enables the speculator to engage in market manipulation, whereby they take a short (long) position despite having good (bad) news.

      <title>Impacto Distributivo Potencial de Reformas na Tributacao Indireta no Brasil: Simulacoes Baseadas na PEC 45/2019</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the redistributive impacts of indirect taxation reforms in Brazil inspired by PEC 45/2019, particularly in the version that led to EC 132/2023. Comparisons are made between the current system and the simulated reforms, considering the distribution of the tax burden among families in different income classes, as well as the impact on poverty and inequality indicators. The simulations are conducted based on the combination of effective tax rates that apply to goods and services consumed by households, using nationally representative microdata from family budgets.</description>

      <title>The Broken Rung: Gender and the Leadership Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing female underrepresentation in leadership positions has become a key policy objective. However, little is known about the extent to which leadership appeals differently to women. Collecting new data from a large firm, I document that women are substantially less likely to apply for early-career promotions. Realized application patterns and large-scale surveys reveal the role of an understudied feature of promotions -- having to assume responsibility over a team -- which is less appealing to women. This gender difference is not accounted for by standard explanations, such as success likelihood or confidence, but is rather a product of common design features of leadership positions.</description>

      <title>Compositional Growth Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review models of compositional growth, which were introduced to explain the growth statistics of various quantities ranging from firm sizes to GDP. In these models, entities are decomposed into units that grow independently. Thus, the growth rate of the entity is the addition of the growth rates of the composing units, with possibly heterogeneous weights. We review such models and show that they can be understood through a unifying theoretical framework, explaining the resulting growth rate distributions using mixtures of Gaussians.</description>

      <title>On the role of ethics and sustainability in business innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For organizations to survive and flourish in the long term, innovation and novelty must be continually introduced, which is particularly true in today's rapidly changing world. This raises a variety of ethical and sustainability considerations that seldom receive the attention they deserve. Existing innovation adoption frameworks often focus on technological, organizational, environmental, and social factors impacting adoption. In this chapter, we explore the ethical and sustainability angles, particularly as they relate to emerging technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) being a prominent example. We consider how to facilitate the development and cultivation of innovation cultures in organizations, including budding startups as well as established enterprises, through approaches such as systems thinking.</description>

      <title>The forgotten pillar of sustainability: development of the S-assessment tool to evaluate Organizational Social Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pursuing sustainable development has become a global imperative, underscored adopting of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). At the heart of this agenda lies the recognition of social sustainability as a pivotal component, emphasizing the need for inclusive societies where every individual can thrive. Despite its significance, social sustainability remains a "forgotten pillar," often overshadowed by environmental concerns. In response, this paper presents the development and validation of the S-Assessment Tool for Social Sustainability, a comprehensive questionnaire designed to evaluate organizations' performance across critical dimensions such as health and wellness, gender equality, decent work, and economic growth, reducing inequalities, and responsible production and consumption. The questionnaire was constructed on the critical dimensions identified through a systematic and narrative hybrid approach to the analysis of peer-reviewed literature. The framework has been structured around the values of the SDGs. It aims to empower organizations to better understand and address their social impact, fostering positive change and contributing to the collective effort towards a more equitable and sustainable future. Through collaborative partnerships and rigorous methodology, this research underscores the importance of integrating social sustainability into organizational practices and decision-making processes, ultimately advancing the broader agenda of sustainable development.</description>

      <title>Finding Stable Price Zones in European Electricity Markets: Aiming to Square the Circle?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The European day-ahead electricity market is split into multiple bidding zones. Within these zones, a uniform energy price is computed for each hour. Large bidding zones have been under scrutiny. The fact that zonal clearing ignores the transmission capacities within zones and the increase in renewables lead to a growing number of interventions in the generation of energy sources and large redispatch costs. The European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) proposed alternative bidding zone configurations that should be analyzed as part of the Bidding Zone Review. For Germany, four alternative configurations were suggested. Bidding zones shall be stable and based on long-term, structural congestion in the grid. We analyzed the proposed configurations considering different clustering algorithms and periods. We found that the configurations do not reduce the price standard deviations within zones considerably, while the average prices across zones are similar. Other configurations identified based on clustering prices lead to lower price standard deviations but are not geographically coherent. Importantly, different configurations emerge depending on clustering features, algorithm, and period considered. Given the substantial changes in energy supply and demand that can be expected in the future, defining stable configurations appears to be a moving target.</description>
