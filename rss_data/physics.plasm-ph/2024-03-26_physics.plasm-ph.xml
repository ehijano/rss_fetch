      <title>Core performance predictions in projected SPARC first-campaign plasmas with nonlinear CGYRO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work characterizes the core transport physics of SPARC early-campaign plasmas using the PORTALS-CGYRO framework. Empirical modeling of SPARC plasmas with L-mode confinement indicates an ample window of breakeven (Q&gt;1) without the need of H-mode operation. Extensive modeling of multi-channel (electron energy, ion energy and electron particle) flux-matched conditions with the nonlinear CGYRO code for turbulent transport coupled to the macroscopic plasma evolution using PORTALS reveal that the maximum fusion performance to be attained will be highly dependent on the near-edge pressure. Stiff core transport conditions are found, particularly when fusion gain approaches unity, and predicted density peaking is found to be in line with empirical databases of particle source-free H-modes. Impurity optimization is identified as a potential avenue to increase fusion performance while enabling core-edge integration. Extensive validation of the quasilinear TGLF model builds confidence in reduced-model predictions. The implications of projecting L-mode performance to high-performance and burning-plasma devices is discussed, together with the importance of predicting edge conditions.</description>

      <title>A numerical study of gravity-driven instability in strongly coupled dusty plasma. Part 3: Homo-interaction between a pair of rising/falling bubbles/droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical study of the homo-interactions between two falling droplets and between two rising bubbles in a strongly coupled dusty plasma medium is presented in this article. This strongly coupled dusty plasma is considered as a viscoelastic fluid using the generalized hydrodynamic fluid model formalism. Two factors that affect homo-interactions are taken into account: the initial spacing and the coupling strength of the medium. Three different spacings between two droplets are simulated: widely, medium, and closely. In each case, the coupling strength has been given as mild-strong and strong. It is shown that the overall dynamic is governed by the competition between the acceleration of two droplets/bubbles due to gravity and the interaction due to the closeness of the droplets/bubbles. Especially in viscoelastic fluids, the closeness between two droplets/bubbles, aside from their initial separation, at a later time may result from shear waves that emerge from rotating vorticies. For widely-spaced, unlike classical hydrodynamic fluids, we find that shear waves in viscoelastic fluids facilitate the pairing between two bubbles/droplets. In the case of medium-spaced, the two new dipoles of unequal strength blobs exhibit a circular motion and exchange their partners. For closely-spaced, the droplet/bubble fall/rise is suppressed as the coupling strength of the medium increases. Numerous two-dimensional simulations have been carried out. This work is a continuation of the work done in parts I (V. S. Dharodi and A. Das, J. Plasma Phys. 87 (02), 905870216 (2021)) and II (V. S. Dharodi, J. Plasma Phys. 87 (04), 905870402 (2021)).</description>

      <title>The high-density regime of dusty plasma: Coulomb plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the dust density regimes in dusty plasma are characterized by two complementary screening processes, (a) the low dust density regime where the Debye screening is the dominant process and (b) the high dust density regime where the Coulomb screening is the dominant process. The Debye regime is characterized by a state where all dust particles carry an equal and constant charge. The high-density regime or the Coulomb plasma regime is characterized by (a) Coulomb screening where the dust charge depends on the spatial location and is screened by other dust particles in the vicinity by charge reduction, (b) quark like asymptotic freedom where dust particles, which on an average carry minimal electric charge (q tends to 0), are asymptotically free, (c) uniform dust charge density and plasma potential, (d) dust charge neutralization by a uniform background of hot ions. Thus, the Coulomb plasma is essentially a one-component plasma (OCP) with screening as opposed to electron plasma which is OCP without screening. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations verify these properties. The MD simulations are performed, using a recently developed Hamiltonian formalism, to study the dynamics of Yukawa particles carrying variable electric charge. A hydrodynamic model for describing the collective properties of Coulomb plasma and its characteristic acoustic mode called the Coulomb acoustic wave is given.</description>

      <title>Pulse-shaping in the interaction of an elliptically-polarized laser and magnetized-plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulse shaping provides a significant level of control and precision when optimizing laser-plasma interactions. Pulse shaping enables precise control and manipulation, resulting in enhanced energy deposition, optimized particle acceleration, controlled polarization, and exploitation of resonant effects. The present study investigates the interaction of structured light with magnetized plasma, considering various spatial profiles and polarization states. This phenomenon involves modification of the temporal and spatial characteristics of the laser pulse due to the presence of the magnetized plasma. The discussion reveals how the electric field and electron velocity evolve within the plasma both spatially and temporally. Factors such as absorption, dispersion, collisions, and scattering are taken into account to understand how they influence the evolution of the pulse. The effects of electron density, external magnetic fields, relativistic velocities, and polarization states on pulse compression are examined. The spatial laser profile impact on pulse-shaping and plasma channel formation is also discussed. This exploration sheds light on the intricate interplays and potential pulse-shaping applications in laser-plasma interactions.</description>

      <title>Modulational electrostatic wave-wave interactions in plasma fluids modeled by asymmetric coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger (CNLS) equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between two co-propagating electrostatic wavepackets characterized by arbitrary carrier wavenumber is considered. A one-dimensional (1D) non-magnetized plasma model is adopted, consisting of a cold inertial ion fluid evolving against a thermalized (Maxwell-Boltzmann distributed) electron background. A multiple-scale perturbation method is employed to reduce the original model equations to a pair of coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger (CNLS) equations governing the dynamics of the wavepacket amplitudes (envelopes). The CNLS equations are in general asymmetric for arbitrary carrier wabvenumbers. Similar CNLS systems have been derived in the past in various physical contexts, and were found to support soliton, breather, and rogue wave solutions, among others. A detailed stability analysis reveals that modulational instability (MI) is possible in a wide range of values in the parameter space. The instability window and the corresponding growth rate are determined, considering different case studies, and their dependence on the carrier and the perturbation wavenumber is investigated from first principles. Wave-wave coupling is shown to favor MI occurrence by extending its range of occurrence and by enhancing its growth rate. Our findings generalize previously known results usually associated with symmetric NLS equations in nonlinear optics, though taking into account the difference between the different envelope wavenumbers and thus group velocities.</description>

      <title>On the Ambipolar Diffusion Formulation for Ion-neutral drifts in the non-negligible drift velocity limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ambipolar diffusion approximation is used to model partially ionised plasma dynamics in a single fluid setting. To correctly apply the commonly used version of ambipolar diffusion, a set of criteria should be satisfied including the requirement that the difference in velocity between charges and neutral species (known as drift velocity) is much smaller than the thermal velocity, otherwise the drift velocity will drive a non-negligible level of further collisions between the two species. In this paper we explore the consequence of relaxing this assumption. We show that a new induction equation can be formulated without this assumption. This formulation reduces to the ambipolar induction equation in the case the drift velocity is small. In the large drift velocity limit, the feedback of the drift velocity on the collision frequency results in decreased diffusion of the magnetic field compared with the standard ambipolar diffusion approximation for the same parameters. This has a natural consequence of reducing the frictional heating that can occur. Applying this to results from flux emergence simulations where the expansion of the magnetic field leads to strong adiabatic cooling of the partially ionised chromosphere resulted in a noticeable reduction in the magnitude of the predicted drift velocities.</description>

      <title>On electromagnetic turbulence and transport in STEP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present first-of-their-kind nonlinear local gyrokinetic simulations of electromagnetic turbulence at mid-radius in the burning plasma phase of the conceptual high-$\beta$, reactor-scale, tight-aspect-ratio tokamak STEP (Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production). A prior linear analysis in D. Kennedy et al. 2023 Nucl. Fusion 63 126061 reveals the presence of unstable hybrid kinetic ballooning modes, where inclusion of the compressional magnetic field fluctuation, $\delta B_{\parallel}$, is crucial, and subdominant microtearing modes are found at binormal scales approaching the ion-Larmor radius. Local nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations on the selected surface in the central core region suggest that hybrid kinetic ballooning modes can drive large turbulent transport, and that there is negligible turbulent transport from subdominant microtearing modes when hybrid kinetic ballooning modes are artificially suppressed (through the omission of $\delta B_{\parallel}$). Nonlinear simulations that include perpendicular equilibrium flow shear can saturate at lower fluxes that are more consistent with the available sources in STEP. This analysis suggests that hybrid kinetic ballooning modes could play an important role in setting the turbulent transport in STEP, and possible mechanisms to mitigate turbulent transport are discussed. Increasing the safety factor or the pressure gradient strongly reduces turbulent transport from hybrid kinetic ballooning modes in the cases considered here. Challenges of simulating electromagnetic turbulence in this high-$\beta$ regime are highlighted. In particular the observation of radially extended turbulent structures in the absence of equilibrium flow shear motivates future advanced global gyrokinetic simulations that include $\delta B_\parallel$.</description>
