      <title>A note on Reeb spaces of some explicit real analytic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reeb spaces of smooth functions are fundamental and strong tools in understanding manifolds via smooth functions with mild critical points. They are defined as the natural spaces of all connected components of level sets. They are also important objects in related studies. Realization of graphs as Reeb spaces of smooth functions of certain nice classes is of such studies.
  In this paper, we present Reeb spaces of explicit real analytic functions which are not finite graphs. Related problems were started by Sharko, in 2006, who has studied smooth functions with critical points represented by certain elementary polynomials, and followed by a study of Masumoto and Saeki, which is on smooth functions on closed surfaces under an extended situation, and a study of Michalak, which is on Morse functions on closed manifolds. The author has contributed to this by respecting topologies of level sets, and real algebraic construction.</description>

      <title>Analytic Regularization of a Ramanujan Machine Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a formal analytic derivation of a continued fraction identity for $-\pi/4$ recently conjectured by the Ramanujan Machine~\cite{Raayoni2021}. By utilizing the contiguous relations of the Gauss hypergeometric function ${}_2F_1(a, b; c; z)$, we establish that the conjectured polynomial architecture is a regularized representation of the transcendental ratio $\mathcal{R}(1/2, 0, 1/2; -1)$. Through an explicit equivalence transformation $\mathcal{T}$ defined by a linear scaling sequence, we map the Gaussian unit-denominator expansion to the conjectured form, thereby recovering the quadratic partial numerators $(n-1)^2$ and linear partial denominators $-(2n-1)$. Convergence is rigorously established via the limit-periodicity of the transformed coefficients, which reside on the Worpitzky boundary $L=1/4$.</description>

      <title>Relations between e, $\pi$, golden ratios and $\sqrt{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09643v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We write out relations between the base of natural logarithms ($e$), the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter ($\pi$), the golden ratios ($\Phi_p$) of the additive $p$-sequences, and the ratio of the diagonal of a square to its side ($\sqrt{2}$). An additive $p$-sequence is a natural extension of the Fibonacci sequence in which every term is the sum of $p$-previous terms given $p \ge 1$ initial values called seeds.</description>

      <title>Newton-Mandelbrot set and Murase-Mandelbrot set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain four extended Newton's methods and three extended Mandelbrot's recurrence formulas from the Wasan (Japanese mathematics in the Edo period (1603-1868)). Furthermore, two extended Newton's methods relate to one of the extended Mandelbrot's recurrence formulas. We lead four types of extended Mandelbrot recurrence formulas. Next, we show that these become the same extended Mandelbrot set, and connected, closed set. These show the originality of Wasan.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Density of Words under Morphism $\{a,b\}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the density of the Fibonacci word and its derived forms by examining the morphisms associated with each. It offers a comparative analysis of the density of Fibonacci numbers alongside other words derived from Fibonacci word. Fibonacci words over the alphabet $\{a,b\}$, we define a novel \emph{power} operation that yields a formal linear combination in the free abelian group generated by all finite words.</description>
