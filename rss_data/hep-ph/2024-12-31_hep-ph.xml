      <title>Quasielastic Lepton-Nucleus Scattering and the Correlated Fermi Gas Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of neutrino-nucleus scattering processes is important for the new generation neutrino experiments for better understanding of the neutrino oscillation phenomenon. A significant source of uncertainty in the cross-section comes from limitations in our knowledge of nucleon and nuclear effects in the scattering process. Here we present a fully analytic implementation of the Correlated Fermi Gas nuclear model for the quasi-elastic lepton nucleus scattering. The implementation is then used to separately compare form factor effects and nuclear model effects, specifically the Relativistic Fermi Gas nuclear model, for both electron-carbon and neutrino-carbon scattering data.</description>

      <title>$P$-wave bottom baryons of the $SU(3)$ flavor $\mathbf{\bar3}_F$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $P$-wave bottom baryons of the $SU(3)$ flavor $\mathbf{\bar3}_F$ and systematically calculate their strong decay properties, including their $D$-wave decays into ground-state bottom baryons with light pseudoscalar mesons and $S$-wave decays into ground-state bottom baryons with light vector mesons. Together with Refs.~\cite{Tan:2023opd,Yang:2019cvw,Yang:2020zrh,Luo:2024jov}, a rather complete investigation has been performed to study their mass spectra and strong/radiative decay properties, through the methods of QCD sum rules and light-cone sum rules within the framework of heavy quark effective theory. Among various possibilities, we identify four $\Lambda_b$ and four $\Xi_b$ baryons, with limited decay widths and so capable of being observed in experiments. Their masses, mass splittings within the same multiplets, and strong/radiative decay widths are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:decayb3f} for future experimental searching.</description>

      <title>Rational-function interpolation from p-adic evaluations in scattering amplitude calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical interpolation techniques are widely employed for calculating large rational functions in scattering amplitude computations. It has been observed in recent years that these rational functions greatly simplify upon partial fractioning. In this conference proceedings paper, based on the article [H. A. Chawdhry, Phys. Rev. D 110, 056028 (2024)], a technique is presented to interpolate such rational functions directly in partial-fractioned form, from evaluations at special integer points chosen for their properties under a p-adic absolute value. It is shown that the technique can require 25 times fewer numerical probes than conventional finite-field-based techniques and can produce results that are more compact in size by 2 orders of magnitude. The reconstructed results moreover exhibit additional patterns that could be exploited in future work to further improve the size of the results and the number of required numerical probes.</description>

      <title>Planar Six-Point Feynman Integrals for Four-Dimensional Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute all planar two-loop six-point Feynman integrals entering scattering observables in massless gauge theories such as QCD. A central result of this paper is the formulation of the differential-equations method under the algebraic constraints stemming from four-dimensional kinematics, which in this case leaves only 8 independent scales. We show that these constraints imply that one must compute topologies with only up to 8 propagators, instead of the expected 9. This leads to the decoupling of entire classes of integrals that do not contribute to scattering amplitudes in four dimensional gauge theories. We construct a pure basis and derive their canonical differential equations, of which we discuss the numerical solution. This work marks an important step towards the calculation of massless $2\to 4$ scattering processes at two loops.</description>

      <title>Disentangling axion-like particle couplings to nucleons via a delayed signal in Super-Kamiokande from a future supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we show that, if axion-like particles (ALPs) from core-collapse supernovae (SNe) couple to protons, they would produce very characteristic signatures in neutrino water Cherenkov detectors through their scattering off free protons via $a \, p \rightarrow p \, \gamma$ interactions. Specifically, sub-MeV ALPs would generate photons with energies $\sim 30$ MeV, which could be observed by Super-Kamiokande and Hyper-Kamiokande as a delayed signal after a future detection of SN neutrinos. We apply this to a hypothetical neighbouring SN (at a maximum distance of 100 kpc) and demonstrate that the region in the parameter space with ALP masses between $10^{-4}$ MeV and $1$ MeV and ALP-proton couplings in the range $3 \times 10^{-6}-4 \times 10^{-5}$ could be probed. We argue that this new signature, combined with the one expected at $\sim 7$ MeV from oxygen de-excitation, would allow us to disentangle ALP-neutron and ALP-proton couplings.</description>

      <title>Search for sub-GeV Scalars in $e^+e^-$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light scalars that couple to leptons are common figures in beyond the Standard Model endeavors. Considering a scalar that has universal and couplings to leptons only, we compute this leptophilic scalar contribution to the $e^{-}e^{+} \rightarrow \tau^{+}\tau^{-} S $ production cross section with $S \rightarrow \ell^+\ell^-$. We later compare the expected signal with recent data from the Belle collaboration collected near the resonance $\Upsilon(4S)$ with $\mathcal{L}=626 fb^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity to place limits on the couplings-mass plane for the $4$~MeV-$6.5$~GeV mass range to show that Belle stands a great laboratory for light scalars, particularly excluding part of the parameter space in which the muon g-2 anomaly is addressed.</description>

      <title>Strong-Weak Bi-Adjoints, Gluon-W resonances, and new asymmetric LHC production processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a novel production and decay mechanism for a bi-adjoint spin zero particle in the (8,3,0) representation of the Standard Model gauge groups. This work is part of a series studying new production processes for exotic particles in higher representations of Standard Model color and weak charge. We study a new dimension 5 effective operator model which couples an exotic bi-adjoint scalar field to the SU(3) and SU(2) field strength tensors. We explore the W-gluon resonant decay of the charged component of this new exotic field. We discuss LHC production modes of the charged and neutral bi-adjoint state and find a new single production mode for the charged state that is the dominant LHC production mode for TeV-scale masses. We introduce a new HL-LHC search in this asymmetric W-gluon fusion process in which a single bi-adjoint is produced in association with a hard forward quark jet. We have 5 sigma discovery potential for bi-adjoint masses up to 3 TeV for 10 TeV scalar effective operator cutoffs. We also find 2 sigma sensitivity of HL-LHC for bi-adjoint masses up to 4 TeV and effective cut-offs in the 15 TeV range for the full 3 inverse atto-barn data set.</description>

      <title>Pion fragmentation functions from a quark-jet model in a functional approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elementary fragmentation function that describes the process $q\to \pi$ is predicted applying crossing and charge symmetry to the cut diagram of the pion valence quark distribution function. This elementary probability distribution defines the ladder-kernel of a quark jet fragmentation equation, which is solved self-consistently to obtain the full pion fragmentation function. The hadronization into a pion employs the complete Poincar\'e invariant Bethe-Salpeter wave function, though the overwhelming contribution to the fragmentation function is due the leading Bethe-Salpeter amplitude. Compared to a Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model prediction, the fragmentation function we obtain is enhanced in the range $z \lesssim 0.8$ but otherwise in good qualitative agreement. The full pion fragmentation function is overall greater than the elementary fragmentation function below $z\lesssim 0.6$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gauge covariance of the quark gap equation is compared for three quark-gluon vertices: the bare vertex, a Ball-Chiu like vertex constrained by the corresponding Slavnov-Taylor identity, and a full vertex including the transverse components derived from transverse Slavnov-Taylor identities. The covariance properties are verified with the chiral quark condensate and the pion decay constant in the chiral limit.</description>

      <title>The nucleon properties in finite temperature and density with vector meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the vector meson $\omega$ into the Quark Meson model, and study the impact of vector interactions on the properties of static hadrons using the mean-field approximation. The short-range repulsive force associated with vector interactions leads to an expansion of the root mean square radius of nucleons. While the mass of hadrons increases, the gap between this mass and the energy of the three free constituent quarks decreases, resulting in the instability of hadrons. Our study of nucleon mass and radius at finite temperature and density has potential applications for particle yield in heavy ion collisions and the mass-radius relationship in compact stars.</description>

      <title>Revisiting CMSSM with Non-Universal Gaugino Masses under Current Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the longstanding tension between the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM) and recent experimental data, we investigate non-universal gaugino masses within an SU(5) Grand Unified Theory (GUT) framework, focusing on the $\tilde{g}$-SUGRA scenario where $\lvert M_{3} \rvert \gg \lvert M_{1} \rvert, \lvert M_{2} \rvert$. This hierarchy enables a heavier gluino, thereby evading current experimental bounds on supersymmetric particles. Our analysis reveals that precise Higgs measurements place stringent constraints on the model, requiring $\tan\beta \gtrsim 5$ and $ M_{0} \gtrsim 20 \, \tan\beta \,\text{GeV}$. Although the $\tilde{g}$-SUGRA scenario can help reconcile the persistent $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly, the Higgs constraints significantly restrict its parameter space, making a large contribution to $(g-2)_{\mu}$ challenging. We also assess the discovery prospects in upcoming dark matter direct detection experiments, including PandaX-xT (200 t.y.), LZ (projected), and XENONnT (20 t.y.), which may not fully cover the viable parameter space. In contrast, future collider experiments$-$such as the High-Luminosity LHC at $3\,\mathrm{ab}^{-1}$ and $\mathrm{CLIC}_{1500}$ at $2.5\,\mathrm{ab}^{-1}$$-$can comprehensively probe the remaining regions. These findings highlight $\tilde{g}$-SUGRA as a promising solution to the CMSSM tension and offer clear, testable predictions for upcoming collider searches.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass ordering sensitivities at DUNE, HK and KNO in presence of scalar NSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limitations of the Standard Model in explaining neutrino masses and neutrino mixing lead to the exploration of frameworks beyond the Standard Model (BSM). The possibility of neutrinos interacting with fermions via a scalar mediator is one of the interesting prospects. The study of neutrino non-standard interactions (NSI) is a well-motivated phenomenological scenario to explore new physics beyond the Standard Model. These new interactions may alter the standard neutrino oscillation probabilities, potentially leading to observable effects in experiments. It also allows for the exploration of absolute neutrino masses via oscillation experiments. It can modify the oscillation probabilities, which in turn can affect the physics sensitivities in long-baseline experiments. The linear scaling of the effects of scalar NSI with matter density also motivates its exploration in long-baseline (LBL) experiments. We will present our study on the impact of a scalar-mediated NSI on the mass ordering (MO) sensitivities of three long-baseline neutrino experiments, i.e., DUNE, HK and KNO. We study the impact on MO sensitivities at these experiments assuming that scalar NSI parameters are present in nature and are known from other non-LBL experiments. The presence of scalar NSI can notably impact the MO sensitivities of these experiments. Furthermore, we analyze the potential synergy by combining data from DUNE with HK and HK+KNO, thereby exploring a broader parameter space.</description>

      <title>Dark Photons and Gravitino Like Particles: Complete EFT Operator Basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a more efficient method for constructing the complete EFT operator basis for particles of any mass and spin, based on on-shell method and Young tableaux. By classifying the amplitude bases according to the polarization configurations of massive particles and using their high-energy limit, our approach can construct EFT basis in a straightforward way, without need of auxiliary fields and tedious basis decomposition. Based on this improved method, we develop a Mathematica code that can automatically construct the EFT basis for particles of any spin. As applications, the EFT bases up to d=8 are explicitly constructed for dark photons and, for the first time, for spin-3/2 gravitino like particles.</description>

      <title>The Spectra of $p\bar\Lambda$ and $p\bar\Sigma$ Hexaquark States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the observation of the $J^P = 1^+$ resonance $X(2085)$ in the $p\bar{\Lambda}$ system by the BESIII collaboration, we studied the molecular states of hexaquarks $p\bar{\Lambda}$ and $p\bar{\Sigma}$ with baryon-antibaryon structures within the framework of the QCD sum rules. Non-perturbative contributions up to dimension 13 were considered in our analysis. The results indicate the existence of six possible molecular states $p\bar{\Lambda}$ and $p\bar{\Sigma}$, with quantum numbers $J^{P}=0^{-}, 0^{+}, 1^{-}$. Consequently, the current sum rule results do not support the interpretation of $X(2085)$ as a $p\bar{\Lambda}$ or $p\bar{\Sigma}$ molecular state. On the other hand, we find that the masses of the proposed $p\bar{\Lambda}$ and $p\bar{\Sigma}$ structures with $J^{P} = 1^{-}$ are in the vicinity of observed $X(2075)$, which implies that the nature of this state needs more invistigations. Moreover, the possible decay modes of the concerned hexaquark states are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Single Higgs boson production in association with a top quark through FCNSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the production and possible detection of a single Higgs boson in association with a top quark in proton-proton collisions ($pp \to th + X$) at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider. This process absent in the Standard Model is predicted by other models such as the Two-Higgs Doublet Model of type III, which is the theoretical framework adopted in this work. Promising results are found for specific scenarios of the model parameter space, which consist mainly of the parameters $\tan\beta$, $\cos(\alpha-\beta)$ and the parameter $\chi_{tc}$, responsible for the Flavor-Changing Neutral Scalar Interactions (FCNSI). Using the machine learning \textit{Boosted Decision Trees} algorithm, we predict \textit{signal significances} at level of $5\sigma$ for $\tan\beta=1$, $\cos(\alpha-\beta)=0.1$ and $\chi_{tc}=5$ and integrated luminosities in the range $2500\, {\rm fb}^{-1}\leq \mathcal{L}_{\rm int} \leq 3000 \, {\rm fb}^{-1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe our recent NNLO QCD extraction of the top-quark pole mass from fits to experimental data on total inclusive and normalized (multi)-differential cross sections for $t\bar{t} + X$ hadroproduction, using as input various modern PDF + $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ sets. We find top-quark mass values compatible among each other and with the PDG 2024 preferred value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the angular momentum balance for a particle undergoing Thomas precession. The relationships among relativistic torque, the center of mass, and the center of inertia for a spinning particle are clarified. We show that spin precession is accompanied by orbital angular momentum precession, and present examples of the resulting out-of-plane motion.</description>

      <title>The role of the $f_0(1710)$ and $a_0(1710)$ resonances in the $D^0 \to \rho^0 \phi$, $\omega \phi$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $D^0 \to \rho^0 \phi$, $\omega \phi$ decays which proceed in a direct mode via internal emission with equal rates. Yet, the experimental branching ratio for the $\rho^0 \phi$ mode is twice as big as that for the $\omega \phi$ mode. We find a natural explanation based on the extra indirect mechanism where $K^{*+} K^{*-}$ is produced via external emission and that channel undergoes final state interaction with other vector--vector channels to lead to the $\rho^0 \phi$, $\omega \phi$ final states, with transition amplitudes dominated by the $a_0(1710)$ resonance, recently discovered, and $f_0(1710)$ respectively. The large coupling of the $a_0(1710)$ to the $\rho^0 \phi$ channel is mostly responsible for this large ratio of the production rates.</description>

      <title>Final-state rescattering mechanism of bottom-baryon decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform an analysis on the non-leptonic two-body weak decays of $\Lambda^{0}_{b}$ within the framework of the final-state rescattering mechanism. The strong phases can be obtained by realizing complete hadronic triangle loop integrations. Then the CP violation and decay asymmetry parameters can be predicted. In this work, we focus on the exclusive decays of $\Lambda^{0}_{b}\to p\pi^{-}/K^{-}/\rho^{-}/K^{*-}$ and $\Lambda\phi$ and achieve numerical predictions for many observables, including branching ratios, direct and partial-wave CP asymmetries, and decay asymmetry parameters. The results are very consistent with the current data, showing the validity of the final-state rescattering mechanism for $b$-baryon decays. It is therefore expected to be applied to predict CP asymmetries in many other channels of $b$-baryon decays.</description>

      <title>Parity Violation on Longitudinal Single-Spin Asymmetries at the EicC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore two longitudinal single-spin asymmetries induced from parity violation in neutral-current deep inelastic scattering at the proposed Electron-ion collider in China (EicC): $A_{PV}^{e\,(p)}$ from longitudinally polarized (unpolarized) electrons scattering off unpolarized (longitudinally polarized) protons. We find $A_{PV}^e$, of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$, is generically one to three orders of magnitude larger than $A_{PV}^p$. We further estimate different uncertainty sources including statistics, parton distribution functions, and beam polarization, for both asymmetries, and then identify individually their dominance in different regimes of the Bjorken-$x$. Based on these results, we then advocate utilizing $A_{PV}^p$ for the extraction of the weak mixing angle at two representative momentum transfer scales unexplored before, and we find a relative precision below 10% can be achieved at the EicC with an effective one-year operation time.</description>

      <title>Flavour-Dependent Chemical Freeze-Out of Light Nuclei in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the production of light nuclei in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 7.7 - 200 GeV and Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV within a flavour-dependent freeze-out framework, assuming different flavoured hadrons undergo separate chemical freeze-out. Using the Thermal-FIST package, thermal parameters extracted from fits to various sets of hadron yields, including and excluding light nuclei, are used to calculate the ratios of the yields of light nuclei, namely, $d/p$, $\bar{d}/\bar{p}$, $t/p$, and $t/d$. A comparison with data from the STAR and ALICE collaborations shows that a sequential freeze-out scenario provides a better description of light nuclei yield ratios than the traditional single freeze-out approach. These results suggest the flavour-dependent chemical freeze-out for final state light-nuclei production persists in heavy-ion collisions at both RHIC and LHC energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a possible interpretation of excesses reported by ATLAS and CMS at around 95GeV, 650GeV and possibly 320GeV, in terms of CP-even scalars. In particular, the combined {\sl global} statistical significances of independent indications for a 650GeV object reach the $4\sigma$ level! While this seems sufficient incentive for a further investigation, this object cannot be fitted in tradional singlet or doublet extensions of the Standard Model. It requires by itself a larger extension with doubly-charged scalars, that naturally fits the two other excesses on top of the SM-like 125~GeV Higgs. We describe the minimal model and give some numerical illustrations.</description>

      <title>Regge poles and cuts and the Lipatov vertex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering amplitudes in the high-energy limit can be described in terms of their singularity structure in the complex angular momentum plane, consisting of Regge poles and cuts. In QCD, gluon Reggeization has long been understood as a manifestation of a Regge pole, but until recently Reggeization violation remained largely obscure. New methods, based on iterative solution of rapidity evolution equations, facilitate direct computation of components of the amplitude which are mediated by multi-Reggeon exchange, a manifestation of Regge cuts. Upon disentangling the Regge cut from the pole we are now able to extract the pole parameters from state-of-the-art fixed-order computations (3 loops) and make predictions regarding certain components of the amplitude to higher loop orders. In this talk I review the key ideas which led to this progress, describe where we stand in exploring the structure of 2 -&gt; 2 and 2 -&gt; 3 amplitudes in the (multi-) Regge limit, and comment on the interplay between this research and the study of infrared factorization.</description>

      <title>The Two-Loop Lipatov Vertex in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy factorization of 2 -&gt; 2 amplitudes in QCD has been recently pushed to the next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic order by determining the three-loop gluon Regge trajectory. This was based on computing multi-Reggeon exchanges using rapidity evolution in the shock-wave formalism, and disentangling between the Regge pole and Regge cut contributions. In the present paper we extend the relevant theoretical framework to 2 -&gt; 3 processes, and compute all multi-Reggeon exchanges necessary for extracting the two-loop Reggeon-gluon-Reggeon Lipatov vertex from 2 -&gt; 3 amplitudes. Then, specializing general amplitude methods to multi-Regge kinematics, we derive analytic expressions for non-planar two-loop gg -&gt; ggg, gq -&gt; ggq and qq -&gt; qgq QCD amplitudes in that limit. Matching these to the multi-Reggeon computation, we determine the QCD Lipatov vertex in dimensional regularization at two loops through finite terms. We also determine the one-loop vertex through O(epsilon^4). All results are expressed in a compact form in terms of a basis of single-valued generalised polylogarithms, manifesting target-projectile symmetry and reality properties. Furthermore, our basis of functions is explicitly finite in the soft limit, featuring delicate cancellation of spurious rational poles by transcendental functions. Agreement between all three partonic channels, as well agreement of the maximal weight contributions with the super Yang-Mills Lipatov vertex provide robust checks of the result.</description>

      <title>Refining lower bounds on sterile neutrino dark matter mass from estimates of phase space densities in dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are recognized as being highly dominated by Dark Matter (DM), making them excellent targets for testing DM models through astrophysical observations. One effective method involves estimating the coarse-grained phase-space density (PSD) of the galactic DM component. By comparing this PSD with that of DM particles produced in the early Universe, it is possible to establish lower bounds on the DM particle mass. These constraints are particularly relevant for models of warm DM, such as those involving sterile neutrinos. Utilizing the GravSphere code, we obtain a fit of the DM PSD based on the latest reliable stellar dynamics data for twenty of the darkest dSphs, refining earlier lower bounds on sterile neutrino masses in non-resonant production scenarios. Additionally, we introduce an alternative approach involving the Excess Mass Function (EMF), which yields even tighter constraints. Specifically, using the maximum PSD, we derive a lower bound of $m&gt;1.02$ keV at 95% confidence level, while the EMF method provides a stronger limit of $m&gt;1.98$ keV at 95% CL. Both methods are versatile and can be extended to more complex DM production mechanisms in the early Universe. For the first time, we also constrain parameters of models involving non-standard cosmologies during the epoch of neutrino production. Our analysis yields $m&gt;2.54$ keV for models with kination domination and $m&gt;4.71$ keV for scenarios with extremely low reheating temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore models where single new exotic states interact with the Standard Model through an asymmetric Standard Model portal with couplings to at least one quark and one lepton. We write down all effective operators up to dimension six where such interactions couple the SM to spin 0 and spin 1/2 particles. We identify the exotic states accessible through the portal and find the interactions couple the SM to new particles with exotic combinations of baryon and lepton number, and particles with unusual SM charge, including states in higher dimensional representations of both SU(3) and SU(2), and states of higher electric charge. We discuss the phenomenology of these interactions including novel particle decays, and we classify some of the collider production modes for exotic states at LHC, LHeC and the muon collider.</description>

Abstract: In the present work, the connection between the smallness of the neutrino masses and the stability of the proton is studied. We analyze this connection from different perspectives: the smallness of neutrino mass and the proton stability originate from the same source, small neutrino masses lead to a long lived proton, and the smallness of the proton decay width as a cause of the naturally small neutrino masses. All the schemes are studied in detail and UV realizations are given. We discuss advantages of each scheme and outline further investigation directions.</description>

      <title>Possible scenario of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the instanton liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on simulations of the interacting instanton liquid model (IILM) with three flavor quarks, we compute the free energy density of the QCD vacuum as a function of the quark condensate. We evaluate the second derivative of the free energy density with respect to the quark condensate at the origin. This evaluation makes us to examine whether chiral symmetry breaking in the IILM occurs in an anomaly-driven way. Such a breaking pattern of chiral symmetry has been proposed by a previous study to connect the QCD vacuum structure with the meson propoerties, such as the sigma meson mass. We also perform the quenched simulations, in which no dynamical quarks interact with instantons. This simulation helps us to understand the pattern of chiral symmetry brekaing in the IILM by comparing the full calculation results. We find that in the full IILM chiral symmetry is broken in anomaly-driven way, while for the quenched IILM chiral symmetry is broken in ordinary manner. From these results, we expect that chiral symmetry can be broken in anomaly-driven way even in the real QCD and in phenomena where chiral symmetry breaking plays a crucial role the anomaly effect may also play an important role.</description>

      <title>Emergence, Formation and Dynamics of Hot QCD Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we make progress in two concrete directions in the vast landscape of hot QCD physics. The first one is quarkonium transport inside quark-gluon plasma (QGP), the high temperature phase of QCD. Over the past two decades it has been realized that a significant fraction of quarkonium suppression in high energy heavy ion collisions comes from dynamic dissociation and recombination processes, instead of static screening of the interaction potential as originally proposed by Matsui and Satz. Our contribution is the formulation of the precise correlation functions in QCD at finite temperature that describe the dissociation and recombination processes of heavy quarkonium in QGP, as well as their calculation in weakly coupled QCD and strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We also formulate the Euclidean version of these correlation functions so that they may be calculated using Lattice QCD techniques. The second contribution we make is the development of tools to understand the process of hydrodynamization in QCD kinetic theory and their application to a simplified description where only a subset of the QCD scattering mechanisms are included. By doing this, we learn that the process of hydrodynamization in this theory, and specifically, how memory of the initial condition is lost, follows the recently proposed Adiabatic Hydrodynamization scenario. Concretely, hydrodynamization proceeds through a sequential process in which a monotonously shrinking set of low-energy states dominate the dynamics, where the opening of an energy gap relative to the ground state(s) signals the start of each stage of this process. The hydrodynamic attractor is reached when only one low-energy state remains as the ground state, and the system approaches local thermal equilibrium following the adiabatic evolution of this low-energy state.</description>

      <title>Probing Long-Range Forces Between Neutrinos with Cosmic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the consequences of new long-range forces between neutrinos on cosmic scales. If these forces are a few orders of magnitude stronger than gravity, they can induce perturbation instability in the non-relativistic cosmic neutrino background in the late time universe. As a result, the cosmic neutrino background may form nonlinear bound states instead of free-streaming. The implications of the formation of nonlinear neutrino bound states include enhancing matter perturbations and triggering star formation. Based on existing measurements of the matter power spectrum and reionization history, we place new constraints on long-range forces between neutrinos with ranges lying in $1 \text{ kpc}\lesssim m_\phi^{-1} \lesssim 10 \text{ Mpc}$.</description>

      <title>Baryon number violating hydrogen decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most studies on baryon number violating (BNV) processes in the literature focus on free or bound nucleons in nuclei, with limited attention given to the decay of bound atoms. Given that hydrogen is the most abundant atom in the universe, it is particularly intriguing to investigate the decay of hydrogen atom as a means to probe BNV interactions. In this study, for the first time, we employ a robust effective field theory (EFT) approach to estimate the decay widths of two-body decays of hydrogen atom into standard model particles, by utilizing the constraints on the EFT cutoff scale derived from conventional nucleon decay processes. We integrate low energy effective field theory (LEFT), chiral perturbation theory (ChPT), and standard model effective field theory (SMEFT) to formulate the decay widths in terms of the LEFT and SMEFT Wilson coefficients (WCs), respectively. By applying the bounds on the WCs from conventional nucleon decays, we provide a conservative estimate on hydrogen BNV decays. Our findings indicate that the bounds on the inverse partial widths of all dominant two-body decays exceed $10^{44}$ years. Among these modes, the decay into two photons, ${\rm H}\to \gamma\gamma$, is particularly interesting, as it is the least constrained. This mode could be searched for in hydrogen-rich stellar environments by its distinct signature of 469.4 MeV gamma photons.</description>

      <title>Probing Light Bosonic Dark Matter with Transmon Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the constraints of the transmon qubit, an improved version of the charge qubit, on bosonic light dark matters. Phonon excitations induced by the scattering or absorption of dark matter on a superconductor may destroy the Cooper pair, leading to the production of quasiparticles made by the electron. By measuring the production rate of the quasiparticle density, one may read out the coupling between dark matter and ordinary matter, assuming that these quasiparticles are solely induced by dark matter interactions. For the first time, we show constraints on the parameter space of the dark photon, light scalar dark matter, and axion-like particles from the measurement of quasiparticles in transmon qubit experiments. This study offers insights for the development of quantum qubit experiments aimed at the direct detection of dark matter in underground laboratories.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopic study of the $S=-1$ meson-baryon interaction: $K^-p$, $\pi^-\Lambda$ and $K^+\Xi^-$ correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the femtoscopic correlation functions of meson-baryon pairs in the strangeness $S=-1$ sector, employing unitarized s-wave scattering amplitudes derived from the chiral Lagrangian up to next-to-leading order. For the first time, we deliver predictions on the $\pi^-\Lambda$ and $K^+\Xi^-$ correlation functions which are feasible to be measured at the Large Hadron Collider. We also demonstrate that the employed model is perfectly capable of reproducing the $K^-p$ correlation function data measured by the same collaboration, without the need to modify the coupling strength to the $\bar{K}^0n$ channel, as has been recently suggested. In all cases, the effects of the source size on the correlation are tested. In addition, we present detailed analysis of the different coupled-channel contributions, together with the quantification of the relative relevance of the different terms in the interaction.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of bosonic matter with additional derivative interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equation of state of uncharged bosonic matter is studied within a field-theoretical approach in the mean-field approximation. Interaction of bosons is described by a scalar field $\sigma$ with a Skyrme-like potential which contains both attractive and repulsive terms. Additionally we introduce the derivative interaction by including factor $(1+\lambda\sigma)^{-1}$ in the kinetic part of Lagrangian where $\lambda &gt; 0$ is the model parameter. Numerical calculations are made for strongly interacting matter composed of $\alpha$ particles. It is shown that ground-state binding energy and equilibrium density of such matter drop with increasing $\lambda$. The liquid-gas phase transition and the Bose-Einstein condensation are studied by using different thermodynamic variables. We calculate also spinodal lines which give boundaries of metastable states. It is demonstrated that critical temperature decreases with $\lambda$. Both LGPT and bound condensate states disappear above certain maximum value of $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Searches for Power-Law Warped Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extra dimensions with a bulk dilaton field can be power-law warped, unlike the exponential warping in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. We show that this mildly warped extra dimension can address the hierarchy problem with a novel Kaluza-Klein (KK) spectrum characterized by lighter feebly coupled KK modes compared to the KK modes in the RS model. We investigate the prospects of searching for signatures of such KK modes at current and future colliders, such as the LHC, CLIC, and FCC-ee using visible decays of KK gravitons. We also update the current bounds and projected limits for the RS model and the linear dilaton (LD) model. Furthermore, we explore the long-lived regime of KK gravitons at Belle II, beam dump experiments, e.g., FASER2, MATHUSLA, and SHiP, as well as constraints from astrophysical and cosmological observations. We find that combining both kinds of searches will enable comprehensive coverage of the model parameter space relevant to the electroweak hierarchy problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the standard top-quark Yukawa coupling with a dimension-6 operator in order to accommodate a CP violating complex phase with manifest gauge invariance. This leads to a new $ttHH$ contact interaction, along with many Goldstone boson couplings. We investigate the impact of the new interactions on a muon collider process $\mu^-\mu^+\to \nu_\mu\bar{\nu}_\mu t\bar{t}H$ compared with the standard dimension-4 top-Yukawa coupling. The unitarity bounds on the coefficient of the new physics operator is obtained from $W^-_LW^+_L$ and $HH$ initiated processes.</description>

      <title>Time modulation of weak nuclear decays as a probe of axion dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the time modulation of weak nuclear decays as a method to probe axion dark matter. To this end, we develop a theoretical framework to compute the $\theta$-dependence of weak nuclear decays, including electron capture and $\beta$ decay, which enables us to predict the time variation of weak radioactivity in response to an oscillating axion dark matter background. As an application, we recast old data sets, from the weak nuclear decays of ${^{40}\text{K}}$ and ${^{137}\text{Cs}}$ taken at the underground Gran Sasso Laboratory, in order to set constraints on the axion decay constant, specifically in the axion mass range from few $10^{-23}\;$eV up to $10^{-19}\;$eV. We finally propose a new measurement at the Gran Sasso Laboratory, based on the weak nuclear decay of ${^{40}\text{K}}$ via electron capture, in order to explore even shorter timescales, thus reaching sensitivities to axion masses up to $10^{-9}\;$eV.</description>

      <title>NNLOCAL: completely local subtractions for color-singlet production in hadron collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present NNLOCAL, a proof-of-concept parton-level Monte Carlo program implementing the extension of the completely local subtraction scheme CoLoRFulNNLO to the case of color-singlet production in hadron collisions. We have built general local subtraction terms that regularize all single and double unresolved infrared singularities in real radiation phase space. The subtractions are then integrated fully analytically to the required order in the parameter of dimensional regularization. Combining the integrated counterterms with the virtual contributions we demonstrate the cancellation of all infrared poles explicitly. We validate our procedure by computing the fully differential cross section for the production of a Higgs boson at the LHC in an effective field theory with gluons only. Our code provides the first public implementation of a completely local analytic subtraction scheme at next-to-next-to-leading order accuracy.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Signatures of Neutrino Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tiny neutrino masses are most naturally explained by the seesaw mechanism through singlet right-handed neutrinos, which can further explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. In this work, we propose a new approach to study cosmological signatures of neutrino seesaw through the interaction between inflaton and right-handed neutrinos. After inflation the inflaton predominantly decays into right-handed neutrinos and its decay rate is modulated by the fluctuations of Higgs field which act as the source of curvature perturbations. We demonstrate that this modulation produces primordial non-Gaussian signatures, which can be measured by the forthcoming large-scale structure surveys. We find that these surveys have the potential to probe a large portion of the neutrino seesaw parameter space, opening up a new window for testing the high scale seesaw mechanism.</description>

      <title>Tame multi-leg Feynman integrals beyond one loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel structure for Feynman integrals, reformulating them as integrals over a small set of parameters with a fully controllable integrand. The integrand closely resembles one-loop Feynman integrals, and they are very easy to handle. Remarkably, the number of remaining integration parameters is independent of the number of external legs and small -- at most 2 for two-loop integrals and 5 for three-loop integrals -- facilitating the application of a wide range of established methods, both specific to Feynman integrals and more general techniques. This approach is expected to mitigate the computational challenges of multi-loop, multi-leg Feynman integrals. As a proof of concept, we successfully computed two-loop non-planar Feynman integrals with six external legs, demonstrating high efficiency.</description>

      <title>Efficient Computation of One-Loop Feynman Integrals and Fixed-Branch Integrals to High Orders in $\epsilon$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method, called the dimension-changing transformation (DCT), to compute one-loop Feynman integrals and recently introduced fixed-branch integrals to arbitrary orders in $\epsilon$. The DCT relates one-loop Feynman integrals or fixed-branch integrals in one spacetime dimension to their corresponding quantities with auxiliary mass in any other dimension, making the expansion to high orders in $\epsilon$ highly efficient. We applied this method to several examples to demonstrate its validity and efficiency. The approach introduced in this work has been implemented in an open-source C++ package, available at \href{https://gitlab.com/multiloop-pku/dct}{https://gitlab.com/multiloop-pku/dct}.</description>

Abstract: The evolution of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distributions in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) can be formulated in a parton branching (PB) framework. We show that next-to-next-to-leading-logarithm (NNLL) accuracy can be achieved in this framework by using the concept of soft-gluon physical coupling. We present results for the TMD distributions and for the Collins-Soper kernel controlling rapidity evolution. The results pave the way for PB predictions at NNLL level for physical observables at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and future colliders.</description>

      <title>Probing Gravitational Dark Matter with Ultra-high Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evidence for the existence of dark matter (DM) is compelling, yet its nature remains elusive. A particularly interesting and minimal scenario involves DM with pure gravitational interactions. In the early Universe, such DM can be unavoidably generated via annihilation of particles in the standard model (SM) thermal plasma. It is known that the SM thermal plasma also produces gravitational waves (GWs). In this study, we point out a simple and tight connection between the amplitude of the thermal GWs and the properties of pure gravitational DM. Notably, future GW experiments in the ultra-high frequency regime have the potential to shed light on the mass and spin of pure gravitational DM.</description>

      <title>Strange-antistrange and charm-anticharm asymmetries of pion in 't Hooft model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a sequel of our preceding work [S. Hu et al., Phys. Rev. D 108 (2023) 9, 094040], we investigate the strange-antistrange and charm-anticharm asymmetries in the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of a light flavored meson, exemplified by the first excited pion in the 't Hooft model, {\it viz.}, QCD in two spacetime dimensions with infinite number of colors. Counted as an ${\cal O}(1/N_c)$ effect, the intrinsic strange content necessarily originates from the higher Fock component of the light flavored meson, which entails infinite towers of $K$ and $\overline{K}$ mesons. Numerical studies reveal that, with $m_u/m_d=1/2$, the $s$-$\bar{s}$ and $c$-$\bar{c}$ asymmetries of the first excited $\pi^-$ can reach per cents level. While the $s$-$\bar{s}$ asymmetry predicted from the meson cloud model (MCM) grossly align with the rigorous approach, there exists severe discrepancy between two approaches on the $c$-$\bar{c}$ asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Accidental Peccei-Quinn Symmetry From Gauged U(1) and a High Quality Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct explicit models that solve the axion quality problem originating from quantum gravitational effects. The general strategy we employ is to supplement the Standard Model and its grand unified extensions by an anomaly-free axial $U(1)_a$ symmetry that is gauged. We show that for several choices of the gauge quantum numbers of the fermions, this setup leads to an accidental $U(1)$ symmetry with a QCD anomaly which is identified as the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry that solves the strong CP problem. The $U(1)_a$ gauge symmetry controls the amount of explicit PQ symmetry violation induced by quantum gravity, resulting in a high quality axion. We present two classes of models employing this strategy. In the first class (models I and II), the axial $U(1)_a$ gauge symmetry acts on vector-like quarks leading to an accidental KSVZ-type axion. The second class (model III) is based on $SO(10)$ grand unified theory extended by a gauged $U(1)_a$ symmetry that leads to a hybrid KSVZ--DFSZ type axion. The couplings of the axion to the electron and the nucleon are found to be distinct in this class of hybrid models from those in the KSVZ and DFSZ models, which can be used to test these models. Interestingly, all models presented here have domain wall number of one, which is free of cosmological problems that typically arise in axion models.</description>

      <title>Measuring Quantum Discord at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been an increasing interest in exploring quantities associated with quantum information at colliders. We perform a detailed analysis describing how to measure the quantum discord in the top anti-top quantum state at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). While for pure states, quantum discord, entanglement, and Bell nonlocality all probe the same correlations, for mixed states they probe different aspects of quantum correlations. The quantum discord, in particular, is interesting because it aims to encapsulate all correlations between systems that cannot have a classical origin. We employ two complementary approaches for the study of the top anti-top system, namely the decay method and the kinematic method. We highlight subtleties associated with measuring discord for reconstructed quantum states at colliders. Usually quantum discord is difficult to compute due to an extremization that must be performed. We show, however, that for the $t\bar{t}$ system this extremization can be performed analytically and we provide closed-form formulas for the quantum discord. We demonstrate that at the high luminosity LHC, discord is projected to be measurable with a precision of approximately 5% using the decay method and sub-percent levels using the kinematic method. Even with current LHC datasets, discord can be measured with 1-2% precision with the kinematic method. By systematically investigating quantum discord for the first time through a detailed collider analysis, this work expands the toolkit for quantum information studies in particle physics and lays the groundwork for deeper insights into the quantum properties in high-energy collisions.</description>

      <title>Probing Heavy Axion-like Particles from Massive Stars with X-rays and Gamma Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hot interiors of massive stars in the later stages of their evolution provide an ideal place for the production of heavy axion-like particles (ALPs) with mass up to O(100 keV) range. We show that a fraction of these ALPs could stream out of the stellar photosphere and subsequently decay into two photons that can be potentially detected on or near the Earth. In particular, we estimate the photon flux originating from the spontaneous decay of heavy ALPs produced inside Horizontal Branch and Wolf-Rayet stars, and assess its detectability by current and future $X$-ray and gamma-ray telescopes. Our results indicate that current and future telescopes can probe axion-photon couplings down to $g_{a\gamma} \sim 4\times 10^{-11}$ GeV${}^{-1}$ for $m_a\sim 10-100$ keV, which covers new ground in the ALP parameter space.</description>

      <title>Precise Determination of the Strong Coupling Constant from Dijet Cross Sections up to the Multi-TeV Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the value of the strong coupling $\alpha_\text{s}$ and study its running over a wide range of scales as probed by the dijet production process at hadron colliders, based on an NNLO QCD analysis of LHC dijet data. From a large subset of these data a value of $\alpha_\text{s} (m_\text{Z}) = 0.1178 \pm 0.0022$ is obtained for the strong coupling at the scale of the Z-boson mass $m_\text{Z}$, using the invariant mass of the dijet system to select the scale where $\alpha_\text{s}$ is probed. The combination of different data sets enhances the reach and precision of the analysis in the mutli-TeV range and allows for the first determination of $\alpha_\text{s}$ up to scales of 7 TeV. Complementing the LHC data with dijet cross sections measured at the HERA electron-proton collider, the kinematic range is extended to test the running of the strong coupling towards smaller scales. Our results exhibit excellent agreement with predictions based on the renormalization group equation of QCD, and represent a comprehensive test of the asymptotic behavior of QCD, spanning more than three orders of magnitude in energy scale.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms for the simulation of QCD processes in the perturbative regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical predictions for high-energy collision processes at particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), rely on calculations in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which are often computationally challenging. In these conference proceedings, we explore the possibility of using quantum computers to simulate QCD processes in the perturbative QCD regime. In particular, as a first step towards that goal, we present quantum circuits to simulate the colour part of perturbative QCD. The circuits are validated by implementing them on a simulated quantum computer and verifying the colour factors for several example Feynman diagrams.</description>

      <title>Vector-like quark doublets, weak-basis invariants and CP violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Standard Model extensions with isodoublet vector-like quarks with standard charges. Their presence induces right-handed charged and neutral currents. We identify minimal sets of independent parameters characterizing these extensions, describe useful weak bases, and provide parameterizations for all quark mixing. We analyze the intricacies of CP violation in such scenarios, finding a complete set of CP-odd invariants for the single doublet case. Crucially, we uncover a connection between weak-basis invariants and effective rephasing invariants involving only standard quarks. These results allow us to explore the phenomenology of doublet vector-like quarks through a rephasing-invariant analysis, with an emphasis on CP violation, including the potential role of these fields in explaining the Cabibbo angle anomalies.</description>

      <title>Two-component Dark Matter and low scale Thermal Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observable cosmos exhibits sizable baryon asymmetry, small active neutrino masses, and the presence of dark matter (DM). To address these phenomena together, we propose a two component DM scenario in an extension of Scotogenic model, imposing $\mathbb{Z}_2 \otimes \mathbb{Z}_2^{\prime}$ symmetry. The electroweak sphaleron process converts the $\rm Y_{B-L}^{}$ yield, generated through the Leptogenesis mechanism, into the baryon asymmetry ($\rm Y_{\Delta B}^{}$) at $T_{\rm sph}\sim 131.7$ GeV, the sphalerons decoupling temperature. In this framework, the CP asymmetry as well as the radiative neutrino mass generation explicitly involve the two DM particles, thus establishing a correlation between the baryon asymmetry, DM and observed active neutrino masses. We study in details the allowed parameter space available after considering all the constraints from the three phenomena as well as from the collider search limits, and outline the region which could potentially be tested in future DM detection experiments through direct or indirect detection searches, lepton flavor-violating decays, etc.</description>

      <title>Semi-Classical Spin Hydrodynamics in Flat and Curved Spacetime: Covariance, Linear Waves, and Bjorken Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore various aspects of semi-classical spin hydrodynamics, where hydrodynamic currents are derived from an expansion in the reduced Planck constant $\hbar$, incorporating both flat and curved spacetimes. After establishing covariant definitions for angular momentum currents, we demonstrate that the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor requires modifications involving the Riemann curvature and the spin tensors. We also revise pseudo-gauge transformations to ensure their applicability in curved spacetimes. Key assumptions for semi-classical spin hydrodynamics are introduced, enabling studies without explicitly invoking quantum kinetic theory. We derive and analyze the linearized semi-classical spin hydrodynamic equations, proving that spin and fluid modes decouple in the linear regime. As a concrete example, we study the ideal-spin approximation in a dissipative fluid with shear viscosity. This analysis confirms our general result: the damping of spin waves is governed solely by spin relaxation time coefficients, independent of linear fluid perturbations. We also examine the Gibbs stability criterion and reveal its limitations at first order in $\hbar$, signaling the inherent anisotropy of the equilibrium state, which remains unaddressed in current semi-classical spin hydrodynamics formulations. Finally, within a conformal Bjorken flow background and using the slow-roll approximation attractor for the fluid sector, we show that the relaxation of the spin potential is governed by spin relaxation time coefficients, mirroring the damping behavior of spin waves in the linear regime.</description>

      <title>Constituent Quark Model and nucleon-Nucleon Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In these notes, while focusing on the meson-nucleon vertices, we give a derivation of the nucleon-nucleon 9NN) potentials from meson-exchange between quarks. To establish such a relation the quark-quark-meson (QQM) interactions are properly defined. Hitherto, the coefficients in the Pauli-spinor expansion of the meson-nucleon-nucleon (NNM) vertices are equated with those of the QQM-vertices. In these notes we employ the description of the nucleon with Dirac-spinors in the SU(6) semi-relativistic "constituent" quark-model (CQM) as formulated by LeYouanc, et al. It appears that the constituent quark model with $m_q= M_N/3$, is able to produce the same ratio's for the central-, spin-spin-, tensor-, spin-orbit-, and quadratic-spin-orbit Pauli-invariants as in the phenomenological NNM-vertices. In order to achieve this, the scalar-, magnetic-vector, and axial-vector interactions require, besides the standard ones, an extra coupling to the quarks without the introduction of new parameters. in the case of the axial-vector mesons an extra coupling to the quarks is necessary, which is related to the quark orbital angular momentum contribution to the nucleon spin. Furthermore, a momentum correlation between the quark that is coupled to the meson and the remaining quark pair, and a (gaussian) QQM form factor, are necessary to avoid "spurious" terms. From these results we have obtained a formulation of the QQ-interactions which is directly related to the NN extended-soft-core (ESC) interactions. This has been applied to mixed quark-nuclear matter in a study of (heavy) neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Moments to All Orders from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the traditional moments approach in lattice QCD, based on operator product expansion (OPE), can be realized in a way that avoids power divergent mixings, and thus allows to extract moments order by order, to all orders in principle. We propose to use momentum instead of distance as a leverage to extract moments at a given order. Moreover, by utilizing symmetry of the lattice matrix elements, we can determine the even and odd moments separately. As a demonstrative example, we determine the first three moments beyond the tensor charge gT of the isovector quark transversity distribution in the nucleon.</description>

      <title>Cosmohedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been a long-standing challenge to find a geometric object underlying the cosmological wavefunction for Tr($\phi^3$) theory, generalizing associahedra and surfacehedra for scattering amplitudes. In this note we describe a new class of polytopes -- "cosmohedra" -- that provide a natural solution to this problem. Cosmohedra are intimately related to associahedra, obtained by "blowing up" faces of the associahedron in a simple way, and we provide an explicit realization in terms of facet inequalities that further "shave" the facet inequalities of the associahedron. We also discuss a novel way for computing the wavefunction from cosmohedron geometry that extends the usual connection with polytope canonical forms. We illustrate cosmohedra with examples at tree-level and one loop; the close connection to surfacehedra suggests the generalization to all loop orders. We also briefly describe "cosmological correlahedra" for full correlators. We speculate on how the existence of cosmohedra might suggest a "stringy" formulation for the cosmological wavefunction/correlators, generalizing the way in which the Minkowski sum decomposition of associahedra naturally extend particle to string amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the hard exclusive $\pi^{0}$ muoproduction cross section at COMPASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new and detailed measurement of the cross section for hard exclusive neutral-pion muoproduction on the proton was performed in a wide kinematic region, with the photon virtuality $Q^2$ ranging from 1 to 8 (GeV/$c$)$^{\rm\, 2}$ and the Bjorken variable $x_{\rm Bj}$ ranging from 0.02 to 0.45. The data were collected at COMPASS at CERN using 160 GeV/$c$ longitudinally polarised $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$ beams scattering off a 2.5 m long liquid hydrogen target. From the average of the measured $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$ cross sections, the virtual-photon--proton cross section is determined as a function of the squared four-momentum transfer between the initial and final state proton in the range 0.08 (GeV/$c$)$^{\rm\, 2}$ $&lt; |t| &lt;$ 0.64 (GeV/$c$)$^{\rm\, 2}$. From its angular distribution, the combined contribution of transversely and longitudinally polarised photons are determined, as well as transverse--transverse and longitudinal--transverse interference contributions. They are studied as functions of four-momentum transfer $|t|$, photon virtuality $Q^2$ and virtual-photon energy $\nu$. The longitudinal--transverse interference contribution is found to be compatible with zero. The significant transverse--transverse interference contribution reveals the existence of a dominant contribution by transversely polarized photons. This provides clear experimental evidence for the chiral-odd GPD $\overline{E}_T$. In addition, the existence of a non-negligible contribution of longitudinally polarized photons is suggested by the $|t|$-dependence of the cross section at $x_{\rm Bj} &lt; $ 0.1 . Altogether, these results provide valuable input for future modelling of GPDs and thus of cross sections for exclusive pseudo-scalar meson production. Furthermore, they can be expected to facilitate the study of next-to-leading order corrections and higher-twist contributions.</description>

      <title>Search for Solar Boosted Dark Matter Particles at the PandaX-4T Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel constraint on light dark matter utilizing $1.54$ tonne$\cdot$year of data acquired from the PandaX-4T dual-phase xenon time projection chamber. This constraint is derived through detecting electronic recoil signals resulting from the interaction with solar-enhanced dark matter flux. Low-mass dark matter particles, lighter than a few MeV/$c^2$, can scatter with the thermal electrons in the Sun. Consequently, with higher kinetic energy, the boosted dark matter component becomes detectable via contact scattering with xenon electrons, resulting in a few keV energy deposition that exceeds the threshold of PandaX-4T. We calculate the expected recoil energy in PandaX-4T considering the Sun's acceleration and the detection capabilities of the xenon detector. The first experimental search results using the xenon detector yield the most stringent cross-section of $3.51 \times 10^{-39}~\mathrm{cm}^2$ at $0.08~\mathrm{MeV}$/$c^2$ for a solar boosted dark matter mass ranging from $0.02$ to $10~ \mathrm{MeV}$/$c^2$, achieving a 23 fold improvement compared with earlier experimental studies.</description>

      <title>The nucleon properties in finite temperature and density with Gaussian fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of nucleons at finite temperature and density using a two-flavor quark meson model with Gaussian fluctuations that extend beyond the mean-field approximation. Our findings suggest that Gaussian fluctuations lead to a non-monotonic behavior of the nucleon mass as a function of temperature and density, which may play an important role in the study of the hadronization process of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Moreover, we observe an increase in the nucleon radius due to Gaussian fluctuations, suggesting an effective repulsive force akin to the Casimir effect, as observed in the gold-bromobenzene-silica system. This study offers new insights into how temperature, density, and quantum fluctuations affect the structure and properties of nucleons under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Spectral sum rules and phase transition in strongly coupled QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By incorporating contributions from both the (chromo)electric scale $gT$ and (chromo)magnetic scale $g^2T$, we establish spectral sum rules of quarks for strongly coupled QCD that respect Fermi-Dirac statistics as required by quantum mechanics. In sharp contrast to QED and weakly coupled QCD whose spectral functions consist of discontinuous zero-dimensional (poles) and one-dimensional (branch cuts) non-analytic contributions from real energy $p_0 \in \mathbb{R}$, the derived spectral function for strongly coupled quarks features continuous but non-analytic contributions from complex energy $p_0 \in \mathbb{C}$ that are two-dimensional in nature. In light of the novel sum rules, we uncover an intrinsic QCD transition between a three-mode phase at small coupling and a one-mode phase at large coupling. The transition is induced by the magnetic scale that generates a massless hydro-like mode with the genuine non-Abelian feature of positivity violation and serving as the Goldstone mode of the Lorentz symmetry breaking. The thermal mass serves as an order parameter of the transition and vanishes at large coupling in line with phenomenological predictions from Dyson-Schwinger equations and gauge/gravity duality. This result provides novel insights into the mechanism of the QCD deconfinement transition.</description>

      <title>Learning physical unknowns from hydrodynamic shock and material interface features in ICF capsule implosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high energy density physics (HEDP) and inertial confinement fusion (ICF), predictive modeling is complicated by uncertainty in parameters that characterize various aspects of the modeled system, such as those characterizing material properties, equation of state (EOS), opacities, and initial conditions. Typically, however, these parameters are not directly observable. What is observed instead is a time sequence of radiographic projections using X-rays. In this work, we define a set of sparse hydrodynamic features derived from the outgoing shock profile and outer material edge, which can be obtained from radiographic measurements, to directly infer such parameters. Our machine learning (ML)-based methodology involves a pipeline of two architectures, a radiograph-to-features network (R2FNet) and a features-to-parameters network (F2PNet), that are trained independently and later combined to approximate a posterior distribution for the parameters from radiographs. We show that the estimated parameters can be used in a hydrodynamics code to obtain density fields and hydrodynamic shock and outer edge features that are consistent with the data. Finally, we demonstrate that features resulting from an unknown EOS model can be successfully mapped onto parameters of a chosen analytical EOS model, implying that network predictions are learning physics, with a degree of invariance to the underlying choice of EOS model.</description>

      <title>Stiffening of matter in quark-hadron continuity: a mini-review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of neutron stars, combined with causality, thermodynamic stability, and nuclear constraints, indicate rapid stiffening of QCD matter at density slightly above nuclear saturation density ($n_0 \simeq 0.16\,{\rm fm}^{-3}$). The evolution of the stiffening is quicker than expected from purely nucleonic models with many-body repulsion. Taking into account the quark substructure of baryons, we argue that the saturation of quarks states occur at $\sim$ 2-3$n_0$, driving the quark matter formation even before baryonic cores of the radii $\sim$0.5 fm spatially overlap. We describe the continuous transitions from hadronic to quark matter are described within a quarkyonic matter model in which gluons are assumed to be confining at density of interest. To obtain analytic insights for the transient regime, we construct an ideal model of quarkyonic matter, IdylliQ model, in which one can freely switch from baryonic to quark languages and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Transport coefficients of dense nucleon matter at low temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transport properties of cold and dense nucleon matter are important for both nuclear and astrophysics but are relatively less studied than those at finite temperatures. In this paper, we present a primary study of bulk and shear viscosities in the limit $T/\mu_B \ll 1$, where $T$ and $\mu_B$ are the temperature and the baryon chemical potential. The analysis is performed for a generic system where nucleons are dressed by the condensation of both scalar and vector interactions. Under the relaxation time approximation of the Boltzmann equation, we compute the viscosities of the system to leading power in $T/\mu_B$ expansion and establish a relation between the thermodynamic potential and transport coefficients, including bulk viscosity ($\zeta$) and shear viscosity ($\eta$). It is found that hydrodynamic stability ($\zeta&gt;0$) imposes additional constraints on the thermodynamic potential. As an example, these relations are applied to the Walecka model. The fluid properties of the cold and dense nucleon matter are characterized by the dimensionless combination of viscosities times the quasi-Fermi momentum over the enthalpy. Furthermore, we discuss the implication of the stability condition on the range of applicability of the model.</description>

      <title>One-loop Matching Factors for Singlet Quasi-Parton Distribution Functions in the Hybrid-Ratio Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The one loop matching kernels between parton distribution functions (PDFs) for parton $i=u,d,s,g$ and their corresponding quasi-PDFs are computed at one loop in the hybrid-ratio scheme. We found that, in addition to the conservation of the quasi-quark number for each flavor, the second moment $\langle x \rangle_{\tilde{i}}=\langle x \rangle_i$ of quasi-PDF of parton $i$ (denoted as $\tilde{i}$) and PDF of parton $i$ is the same in our approach. This is demonstrated numerically using the CTEQ14 global analysis as input. However, because the quark-quark mixing kernels are not flavor blind, the notion of non-singlet quasi-PDFs is no longer valid. One has to work with the four sets of quasi-PDFs simultaneously to extract the corresponding PDFs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the analogy between graviton emission in a thermal radiation environment and the laser mechanism, where photons of the same momentum and polarization are amplified. Using interaction picture perturbation theory, we analyze the time evolution of the graviton number operator and its expectation value in a squeezed vacuum state, describing the inflationary graviton state. During the radiation-dominated era of the early universe, we find secular growth in the graviton number, leading to the breakdown of perturbative analysis within approximately ten Hubble times after reheating. We also explore analogous effects in a Minkowski background. As a thought experiment, we consider LIGO/Virgo-like detectors immersed in a radiation environment at temperatures of $O(10)$ GeV. In this scenario, graviton numbers at $O(100)$ Hz could be enhanced, suggesting a mechanism to amplify gravitational wave signals. While this setup is beyond current experimental capabilities, it points to potential advancements in gravitational wave measurements.</description>

      <title>Cascading from $\mathscr{N}=2$ Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory to Confinement and Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Adjoint QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that adjoint QCD in 3+1 dimensions, with any $SU(N)$ gauge group and two Weyl fermion flavors (i.e. one adjoint Dirac fermion), confines and spontaneously breaks its chiral symmetries via the condensation of a fermion bilinear. We flow to this theory from pure $\mathscr{N}=2$ SUSY Yang-Mills theory with the same gauge group, by giving a SUSY-breaking mass $M$ to the scalars in the $\mathscr{N} = 2$ vector multiplet. This flow can be analyzed rigorously at small $M$, where it leads to a deconfined vacuum at the origin of the $\mathscr{N}=2$ Coulomb branch. The analysis can be extended to all $M$ using an Abelian dual description that arises from the $N$ multi-monopole points of the $\mathscr{N} = 2$ theory. At each such point, there are $N-1$ hypermultiplet Higgs fields $h_m^{i = 1, 2}$, which are $SU(2)_R$ doublets. We provide a detailed study of the phase diagram as a function of $M$, by analyzing the semi-classical phases of the dual using a combination of analytic and numerical techniques. The result is a cascade of first-order phase transitions, along which the Higgs fields $h_m^i$ successively turn on, and which interpolates between the Coulomb branch at small $M$, where all $h_m^i = 0$, and a maximal Higgs branch, where all $h_m^i \neq 0$, at sufficiently large $M$. We show that this maximal Higgs branch precisely matches the confining and chiral symmetry breaking phase of two-flavor adjoint QCD, including its broken and unbroken symmetries, its massless spectrum, and the expected large-$N$ scaling of various observables. The spontaneous breaking pattern $SU(2)_R \to U(1)_R$, consistent with the Vafa-Witten theorem, is ensured by an intricate alignment mechanism for the $h_m^i$ in the dual, and leads to a $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^1$ sigma model of increasing radius along the cascade.</description>

      <title>Open String Amplitudes: Singularities, Asymptotics, and New Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open string amplitudes at tree level have been studied for over fifty years, but there is no known analytic form for general $n$-point amplitudes, and their conventional representation in terms of worldsheet integrals does not make many of their most basic physical properties manifest. Recently, a formulation of these amplitudes exposing the underlying "binary geometry" via the use of "$u$" variables has given us many insights into their basic features. In this paper, we initiate a systematic exploration of fundamental aspects of open string amplitudes from this new point of view. We begin by giving explicit expressions for the factorization of amplitudes at general massive levels. We then study the asymptotic behavior when subsets of kinematic variables become large, delineating regimes with exponential (generalized hard scattering) and power-law (generalized Regge) behavior. We also give precise expressions for the asymptotics, which reveal another example of the recently observed property of factorization away from poles. We finally derive new recursion relations and infinite series representations for the amplitude, and for five points, we present a new closed-form expression for the amplitude that for the first time gives its analytic continuation to all of kinematic space.</description>

      <title>The Casimir Effect in (3+1)-dimensional lattice Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature: the unexpected universality of quarkiton and glueton boundary states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our earlier work on the Casimir effect in (3+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, we identified two novel nonperturbative states arising in QCD with boundaries: the glueton and the quarkiton. The glueton, or "gluon exciton", is a colorless bound state formed by gluons interacting with their negatively colored images in a chromometallic mirror. The quarkiton, or "quark exciton", is a meson-like state comprising a heavy quark attracted to its image through the mirror. In this study, we extend our analysis to finite temperatures near the deconfinement phase transition $(T \approx 0.78 T_c)$, where we observe a linear potential between a color-neutral chromometallic mirror and a heavy test quark. Our result suggests that the quarkiton state can have a physical relevance since mirrors for photons and, presumably, gluons can be realized in field theories as domain-wall solutions. Furthermore, we find a striking universality: the ratio of the glueton mass to the bulk $0^{++}$ glueball mass - defining the bulk mass gap - matches the ratio of the quarkiton string tension to the string tension between quark and anti-quark in the absence of the mirror, with a value $\mathcal{R} = 0.294(11)$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from cosmic strings for pedestrians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings represent an attractive source of gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. However, in contrast to other primordial GW sources whose signal may be modeled by simple analytic expressions, computing the GW signal from cosmic strings requires the numerical evaluation of complicated integral and sum expressions, which can become computationally costly in large parameter scans. This shortcoming motivates us to rederive the GW signal from a network of local stable cosmic strings in the Nambu-Goto approximation and based on the velocity-dependent one-scale model from a "pedestrian" perspective. That is, we derive purely analytical expressions for the total GW spectrum, which remain exact wherever possible and whose error can be tracked and reduced in a controlled way in crucial situations in which we are forced to introduce approximations. In this way, we obtain powerful formulas that, unlike existing results in the literature, are valid across the entire frequency spectrum and across the entire conceivable range of cosmic-string tensions. We provide an in-depth discussion of the GW spectra thus obtained, including their characteristic break frequencies and approximate power-law behaviors, comment on the effect of changes in the effective number of degrees of freedom during radiation domination, and conclude with a concise summary of our main formulas that can readily be used in future studies.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in image generation, but they are computationally intensive and time-consuming to train. In this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion model that benefits from quantum computing techniques in order to mitigate computational challenges and enhance generative performance within high energy physics data. The fully quantum diffusion model replaces Gaussian noise with random unitary matrices in the forward process and incorporates a variational quantum circuit within the U-Net in the denoising architecture. We run evaluations on the structurally complex quark and gluon jets dataset from the Large Hadron Collider. The results demonstrate that the fully quantum and hybrid models are competitive with a similar classical model for jet generation, highlighting the potential of using quantum techniques for machine learning problems.</description>

      <title>Effects of asymmetric dark matter on a magnetized neutron star: A two-fluid approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interaction between dark matter (DM) and highly magnetized neutron stars (NSs), focusing on how DM particle mass, mass fraction, and magnetic field (MF) strength affect NS structure and stability. We consider self-interacting, non-annihilating, asymmetric fermionic DM that couples to NSs only through gravitational interaction. Using the QMC-RMF4 relativistic mean-field model with density-dependent magnetic fields, we investigate the magnetized equation of state and examine the accumulation of DM under various conditions. Our results show that as the DM fraction increases, the maximum gravitational mass of the NS decreases, especially for heavier DM particles, while lighter DM particles can induce a transition from a dark core to a halo structure, increasing the maximum mass. Strong MFs soften the equation of state and reduce the dark mass a NS core can retain before transitioning to a halo.</description>

      <title>Gravitational EFT for dissipative open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elaborate on the effective field theory (EFT) construction for dissipative open systems coupled to dynamical gravity, in light of recent developments on the EFT of dissipative hydrodynamics (HydroEFT). Our construction is based on the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and its symmetries as well as microscopic unitarity. A key aspect of dynamical gravity is that gravity couples to all degrees of freedom universally, hence the EFT has to take into account the energy-momentum tensor of the environment to which the energy escapes from the dissipative system of interest. We incorporate this effect by modeling the environment based on HydroEFT, assuming validity of the derivative expansion of the environment sector. For illustration, we apply our EFT recipe to a dissipative scalar field coupled to dynamical gravity that can be used, e.g., for dissipative inflation. In particular we quantify impacts of fluctuations in the environment sector on the scalar dynamics. We also apply the same framework to dissipative gravity, discussing dissipative gravitational waves and the generalized second law of black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Hint at an axion-like particle from GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection by the LHAASO Collaboration of the gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A at redshift $z = 0.151$ with energies up to $(13-18) \, \rm TeV$ challenges conventional physics. Photons emitted with energies above $10 \, \rm TeV$ at this redshift can hardly be observed on Earth due to their interaction with the extragalactic background light (EBL). We show that indeed the LHAASO Collaboration should not have observed photons with energies above $10 \, \rm TeV$ if the state-of-the-art EBL model by Saldana-Lopez et al. is taken into account. A problem therefore arises: the Universe should be more transparent than currently believed. We also show that the issue is solved if we introduce the interaction of photons with axion-like particles (ALPs). ALPs are predicted by String Theory, are among the best candidates for dark matter and can produce spectral and polarization effects on astrophysical sources in the presence of external magnetic fields. In particular, for GRB 221009A, photon-ALP oscillations occur within the crossed magnetized media, i.e. the host galaxy, the extragalactic space, the Milky Way, partially reducing the EBL absorption to a level that explains the LHAASO detection of GRB 221009A and its observed spectrum without the need of contrived choices of parameter values, which are instead compulsory within proposed emission models within conventional physics. This fact regarding GRB 221009A represents a strong hint at the ALP existence, which adds to two other indications coming from blazars, a class of active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to Neutrino-Hydrogen Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:1809.08752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The limited statistics of the available (anti)neutrino-hydrogen (H) interactions has been a longstanding impediment for high-energy neutrino physics. We discuss a practical way to achieve accurate (anti)neutrino-hydrogen measurements, addressing the principal limitations of earlier experiments. Interactions on hydrogen are extracted by subtracting measurements on thin dedicated graphite (pure C) and polypropylene (CH$_2$) targets within a highly segmented low-density detector. A kinematic selection is used to increase the purities to 80-95\% before subtraction. A statistics of ${\cal O}(10^6)$ can be realistically achieved in modern neutrino beams for the various $\nu(\bar \nu)$-H event topologies. The availability of such samples would allow a precise determination of neutrino and antineutrino fluxes, as well as to directly constrain nuclear effects from a comparison with corresponding measurements on heavy materials within the same detector. The (anti)neutrino fluxes and the nuclear smearing are typically the leading sources of systematic uncertainties in long-baseline oscillation experiments. (Anti)neutrino-hydrogen interactions also provide an ideal tool for a wide range of precision tests of fundamental interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the scope of determining the neutrino nature in long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments considering the effect of environmental decoherence in neutrino evolution. Assuming an open quantum system framework, we numerically analyze the two flavor neutrino oscillation probabilities. We observe that the transition probabilities accommodate the Majorana phase in the presence of dissipative environment. Considering this phenomenology, we study the effect of Majorana phase on these probabilities and investigate the sensitivity of T2K, ESSnuSB, NOvA, T2HKK and DUNE to differentiate between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A transformation on homogeneous polynomials is proposed, which is further applied to parametric Feynman integrals. The two representations related through this transformation are dual to each other. And it naturally leads to dualities of Landau equations and linear integral relations between the two representations. For integrals with momentum-space correspondences, the dual representation is equivalent to the Baikov representation.</description>

      <title>The effect of gluon condensate on the entanglement entropy in a holographic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00682v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of gluon condensate on the holographic entanglement entropy is investigated in an Einstein-Dilaton model at zero and finite temperature. There is a critical length for the difference of entanglement entropy between the connected and disconnected surfaces in this model, which is often regarded as a signal of phase transition. With the increase of gluon condensate, the critical length becomes small, which means the confinement becomes strong at zero temperature. Moreover, an entropic C-function suddenly jumps to zero at the critical length, where there are expected to be no entangled states. At finite temperatures, results show that the effect of gluon condensate on the critical length is qualitatively consistent with the case of zero temperature. We find that the entropic C-function increases as a function of $l$ at finite temperature, while it has competitive behaviors with large gluon condensate.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Monopole-Antimonopole Pair Production at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10747v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The monopole production at LHC crucially depends on the monopole production mechanism. We show that, if the monopole production mechanism at LHC is the thermal fluctuation of the Higgs vacuum as the early universe did, it is practically impossible for LHC to produce the monopole, even with the future FCC energy upgrade. This is because the temperature of the p-p fireball is simply too low to produce the monopole. But if the monopole production mechanism is the Drell-Yan and/or Schwinger mechanism, the 14 TeV LHC could produce the monopole in the form of the monopolium of mass around 5,7 TeV even when the monopole mass becomes 11 TeV. Or, it could produce the monopole when the mass is less than 7 TeV. Our result tells that, if the monopole production mechanism at LHC becomes the thermal fluctuation, searching for the remnant monopoles produced in the early universe could be the only way to detect the electroweak monopole. We discuss the physical implications of our result.</description>

      <title>Estimating Longitudinal Polarization of $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ Hyperons at Relativistic Energies using Hydrodynamic and Transport models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global and local polarization measurements of $\Lambda$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$) hyperons by STAR and ALICE Collaborations open up an immense interest in investigating the polarization dynamics in heavy-ion collisions. Recent studies suggest the transverse component of the vorticity field is responsible for the global spin polarization, while the longitudinal component of the vorticity field accounts for the local polarization. The local polarization of $\Lambda$-hyperons arises due to the anisotropic flows in the transverse plane, indicating a quadrupole pattern of the longitudinal vorticity along the beam direction. We derive a simple solution relating the longitudinal mean spin vector with the second-order anisotropic flow coefficient due to the thermal shear for an ideal uncharged fluid in a longitudinal boost invariant scenario. The present study focuses on the local (longitudinal) polarization of $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ in Au$+$Au and Pb$+$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and 5.02 TeV, respectively. Further, we explore the azimuthal angle, centrality, and transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) dependence study of longitudinal polarization using hydrodynamic and transport models. All these models predict a maximum longitudinal polarization in mid-central collisions around 30-50 \% centrality at $p_{\rm T} \approx$ 2.0 - 3.0 GeV/c. These findings on longitudinal polarization advocate the existence of a thermal medium in non-central heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Study of quantum decoherence at Protvino to ORCA experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protvino to ORCA (Oscillation Research with Cosmics in the Abyss) (P2O) is an upcoming neutrino oscillation experiment with a very long baseline of 2595 km. Due to the substantial baseline, this experiment provides a unique opportunity to study the earth matter effects over very large distances. This makes it a suitable experiment to investigate the environmental decoherence in neutrino oscillations, where the neutrino system could interact with a stochastic environment and lead to a loss in the coherence of neutrino states. In this work, we consider an open quantum system framework to simulate the neutrino oscillations in P2O experiment and obtain bounds on the decoherence parameters in different phenomenological models. We assume that the decoherence parameter $\Gamma$ depends on neutrino energy $E_\nu$ as $\Gamma_{ij}(E_\nu) = \Gamma_{0} (\frac{E_\nu}{E_0})^n$. Further, we use these bounds to study the effect on the neutrino mass ordering sensitivity and CP violation sensitivity of P2O experiment.</description>

Abstract: Detector simulations are an exciting application of modern generative networks. Their sparse high-dimensional data combined with the required precision poses a serious challenge. We show how combining Conditional Flow Matching with transformer elements allows us to simulate the detector phase space reliably. Namely, we use an autoregressive transformer to simulate the energy of each layer, and a vision transformer for the high-dimensional voxel distributions. We show how dimension reduction via latent diffusion allows us to train more efficiently and how diffusion networks can be evaluated faster with bespoke solvers. We showcase our framework, CaloDREAM, on datasets 2 and 3 of the CaloChallenge.</description>

Abstract: One of purposes for High Energy accelerator experiments is confrontation of theory and measurements in ever new realms. Any new agreement extends theory applicability domain, any discrepancy hints to unexplained. That calls for better calculations or new, deeper theory. Often one has to search for small contributions over large Standard Model background. Multi-dimensional signatures and complex background subtraction cuts imply that Monte Carlo techniques are indispensable.

      <title>Search for single vector-like $B$ quark production in hadronic final states at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the discovery potential of a Vector-Like $B$ quark (VLB) via the process $pp \to B(\to bZ)j\to b(Z \to \nu_l\bar{\nu_l})j$ at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV. In the framework of a simplified model, we perform a scan over its parameter space and test its viability following a Monte Carlo analysis developed to include all production and decay dynamics. We use cut-and-count combined with Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) methods to classify the signal and background events in order to improve the efficiency of signal identification and background rejection. We find that this approach can reduce background events significantly while the signal retention rate is much higher than that of traditional methods, thereby improving the VLB discovery potential. We then calculate the exclusion and discovery capabilities for VLBs and find that the advantages of the cut-and-count plus XGBoost method especially lie in the high-mass region, i.e., $m_B &gt; 1500 \text{ GeV}$. We finally obtain the following LHC results in terms of the coupling and chiral structure of a singlet heavy VLB interactions: (i) for $g^{\ast}$=0.2 and $R_L=0$ with 3000 fb$^{-1}$, the $B$ quark mass can be be excluded (discovered) up to 3000 GeV (2500 GeV); (ii) for $g^{\ast}$=0.2 and $R_L=0.5$ with 3000 fb$^{-1}$, the exclusion (discovery) region can reach up to 4750 GeV (4250 GeV).</description>

      <title>Universal Anomaly Detection at the LHC: Transforming Optimal Classifiers and the DDD Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel approach to transform supervised classifiers into effective unsupervised anomaly detectors. The method we have developed, termed Discriminatory Detection of Distortions (DDD), enhances anomaly detection by training a discriminator model on both original and artificially modified datasets. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our models on the Dark Machines Anomaly Score Challenge channels and a search for 4-top quark events, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach across various final states and beyond the Standard Model scenarios.
  We compare the performance of the DDD method with the Deep Robust One-Class Classification method (DROCC), which incorporates signals in the training process, and the Deep Support Vector Data Description (DeepSVDD) method, a well established and well performing method for anomaly detection. Results show that the effectiveness of each model varies by signal and channel, with DDD proving to be a very effective anomaly detector. We recommend the combined use of DeepSVDD and DDD for purely unsupervised applications, with the addition of flow models for improved performance when resources allow.
  Findings suggest that network architectures that excel in supervised contexts, such as the particle transformer with standard model interactions, also perform well as unsupervised anomaly detectors. We also show that with these methods, it is likely possible to recognize 4-top quark production as an anomaly without prior knowledge of the process. We argue that the Large Hadron Collider community can transform supervised classifiers into anomaly detectors to uncover potential new physical phenomena in each search.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present techniques for estimating the effects of systematic uncertainties in unbinned data analyses at the LHC. Our primary focus is constraining the Wilson coefficients in the standard model effective field theory (SMEFT), but the methodology applies to broader parametric models of phenomena beyond the standard model (BSM). We elevate the well-established procedures for binned Poisson counting experiments to the unbinned case by utilizing machine-learned surrogates of the likelihood ratio. This approach can be applied to various theoretical, modeling, and experimental uncertainties. By establishing a common statistical framework for BSM and systematic effects, we lay the groundwork for future unbinned analyses at the LHC. Additionally, we introduce a novel tree-boosting algorithm capable of learning highly accurate parameterizations of systematic effects. This algorithm extends the existing toolkit with a versatile and robust alternative. We demonstrate our approach using the example of an SMEFT interpretation of highly energetic top quark pair production in proton-proton collisions.</description>

Abstract: The Beijing Spectrometer (BESIII) Collaboration reconstructed the invariant mass of three pairs of positive and negative pions by studying the decay process of charmonium to a photon and three pairs of positive and negative pions. They discovered the resonant structures X(1840) and X(1880), which are interpreted as the predicted proton-antiproton bound states, also known as protonium. This article briefly introduces the experimental discovery processes of these resonant structures and discusses the theoretical explorations inspired by them. The predictions proposed by these theoretical explorations offer a new perspective for studying the nature of these particles and new decay modes. Therefore the collaborative exploration of experiments and theory plays a positive role in deepening understanding of the fundamental laws of nature.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay from Scalar Leptoquarks: Interplay with Neutrino Mass and Flavor Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of neutrinoless double beta decay and its interplay with low-energy flavor observables in a radiative neutrino mass model with scalar leptoquarks $S_1(\bar{3},1,1/3)$ and $\widetilde{R}_2(3,2,1/6)$. We carve out the parameter region consistent with constraints from neutrino mass and mixing, collider searches, as well as measurements of several flavor observables, such as muon and electron anomalous magnetic moments, charged lepton flavor violation and rare (semi)leptonic kaon and $B$-meson decays, including the recent anomalies in $R_{D^{(*)}}$ and $B\to K\nu\bar{\nu}$ observables. We perform a global analysis to all existing constraints and show the (anti)correlations between all relevant Yukawa couplings satisfying these restrictions. We find that the most stringent constraint on the parameter space comes from $\mu \to e$ conversion in nuclei and $K^{+} \rightarrow\, \pi^{+}\nu \bar{\nu}$ decay. We also point out a tension between the muon and electron $(g-2)$ anomalies in this context. Taking benchmark values from the combined allowed regions, we study the implications for neutrinoless double beta decay including both the canonical light neutrino and the leptoquark contributions. We find that for normal ordering of neutrino masses, the leptoquark contribution removes the cancellation region that occurs for the canonical case. The effective mass in presence of leptoquarks can lie in the desert region between the standard normal and inverted ordering cases, and this can be probed in future ton-scale experiments like LEGEND-1000 and nEXO.</description>

      <title>TeV Scale Resonant Leptogenesis with triplet Fermion in Connection to Muon $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the minimal scotogenic model with a triplet fermion and a singlet scalar. An imposed $Z_{4}\times Z_{2}$ symmetry allows only diagonal Yukawa couplings among different generations of SM leptons and right-handed singlet neutrinos. The Yukawa coupling of the triplet fermion with the inert doublet positively contributes to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. The imposed $Z_{4}\times Z_{2}$ symmetry forbids the conventional leptogenesis from the lightest right-handed neutrino decay. A net lepton asymmetry can be generated in the muonic sector from $N_{2}$ and triplet fermion decay through resonant leptogenesis scenario. The Yukawa coupling of triplet plays significant role both in leptogenesis and in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We show a viable parameter space for TeV scale leptogenesis while explaining the Fermi lab results. The inert scalar is the dark matter candidate in this model. The Muon $(g-2)$ and dark matter both favor the same parameter space for mass of the dark matter and the triplet fermion.</description>

      <title>Mixing angle between $^{3}P_1$ and $^{1}P_1$ states in heavy axial vector mesons within the QCD sum rules framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we calculate the mixing angles between the axial-vector mesons $D_{1(s1)} - D_{1(s1)}^\prime$ and $B_{1(s1)} - B_{1(s1)}^\prime$ using the QCD sum rules approach. Our results are $\theta_1 = 28.2 \pm 0.6^\circ$, $\theta_2 = 26.6 \pm 0.6^\circ$, $\theta_3 = 38.6 \pm 0.1^\circ$, and $\theta_4 = 38.5 \pm 0.1^\circ$. These values are in good agreement with the predictions of Heavy Quark Effective Theory, particularly for the mixing angle $\theta = 35.3^\circ$, and are compatible with several existing results in the literature.
  The predicted mixing angles can be tested through the analysis of semileptonic decays such as $B_c \to B_1 \ell \nu$, $B_c \to B_{s1}^0 \ell \nu$, $B_s \to D_{s1} \ell \nu$, and $B_s \to D_{s1}^\prime \ell \nu$, which can be investigated at experimental facilities such as LHCb and Belle II.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a gauge singlet scalar with mass around 1-100 TeV as a thermal heavy dark matter candidate along with a dilaton as a Higgs portal mediator in a dimensionless scalar extension of the Standard Model. We demonstrate analytically that such a model gives rise to very strong first-order electroweak phase transition through supercooling. We calculate the corresponding gravitational wave signals due to bubble collisions during the phase transition. The produced gravitational waves can be detected by future space-based gravitational wave detectors in the frequency range from 10^{-4} Hz to 0.1 Hz.</description>

      <title>Loop quantum effects on direct detection prediction in two-scalar dark matter scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of quantum corrections on the elastic scattering cross section of dark matter off nucleus in two-scalar dark matter model. Among two extra singlet scalars in the two-scalar model, the lighter one is stable and plays the role of dark matter candidate and the heavier one contributes in dark matter co-annihilation processes in thermal history of the early universe. It is already known that the two-scalar model at tree level, unlike the single-scalar dark matter model, can easily evade the bounds from direct detection (DD) experiments. The claim here is that taking into account the loop effects, in some regions of the parameter space, the DM-nucleon cross section becomes larger than the tree level contribution. Therefore, loop effects move the regions which were below the neutrino floor at tree level, up to the regions which are detectable by future DD experiments.</description>

      <title>Higher twist corrections to doubly-charmed baryonic $B$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baryonic two-body $B$ mesons decays have been measured experimentally for some time, which provides an excellent ground for studying the QCD of baryonic $B$ decays. In this work, we investigate the two-body doubly-charmed baryonic $B$ decays in the perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach including higher twist contributions to the light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs). The charmed baryon LCDAs are included up to the twist four and the effect of the subleading component of the $B$ meson LCDAs is studied for details. With the inclusion of these higher-power contributions, the PQCD results on rates can explain the current experimental data well. Moreover, we note that the SU(3) symmetry breaking is important in the concerned processes and play an essential role in understanding the measurements of $\mathcal{B}(\overline{B}^0\to \Lambda_c^+\overline \Lambda_c^-)$ and $ \mathcal{B}({B}^-\to\Xi_c^0\overline \Lambda_c^-)$. We also evaluate the angular asymmetries for the first time, which have neither been measured experimentally nor calculated theoretically. All these predictions can be tested in future.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopy correlation functions and mass distributions from production experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the relation between the Koonin-Pratt femtoscopic correlation function (CF) and invariant mass distributions from production experiments. We show that the equivalence is total for a zero source-size and that a Gaussian finite-size source provides a form-factor for the virtual production of the particles. Motivated by this remarkable relationship, we study an alternative method to the Koonin-Pratt formula, which connects the evaluation of the CF directly with the production mechanisms. The differences arise mostly from the $T$-matrix quadratic terms and increase with the source size. We study the case of the $D^0 D^{\ast +}$ and $D^+ D^{\ast 0}$ correlation functions of interest to unravel the dynamics of the exotic $T_ {cc}(3875)^+$, and find that these differences become quite sizable already for 1 fm sources. We nevertheless conclude that the lack of coherence in high-multiplicity-event reactions and in the creation of the fire-ball source that emits the hadrons certainly make much more realistic the formalism based on the Koonin-Pratt equation. We finally derive an improved Lednicky-Lyuboshits (LL) approach, which implements a Lorentz ultraviolet regulator that corrects the pathological behaviour of the LL CF in the punctual source-size limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the generation of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) from interactions in the thermal plasma. We extend the existing literature by incorporating the reheating phase into the thermal history. Our results show that the amplitude of the GW spectrum can be significantly enhanced because the temperature during reheating can be much higher than the reheating temperature. Furthermore, since the temperature evolution during reheating differs from that of free radiation, the peak frequency of the spectrum can also shift. Additionally, the morphology of the spectrum can present characteristic features. We also compute the contribution of the integrated GW spectrum to the effective number of neutrino species, $\Delta N_\text{eff}$, which can be substantially larger.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the limit of vanishing up, down and strange quark masses, QCD exhibits a chiral symmetry. This symmetry is broken spontaneously to its vector subgroup, giving rise to Goldstone bosons. These acquire a small mass through the explicit chiral symmetry breaking for non-vanishing quark masses. The consequences of these broken symmetries can be investigated in a suitably tailored effective field theory called chiral pertubation theory. It admits a perturbative expansion in the external momenta and the Goldstone boson masses and can be systematically analyzed in terms of a loop expansion. The appearing ultraviolet divergences in loop diagrams can be dealt with order-by-order through the Goldstone boson contact interactions. Matter fields like the lowest-lying baryons can also included, leading to a rich and testable phenomenology of low-energy QCD.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity corrections to the spontaneous excitation of an accelerated atom interacting with a quantum scalar field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) extends the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) by suggesting a minimum observable scale that includes the effects of quantum gravity, which is supposed to potentially result in observable effects far below the Planck energy scale, providing us the opportunity to explore the theory of quantum gravity through physical processes at low energy scale. In present work, we study the corrections induced by the GUP to the spontaneous radiation properties of a two-level atom interacting with a real massless scalar quantum field based on the DDC formalism. The GUP alters the correlation function of the scalar field, consequently affecting the radiative properties of atoms. We compute the rate of change in the mean atomic energy for an atom undergoing inertial motion, uniform acceleration, and uniform circular motion. We show that the GUP can enhance the spontaneous emission rate of an excited state atom in inertial motion; however, it does not alter the stability of the ground-state atom in vacuum. For an atom in uniformly accelerated and uniformly circular motion, the GUP can change both its spontaneous emission and spontaneous excitation rates, and the proper acceleration $a$ can significantly amplify the effect of the GUP on the spontaneous transition rates of the atom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experimental progress on baryonic rare decays has spurred a deeper investigation on flavor-changing neutral current transitions in the baryon sector. Within the framework of QCD sum rules, we derive a complete set of form factors for the $ \Lambda_c\to p $ process in the large recoil region and use the $z$-series parametrization to extrapolate them across the full physical range. Employing these form factors and flavor symmetries, we compute branching fractions for the decays $\Lambda_c \to p e^+ e^-$ and $\Lambda_c \to p \mu^+ \mu^-$, as well as for rare $ \Xi_c $ decay modes. We examine as well the new physics effects through specific angular observables such as the lepton forward-backward asymmetry and the fraction of longitudinally polarized dileptons. Results indicate that new physics models may be testified in baryonic rare decays, with immense data collected in running and future colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vector-like leptons (VLLs) as one kind of interesting new particles can produce rich phenomenology at low- and high-energy experiments. In the framework of the singlet vector-like leptons with scalar (VLS) model, we investigate the discovery potential of VLL via its single production at the International Linear Collider (ILC) with the center of mass energy $\sqrt{s} =$ 1 TeV and the integrated luminosity $\mathcal{L}$ = 1 ab$^{-1}$, taking into account the appropriate polarization. For the signal and standard model (SM) background analysis, we have considered two kinds of decay channels for the W boson, i.e. pure leptonic and fully hadronic decay channels. Our analytic results show that the parameter space $M_{F}\in$ [300, 675] GeV and $\kappa \in$ [0.0294, 0.1] might be detected by the proposed ILC for pure leptonic decay channel. For fully hadronic decay channel, larger detection region of the parameter space are derived as $M_{F}\in$ [300, 700] GeV and $\kappa \in$ [0.0264, 0.0941].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a photon proliferation effect from N-body dark matter (DM) annihilation in the early Universe, which can induce a drastic photon-temperature shift after neutrino decoupling. For pseudoscalar DM mass below the eV scale, we show that the photon proliferation effect becomes significant as the mass approaches the ultralight end, due to the huge enhancement from the background DM number density. This presents the leading constraints on the DM-photon coupling, DM self-interaction, and DM-electron coupling, which are stronger than the existing bounds up to several orders of magnitude. The present research can be extended to other interactions and DM candidates, and highlights the importance of multi-body processes in the early Universe.</description>

Abstract: We apply the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) to analyze cosmological models with clustering quintessence, which allows us to consistently describe the parameter region in which the quintessence equation of state $w &lt; - 1$. First, we extend the description of biased tracers in redshift space to the presence of clustering quintessence, and compute the one-loop power spectrum. We solve the EFTofLSS equations using the exact time dependence, which is relevant to obtain unbiased constraints. Then, fitting the full shape of BOSS pre-reconstructed power spectrum measurements, the BOSS post-reconstruction BAO measurements, BAO measurements from 6DF/MGS and eBOSS, the Supernovae from Pantheon, and a prior from BBN, we bound the clustering quintessence equation of state parameter $w=-1.011_{-0.048}^{+0.053}$ at $68\%$ C.L.. Further combining with Planck, we obtain $w=-1.028_{-0.030}^{+0.037}$ at $68\%$ C.L.. We also obtain constraints on smooth quintessence, in the physical regime $w \geq -1$: combining all datasets, we get $-1\leq w &lt; - 0.979$ at $68\%$ C.L.. These results strongly support a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Chiral anomaly in (1+1) dimensions revisited: complementary kinetic perspective and universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.02844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reinvestigate the classic example of the chiral anomaly in (1+1) dimensional spacetime. By reviewing the derivation of charge conservation using the semiclassical Boltzmann equation, we show that chiral anomalies could emerge in (1+1) dimensions without Berry curvature corrections to the kinetic theory. The pivotal step depends only on the asymptotic behavior of the distribution function of the quasiparticle--and thus its dispersion relation--in the limit of $\mathbf p\to\pm\infty$ rather than the detailed functional form of the dispersion. We address two subjects motivated by this observation. First, we reformulate (1+1)-dimensional chiral anomaly using kinetic theory with the current algebra approach and the gradient expansion of the Dirac Lagrangian, adding a complementary perspective to existing approaches. Second, we demonstrate the universality of the chiral anomaly across various quasiparticle dispersions. For two-band models linear in the temporal derivative, with Fujikawa's method we show it is sufficient to have a chirality-odd strictly monotonic dispersion in order to exhibit the chiral anomaly.</description>

Abstract: Using $\Upsilon(1S)$, $\Upsilon(2S)$, and $\Upsilon(3S)$ data collected by the Belle detector, we discover a new three-body decay, $\Omega(2012)^-\to\Xi(1530)\bar K\to\Xi\pi\bar K$, with a significance of 5.2~$\sigma$. The mass of the $\Omega(2012)^-$ is $(2012.5\pm0.7\pm0.5)$ MeV and its effective couplings to $\Xi(1530)\bar{K}$ and $\Xi\bar{K}$ are $(39^{+31}_{-39}\pm9)\times10^{-2}$ and $(1.7\pm0.3\pm0.3)\times10^{-2}$, where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second are systematic. The ratio of the branching fraction for the three-body decay to that for the two-body decay to $\Xi\bar{K}$ is $0.99\pm0.26\pm0.06$, assuming isospin symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.04896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron mass is known to modify at finite temperatures and densities. Weak nuclear processes have a great impact on electron mass which modifies in a statistical background. We demonstrate how the temperature change in electron mass is associated with beta decay in the early universe. Its precise contributions to the abundance of light elements in the early universe describe some of the details about nucleosynthesis. We employ the calculational scheme of the renormalization of QED to precisely compute the temperature dependence of electron mass during the nuclear processes. In this paper we precisely compute the concentration of electron and its mass change with temperature during nucleosynthesis and use it to describe the helium abundance, expansion rate and energy density of the universe during nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Triply charmed baryons mass decomposition from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first calculation of the connected scalar matrix element and the momentum fraction of charm quark within the$\frac{3}{2}^{+}$ and $\frac{3}{2}^{-}$triply charmed baryons on lattice QCD. The results are based on overlap valence fermions on two ensembles of $N_f=2+1$ domain wall fermion configurations with two lattice spacings. The corresponding sea quark pion masses are $300$ MeV and $278$ MeV. The separated contributions to the triply charmed baryon mass are derived through the decomposition of the QCD energy-momentum tensor. The contribution of the connected charm quark matrix element to the triply charmed baryon is about 3/2 times that of the charmonium. And it contributes almost 70\% of the total mass. The mass splitting of $\frac{3}{2}^{+}$ and $\frac{3}{2}^{-}$triply charmed baryons is mainly from $\langle H_{E}\rangle$ of the QCD energy-momentum tensor. A mass decomposition from the quark model is also studied for comparison.</description>

      <title>Fast Partitioning of Pauli Strings into Commuting Families for Optimal Expectation Value Measurements of Dense Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pauli strings appearing in the decomposition of an operator can be can be grouped into commuting families, reducing the number of quantum circuits needed to measure the expectation value of the operator. We detail an algorithm to completely partition the full set of Pauli strings acting on any number of qubits into the minimal number of sets of commuting families, and we provide python code to perform the partitioning. The partitioning method scales linearly with the size of the set of Pauli strings and it naturally provides a fast method of diagonalizing the commuting families with quantum gates. We provide a package that integrates the partitioning into Qiskit, and use this to benchmark the algorithm with dense Hamiltonians, such as those that arise in matrix quantum mechanics models, on IBM hardware. We demonstrate computational speedups close to the theoretical limit of $(3/2)^m$ relative to qubit-wise commuting groupings, for $m=2,\dotsc,6$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Gravitational to Coulomb force ratio and the origin of the Cosmic magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14930v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of the seeds of galactic magnetic fields is a subject that remains under debate. Here we will explore a simple source based on tiny charge asymmetries in slowly rotating protogalaxies. We use current knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution to estimate that a charge imbalance of $1$ every $\sim 10^{38\pm 5}$ charge carriers in slowly rotating protogalaxies can provide adequate seeds for the galactic dynamos. Interestingly, this is of the same order than the ratio of gravitational to Coulomb forces between the elementary plasma constituents. Motivated by this fact, we study different mechanisms for generating such charge imbalances from a direct interplay of gravitational and Coulomb forces, namely the possibility that these are of primordial origin, that stellar or primordial black holes redistribute charge in protogalaxies, or that the imbalance is sourced by gravity as the galaxy forms in quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium. Our results show that primordial asymmetries drop to small values by the onset of galaxy formation, with an amplitude that is similar to the possible charge asymmetries that could be produced by black holes. Although these charge asymmetries can have values within the range of interest, they are much smaller than the gravitationally induced one in hydrostatic equilibrium conditions. The latter lies in the upper range of the required charge imbalance.</description>

      <title>Hidden zeros for particle/string amplitudes and the unity of colored scalars, pions and gluons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16282v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen the emergence of a new understanding of scattering amplitudes in the simplest theory of colored scalar particles - the Tr$(\phi^3)$ theory - based on combinatorial and geometric ideas in the kinematic space of scattering data. In this paper we report a surprise: far from the toy model it appears to be, the ''stringy'' Tr$(\phi^3)$ amplitudes secretly contain the scattering amplitudes for pions, as well as non-supersymmetric gluons, in any number of dimensions. The amplitudes for the different theories are given by one and the same function, related by a simple shift of the kinematics. This discovery was spurred by another fundamental observation: the tree-level Tr$(\phi^3)$ field theory amplitudes have a hidden pattern of zeros when a special set of non-planar Mandelstam invariants is set to zero. Furthermore, near these zeros, the amplitudes simplify, by factoring into a non-trivial product of smaller amplitudes. Remarkably the amplitudes for pions and gluons are observed to also vanish in the same kinematical locus. These properties further generalize to the ''stringy'' Tr$(\phi^3)$ amplitudes. There is a unique shift of the kinematic data that preserves the zeros, and this shift is precisely the one that unifies colored scalars, pions, and gluons into a single object. We will focus in this paper on explaining the hidden zeros and factorization properties and the connection between all the colored theories, working for simplicity at tree-level. Subsequent works will describe this new formulation for the Non-linear Sigma Model and non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, at all loop orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that position space correlators of a Poincare invariant quantum field theory can be recast in terms of conformally invariant correlators, in other words, as functions of conformal cross ratios. In particular, we show that correlators of massless fields in flat spacetimes with $n-$point interactions can be expressed as position space soft limits of conformally invariant correlators with $(n+1)-$point interactions. We show that this correspondence applies at the level of every Feynman diagram that appears in the perturbative expansion of the correlators in the respective coupling constants. We apply this method to find exact answers for some Feynman diagrams including several loop examples. We also show that the analogous correlators for massive fields can be expressed as infinite sums of conformal correlators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scattering amplitudes for the simplest theory of colored scalar particles - the Tr($\Phi^3$) theory - have recently been the subject of active investigations. In this letter we describe an unanticipated wider implication of this work: the Tr($\Phi^3$) theory secretly contains Non-linear Sigma Model (NLSM) amplitudes to all loop orders. The NLSM amplitudes are obtained from Tr$(\Phi^3)$ amplitudes by a unique shift of kinematic variables. We show that this shifted kinematics produces amplitudes for a cubic theory with a linear term in potential, with extrema spontaneously breaking $U(N) \to U(N-k) \times U(k)$. The Goldstone amplitudes for this theory coincide with those of pions in the $U(N) \times U(N) \to U(N)$ chiral Lagrangian to all orders in the planar limit. We also give a purely on-shell understanding of this correspondence, showing integrands defined by the kinematic shifts have the correct residues on poles and appropriately produce the Adler zero. Finally, we discuss how similar kinematic shifts produce certain infinite classes of mixed amplitudes of pions and Tr($\Phi^3$) scalars, most of which are not interpretable from the Lagrangian description.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from an interrupted phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism of primordial black hole formation via an interrupted phase transition during the early matter-dominated stage of reheating after inflation. In reheating, induced by the decay of a pressureless fluid dominating the Universe at the end of inflation, dubbed as reheaton, the temperature of the radiation bath typically increases, reaching a maximum temperature $T_{\rm max}$, and then decreases. We consider a first-order phase transition induced by the increase of the temperature that is aborted as $T_{\rm max}$ is higher than the critical temperature but not sufficiently high for the bubble nucleation rate to overcome the expansion of the Universe. Although bubbles never fully occupy the space, some may be nucleated and expand until the temperature once again decreases to the critical temperature. We argue that these bubbles shrink and disappear as the temperature drops further, leaving behind macroscopic spherical regions with positive density perturbations. These perturbed regions accrete the surrounding matter (reheatons) and eventually collapse into primordial black holes whose mass continues to grow until the onset of radiation domination. We estimate the abundance of these primordial black holes in terms of the bubble nucleation rate at $T_{\rm max}$, and demonstrate that the abundance can be significantly large from a phenomenological perspective.</description>

      <title>Robust semi-parametric signal detection in particle physics with classifiers decorrelated via optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searches of new signals in particle physics are usually done by training a supervised classifier to separate a signal model from the known Standard Model physics (also called the background model). However, even when the signal model is correct, systematic errors in the background model can influence supervised classifiers and might adversely affect the signal detection procedure. To tackle this problem, one approach is to use the (possibly misspecified) classifier only to perform a preliminary signal-enrichment step and then to carry out a bump hunt on the signal-rich sample using only the real experimental data. For this procedure to work, we need a classifier constrained to be decorrelated with one or more protected variables used for the signal detection step. We do this by considering an optimal transport map of the classifier output that makes it independent of the protected variable(s) for the background. We then fit a semi-parametric mixture model to the distribution of the protected variable after making cuts on the transformed classifier to detect the presence of a signal. We compare and contrast this decorrelation method with previous approaches, show that the decorrelation procedure is robust to moderate background misspecification, and analyse the power of the signal detection test as a function of the cut on the classifier.</description>

      <title>The GD-1 stellar stream perturber as a core-collapsed self-interacting dark matter halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The GD-1 stellar stream exhibits spur and gap structures that may result from a close encounter with a dense substructure. When interpreted as a dark matter subhalo, the perturber is denser than predicted in the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model. In self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), however, a halo could evolve into a phase of gravothermal collapse, resulting in a higher central density than its CDM counterpart. We conduct high-resolution controlled N-body simulations to show that a collapsed SIDM halo could account for the GD-1 perturber's high density. We model a progenitor halo with a mass of $3\times10^8~M_\odot$, motivated by a cosmological simulation of a Milky Way analog, and evolve it in the Milky Way's tidal field. For a cross section per mass of $\sigma/m\approx30-100~{\rm cm^2~g^{-1}}$ at $V_{\rm max }\sim10~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$, the enclosed mass of the SIDM halo within the inner $10~{\rm pc}$ can be increased by more than an order of magnitude compared to its CDM counterpart, leading to a good agreement with the properties of the GD-1 perturber. Our findings indicate that stellar streams provide a novel probe into the self-interacting nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Graded transcendental functions: an application to four-point amplitudes with one off-shell leg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several recent works have demonstrated the powerful algebraic simplifications that can be achieved for scattering amplitudes through a systematic grading of transcendental quantities. We develop these concepts to construct a minimal basis of functions tailored to a scattering amplitude in a general way. Starting with formal solutions for all master integral topologies, we organise the appearing functions by properties such as their symbol alphabet or letter adjacency. We rotate the basis such that functions with spurious features appear in the least possible number of basis elements. Since their coefficients must vanish for physical quantities, this approach avoids complex cancellations. As a first application, we evaluate all integral topologies relevant to the three-loop $Hggg$ and $Hgq\bar{q}$ amplitudes in the leading-colour approximation and heavy-top limit. We describe the derivation of canonical differential equation systems and present a method for fixing boundary conditions without the need for a full functional representation. Using multiple numerical reductions, we test the maximal transcendentality conjecture for $Hggg$ and identify a new letter which appears in functions of weight 4 and 5. In addition, we provide the first direct analytic computation of a three-point form factor of the operator $\mathrm{Tr}(\phi^2)$ in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ sYM and find agreement with numerical and bootstrapped results.</description>

      <title>Pythia 8 and Air Shower Simulations: A Tuning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory has revealed a significant challenge in air shower physics: a discrepancy between the simulated and observed muon content in cosmic-ray interactions, known as the 'Muon Puzzle'. This issue stems from a lack of understanding of high-energy hadronic interactions. Current state-of-the-art hadronic interaction models fall short, underscoring the need for improvements. In this contribution, we explore the integration of the Pythia 8 hadronic interaction model into air shower simulations. While Pythia 8 is primarily used in Large Hadron Collider experiments, recent advancements in its Angantyr module show promise in better describing hadron-nucleus interactions, making it a valuable tool for addressing the Muon Puzzle.</description>

      <title>Quasi-steady evolution of fast neutrino-flavor conversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In astrophysical environments such as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs), neutrinos potentially experience substantial flavor mixing due to the refractive effects of neutrino self-interactions. Determining the survival probability of neutrinos in asymptotic states is paramount to incorporating flavor conversions' effects in the theoretical modeling of CCSN and BNSM. Some phenomenological schemes have shown good performance in approximating asymptotic states of fast neutrino-flavor conversions (FFCs), known as one of the collective neutrino oscillation modes induced by neutrino self-interactions. However, a recent study showed that they would yield qualitatively different asymptotic states of FFC if the neutrino number is forced to evolve. It is not yet fully understood why the canonical phenomenological models fail to predict asymptotic states. In this paper, we perform detailed investigations through numerical simulations and then provide an intuitive explanation with a quasi-homogeneous analysis. Based on the analysis, we propose a new phenomenological model, in which the quasi-steady evolution of FFCs is analytically determined. The model also allows us to express the convolution term of spatial wave number as a concise form, which corresponds to useful information on analyses for the non-linear feedback from small-scale flavor conversions to large-scale ones. Our model yields excellent agreement with numerical simulations, which lends support to our interpretation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of the deuteron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational form factors of the deuteron are calculated in the framework of non-relativistic chiral effective field theory. Non-relativistic reduction of the matrix element of the energy-momentum tensor operator for spin-one systems is worked out, and the gravitational form factors of the deuteron are extracted from the three-point function of the energy-momentum tensor using the LSZ reduction formula. The obtained form factors are compared to results of model calculations available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Photon and Dilepton Yield in a Thermalized Quark-Gluon Plasma under Magnetic Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we analyze the effects of stochastic magnetic fluctuations with respect to an intense magnetic field background over the yields for photon and dilepton emission processes in a thermalized quark-gluon plasma phase. Such stochastic fluctuations model the effects of nearly random initial conditions for the nuclei participating in non-central heavy-ion collisions, which are the sources of the background magnetic field. Our theoretical results predict significant anisotropic effects due to stochastic magnetic noise over the angular distribution for photon and dilepton production rates in this scenario.</description>
