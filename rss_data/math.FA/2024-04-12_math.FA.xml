      <title>On K\"othe duals of Orlicz-Lorentz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study a number of properties of the K\"othe duals $\mathcal{M}_{\varphi,w}$ of Orlicz-Lorentz spaces. An explicit description of the order-continuous subspace of $\mathcal{M}_{\varphi,w}$ is provided. Moreover, the separability of these spaces is characterized by the growth condition $\Delta_2$. Consequently, the K\"othe dual space $\mathcal{M}_{\varphi,w}$ has the Radon-Nikod\'ym property if and only if the N-function at infinity $\varphi$ satisfies the appropriate $\Delta_2$-condition. The comparison between $\mathcal{M}_{\varphi,w}$ spaces is characterized via standard orders between Orlicz functions. As applications of these results, we provide sufficient conditions for M-embedded order-continuous subspaces of Orlicz-Lorentz spaces equipped with the Luxemburg norm and prove the existence of a unique norm-preserving extension on Orlicz-Lorentz spaces equipped with the Orlicz norm.</description>

      <title>Linear structures of norm-attaining Lipschitz functions and their complements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve two main questions on linear structures of (non-)norm-attaining Lipschitz functions. First, we show that for every infinite metric space $M$, the set consisting of Lipschitz functions on $M$ which do not strongly attain their norm and the zero contains an isometric copy of $\ell_\infty$, and moreover, those functions can be chosen not to attain their norm as functionals on the Lipschitz-free space over $M$. Second, we prove that for every infinite metric space $M$, neither the set of strongly norm-attaining Lipschitz functions on $M$ nor the union of its complement with zero is ever a linear space. Furthermore, we observe that the set consisting of Lipschitz functions which cannot be approximated by strongly norm-attaining ones and the zero element contains $\ell_\infty$ isometrically in all the known cases. Some natural observations and spaceability results are also investigated for Lipschitz functions that attain their norm in one way but do not in another, for several norm-attainment notions considered in the literature.</description>

      <title>Approximation of Random Evolution Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an abstract framework to obtain convergence rates for the approximation of random evolution equations corresponding to a random family of forms determined by finite-dimensional noise. The full discretisation error in space, time, and randomness is considered, where polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is used for the semi-discretisation in randomness. The main result are regularity conditions on the random forms under which convergence of polynomial order in randomness is obtained depending on the smoothness of the coefficients and the Sobolev regularity of the initial value. In space and time, the same convergence rates as in the deterministic setting are achieved. To this end, we derive error estimates for vector-valued PCE as well as a quantified version of the Trotter-Kato theorem for form-induced semigroups.</description>

      <title>Sampling recovery on function classes with a structural condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling recovery on some function classes is studied in this paper. Typically, function classes are defined by imposing smoothness conditions. It was understood in nonlinear approximation that structural conditions in the form of control of the number of big coefficients of an expansion of a function with respect to a given system of functions plays an important role. Sampling recovery on smoothness classes is an area of active research, some problems, especially in the case of mixed smoothness classes, are still open. It was discovered recently that universal sampling discretization and nonlinear sparse approximations are useful in the sampling recovery problem. This motivated us to systematically study sampling recovery on function classes with a structural condition. Some results in this direction are already known. In particular, the classes defined by conditions on coefficients with indices from the domains, which are differences of two dyadic cubes are studied in the recent author's papers. In this paper we concentrate on studying function classes defined by conditions on coefficients with indices from the domains, which are differences of two dyadic hyperbolic crosses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph independence (also known as $\epsilon$-independence or $\lambda$-independence) is a mixture of classical independence and free independence corresponding to graph products or groups and operator algebras. Using conjugation by certain random permutation matrices, we construct random matrix models for graph independence with amalgamation over the diagonal matrices. This yields a new probabilist,ic proof that graph products of sofic groups are sofic.</description>

      <title>Subcritical Fourier uncertainty principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that if a function $f$ satisfies $$ \norm{f(x) e^{\pi \alpha |x|^2}}_p + \norm{\widehat{f}(\xi) e^{\pi \alpha |\xi|^2}}_q&lt;\infty \eqno{(*)}$$ with $\alpha=1$ and $1\le p,q&lt;\infty$, then $f\equiv 0.$
  We prove that if $f$ satisfies $(*)$ with some $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$ and $1\le p,q\leq \infty$, then $$ |f(y)|\le C
  (1+|y|)^{\frac{d}{p}}
  e^{- \pi \alpha |y|^2}, \quad y\in \mathbb{R}^d, $$ with $ C=C(\alpha,d,p,q)$ and this bound is sharp for $p\neq 1$. We also study a related uncertainty principle for functions satisfying $\;\;\displaystyle\norm{f(x)|x|^m}_p+ \norm{\widehat{f}(\xi)|\xi|^n}_q &lt;\infty.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We~describe a Dirichlet-type space of $H$-harmonic functions, i.e. functions annihilated by the hyperbolic Laplacian on~the unit ball of the real $n$-space, as~the analytic continuation (in~the spirit of Rossi and Vergne) of the corresponding weighted Bergman spaces. Characterizations in terms of derivatives are given, and the associated semi-inner product is shown to be Moebius invariant. We~also give a formula for the corresponding reproducing kernel. Our~results solve an open problem addressed by M.~Stoll in his book ``Harmonic and subharmonic function theory on the hyperbolic ball'' (Cambridge University Press, 2016).</description>

      <title>Stability in Phase Retrieval: Characterizing Condition Numbers and the Optimal Vector Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we primarily focus on analyzing the stability property of phase retrieval by examining the bi-Lipschitz property of the map $\Phi_{\boldsymbol{A}}(\boldsymbol{x})=|\boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{x}|\in \mathbb{R}_+^m$, where $\boldsymbol{x}\in \mathbb{H}^d$ and $\boldsymbol{A}\in \mathbb{H}^{m\times d}$ is the measurement matrix for $\mathbb{H}\in\{\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}\}$. We define the condition number $\beta_{\boldsymbol{A}}:=\frac{U_{\boldsymbol{A}}}{L_{\boldsymbol{A}}}$, where $L_{\boldsymbol{A}}$ and $U_{\boldsymbol{A}}$ represent the optimal lower and upper Lipschitz constants, respectively. We establish the first universal lower bound on $\beta_{\boldsymbol{A}}$ by demonstrating that for any ${\boldsymbol{A}}\in\mathbb{H}^{m\times d}$, \begin{equation*} \beta_{\boldsymbol{A}}\geq \beta_0^{\mathbb{H}}:=\begin{cases} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\pi-2}}\,\,\approx\,\, 1.659 &amp; \text{if $\mathbb{H}=\mathbb{R}$,}\\ \sqrt{\frac{4}{4-\pi}}\,\,\approx\,\, 2.159 &amp; \text{if $\mathbb{H}=\mathbb{C}$.} \end{cases} \end{equation*} We prove that the condition number of a standard Gaussian matrix in $\mathbb{H}^{m\times d}$ asymptotically matches the lower bound $\beta_0^{\mathbb{H}}$ for both real and complex cases. This result indicates that the constant lower bound $\beta_0^{\mathbb{H}}$ is asymptotically tight, holding true for both the real and complex scenarios. As an application of this result, we utilize it to investigate the performance of quadratic models for phase retrieval. Lastly, we establish that for any odd integer $m\geq 3$, the harmonic frame $\boldsymbol{A}\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times 2}$ possesses the minimum condition number among all $\boldsymbol{A}\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times 2}$. We are confident that these findings carry substantial implications for enhancing our understanding of phase retrieval.</description>

      <title>Statistical Independence and the Brockwell Transform -- From an Integral Equation Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical independence is a notion ubiquitous in various fields such as in statistics, probability, number theory and physics. We establish the stability of independence for any pair of random variables by their corresponding Brockwell transforms (Brockwell, 2007) beyond the non-atomic condition that is naturally imposed on their distributions, thereby generalizing the proposition originated by Cai et al. (2022). A central novelty in our work is to formulate the problem as a possibly new type of mathematical inverse problem, which aims to claim that an integral equation has a unique solution in terms of its stochastic kernel -- not under-determined contrary to the usual cases, and also to design a recursive constructive scheme, combined with the property of the quantile function, that solves the aforementioned integral equation in an iterative manner.</description>

      <title>The search for NLS ground states on a hybrid domain: Motivations, methods, and results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the problem of establishing the existence of the Ground States for the subcritical focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger energy on a domain made of a line and a plane intersecting at a point. The problem is physically motivated by the experimental realization of hybrid traps for Bose-Einstein Condensates, that are able to concentrate the system on structures close to the domain we consider. In fact, such a domain approximates the trap as the temperature approaches the absolute zero. The spirit of the paper is mainly pedagogical, so we focus on the formulation of the problem and on the explanation of the result, giving references for the technical points and for the proofs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a complete, unbounded, hyperbolic metric space $X$ and a concave, nonzero and nondecreasing function $\omega:[0,+\infty)\to[0,+\infty)$ with $\omega(0)=0$ and study the space $\mathcal{C}_\omega(X)$ of uniformly continous self-mappings on $X$ whose modulus of continuity is bounded above by $\omega$. We endow $\mathcal{C}_\omega(X)$ with the topology of uniform convergence on bounded sets and prove that the modulus of continuity of the generic mapping in $\mathcal{C}_\omega(X)$, in the sense of Baire categories, is precisely $\omega$. Some related results in spaces of bounded mappings and in the topology of pointwise convergence are also discussed. This note can be seen as a completion of various results due to F. Strobin, S. Reich, A. Zaslavski, C. Bargetz and D. Thimm.</description>

      <title>Limit-case admissibility for positive infinite-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of positive infinite-dimensional linear systems, we systematically study $L^p$-admissible control and observation operators with respect to the limit-cases $p=\infty$ and $p=1$, respectively. This requires an in-depth understanding of the order structure on the extrapolation space $X_{-1}$, which we provide. These properties of $X_{-1}$ also enable us to discuss when zero-class admissibility is automatic. While those limit-cases are the weakest form of admissibility on the $L^p$-scale, it is remarkable that they sometimes follow from order theoretic and geometric assumptions. Our assumptions on the geometries of the involved spaces are minimal.</description>

      <title>Neural Hilbert Ladders: Multi-Layer Neural Networks in Function Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To characterize the function space explored by neural networks (NNs) is an important aspect of learning theory. In this work, noticing that a multi-layer NN generates implicitly a hierarchy of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) - named a neural Hilbert ladder (NHL) - we define the function space as an infinite union of RKHSs, which generalizes the existing Barron space theory of two-layer NNs. We then establish several theoretical properties of the new space. First, we prove a correspondence between functions expressed by L-layer NNs and those belonging to L-level NHLs. Second, we prove generalization guarantees for learning an NHL with a controlled complexity measure. Third, we derive a non-Markovian dynamics of random fields that governs the evolution of the NHL which is induced by the training of multi-layer NNs in an infinite-width mean-field limit. Fourth, we show examples of depth separation in NHLs under the ReLU activation function. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the feature learning aspect of NN training through the lens of NHLs.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for particle gradient descent, and extensions of the log-Sobolev and Talagrand inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove non-asymptotic error bounds for particle gradient descent (PGD)~(Kuntz et al., 2023), a recently introduced algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of large latent variable models obtained by discretizing a gradient flow of the free energy. We begin by showing that, for models satisfying a condition generalizing both the log-Sobolev and the Polyak--{\L}ojasiewicz inequalities (LSI and P{\L}I, respectively), the flow converges exponentially fast to the set of minimizers of the free energy. We achieve this by extending a result well-known in the optimal transport literature (that the LSI implies the Talagrand inequality) and its counterpart in the optimization literature (that the P{\L}I implies the so-called quadratic growth condition), and applying it to our new setting. We also generalize the Bakry--\'Emery Theorem and show that the LSI/P{\L}I generalization holds for models with strongly concave log-likelihoods. For such models, we further control PGD's discretization error, obtaining non-asymptotic error bounds. While we are motivated by the study of PGD, we believe that the inequalities and results we extend may be of independent interest.</description>
