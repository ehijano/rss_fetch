      <title>Kazhdan-Lusztig map and Langlands duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over $\mathbb{C}$ with Weyl group $W$. Following a suggestion of Bezrukavnikov, we define a map from two-sided cells to conjugacy classes in $W$ using the geometry of the affine flag variety. This is an affine analog of the classical story of two-sided cells of $W$, special nilpotent orbits and special representations of $W$. The proof involves studying Springer representations appearing in the cohomology of affine Springer fibers. This relies on tools developed by Yun in his papers on Global Springer theory. Our result provides evidence for a conjecture of Lusztig on strata in a connected reductive group.</description>

      <title>Serre functors and complete torsion pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a torsion pair $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$ in an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$, there is a t-structure $(\mathcal{U}_\mathcal{T},\mathcal{V}_\mathcal{T})$ determined by $\mathcal{T}$ on the derived category $D^b(\mathcal{A})$. The existence of derived equivalence between heart $\mathcal{B}$ of the t-structure and $\mathcal{A}$ which naturally extends the embedding $\mathcal{B}\to D^b(\mathcal{A})$ is determined by the completeness of the torsion pair [6]. When $\mathcal{A}$ is the module category of a finite-dimensional hereditary algebra and $\mathcal{U}_\mathcal{T}$ is closed under Serre functor, then there exists a triangle equivalence $D^b(\mathcal{B})\to D^b(\mathcal{A})$ [21]. In this case, we give a straightforward proof of the fact torsion pair $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$ is complete if and only if $\mathcal{U}_\mathcal{T}$ is closed under the Serre functor.</description>

      <title>The solenoidal Heisenberg Virasoro algebra and its simple weight modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A_n=\mathbb{C}[t_i^{\pm1},~1\leq i\leq n]$ and $\mathbf{W}(n)_\mu=A_nd_\mu$ the solenoidal Lie algebra introduced by Y.Billig and V.Futorny in \cite{BiFu2}, where $\mu=(\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_n)\in\mathbb{C}^n$ is a generic vector and $$d_\mu=\sum_{i=1}^n\mu_it_i\frac{\partial}{\partial t_i}.$$ We consider the semi-direct product Lie algebra $\mathbf{WA}(n)_\mu:=\mathbf{W}(n)_\mu\ltimes A_n$.
  In the first part, We prove that $\mathbf{WA}(n)_\mu$ has a unique three-dimensional universal central extension. In fact we construct a higher rank Heisenberg-Virasoro algebra (see \cite{LiuGuo, LdZ}). It will be denoted by $\mathbf{HVir}(n)_\mu$ and it will be called the solenoidal Heisenberg-Virasoro algebra. Then we will study Harish-Chandra modules of $\mathbf{HVir}(n)_\mu$ following \cite{LiuGuo}. We will obtain two classes of Harich-Chandra modules: generalized highest weight modules(\textbf{GHW} modules) and intermediate series modules. Our results are particular cases of \cite{LiuGuo}. In the end, we will construct $\mathbf{HVir}(n)_\mu$ Verma modules using the lexicographic order on $\mathbb{Z}^{n}$. In particular we give examples of irreducible weight modules which have infinite dimensional weight spaces.</description>

      <title>A geometric model for the module category of a string algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a geometric construction of string algebras and of their module categories. Our approach uses dissections of punctured Riemann surfaces with extra data at marked points, called labels. As an application, we give a classification of support tau-tilting modules in terms of arcs in such a tiled surface. In the case when the string algebra is gentle, we recover the classification given arXiv:2004.11136.</description>

      <title>Computing $p$-presentation distances is hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, $p$-presentation distances for $p\in [1,\infty]$ were introduced for merge trees and multiparameter persistence modules as more sensitive variations of the respective interleaving distances ($p=\infty$). It is well-known that computing the interleaving distance is NP-hard in both cases. We extend this result by showing that computing the $p$-presentation distance is NP-hard for all $p\in [1,\infty)$ for both merge trees and $t$-parameter persistence modules for any $t\geq 2$. Though the details differ, both proofs follow the same novel strategy, suggesting that our approach can be adapted to proving the NP-hardness of other distances based on sums or $p$-norms.</description>

      <title>Crystal Chute Moves on Pipe Dreams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schubert polynomials represent a basis for the cohomology of the complete flag variety and thus play a central role in geometry and combinatorics. In this context, Schubert polynomials are generating functions over various combinatorial objects, such as rc-graphs or reduced pipe dreams. By restricting Bergeron and Billey's chute moves on rc-graphs, we define a Demazure crystal structure on the monomials of a Schubert polynomial. As a consequence, we provide a method for decomposing Schubert polynomials as sums of key polynomials, complementing related work of Assaf and Schilling via reduced factorizations with cutoff, as well as Lenart's coplactic operators on biwords.</description>

      <title>The power operation in the Galois cohomology of a reductive group over a number field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a connected reductive group $G$ over a local or global field $K$, we define a *diamond* (or *power*) operation $$(\xi, n)\mapsto \xi^{\Diamond n}\, \colon\ H^1(K,G)\times {\mathbb Z}\to H^1(K,G)$$ of raising to power $n$ in the Galois cohomology pointed set (this operation is new when $K$ is a number field). We show that this operation has many functorial properties. When $G$ is a torus, the ponted set $H^1(K,G)$ has a natural group structure, and our new operation coincides with the usual power operation $(\xi,n)\mapsto \xi^n$.
  For a cohomology class $\xi$ in $H^1(K,G)$, we define the period ${\rm per}(\xi)$ to be the greatest common divisor of $n\ge 1$ such that $\xi^{\Diamond n}=1$, and the index ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ to be the greatest common divisor of the degrees $[L:K]$ of finite separable extensions $L/K$ splitting $\xi$. We show that ${\rm per}(\xi)$ divides ${\rm ind}(\xi)$, but they need not be equal. However, ${\rm per}(\xi)$ and ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ have the same set of prime factors.</description>

We develop a novel method for computing the $S_n$-equivariant $E$-polynomial of an algebraic variety, and we apply it to this new kind of varieties.</description>

      <title>On t-structures adjacent and orthogonal to weight structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $t$-structures (on triangulated categories) that are closely related to weight structures.
  A $t$-structure couple $t=(C_{t\le 0},C_{t\ge 0})$ is said to be adjacent to a weight structure $w=(C_{w\le 0}, C_{w\ge 0})$ if $C_{t\ge 0}=C_{w\ge 0}$.
  For a category $C$ that satisfies the Brown representability property we prove that $t$ that is adjacent to $w$ exists if and only if $w$ is smashing (that is, "respects C-coproducts"). The heart $Ht$ of this $t$ is the category of those functors $Hw^{op}\to Ab$ that respect products (here $Hw$ is the heart of $w$); the result has important applications.
  We prove several more statements on constructing $t$-structures starting from weight structures; we look for a strictly orthogonal $t$-structure $t$ on some $C'$ (where $C,C'$ are triangulated subcategories of a common $D$) such that $C'_{t\le 0}$ (resp. $C'_{t\ge 0}$) is characterized by the vanishing of morphisms from $C_{w\ge 1}$ (resp. $C_{w\le -1}$). Some of these results generalize properties of semi-orthogonal decompositions proved in the previous paper, and can be applied to various derived categories of (quasi)coherent sheaves on a scheme $X$ that is projective over an affine noetherian one. We also study hearts of orthogonal $t$-structures and their restrictions, and prove some statements on "reconstructing" weight structures from orthogonal $t$-structures.</description>

      <title>Homological and homotopical aspects of Gorenstein flat modules and complexes relative to duality pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11014v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study homological and homotopical aspects of Gorenstein flat modules over a ring with respect to a duality pair $(\mathcal{L,A})$. These modules are defined as cycles of exact chain complexes with components in $\mathcal{L}$ which remain exact after tensoring by objects in $\mathcal{A} \cap {}^\perp\mathcal{A} = \mathcal{A} \cap \Big( \bigcap_{i \in \mathbb{Z}_{&gt; 0}} {\rm Ker}({\rm Ext}^i_{R^{\rm o}}(-,\mathcal{A})) \Big)$. In the case where $(\mathcal{L,A})$ is product closed and bicomplete (meaning in addition that $\mathcal{L}$ is closed under extensions, (co)products, $R \in \mathcal{L}$, $(\mathcal{A,L})$ is also a duality pair, and $\mathcal{A}$ is the right half of a hereditary complete cotorsion pair) we prove that these relative Gorenstein flat modules are closed under extensions, and that the corresponding Gorenstein flat dimension is well behaved in the sense that it recovers many of the properties and characterizations of its (absolute) Gorenstein flat counterpart (for instance, it can be described in terms of torsion functors). The latter in turn is a consequence of a Pontryagin duality relation that we show between these relative Gorenstein flat modules and certain Gorenstein injective modules relative to $\mathcal{A}$. We also find several hereditary and cofibrantly generated abelian model structures from these Gorenstein flat modules and complexes relative to $(\mathcal{L,A})$. At the level of chain complexes, we find three recollements between the homotopy categories of these model structures, along with several derived adjunctions connecting these recollements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.08998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of the power quandle of a group, an algebraic structure that forgets the multiplication but keeps the conjugation and the power maps. Compared with plain quandles, power quandles are much better invariants of groups. We show that they determine the central quotient of any group and the center of any finite group. Any group can be canonically approximated by the associated group of its power quandle, which we show to be a central extension, with a universal property, and a computable kernel. This allows us to present any group as a quotient of a group with a power-conjugation presentation by an abelian subgroup that is determined by the power quandle and low-dimensional homological invariants.</description>

      <title>Eilenberg-Moore categories and quiver representations of monads and comonads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider representations of quivers taking values in monads or comonads over a Grothendieck category $\mathcal C$. We treat these as scheme like objects whose ``structure sheaf'' consists of monads or comonads. By using systems of adjoint functors between Eilenberg-Moore categories, we obtain a categorical framework of modules over monad quivers, and of comodules over comonad quivers. Our main objective is to give conditions for these to be Grothendieck categories, which play the role of noncommutative spaces. As with usual ringed spaces, we have to study two kinds of module categories over a monad quiver. The first behaves like a sheaf of modules over a ringed space. The second consists of modules that are cartesian, which resemble quasi-coherent sheaves. We also obtain an extension of the classical quasi-coherator construction to modules over a monad quiver with values in Eilenberg-Moore categories. We establish similar results for comodules over a comonad quiver. One of our key steps is finding a modulus like bound for an endofunctor $U:\mathcal C\longrightarrow \mathcal C$ in terms of $\kappa(G)$, where $G$ is a generator for $\mathcal C$ and $\kappa(G)$ is a cardinal such that $G$ is $\kappa(G)$-presentable. Another feature of our paper is that we study modules over a monad quiver in two different orientations, which we refer to as ``cis-modules'' and ``trans-modules.'' We conclude with rational pairings of a monad quiver with a comonad quiver, which relate comodules over a comonad quiver to coreflective subcategories of modules over monad quivers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group acting on a left or right rigid monoidal triangulated category ${\mathbf K}$ which has a Noetherian Balmer spectrum. We prove that the Balmer spectrum of the crossed product category of ${\mathbf K}$ by $G$ is homeomorphic to the space of $G$-prime ideals of ${\mathbf K}$, give a concrete description of this space, and classify the $G$-invariant thick ideals of ${\mathbf K}$. Under some additional technical conditions, we prove that the Balmer spectrum of the equivariantization of ${\mathbf K}$ by $G$ is also homeomorphic to the space of $G$-prime ideals. Examples of stable categories of finite tensor categories and perfect derived categories of coherent sheaves on Noetherian schemes are used to illustrate the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an $n$-qubit system, a rational function on the space of mixed states which is invariant with respect to the action of the group of local symmetries may be viewed as a detailed measure of entanglement. We show that the field of all such invariant rational functions is purely transcendental over the complex numbers and has transcendence degree $4^n - 2n-1$. An explicit transcendence basis is also exhibited.</description>
