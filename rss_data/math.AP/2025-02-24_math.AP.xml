      <title>Stochastic interpretations of the oceanic primitive equations with relaxed hydrostatic assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how weakening the classical hydrostatic balance hypothesis impacts the well-posedness of the stochastic LU primitive equations. The models we consider are intermediate between the incompressible 3D LU Navier-Stokes equations and the LU primitive equations with standard hydrostatic balance. As such, they are expected to be numerically tractable, while accounting well for phenomena within the grey zone between hydrostatic balance and non-hydrostatic processes. Our main result is the well-posedness of a low-pass filtering-based stochastic interpretation of the LU primitive equations, with rigid-lid type boundary conditions, in the limit of ``quasi-barotropic'' flow. This assumption is linked to the structure assumption proposed in the work of Agresti et al., which can be related to the dynamical regime where the primitive equations remain valid. Furthermore, we present and study two eddy-(hyper)viscosity-based models.</description>

      <title>An essential one sided boundary singularity for a $3$-dimensional area minimizing current in $\mathbb{R}^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a $3$ dimensional area minimizing current $T$ in $\mathbb{R}^5$ whose boundary contains a real analytic surface of multiplicity $2$ at which $T$ has a density $1$ essential boundary singularity with a flat tangent cone. This example shows that the regularity theory we developed with Reinaldo Resende in another paper, is dimensionally sharp.
  The construction of $T$ relies on the prescription of boundary data with non-trivial topology, which makes it an extremely flexible technique and gives rise to a wide family of singular examples.
  In order to understand the examples, we develop a boundary regularity theory for a class of area minimizing $m$-dimensional currents whose boundary consists of smooth $(m-1)$-dimensional surfaces with multiplicities meeting at an $(m-2)$-dimensional smooth submanifold.</description>

      <title>On determination of the bifurcation type for a free boundary problem modeling tumor growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many mathematical models in different disciplines involve the formulation of free boundary problems, where the domain boundaries are not predefined. These models present unique challenges, notably the nonlinear coupling between the solution and the boundary, which complicates the identification of bifurcation types. This paper mainly investigates the structure of symmetry-breaking bifurcations in a two-dimensional free boundary problem modeling tumor growth. By expanding the solution to a high order with respect to a small parameter and computing the bifurcation direction at each bifurcation point, we demonstrate that all the symmetry-breaking bifurcations occurred in the model, as established by the Crandall-Rabinowitz Bifurcation From Simple Eigenvalue Theorem, are pitchfork bifurcations. These findings reveal distinct behaviors between the two-dimensional and three-dimensional cases of the same model.</description>

      <title>Traveling-wave solutions for a higher-order Boussineq system: existence and numerical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence and numerical computation of traveling wave solutions for a family of nonlinear higher-order Boussinesq evolution systems with a Hamiltonian structure. This general Boussinesq evolution system includes a broad class of homogeneous and non-homogeneous nonlinearities. We establish the existence of traveling wave solutions using the variational structure of the system and the \textit{concentration-compactness} principle by P.-L. Lions, even though the nonlinearity could be non-homogeneous. For the homogeneous case, the traveling wave equations of the Boussinesq system are approximated using a spectral approach based on a Fourier basis, along with an iterative method that includes appropriate stabilizing factors to ensure convergence. In the non-homogeneous case, we apply a collocation Fourier method supplemented by Newton's iteration. Additionally, we present numerical experiments that explore cases in which the wave velocity falls outside the theoretical range of existence.</description>

      <title>A Generalization of Littlewood-Paley Type Inequality for Evolution Systems Associated with Pseudo Differential Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first prove that the Littlewood-Paley $g$-function, related to the convolution corresponding to the composition of pseudo-differential operator and evolution system associated with pseudo-differential operators, is a bounded operator from $L^{q}((a,b)\times \mathbb{R}^{d};V)$ with a Hilbert space $V$ into $L^{q}((a,b)\times \mathbb{R}^{d})$. Secondly, we prove that the sharp function of the Littlewood-Paley $g$-function is bounded by some maximal function. Finally, by applying Fefferman-Stein theorem and Hardy-Littlewood maximal theorem, we prove the Littlewood-Paley type inequality for evolution systems associated with pseudo-differential operators.</description>

      <title>Almost sure existence of global weak solutions for incompressible generalized Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the initial value problem of the incompressible generalized Navier-Stokes equations in torus $\mathbb{T}^d$ with $d \geq 2$. The generalized Navier-Stokes equations is obtained by replacing the standard Laplacian in the classical Navier-Stokes equations by the fractional order Laplacian $-(-\Delta)^\al$ with $\al \in \left( \frac{2}{3},1 \right]$. After an appropriate randomization on the initial data, we obtain the almost sure existence of global weak solutions for initial data being in $\Dot{H}^s(\mathbb{T}^d)$ with $s\in (1-2\al,0)$.</description>

      <title>Stability for an inverse flux and an inverse boundary coefficient problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish both Lipschitz and logarithmic stability estimates for an inverse flux problem and subsequently apply these results to an inverse boundary coefficient problem. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the stability inequalities derived for the inverse boundary coefficient problem can be utilized in solving an inverse corrosion problem. This involves determining the unknown corrosion coefficient on an inaccessible part of the boundary based on measurements taken on the accessible part of the boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we establish precise lower bounds for the eigenvalues and critical values associated with the fractional $A-$Laplacian operator, where $A$ is a Young function. The obtained bounds are expressed in terms of the domain geometry and the growth properties of the function $A$. We emphasize that we do not assume that $A$ or its complementary function satisfies the $\Delta_2$ condition.</description>

      <title>Recent advances in the analysis of the dissipative Aw-Rascle system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-dimensional Aw-Rascle (AR) system has become a cornerstone of macroscopic models for single-lane vehicular traffic. A possible generalization of this model to a multi-dimensional setting is the so-called dissipative AR model, which is more suited to capturing crowd dynamics. This review summarizes recent studies that analyze the dissipative AR model, its hard congestion limit, the non-uniqueness of weak solutions, the existence and asymptotics of solutions within the duality framework, non-local interactions, and the existence of regular solutions.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates for the vanishing viscosity approximation of Hamilton-Jacobi equations: the convex case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the speed of convergence in $L^\infty$ norm of the vanishing viscosity process for Hamilton-Jacobi equations with uniformly or strictly convex Hamiltonian terms with superquadratic behavior. Our analysis boosts previous findings on the rate of convergence for this procedure in $L^p$ norms, showing rates in sup-norm of order $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^\beta)$, $\beta\in(1/2,1)$, or $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon|\log\epsilon|)$ with respect to the vanishing viscosity parameter $\epsilon$, depending on the regularity of the initial datum of the problem and convexity properties of the Hamiltonian. Our proofs are based on integral methods and avoid the use of techniques based on stochastic control or the maximum principle.</description>

      <title>Control of the half-heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate null-controllable initial states of the half heat equation controlled from a sub-arc $\omega$ of the unit circle. We also study the projection on positive frequencies of the half-heat equation. For this projected half-heat equation, we obtain necessary as well as sufficient conditions for an initial condition to be null-controllable. These conditions, which are almost sharp, are expressed in term of projections on positive frequencies of functions supported on $\omega$. From these results, and with the help of classical results on sum of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic functions, we also treat the (unprojected) half-heat equation. Surprisingly, without using our conditions on null-controllable states, we are able to show that the space of null-controllable functions does not depend on time by using a result of separation of singularities for holomorphic functions.</description>

      <title>A growth estimate for the planar Mumford--Shah minimizers at a tip point: An alternative proof of David--L\'eger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset \mathbb R^2$ be a bounded domain and $u\in SBV(\Omega)$ be a local minimizer of the Mumford--Shah problem in the plane, with $0\in \overline{S}_u$ being a tip point and $B_1\subset \Omega$. Then there exist absolute constants $C&gt;0$ and $0&lt;r_0&lt;1$ such that $$|u(x)-u(0)|\le C r^{\frac 1 2} \quad \text{ for any } \ x\in B_r \ \text{ and } \ 0&lt;r&lt;r_0. $$ This estimate is a local version of the original one in \cite[Proposition 10.17]{DL2002}.
  Our result is based on a dichotomy and the John structure of $\Omega\setminus \overline{S}_u$, different from the one by David--L\'eger \cite{DL2002} or Bonnet--David \cite[Lemma 21.3]{BD2001}.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Optimal Transport (OTIKIN) -- Part 1: Second-Order Discrepancies Between Probability Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first of a series of papers aimed at constructing a general theory of optimal transport to describe the time evolution of complex systems of interacting particles at the kinetic level. We argue that this theory may have applications also to biology (RNA sequencing and cell development), computer vision (continuous interpolation of images), and engineering (optimal steering).
  Firstly, we define our main object: a new second-order discrepancy between probability measures, analogous to the $2$-Wasserstein distance, but based on the minimisation of the squared acceleration.
  Secondly, we prove existence for the associated Kantorovich problem, and, under suitable conditions, of an optimal transport map. We also provide an equivalent time-continuous characterisation (Benamou--Brenier formula), where the admissible curves of measures are solutions to an adapted class of Vlasov's continuity equations.
  Thirdly, we define a class of absolutely continuous curves of measures and prove that they coincide exactly with time reparametrisations of solutions to Vlasov's equations.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of L\'evy-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroups on $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of Markov semigroups associated with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes driven by L\'evy processes. These semigroups are generated by non-local, non-self-adjoint operators. In the special case where the driving L\'evy process is Brownian motion, one recovers the classical diffusion OU semigroup, whose spectral properties have been extensively studied over past few decades. Our main results establish that, under suitable conditions on the L\'evy process, the spectrum of the L\'evy-OU semigroup in the $L^p$-space weighted with the invariant distribution coincides with that of the diffusion OU semigroup. Furthermore, when the drift matrix $B$ is diagonalizable with real eigenvalues, we derive explicit formulas for eigenfunctions and co-eigenfunctions--an observation that, to the best of our knowledge, has not appeared in the literature. We also show that the multiplicities of the eigenvalues remain independent on the choice of the L\'evy process. A key ingredient in our approach is intertwining relationship: we prove that every L\'evy-OU semigroup is intertwined with a diffusion OU semigroup. Additionally, we examine the compactness properties of these semigroups and provide examples of non-compact L\'evy-OU semigroups.</description>

      <title>Bushfires and Balance: Proactive versus Reactive Policies in Prescribed Burning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model to describe the interplay between prescribed burning and bushfires based on a system of ordinary differential equations.
  We show that the system possesses a unique steady-state, whose stability depends on the policy governing prescribed burning. Specifically, a Reactive Policy in which prescribed burning activities are increased in response to bushfire events risks to produce instability and requires an additional feedback control, while a Proactive Policy in which moderate prescribed burning replaces natural bushfires may be more effective to maintain a balanced state. A high regeneration factor is also helpful to ensuring the stability of the equilibrium state.
  The results presented here should not be regarded as a definitive solution to the issue of prescribed burning, as numerous specific factors must be considered in any comprehensive policymaking approach. Nonetheless, the stability analysis developed in this paper suggests that policies driven primarily by reactive responses to bushfire events may be emotionally charged and prone to instability. These reactive policies would benefit from incorporating feedback control mechanisms. In contrast, strategies based on proactive prescribed burning in moderate quantities, focused on prevention rather than reaction, are likely to be more effective in maintaining long-term ecological stability.</description>

      <title>Bound on the Excess Charge of Generalized Thomas-Fermi-Weizs\"acker Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We bound the number of electrons $Q$ that an atom can bind in excess of neutrality for density functionals generalizing the classical Thomas-Fermi-Weizs\"acker functional: instead of the classical power $5/3$ more general powers $p$ are considered. For $3/2&lt;p&lt;2$ we prove the excess charge conjecture, i.e., that $Q$ is uniformly bounded in the atomic number $Z$. The case $p=3/2$ is critical: the behavior changes from a uniform bound in $Z$ to a linear bound at the critical coupling $4\sqrt\pi$ of the nonlinear term. We also improve the linear bound for all $p\geq6/5$.</description>

Abstract: We identify the blow-up rate of a solution to a generalised Blasius equation, that we came across while studying a probabilistic model of "Poissonian burning" in Euclidean space.

Abstract: In this note we analyze the large time behavior of solutions to an initial/boundary problem involving a damped nonlinear beam equation. We show that under physically realistic conditions on the nonlinear terms in the equation of motion the energy is a decreasing function of time and solutions converge to a stationary solution with respect to a desirable norm.</description>

      <title>The Exact Solutions of Certain Linear Partial Difference Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Difference equations have many applications and play an important role in numerical analysis, probability, statistics, combinatorics, computer science, quantum consciousness, etc. We first prove that the partial differential equation is equivalent to partial difference equation with an example of heat equation. Additionally, we use generating functions to find the exact solutions of some simple linear partial difference equations. Then we extend it to more general partial difference equations of higher dimensions and obtain their solutions. Notice that Theorem 4.2 could provide a mathematical framework for understanding how information within a black hole is encoded on its event horizon, a key concept in the black hole information paradox. In addition, we extend it to n-dimensional case, Theorem 4.4, the high-order partial difference equations (HOPDE). We conclude that using multivariable power series as generating function is a very efficient method to solve partial difference equations.</description>

      <title>Uniform Decaying Property of Solutions for Anisotropic Viscoelastic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper concerns about the uniform decaying property (abbreviated by UDP) of solutions for an anisotropic viscoelastic system in the form of integrodifferential system (abbreviated by VID system) with mixed type boundary condition. The mixed type condition consists of the homogeneous displacement boundary condition and a homogeneous traction boundary condition or with a dissipation. By using a dissipative structure of this system, we will prove the UDP in a unified way for the two cases, which are, when the time derivative of relaxation tensor decays with polynomial order and it decays with exponential order.</description>

      <title>Weak solutions and singular limits for a compressible fluid-structure interaction problem with slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a system describing the compressible barotropic fluids interacting with (visco) elastic solid shell/plate. In particular, the elastic structure is part of the moving boundary of the fluid, and the Navier-slip type boundary condition is taken into account. Depending on the reference geometry (flat or not), we show the existence of weak solutions to the coupled system provided the adiabatic exponent satisfies $\gamma &gt; \frac{12}{7}$ without damping and $\gamma &gt; \frac{3}{2}$ with structure damping, utilizing the domain extension and regularization approximation. Moreover, via a modified relative entropy method in time-dependent domains, we give a rigorous justification of the incompressible inviscid limit of the compressible fluid-structure interaction problem with a flat reference geometry, in the regime of low Mach number, high Reynolds number, and well-prepared initial data. As a byproduct, with a fixed Reynolds number, we derive the incompressible limit without extra assumption. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result concerning the singular limit problem for compressible fluids interacting with elastic structures.</description>

Abstract: We study the nonlinear steady Boltzmann equation in the half space, with phase transition and Dirichlet boundary condition. In particular, we study the regularity of the solution to the half-space problem in the situation that the gas is in contact with its condensed phase. We propose a novel kinetic weight and establish a weighted $C^1$ estimate under the spatial domain $x\in [0,\infty)$, which is unbounded and not strictly convex. Additionally, we prove the $W^{1,p}$ estimate without any weight for $p&lt;2$.</description>

      <title>Finite-time blow-up in fully parabolic quasilinear Keller-Segel systems with supercritical exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the possibility of finite-time blow-up of solutions to the fully parabolic quasilinear Keller--Segel model \begin{align}\tag{$\star$}\label{prob:star}
  \begin{cases}
  u_t = \nabla \cdot ((u+1)^{m-1}\nabla u - u(u+1)^{q-1}\nabla v) &amp; \text{in $\Omega \times (0, T)$}, \\
  v_t = \Delta v - v + u &amp; \text{in $\Omega \times (0, T)$}
  \end{cases} \end{align} in a ball $\Omega\subset \mathbb R^n$ with $n\geq 2$. Previous results show that unbounded solutions exist for all $m, q \in \mathbb R$ with $m-q&lt;\frac{n-2}{n}$, which, however, are necessarily global in time if $q \leq 0$. It is expected that finite-time blow-up is possible whenever $q &gt; 0$ but in the fully parabolic setting this has so far only been shown when $\max\{m, q\} \geq 1$.
  In the present paper, we substantially extend these findings. Our main results for the two- and three-dimensional settings state that \eqref{prob:star} admits solutions blowing up in finite time if \begin{align*}
  m-q&lt;\frac{n-2}{n}
  \quad \text{and} \quad
  \begin{cases}
  q &lt; 2m &amp; \text{if } n = 2, \\
  q &lt; 2m - \frac23 \text{ or } m &gt; \frac23 &amp; \text{if } n = 3,
  \end{cases} \end{align*} that is, also for certain $m, q$ with $\max\{m, q\} &lt; 1$. As a key new ingredient in our proof, we make use of (singular) pointwise upper estimates for $u$.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel estimates for boundary traces of reflected diffusions on uniform domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the boundary trace processes of reflected diffusions on uniform domains. We obtain stable-like heat kernel estimates for such a boundary trace process when the diffusion on the underlying ambient space satisfies sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates. Our arguments rely on new results of independent interest such as sharp two-sided estimates and the volume doubling property of the harmonic measure, the existence of a continuous extension of the Na\"im kernel to the topological boundary, and the Doob--Na\"im formula identifying the Dirichlet form of the boundary trace process as the pure-jump Dirichlet form whose jump kernel with respect to the harmonic measure is exactly (the continuous extension of) the Na\"im kernel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This technical note is concerned with boundary stabilization of multi-dimensional discrete-velocity kinetic models. By exploiting a certain stability structure of the models and adapting an appropriate Lyapunov functional, we derive feasible control laws so that the corresponding solutions decay exponentially in time. The result is illustrated with an application to the two-dimensional coplanar model in a square container. The effectiveness of the derived control laws is confirmed by numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of common retraction and coretraction for families of Banach spaces, formulate a framework for identifying interpolation spaces, and apply it to modulation spaces with exponential weights $E^s_{p,q}$. By constructing the domain of the common coretraction, we are able to prove $E^s_{o, q} \hookrightarrow E^s_{p, q}$ for $o \leq p$, i.e. the monotonicity in the spatial integrability parameter.</description>

      <title>Localized past stability of the subcritical Kasner-scalar field spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the nonlinear stability, in the contracting direction, of the entire subcritical family of Kasner-scalar field solutions to the Einstein-scalar field equations in four spacetime dimensions. Our proof relies on a zero-shift, orthonormal frame decomposition of a conformal representation of the Einstein-scalar field equations. To synchronise the big bang singularity, we use the time coordinate $\tau = \exp\bigl(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\phi\bigr)$, where $\phi$ is the scalar field, which coincides with a conformal harmonic time slicing. We show that the perturbed solutions are asymptotically pointwise Kasner, geodesically incomplete to the past and terminate at quiescent, crushing big bang singularities located at $\tau=0$, which are characterised by curvature blow up. Specifically, we establish two stability theorems. The first is a global in-space stability result where the perturbed spacetimes are of the form $M =\bigcup_{t\in (0,t_0]} \tau^{-1}(\{t\}) \cong (0,t_0] \times \mathbb{T}^{3}$. The second is a localised version where the perturbed spacetimes are given by $M=\bigcup_{t\in (0,t_0]}\tau^{-1}(\{t\})\cong \bigcup_{t\in (0,t_0]} \{t\}\times\mathbb{B}_{\rho(t)}$ with time-dependent radius function $\rho(t)=\rho_0+(1-\vartheta)\rho_0\bigl(\bigl(\frac{t}{t_0}\bigr)^{1-\epsilon}-1\bigr)$. Spatial localisation is achieved through our choice of zero-shift, harmonic time slicing that leads to hyperbolic evolution equations with a finite propagation speed.</description>
