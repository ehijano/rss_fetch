      <title>Integrability of the Ablowitz-Ladik system with nonlocal shifted reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the complete integrability of the Ablowitz-Ladik (AL) system with shifted nonlocal reductions under the rapidly decreasing boundary conditions. We find that the space and space-time shifted nonlocal reductions preserve the complete integrability of the AL system, but it is not the case for the time shifted nonlocal reduction. For the resulting space and space-time shifted nonlocal differential-difference equations, we construct their explicit variables of action-angle type and present their Hamiltonian descriptions in terms of the action-angle variables.</description>

      <title>On the recurrence coefficients for the $q$-Laguerre weight and discrete Painlev\'e equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dependence of recurrence coefficients in the three-term recurrence relation for orthogonal polynomials with a certain deformation of the $q$-Laguerre weight on the degree parameter $n$. We show that this dependence is described by a discrete Painlev\'e equation on the family of $A_{5}^{(1)}$ Sakai surfaces, but this equation is different from the standard examples of discrete Painlev\'e equations of this type and instead is a composition of two such. This case study is a good illustration of the effectiveness of a recently proposed geometric identification scheme for discrete Painlev\'e equations.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and exact solutions of a reaction-diffusion system arising in population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system of two cubic reaction-diffusion equations for two independent gene frequencies arising in population dynamics is studied. Depending on values of coefficients, all possible Lie and $Q$-conditional (nonclassical) symmetries are identified. A wide range of new exact solutions is constructed, including those expressible in terms of a Lambert function and not obtainable by Lie symmetries. An example of a new real-world application of the system is discussed. A general algorithm for finding Q-conditional symmetries of nonlinear evolution systems of the most general form is presented in a useful form for other researchers.</description>

      <title>Exact g-function without strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to compute exact $g$-function for integrable quantum field theories with non-diagonal scattering S-matrices. The approach is based on an integrable lattice regularization of the quantum field theory. The exact $g$-function is encoded in the overlap of the integrable boundary state and the ground state on the lattice, which can be computed exactly by Bethe ansatz. In the continuum limit, after subtracting the contribution proportional to the volume of the closed channel, we obtain the exact $g$-function, given in terms of the counting function which is the solution of a nonlinear integral equation. The resulting $g$-function contains two parts, the scalar part, which depends on the boundary parameters and the ratio of Fredholm determinants, which is universal. This approach bypasses the difficulties of dealing with magnetic excitations for non-diagonal scattering theories in the framework of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. We obtain numerical and analytical results of the exact $g$-function for the prototypical sine-Gordon theory with various integrable boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>A Novel Geometric Realization of the Yajima-Oikawa Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Yajima-Oikawa (YO) equations, a model of short wave-long wave interaction, arise from a simple geometric flow on curves in the 3-dimensional sphere $S^3$ that are transverse to the standard contact structure. For the family of periodic plane wave solutions of the YO equations studied by Wright, we construct the associated transverse curves, derive their closure condition, and exhibit several examples with non-trivial topology.</description>

      <title>On Haantjes tensors for second-order superintegrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vanishing of the Haantjes tensor is an important property that has been linked, for instance, to the existence of separation coordinates and the integrability of systems of hydrodynamic type. We discuss the vanishing of the Haantjes tensor for operator fields that admit a large number of so-called conservation laws. In particular, we investigate Haantjes-zero Killing tensor fields that are associated with second-order superintegrable systems.</description>

      <title>Parameter-free higher-order Schrodinger systems with weak dissipation and forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The higher-order nonlinear Schrodinger equation (Dysthe's equation in the context of water-waves) models the time evolution of the slowly modulated amplitude of a wave-packet in dispersive partial differential equations (PDE). These systems, of which water-waves are a canonical example, require the presence of a small-valued ordering parameter so that a multi-scale expansion can be performed. However, often the resulting system itself contains the small-ordering parameter. Thus, these models are difficult to interpret from a formal asymptotics perspective. This paper derives a parameter-free, higher-order evolution equation for a generic infinite-dimensional dispersive PDE with weak linear damping and/or forcing. Instead of focusing on the water-wave problem or another specific problem, our procedure avoids the complicated algebra by placing the PDE in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and Taylor expanding with Frechet derivatives. An attractive feature of this procedure is that it can be used in many different physical settings, including water-waves, nonlinear optics and any dispersive system with weak dissipation or forcing. The paper concludes by discussing two specific examples.</description>

      <title>The generalised hodograph method for non-diagonalisable integrable systems of hydrodynamic type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the generalised hodograph method to regular non-diagonalisable integrable systems of hydrodynamic type, in light of the relation between such systems and F-manifolds with compatible connection. We discuss in detail the completeness of the symmetries of the system. Unlike the diagonalisable case, this does not follow from the natural integrability conditions but requires additional assumptions ensuring the applicability of a Darboux's theorem on Pfaffian systems. Under these assumptions, Tsarev's theory for diagonal systems is fully extended to regular non-diagonal systems.</description>

      <title>Solutions of tetrahedron equation from quantum cluster algebra associated with symmetric butterfly quiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08814v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new solution to the tetrahedron equation by further pursuing the quantum cluster algebra approach in our previous works. The key ingredients include a symmetric butterfly quiver attached to the wiring diagrams for the longest element of type $A$ Weyl groups and the implementation of quantum $Y$-variables through the $q$-Weyl algebra. The solution consists of four products of quantum dilogarithms, incorporating a total of seven parameters. By exploring both the coordinate and momentum representations, along with their modular double counterparts, our solution encompasses various known three-dimensional (3D) $R$-matrices. These include those obtained by Kapranov-Voevodsky ('94) utilizing the quantized coordinate ring, Bazhanov-Mangazeev-Sergeev ('10) from a quantum geometry perspective, Kuniba-Matsuike-Yoneyama ('23) linked with the quantized six-vertex model, and Inoue-Kuniba-Terashima ('23) associated with the Fock-Goncharov quiver. The 3D $R$-matrix presented in this paper offers a unified perspective on these existing solutions, coalescing them within the framework of quantum cluster algebra.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of a quantum integrable system associated with the $G_2$ exceptional Lie algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum integrable spin chain model associated with the $G_2$ exceptional Lie algebra is studied. By using the fusion technique, the closed recursive relations among the fused transfer matrices are obtained. These identities allow us to derive the exact energy spectrum and Bethe ansatz equations of the system based on polynomial analysis. The present method provides a unified treatment to investigate the Bethe ansatz solutions for both periodic and non-diagonal open boundary conditions associated with exceptional Lie algebras.</description>
