      <title>Simple lipids form stable higher-order structures in concentrated sulfuric acid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Venus has become a target of astrobiological interest because it is physically accessible to direct exploration, unlike exoplanets. So far this interest has been motivated not by the explicit expectation of finding life, but rather a desire to understand the limits of biology. The Venusian surface is sterilizing, but the cloud deck includes regions with temperatures and pressures conventionally considered compatible with life. However, the Venusian clouds are thought to consist of concentrated sulfuric acid. To determine if any fundamental features of life as we understand them here on Earth could in principle exist in these extreme solvent conditions, we have tested several simple lipids for resistance to solvolysis and their ability to form structures in concentrated sulfuric acid. We find that single-chain saturated lipids with sulfate, alcohol, trimethylamine, and phosphonate head groups are resistant to sulfuric acid degradation at room temperature. Furthermore, we find that they form stable higher-order structures typically associated with lipid membranes, micelles, and vesicles. Finally, results from molecular dynamics simulations suggest a molecular explanation for the observed robustness of the lipid structures formed in concentrated sulfuric acid. We conclude with implications for the study of Venus as a target of experimental astrobiology.</description>

      <title>Solid-liquid equilibria and excess enthalpies in binary mixtures of propiophenone with some aliphatic amides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solid-liquid equilibria and excess enthalpies of the binary systems of propiophenone and {N-methylformamide, or N,N-dimethylformamide, or N,N-dimethylacetamide, or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone} were measured. The SLE datawere determined by the cloud-point method, partly supplemented by the DSC technique. The excess enthalpieswere measured by the titration calorimetry at 298.15 K and 308.15 K for all the systems and additionally at 293.15 K and 318.15 K for the system with N-methylformamide, and at 293.15 K for the system with N,N-dimethylformamide. The activity coefficients of both components as a function of concentration and temperature were calculated by the correlation which included both types of data. The results of the prediction by the modified UNIFAC model were comparedwith the experimental data. The observed trends and differences between the systems were discussed.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of chlorobenzene, or bromobenzene, or 1-chloronaphthalene or 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene + alkane mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The systems C$_6$H$_5$Cl, or C$_6$H$_5$Br, or 1-chloronaphthalene, or 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, or 1-methylnaphthalene, or 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene + alkane have been investigated by means of the their excess molar properties, including, when the needed data are available, those at constant volume, internal energies ($U_{V\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$) and heat capacities ($C_{V\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$), and using the DISQUAC, and Flory models, and the concentration-concentration structure factor formalism. The position of the mixtures within the $G_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ (excess molar Gibbs energy) vs. $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ (excess molar enthalpy) diagram has been also determined. Interactions between C$_6$H$_5$X molecules become stronger in the sequence X = H $\approx$ F $\approx$ Cl &lt; Br. These interactions are weaker than those between 1-chloronaphtahlene or 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene molecules. It is shown that the considered systems have some common features: dispersive interactions are dominant, structural effects for solutions with shorter n-alkanes are large and $U_{V\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ decreases when the number ($n$) of C atoms of the alkane increases. This variation is held when an n-alkane is replaced by a branched alkane with the same $n$ in systems with C$_6$H$_5$Cl or 1-chloronaphthalene. This suggests that larger alkanes are poorer breakers of the interactions between aromatic halogenated compounds. Viscosity and $C_{V\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ data support this conclusion. The parabolic dependence of $C_{V\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ with $n$ indicates that the short orientational order of long n-alkanes is destroyed. Aromaticity and proximity effects are discussed.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Surface Hopping with Tight Binding Density Functional Theory applied to Molecular Motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) has become an essential computational technique for studying the photophysical relaxation of molecular systems after light absorption. These phenomena require approximations that go beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, and the accuracy of the results heavily depends on the electronic structure theory employed. Sophisticated electronic methods, however, make these techniques computationally expensive, even for medium size systems. Consequently, simulations are often performed on simplified models to interpret experimental results. In this context, a variety of techniques have been developed to perform NAMD using approximate methods, particularly Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB). Despite the use of these techniques on large systems where ab initio methods are computationally prohibitive, a comprehensive validation has been lacking. In this work, we present a new implementation of trajectory surface hopping (TSH) combined with DFTB, utilizing non-adiabatic coupling vectors (NACVs). We selected two different systems for validation, providing an exhaustive comparison with higher-level electronic structure methods. As a case study, we simulated a system from the class of molecular motors, which has been extensively studied experimentally but remains challenging to simulate with ab initio methods due to its inherent complexity. Our approach effectively captures the key photophysical mechanism of dihedral rotation after absorption of light. Additionally, we successfully reproduce the transition from the bright to dark states observed in the time dependent fluorescence experiments, providing valuable insights into this critical part of the photophysical behavior in molecular motors.</description>

      <title>Local Exchange-Correlation Potentials by Density Inversion in Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following Hollins et al. [J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 29, 04LT01 (2017)], we invert the electronic ground state densities for various semiconducting and insulating solids calculated using several density functional approximations within the generalised Kohn-Sham (GKS) scheme, Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and the LDA+$U$ method, and benchmark against standard (semi-)local functionals. The band structures from the resulting local exchange-correlation (LXC) Kohn-Sham potential for these densities are then compared with the band structures of the original GKS method. We find the LXC potential obtained from the HF density systematically predicts band gaps in good agreement with experiment, even in strongly correlated transition metal monoxides (TMOs). Furthermore, we find that the HSE06 and PBE0 hybrid functionals yield similar densities and LXC potentials, and in weakly correlated systems, these potentials are similar to PBE. For LDA+$U$ densities, the LXC potential effectively reverses the flattening of bands caused by over-localisation by a large Hubbard-$U$ value, while for meta-GGAs, we find only small differences between the GKS and LXC results demonstrating that the non-locality of meta-GGAs is weak.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory dissipative tunneling in an asymmetric double-well potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipative tunneling remains a cornerstone effect in quantum mechanics. In chemistry, it plays a crucial role in governing the rates of chemical reactions, often modeled as the motion along the reaction coordinate from one potential well to another. The relative positions of energy levels in these wells strongly influences the reaction dynamics. Chemical research will benefit from a fully controllable, asymmetric double-well equipped with precise measurement capabilities of the tunneling rates. In this paper, we show that a continuously driven Kerr parametric oscillator with a third order non-linearity can be operated in the quantum regime to create a fully tunable asymmetric double-well. Our experiment leverages a low-noise, all-microwave control system with a high-efficiency readout of the which-well information. We explore the reaction rates across the landscape of tunneling resonances in parameter space. We uncover two new and counter-intuitive effects: (i) a weak asymmetry can significantly decrease the activation rates, even though the well in which the system is initialized is made shallower, and (ii) the width of the tunneling resonances alternates between narrow and broad lines as a function of the well depth and asymmetry. We predict by numerical simulations that both effects will also manifest themselves in ordinary chemical double-well systems in the quantum regime. Our work paves the way for analog molecule simulators based on quantum superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>A Roadmap for Simulating Chemical Dynamics on a Parametrically Driven Bosonic Quantum Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical reactions are commonly described by the reactive flux transferring population from reactants to products across a double-well free energy barrier. Dynamics often involves barrier recrossing and quantum effects like tunneling, zero-point energy motion and interference, which traditional rate theories, such as transition-state theory, do not consider. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of simulating reaction dynamics using a parametrically driven bosonic superconducting Kerr-cat device. This approach provides control over parameters defining the double-well free energy profile, as well as external factors like temperature and the coupling strength between the reaction coordinate and the thermal bath of non-reactive degrees of freedom. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this protocol by showing that the dynamics of proton transfer reactions in prototypical benchmark model systems, such as hydrogen bonded dimers of malonaldehyde and DNA base pairs, could be accurately simulated on currently accessible Kerr-cat devices.</description>

      <title>Field theories and quantum methods for stochastic reaction-diffusion systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex systems are composed of many particles or agents that move and interact with one another. The underlying mathematical framework to model many of these systems must incorporate the spatial transport of particles and their interactions, as well as changes to their copy numbers, all of which can be formulated in terms of stochastic reaction-diffusion processes. The probabilistic representation of these processes is complex because of combinatorial aspects arising due to nonlinear interactions and varying particle numbers. This review presents the main field theory representations of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems, which handle these issues `under-the-hood'. First, we focus on bringing techniques familiar to theoretical physicists -- such as second quantization, Fock space, and path integrals -- back into the classical domain of reaction-diffusion systems. We demonstrate how various field theory representations can all be unified under a single basis-independent representation. We then extend existing quantum-based methods and notation to work directly on the level of the unifying representation, and we illustrate how they can be used to consistently obtain previous known results, such as numerical discretizations and relations between model parameters at multiple scales. Throughout the work, we contextualize how these representations mirror well-known models of chemical physics depending on their spatial resolution, as well as the corresponding macroscopic limits. The framework presented here may find applications in a diverse set of scientific fields, including physical chemistry, theoretical ecology, epidemiology, game theory and socio-economical models of complex systems. The presentation is done in a self-contained educational and unifying manner such that it can be followed by researchers across several fields.</description>

      <title>Towards comprehensive coverage of chemical space: Quantum mechanical properties of 836k constitutional and conformational closed shell neutral isomers consisting of HCNOFSiPSClBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Vector-QM24 (VQM24) dataset attempts to more comprehensively cover all possible neutral closed shell small organic and inorganic molecules and their conformers at state of the art level of theory. We have used density functional theory ($\omega$B97X-D3/cc-pVDZ) to optimize 577k conformational isomers corresponding to 258k constitutional isomers. Isomers included contain up to five heavy atoms (non-hydrogen) consisting of $p$-block elements C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br. Single point diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC@PBE0(ccECP/cc-pVQZ)) energies are reported for the sub-set of all the lowest conformers (10,793 molecules) with up to 4 heavy atoms. This dataset has been systematically generated by considering all combinatorially possible stoichiometries, and graphs (according to Lewis rules as implemented in the {\tt SURGE} package), along with all stable conformers identified by GFN2-xTB. Apart from graphs, geometries, rotational constants, and vibrational normal modes, VQM24 includes internal, atomization, electron-electron repulsion, exchange correlation, dispersion, vibrational frequency, Gibbs free, enthalpy, ZPV, molecular orbital energies; as well as entropy, and heat capacities. Electronic properties include multipole moments (dipole, quadrupole, octupole, hexadecapole), electrostatic potentials at nuclei (alchemical potential), Mulliken charges, and molecular wavefunctions. Machine learning (ML) models on the 258k constitutional isomers indicate an upto $\sim$8 times more challenging benchmark than the commonly used QM9 dataset. VQM24 represents a highly accurate and unbiased dataset of molecules, ideal for testing and training transferable, scalable, and generative ML models of real quantum systems.</description>

      <title>An improved penalty-based excited-state variational Monte Carlo approach with deep-learning ansatzes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce several improvements to the penalty-based variational quantum Monte Carlo (VMC) algorithm for computing electronic excited states of Entwistle $\textit{et al.}$ [M. T. Entwistle $\textit{et al.}$, Nat. Commun. $\textbf{14}$, 274 (2023)], and demonstrate that the accuracy of the updated method is competitive with other available excited-state VMC approaches. A theoretical comparison of the computational aspects of these algorithms is presented, where several benefits of the penalty-based method are identified. Our main contributions include an automatic mechanism for tuning the scale of the penalty terms, an updated form of the overlap penalty with proven convergence properties, and a new term that penalizes the spin of the wave function, enabling the selective computation of states with a given spin. With these improvements, along with the use of the latest self-attention-based ansatz, the penalty-based method achieves a mean absolute error below 1 kcal/mol for the vertical excitation energies of a set of 26 atoms and molecules, without relying on variance matching schemes. Considering excited states along the dissociation of the carbon dimer, the accuracy of the penalty-based method is on par with that of natural-excited-state (NES) VMC, while also providing results for larger sections of the potential energy surface. Additionally, the accuracy of the original penalty-based method is improved for a conical intersection of ethylene, with the predicted angle of the intersection agreeing well with both NES-VMC and multi-reference configuration interaction.</description>

      <title>Potential Distribution Theory of Alchemical Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analytical description of the Alchemical Transfer Method (ATM) for molecular binding using the Potential Distribution Theory (PDT) formalism. ATM models the binding free energy by mapping the bound and unbound states of the complex by translating the ligand coordinates. PDT relates the free energy and the probability densities of the perturbation energy along the alchemical path to the probability density at the initial state, which is the unbound state of the complex in the case of a binding process. Hence, the ATM probability density of the transfer energy at the unbound state is first related by a convolution operation of the probability densities for coupling the ligand to the solvent and coupling it to the solvated receptor--for which analytical descriptions are available--with parameters obtained from maximum likelihood analysis of data from double-decoupling alchemical calculations. PDT is then used to extend this analytical description along the alchemical transfer pathway. We tested the theory on the alchemical binding of five guests to the TEMOA host from the SAMPL8 benchmark set. In each case, the probability densities of the perturbation energy for transfer along the alchemical transfer pathway obtained from numerical calculations match those predicted from the theory and double-decoupling simulations. The work provides a solid theoretical foundation for alchemical transfer, offers physical insights on the form of the probability densities observed in alchemical transfer calculations, and confirms the conceptual and numerical equivalence between the alchemical transfer and double-decoupling processes.</description>

      <title>Path integral for the quartic oscillator: An accurate analytic formula for the partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09859v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work an approximate analytic expression for the quantum partition function of the quartic oscillator described by the potential $V(x) = \frac{1}{2} \omega^2 x^2 + g x^4$ is presented. Using a path integral formalism, the exact partition function is approximated by the partition function of a harmonic oscillator with an effective frequency depending both on the temperature and coupling constant $g$. By invoking a Principle of Minimal Sensitivity (PMS) of the path integral to the effective frequency, we derive a mathematically well-defined analytic formula for the partition function. Quite remarkably, the formula reproduces qualitatively and quantitatively the key features of the exact partition function. The free energy is accurate to a few percent over the entire range of temperatures and coupling strengths $g$. Both the harmonic ($g\rightarrow 0$) and classical (high-temperature) limits are exactly recovered. The divergence of the power series of the ground-state energy at weak coupling, characterized by a factorial growth of the perturbational energies, is reproduced as well as the functional form of the strong-coupling expansion along with accurate coefficients. Explicit accurate expressions for the ground- and first-excited state energies, $E_0(g)$ and $E_1(g)$ are also presented.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulations of glass-forming liquids beyond Metropolis</title>

Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations are widely employed to measure the physical properties of glass-forming liquids in thermal equilibrium. Combined with local Monte Carlo moves, the Metropolis algorithm can also be used to simulate the relaxation dynamics, thus offering an efficient alternative to molecular dynamics. Monte Carlo simulations are however more versatile, because carefully designed Monte Carlo algorithms can more efficiently sample the rugged free energy landscape characteristic of glassy systems. After a brief overview of Monte Carlo studies of glass-formers, we define and implement a series of Monte Carlo algorithms in a three-dimensional model of polydisperse hard spheres. We show that the standard local Metropolis algorithm is the slowest, and that implementing collective moves or breaking detailed balance enhances the efficiency of the Monte Carlo sampling. We use time correlation functions to provide a microscopic interpretation of these observations. Seventy years after its invention, the Monte Carlo method remains the most efficient and versatile tool to compute low-temperatures properties in supercooled liquids.</description>

      <title>The interplay of shape and catalyst distribution in the yield of compressible flow microreactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03944v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a semi-analytical model for transport in structured catalytic microreactors, where both reactant and product are compressible fluids. Making use of the lubrication and Fick-Jacobs approximations, we reduce the three-dimensional governing equations to an effective one-dimensional set of equations. Our model captures the effect of compressibility, of corrugations in the shape of the reactor, as well as of an inhomogeneous catalytic coating of the reactor walls. We show that in the weakly compressible limit (e.g., liquid-phase reactors), the distribution of catalyst does not influence the reactor yield, which we verify experimentally. Beyond this limit, we show that introducing inhomogeneities in the catalytic coating and corrugations to the reactor walls can improve the yield.</description>

      <title>Analytic Model for the Energy Spectrum of the Anharmonic Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent work we have proposed an original analytic expression for the partition function of the quartic oscillator. This partition function, which has a simple and compact form with {\it no adjustable parameters}, reproduces some key mathematical properties of the exact partition function and provides free energies accurate to a few percent over a wide range of temperatures and coupling constants. In this work, we present the derivation of the energy spectrum of this model. We also generalize our previous study limited to the quartic oscillator to the case of a general anharmonic oscillator. Numerical application for a potential of the form $V(x)=\frac{\omega^2}{2} x^2 + g x^{2m}$ show that the energy levels are obtained with a relative error of about a few percent, a precision which we consider to be quite satisfactory given the simplicity of the model, the absence of adjustable parameters, and the negligible computational cost.</description>
