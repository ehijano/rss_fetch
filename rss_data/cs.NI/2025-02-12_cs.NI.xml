      <title>A Comparative Study of ASR Implementations in Resource-Constrained Wireless Sensor Networks for Real-Time Voice Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the challenges and trade-offs associated with implementing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in resource-limited Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for real-time voice communication. We analyze three main architectural approaches: Network Speech Recognition (NSR), Distributed Speech Recognition (DSR), and Embedded Speech Recognition (ESR). Each approach is evaluated based on factors such as bandwidth consumption, processing power requirements, latency, accuracy (Word Error Rate - WER), and adaptability to offline operation. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method, considering the computational and communication limitations of WSN nodes. This comparative study provides insights for selecting the most appropriate ASR implementation strategy based on specific application requirements and resource constraints.</description>

      <title>Semantics-Aware Updates from Remote IoT Devices to Interconnected LEO Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing timely and informative data in Integrated Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Networks (T-NTNs) is critical as data volume continues to grow while the resources available on devices remain limited. To address this, we adopt a semantics-aware approach to optimize the Version Age of Information (VAoI) in a status update system in which a remote Energy Harvesting (EH) Internet of Things (IoT) device samples data and transmits it to a network of interconnected Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites for dissemination and utilization. The optimal update policy is derived through stochastic modeling and optimization of the VAoI across the network. The results indicate that this policy reduces the frequency of updates by skipping stale or irrelevant data, significantly improving energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>LLM-Sketch: Enhancing Network Sketches with LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network stream mining is fundamental to many network operations. Sketches, as compact data structures that offer low memory overhead with bounded accuracy, have emerged as a promising solution for network stream mining. Recent studies attempt to optimize sketches using machine learning; however, these approaches face the challenges of lacking adaptivity to dynamic networks and incurring high training costs. In this paper, we propose LLM-Sketch, based on the insight that fields beyond the flow IDs in packet headers can also help infer flow sizes. By using a two-tier data structure and separately recording large and small flows, LLM-Sketch improves accuracy while minimizing memory usage. Furthermore, it leverages fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to reliably estimate flow sizes. We evaluate LLM-Sketch on three representative tasks, and the results demonstrate that LLM-Sketch outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving a $7.5\times$ accuracy improvement.</description>

      <title>A Fully Open-Source End-to-End Private 5G Network over Unlicensed Frequency Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20652</link>

Abstract: The fifth generation of mobile networks (5G) represents the latest development in mobile communications. It has been designed to support several types of data traffic and to meet more challenging performance requirements than ever before. These characteristics make 5G attractive for current but also novel public and private services. However, because of reasons related to coverage, regulatory restrictions, business considerations, and cyber security, many of these novel applications can only be deployed as part of a private network. The cost of licensed frequencies makes such approach prohibitive for many stakeholders, and therefore unlicensed frequency bands represent a more affordable option. Even so, private 5G networks for use in globally unlicensed frequency bands do not yet exist. In this paper we present the first end-to-end private 5G network operating in a globally unlicensed frequency band, using general purpose computers, open-source software and software-defined radio. We evidence its working and show that the choice of the hardware can significantly affect the performance of the network.</description>

      <title>Open-Source ESP32-C3 Wi-Fi Drivers for Static Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Battery-Free Internet of Things will revolutionize our understanding of sustainable communication, as it operates on energy harvested from the environment (e.g., by solar cells). On these systems, harvested energy is dependent on unpredictable environmental conditions; therefore, device operations, including those of its networking stack, must be resilient to power failures. Reactive intermittent computing provides an approach for solving this by notifications of impending power failures, which is implemented by monitoring the harvested energy buffered in a capacitor. However, to use this power-failure notification and guarantee forward progress, systems must break down tasks into atomic sub-tasks (transactions) that can be predictably finished before the available energy runs out. Thus, static program-code analysis must determine the worst-case energy consumption (WCEC) of all transactions. In the case of Wi-Fi-capable devices, drivers are often closed-source, and it is therefore unclear whether their transactions have a WCEC since static analysis requires all code and its semantics.
  In this work, we integrate a transactional networking stack with reverse-engineered Wi-Fi drivers to enable full-stack WCEC analysis for physical transmission and reception of packets. Further, we extended a static worst-case analysis approach with a resource-consumption model of our Wi-Fi driver. Our evaluation with the RISC-V-based ESP32-C3 platform gives worst-case bounds with our static analysis for the transactions of the full communications stack, therefore showing that Wi-Fi-based reactive intermittent computing is feasible.</description>
