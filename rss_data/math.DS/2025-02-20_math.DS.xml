      <title>Mixing properties of a class of nonuniformly expanding maps. Application to H{\"o}lderian invariance principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mixing properties of a class of nonuniformly expanding maps when the return time to the basis has a weak moment of order p \&amp;gt;1, up to a slowly varying function. From these computations, we deduce an invariance principle in H{\"o}lder spaces for the partial sum process of Birkhoff sums of H{\"o}lder continuous observables. The results apply to a class of intermittent maps of the unit interval. For such a map, we also prove that the H{\"o}lder invariance principle remains true for BV observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known theorem by Fran\c{c}ois Robert expresses the degenerated character of a synchronous Boolean finite dynamical system, in the case where the associated regulatory graph does not contain any circuit: all states of the system go towards a single fixed point. We present a large family of updating modes of Boolean models with the same particularity.</description>

      <title>Automatic time continuity of positive matrix and operator semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a matrix semigroup $T: [0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ without assuming any measurability properties and show that, if $T$ is bounded close to $0$ and $T(t) \ge 0$ entrywise for all $t$, then $T$ is continuous. This complements classical results for the scalar-valued case. We also prove an analogous result if $T$ takes values in the positive operators over a sequence space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates the topological pressure of isotropic axial products of Markov subshifts on the $d$-tree. We show that the quantity increases with dimension $d$. To achieve this, we introduce the pattern distribution vectors and the associated transition matrices and partially transplant the large deviation theory to tree-shifts. Additionally, we apply our main result to a broader class of shift spaces, accompanied by numerical experiments for verification.</description>

      <title>Local spectral estimates and quantitative weak mixing for substitution $\mathbb{Z}$-actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper investigates H\"older and log-H\"older regularity of spectral measures for weakly mixing substitutions and the related question of quantitative weak mixing. It is assumed that the substitution is primitive, aperiodic, and its substitution matrix is irreducible over the rationals. In the case when there are no eigenvalues of the substitution matrix on the unit circle, our main theorem says that a weakly mixing substitution $\mathbb{Z}$-action has uniformly log-H\"older regular spectral measures, and hence admits power-logarithmic bounds for the rate of weak mixing. In the more delicate Salem substitution case, our second main result says that H\"older regularity holds for algebraic spectral parameters, but the H\"older exponent cannot be chosen uniformly.</description>

      <title>Classification of connection graphs of global attractors for $S^1$-equivariant parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the characterization of global attractors $A_f$ for semiflows generated by scalar one-dimensional semilinear parabolic equations of the form $u_t = u_{xx} + f(u,u_x)$, defined on the circle $x\in S^1$, for a class of reversible nonlinearities. Given two reversible nonlinearities, $f_0$ and $f_1$, with the same lap signature, we prove the existence of a reversible homotopy $f_\tau, 0\le\tau\le 1$, which preserves all heteroclinic connections. Consequently, we obtain a classification of the connection graphs of global attractors in the class of reversible nonlinearities. We also describe bifurcation diagrams which reduce a global attractor $A_1$ to the trivial global attractor $A_0=\{0\}$.</description>

      <title>Rate-induced biosphere collapse in the Daisyworld model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is much interest in the phenomenon of rate-induced tipping, where a system changes abruptly when forcings change faster than some critical rate. Here, we demonstrate and analyse rate-induced tipping in the classic "Daisyworld" model. The Daisyworld model considers a hypothetical planet inhabited only by two species of daisies with different reflectivities, and is notable because the daisies lead to an emergent "regulation" of the planet's temperature. The model serves as a useful thought experiment regarding the co-evolution of life and the global environment, and has been widely used in the teaching of Earth system science.
  We show that sufficiently fast changes in insolation (i.e. incoming sunlight) can cause life on Daisyworld to go extinct, even if life could in principle survive at any fixed insolation value among those encountered. Mathematically, this occurs due to the fact that the solution of the forced (nonautonomous) system crosses the stable manifold of a saddle point for the frozen (autonomous) system. The new discovery of rate-induced tipping in such a classic, simple, and well-studied model provides further supporting evidence that rate-induced tipping -- and indeed, rate-induced collapse -- may be common in a wide range of systems.</description>

      <title>Finite type as fundamental objects even non-single-valued and non-continuous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the shadowing property for general upper semicontinuous set-valued maps, inspired by Good and Meddaugh [11], we identify the fundamental objects underpinning the shadowing theory for such maps. Specifically, we explore the relationships among shifts of finite type, the simplest set-valued maps, and the shadowing property.
  Our main result establishes that if $X$ is a compact, totally disconnected Hausdorff space, and $F$ is an upper semicontinuous closed-valued map on $X$ with the set-valued shadowing property, the following hold: 
 (1) If $F$ is expansive, the orbit system of $(X,F)$ is conjugate to a shift of finite type. 
 (2) Without expansiveness, $(X,F)$ is conjugate to an inverse limit of a net of the simplest set-valued systems satisfying the Mittag-Leffler condition. Additionally, the orbit system of $(X,F)$ is conjugate to an inverse limit of a net of shifts of finite type, also satisfying the Mittag-Leffler condition
  As a consequence, if an upper semicontinuous set-valued map on a totally disconnected space has the set-valued shadowing property, its orbit system also exhibits the single-valued shadowing property.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the quasi-compactness of the transfer operator associated with skew product systems that are semi-conjugate to piecewise convex maps with a countably infinite number of branches. These non-invertible skew products admit discontinuities, with the critical set confined to a countable collection of fibers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such systems possess an invariant measure whose disintegration along the fibers exhibits bounded variation, a concept introduced and developed in this work.</description>

      <title>On the Hofer-Zehnder conjecture for non-contractible periodic orbits in Hamiltonian dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.05273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we treat an open problem related to the number of periodic orbits of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on closed symplectic manifolds. Hofer-Zehnder conjecture states that a Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms has infinitely many periodic orbits if it has "homologically unnecessary periodic orbits"". For example, non-contractible periodic orbits are homologically unnecessary periodic orbits because Floer homology of non-contractible periodic orbits is trivial. We prove Hofer-Zehnder conjecture for non-contractible periodic orbits for very wide classes of symplectic manifolds.</description>

      <title>Metrical properties of Hurwitz Continued Fractions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the geometry of Hurwitz continued fractions, a major tool in understanding the approximation properties of complex numbers by ratios of Gaussian integers. Based on a thorough study of the geometric properties of Hurwitz continued fractions, among other things, we determine that the space of valid sequences is not a closed set of sequences. Additionally, we establish a comprehensive metrical theory for Hurwitz continued fractions.%, paralleling the classical theory for regular continued fractions in real numbers.
  Let $\Phi:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$ be any function. For any complex number $z$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}$, let $a_n(z)$ denote the $n$th partial quotient in the Hurwitz continued fraction of $z$. One of the main results of this paper is the computation of the Hausdorff dimension of the set \[E(\Phi) := \left\{ z\in \mathbb C: |a_n(z)|\geq \Phi(n) \text{ for infinitely many }n\in\mathbb{N} \right\}. \] This study is a complex analog of a well-known result of Wang and Wu [Adv. Math. 218 (2008), no. 5, 1319--1339].</description>

      <title>On the discrete Dirac spectrum of general-relativistic hydrogenic ions with anomalous magnetic moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Reissner-Weyl-Nordstr\"om (RWN) spacetime of a point nucleus features a naked singularity for the empirically known nuclear charges $Ze$ and masses $M = A(Z,N)m_{\mathrm{p}}$, where $m_{\mathrm{p}}$ is the proton mass and $A(Z,N)\approx Z+N$ the atomic mass number, with $Z$ the number of protons and $N$ the number of neutrons in the nucleus. The Dirac Hamiltonian for a test electron with mass $m_{\mathrm{e}}$, charge $-e$, and anomalous magnetic moment $\mu_a (\approx - \frac{1}{4\pi}\frac{e^3}{m_{\mathrm{e}} c^2})$ in the electrostatic RWN spacetime of such a 'naked point nucleus' is known to be essentially self-adjoint, with a spectrum that consists of the union of the essential spectrum $(-\infty, m_{\mathrm{e}} c^2]\cup[m_{\mathrm{e}} c^2, \infty)$ and a discrete spectrum of infinitely many eigenvalues in the gap $(-m_{\mathrm{e}} c^2,m_{\mathrm{e}} c^2)$, having $m_{\mathrm{e}} c^2$ as accumulation point. In this paper the discrete spectrum is characterized in detail for the first time, for all $Z\leq 45$ and $A$ that cover all known isotopes. The eigenvalues are mapped one-to-one to those of the traditional Dirac Hydrogen spectrum. Numerical evaluations that go beyond $Z=45$ into the realm of not-yet-produced hydrogenic ions are presented, too. A list of challenging open problems concludes this publication.</description>

      <title>Steiner trees with infinitely many terminals on the sides of an angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Euclidean Steiner problem is the problem of finding a set $St$, with the shortest length, such that $St \cup A$ is connected, where $A$ is a given set in a Euclidean space. The solutions $St$ to the Steiner problem will be called Steiner sets while the set $A$ will be called input. Since every Steiner set is acyclic we call it Steiner tree in the case when it is connected. We say that a Steiner tree is indecomposable if it does not contain any Steiner tree for a subset of the input.
  We are interested in finding the Steiner set when the input consists of infinitely many points distributed on two lines. In particular we would like to find a configuration which gives an indecomposable Steiner tree.
  We consider a self-similar input, namely the set $A_{\alpha,\lambda}$ of points with coordinates $(\lambda^{k-1}\cos \alpha,$ $\pm \lambda^{k-1}\sin \alpha)$, where $\lambda&gt;0$ and $\alpha&gt;0$ are small fixed values. These points are distributed on the two sides of an angle of size $2\alpha$ in such a way that the distances from the points to the vertex of the angle are in a geometric progression.
  To our surprise, we show that in this case the solutions to the Steiner problem for $A_{\alpha,\lambda}$, when $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ are small enough, are always decomposable trees. More precisely, any Steiner tree for $A_{\alpha,\lambda}$ is a countable union of Steiner trees, each one connecting 5 points from the input. By considering only a finite number of components we obtain many solutions to the Steiner problem for finite sets composed of $4k+1$ points distributed on the two lines ($2k+1$ on a line and $2k$ on the other line). These solutions are very similar to the ladders of Chung and Graham.</description>

      <title>Machine learning of continuous and discrete variational ODEs with convergence guarantee and uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The article introduces a method to learn dynamical systems that are governed by Euler--Lagrange equations from data. The method is based on Gaussian process regression and identifies continuous or discrete Lagrangians and is, therefore, structure preserving by design. A rigorous proof of convergence as the distance between observation data points converges to zero is provided. Next to convergence guarantees, the method allows for quantification of model uncertainty, which can provide a basis of adaptive sampling techniques. We provide efficient uncertainty quantification of any observable that is linear in the Lagrangian, including of Hamiltonian functions (energy) and symplectic structures, which is of interest in the context of system identification. The article overcomes major practical and theoretical difficulties related to the ill-posedness of the identification task of (discrete) Lagrangians through a careful design of geometric regularisation strategies and through an exploit of a relation to convex minimisation problems in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.</description>
