      <title>Systematic Bayesian Optimization for Atomic Structure Calculations of Heavy Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel optimisation technique for atomic structure calculations using the Flexible Atomic Code, focussing on complex multielectron systems relevant to $r$-process nucleosynthesis and kilonova modelling. We introduce a method to optimise the fictitious mean configuration used in the Flexible Atomic Code, significantly improving the accuracy of calculated energy levels and transition properties for lanthanide and actinide ions. Our approach employs a Sequential Model-Based Optimisation algorithm to refine the fictitious mean configuration, iteratively minimising the discrepancy between calculated and experimentally determined energy levels. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method through detailed analyses of Au II, Pt II, Pr II, Pr III, Er II, and Er~III, representing a broad range of atomic configurations. The results show substantial improvements in the accuracy of the calculated energy levels, with average relative differences to the NIST data reduced from 20-60\% to 10\% or less for the ions studied. Transition wavelength calculations exhibit exceptional agreement with experimental data, with about 90\% of the calculated values falling within 10\% of measurements for Pr and Er ions. While improvements in transition probability calculations are observed, the calculated transition probabilities (log($gf$) values) still show significant discrepancies compared to the experimental data, with root mean square deviations of approximately 1.1-1.4 dex for Pr and Er ions. We extend our optimisation technique to systematic calculations of singly and doubly ionised lanthanides, achieving accuracies comparable to or surpassing those of \textit{ab-initio} atomic structure codes. The method's broad applicability across the lanthanide series demonstrates its potential for enhancing opacity calculations and spectral modelling in astrophysical contexts.</description>

      <title>Terahertz molecular frequency references: theoretical analysis of optimal instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the instability achievable by using phase modulation spectroscopy to lock a terahertz local oscillator to an absorptive reference consisting of the rotational transition of molecules at room temperature. We find that the signal-to-noise ratio of the THz detector provides the limitation to the instability that can be achieved and analyze a number of viable candidate molecules, identifying several as being of particular interest, including OCS and HI. We find that a one-second instability in the $10^{-13}$ decade is achievable for molecules confined to waveguide, while instability at the $10^{-14}$ level can be reached for molecules in free space. We also present calculations of the intermodulation effect for spectroscopy taking place far outside the quasistatic regime and find that this source of noise presents constraints on which THz local oscillators are appropriate to be used for such frequency references.</description>

      <title>Suppression of heading errors in Bell-Bloom optically pumped free-induction-decay alkali-metal atomic magnetometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heading errors of atomic magnetometers refer to the dependence of measurement results on the sensor orientation with respect to the external magnetic field. There are three main sources of such errors: the light shift effect, the linear nuclear-spin Zeeman effect, and the nonlinear Zeeman effect. In this work, we suppress the former two effects by using the Bell-Bloom optical pumping method and probe the atomic signals while the pumping beam is off, and focus on the heading error induced by nonlinear Zeeman effect while the sensor operates in the geomagnetic field range. We demonstrate several schemes to suppress this remaining heading error within 1 nT using a single magnetometer or a comagnetometer. In the magnetometer system, two schemes are developed to average out the horizontal atomic polarization in space or in time, respectively. In the comagnetometer system, we combine the simultaneously measured Larmor frequencies of two different kinds of alkali atoms to either suppress the heading error or extract the orientation of the pumping beam relative to the bias field.</description>

      <title>Two-loop electron self-energy with accelerated partial-wave expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculations of the two-loop electron self-energy for the $n = 1$ and $n = 2$ states of hydrogen-like ions are reported, performed to all orders in the nuclear binding strength parameter $Z\alpha$ (where $Z$ is the nuclear charge number and $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant). The presented approach features an accelerated convergence of the partial-wave expansion and allows calculations to be accomplished for nuclear charges lower than previously possible and with a higher numerical accuracy.</description>

      <title>Multi-Mode Global Driving of Trapped Ions for Quantum Circuit Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the use of global drives with multiple frequency components to improve the efficiency of trapped ion quantum simulations and computations. We show that such `multi-mode' global drives, when combined with a linear number of single-qubit rotations, generate universal Ising-type interactions with shorter overall runtimes than corresponding two-qubit gate implementations. Further, we show how this framework may be extended to efficiently generate $N-$body interactions between any subset $N$ of the ion qubits. Finally, we apply these techniques to encode the Quantum Fourier Transform using quadratically-fewer entangling operations, with quadratically smaller runtime, compared with traditional approaches.</description>

      <title>Categorical Symmetries in Spin Models with Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Categorical symmetries have recently been shown to generalize the classification of phases of matter, significantly broadening the traditional Landau paradigm. To test these predictions, we propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry $\mathsf{Rep}(D_8)$. This model not only captures the essential features of non-invertible phases but is also straightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.</description>
