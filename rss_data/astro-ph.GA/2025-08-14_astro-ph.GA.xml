      <title>Emulating extended Lyman-alpha haloes around star-forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended Ly$\alpha$ emission is commonly observed around star-forming galaxies, opening a window for probing the neutral hydrogen gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). In this paper, we develop a prescription of spherically symmetric CGM gas properties and build emulators to model circularly-averaged surface brightness (SB) profiles of the extended Ly$\alpha$ emission. With CGM gas properties parametrized by the density, velocity, and temperature profiles, a self-shielding calculation is carried out to obtain the neutral gas distribution with ionizing photons from the ultraviolet (UV) background and star formation in the galaxy. Our calculation reveals three types of systems with distinct neutral gas distribution: non-shielded systems with the CGM being highly ionized across all radii, shielded systems with a neutral gas shell shielding the UV background, and transitional systems in between. Ly$\alpha$ SB profiles are obtained through Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer (RT) simulations, performed for the CGM models with three kinds of Ly$\alpha$ sources: the star formation from central and satellite galaxies, and the recombination in the CGM. We build emulators to efficiently predict Ly$\alpha$ SB profiles for given model parameters and Ly$\alpha$ sources, based on Gaussian process regression. After being trained with only 180 RT simulations for each Ly$\alpha$ source, the emulators reach an overall accuracy at the level of $\sim 20$ per cent. By applying the emulators to fit mock Ly$\alpha$ SB profiles constructed from our model, we find a reasonable recovery of model parameters, indicating the potential of extracting physical information of the CGM and galaxies from the observed extended Ly$\alpha$ emission.</description>

      <title>Quasar Spectral Energy Distributions in the Rest-Frame EUV: Hubble-COS Spectra of Two Ultra-luminous Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope with both far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) gratings, we measure the ionizing spectra of two bright, intermediate-redshift quasars in their rest-frame extreme ultraviolet (EUV). The availability of both NUV and FUV spectra allows us to define the quasar continuum and correct for strong Lyman-limit systems (LLS) that fall in the gap between the FUV and optical. Each AGN has a prominent LLS, but the flux recovery shortward of their Lyman edges allows us to fit and restore the true AGN continuum. In the EUV (450-912 A) these AGN have flux distributions, $F_{\nu} \propto \nu^{-\alpha_{\nu}}$, with spectral indices $\alpha_{\nu} = 1.11\pm0.22$ (SBS 1010+535, $z_{\rm AGN} = 1.5086$) and $\alpha_{\nu} = 0.98\pm0.22$ (HS 0747+4259, $z_{\rm AGN} = 1.9006$), both considerably harder than the mean index, $\alpha_{\nu} = 1.41\pm0.15$, in a COS composite spectrum of 159 UV-bright AGN. These two AGN are outliers in the index distribution, perhaps resulting from their extremely high UV luminosity ($10^{48}~{\rm erg~s}^{-1}$), estimated black-hole masses (0.5-1)$\times10^{10} M_{\odot}$, and effects on the inner accretion disk and Comptonized winds.</description>

      <title>The AURORA Survey: High-Redshift Empirical Metallicity Calibrations from Electron Temperature Measurements at z=2-10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present detections of auroral emission lines of [OIII], [OII], [SIII], and [SII] in deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy for 41 star-forming galaxies at $z=1.4-7.2$ from the AURORA survey. We combine these new observations with 98 star-forming galaxies at $z=1.3-10.6$ with detected auroral lines drawn from the literature to form a sample of 139 high-redshift galaxies with robust electron temperature and direct-method oxygen abundance determinations. This sample notably covers a wider dynamic range in metallicity than previous work, spanning $0.02-0.9$~Z$_\odot$. We calibrate empirical relations between 19 emission-line ratios and oxygen abundance, providing a robust tool set to infer accurate gas-phase metallicities of high-redshift galaxies when auroral lines are not detected. While calibrations based on lines of $\alpha$ elements (O, Ne, S, Ar) appear reliable, we find significant scatter in calibrations involving lines of N driven by a high dispersion in N/O at fixed O/H, suggesting that N-based line ratios are less reliable tracers of the oxygen abundance at high redshift. These new high-redshift calibrations are notably offset from those based on typical $z\sim0$ galaxy and HII region samples, and are better matched by samples of extreme local galaxies that are analogs of high-redshift sources. The new metallicity calibrations presented in this work pave the way for robust studies of galaxy chemical evolution in the early Universe, leading to a better understanding of baryon cycling and galaxy formation from Cosmic Noon through the Epoch of Reionization.</description>

      <title>Globular clusters in M104: Tracing kinematics and metallicities from the centre to the halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As ancient star clusters, globular clusters (GCs) are regarded as powerful tracers of galaxy evolution and assembly. Due to their brightness and compact sizes, GCs are employed to probe the kinematics and stellar population properties of galaxies, from the central regions out into the halo where the underlying stellar light becomes too faint for spectroscopic studies. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the GC system of M 104 (NGC 4594, also known as the Sombrero galaxy) based on literature spectroscopic catalogues and newly collected data from Very Large Telescope (VLT) MUSE integral-field spectroscopy combined with multi-object spectroscopy from VLT FLAMES and OSIRIS at the Gran Telescopio de Canarias (GTC). We present a new catalogue of 499 GCs with radial velocity measurements that span from the inner disc region out to $\sim$ 70 kpc (24$^{\prime}$). In addition to velocities, we measure metallicities from the MUSE, OSIRIS, and FLAMES spectra of 190 GCs. Together with literature values, we collected a sample of 278 metallicities. Comparing GCs observed with multiple instruments, we find a good agreement of velocity and metallicity measurements. Studying GC kinematics with a simple model confirms a decreasing velocity dispersion profile and low rotation velocities. The blue GCs appear to be more dispersion-dominated, while the red GCs follow the kinematics of the stars more closely. We find a large scatter of GC metallicities with distance from the centre and metal-rich GCs are found over all radii. We discuss that the GC metallicity distribution with a broad metal-poor component likely reflects the complex assembly history of M 104.</description>

      <title>Pinched Magnetic Fields in the High-mass Protocluster W3 IRS5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present polarization maps of dust emission at 340 GHz in the luminous high-mass protocluster, W3 IRS5, observed with the Submillimeter Array. The projected magnetic fields appear fairly organized with a pinched morphology in the northern part and a concave shape in the southern part. We fit the polarization maps with a two-component magnetic field model: an hourglass model centered at the continuum peak, SMM2, and an empirical sphere centered at the O-type star, IRS7. Using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, we calculate a projected field strength of $B_\mathrm{pos} = 1.4 \; \mathrm{mG}$. Along with the Zeeman measurement, a total magnetic field strength of $B_\mathrm{tot} = 1.6 \; \mathrm{mG}$ is obtained. We find that the gravitational energy is the most dominant, followed by magnetic energy, and then turbulent energy. Small values of the virial parameter, $\alpha_\mathrm{vir} = 0.8$, and the ratio of timescales, $t_\mathrm{ff}/t_\mathrm{corss} = 0.6$, suggest an ongoing collapse. We also show collimated molecular outflows in the $\mathrm{CO \; (3-2)}$ and $\mathrm{SiO \; (8-7)}$ transitions. The morphology of magnetic fields and the surrounding \HII regions put forward a scenario for W3 IRS5. A gravitationally unstable dense core formed within a neutral gas ridge plowed by the expansions of W3 A and W3 B. The core began to contract, causing gravity to pull the magnetic field lines inward, which resulted in a pinched field morphology. Subsequent expansion of W3 F, ionized by IRS7, perturbed the magnetic field, creating concave patterns. The dynamical interactions among protostars led to misalignment of their outflows.</description>

      <title>Revisiting G29.862-0.0044: a jet cavity disrupted by an outflow in a likely young stellar object wide binary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A few years ago, we investigated MYSO G29.862-0.0044 (YSO-G29), an intriguing star-forming region at a distance of 6.2 kpc. Although the typical disc-jet scenario was proposed to explain the observations, it remained far from conclusive. YSO-G29 was analysed using new observations at near-IR from Gemini-NIFS, at radio continuum (10 GHz) from Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA), and new continuum (1.3 mm) and molecular line data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). The near-IR observations allowed us to detect emission of H2 1-0 S(1) and Br-gamma lines in YSO-G29, which are compatible with excitation and ionization from UV radiation propagating in a highly perturbed ambient. In addition, some evidence of H2 excitation by collisions were found. The ALMA data show the presence of a conspicuous and collimated molecular outflow propagating southwards, while to the north, an extended molecular feature perfectly surrounded by the Ks near-IR emission appears. The continuum emission at 1.3 mm allowed us to better resolve the molecular cores, one of which stands out due to its high temperatures and rich chemical composition. From the JVLA observations, we discovered a compact radio continuum source, a likely compact Hii region or an ionised jet of a massive protostar, located at ~0.7 arcsec (~ 0.02 pc) from the main millimetre core. In this way, we propose a YSO wide binary system. {We can explain the nature of the intriguing near-IR features previously observed: cone-like structures produced by jets/winds of one of the components of the binary system that cleared out the surroundings were disrupted by a molecular outflow probably from the other component. These results complete the picture of what is happening in YSO-G29, and reveal a phenomenon that should be considered when investigating massive star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS): Evolution of the Morphology-Density Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies with different morphological characteristics likely have different evolutionary histories, such that understanding the mechanisms that drive morphological change can provide valuable insights into the galaxy evolution process. These mechanisms largely correlate with local environment, ultimately leading to the well-known local morphology-density relation. To explore how the morphology-density relation is produced, we must look to earlier times, and trace the co-evolution of environment and morphology in an un-biased and self-consistent manner. Here we use new environmental metrics from the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) to explore the spectroscopic morphology-density relation at intermediate redshift (0.3&lt;z&lt;0.5) and compare directly to the Galaxy And Mass Assembly Survey (GAMA) at 0&lt;z&lt;0.08. Importantly, both the galaxy morphologies and environmental metrics in DEVILS and GAMA are derived in a very similar manner, reducing any methodology biases. We see a clear evolution in morphological classes between DEVILS and GAMA, which is modulated by environment. These trends are consistent with a scenario where in all environments disk-dominated galaxies are transitioning to classical bulge+disk systems (potentially via minor mergers and/or secular evolution), and in high-density environments there is an increasing prevalence of visually-selected elliptical galaxies (potentially via major mergers and/or disk fading); with the fraction of ellipticals increasing by ~0.3 in the most dense regions over the last ~7Gyr, but remaining largely unchanged in low-density environments.</description>

      <title>Dark Star Clusters or Ultra-Faint Dwarf galaxies? Revisiting UMa3/U1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to sparse spectroscopic observations, the classification of faint satellites as either dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxies or self-gravitating star clusters remains unresolved. The recently discovered Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 (UMa3/U1) object, with its measured velocity dispersion, provides a rare observational anchor in this regime. Despite its cluster-like compactness, its inferred dynamical mass-to-light ratio (M_dyn/L) suggests a dark matter-dominated nature, prompting interpretations of UMa3/U1 as a microgalaxy, though current measurements remain inconclusive. Thousand-level M_dyn/L values are not unique to galaxies; self-gravitating dark star clusters (DSCs) can reach comparable levels via energy injection driven by a centrally segregated black hole subsystem (BHSub), which accelerates the evaporation of luminous stars and leads to a super-virial appearance with elevated velocity dispersion. To assess whether UMa3/U1 is a DSC, we conducted direct N-body simulations and identified a model that successfully reproduces both its compact structure and elevated M_dyn/L, supporting a self-gravitating cluster origin. We find the cluster entered the DSC phase around 4 Gyr ago, with its luminous stars expected to be depleted within the next 1 Gyr, followed by the gradual disruption of the central BHSub over the subsequent Gyr. We broaden our analysis by mapping DSC evolutionary tracks in the size versus total luminosity (L) and M_dyn/L-L spaces, showing that DSCs occupy a region overlapping with faint, ambiguous satellites. In the M_dyn/L-L diagram, DSCs trace a transitional channel bridging globular clusters and dwarf galaxies as they rise from M_dyn/L ~ 2 to 10^4 M_sun/L_sun.</description>

      <title>Forgotten treasures in the HST/FOC UV imaging polarimetric archives of active galactic nuclei -- IV. 5 Orphaned AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Faint Object Camera (FOC) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) acquired high-resolution, spatially resolved polarimetric images of nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in the near ultraviolet (near-UV) band. Among the 25 individual targets in the polarized archives, 8 had no published analysis until the beginning of this series of papers. We tackle the last 5 targets in the following. In this paper, we finalize the publication of near-UV imaging polarimetry of AGNs in the HST/FOC archives. We render available spatially resolved polarization maps of the [OIII] emission lines for Mrk 3 and Mrk 78, as well as near-UV continuum polarization maps for Mrk 3, NGC 3862, Cygnus A and 3C 109. We make use of the generalized reduction pipeline presented in the first paper in this series to homogeneously analyze the five remaining polarized observations of AGNs in the FOC archives. In Mrk 3 and Mrk 78, we find a polarization pattern in the narrow-line regions consistent with scattering from an obscured nucleus. For NGC 3862, we confirm marginal UV polarization parallel with the inner radio jet, related to synchrotron emission. In Cygnus A, we report spatially resolved centro-symmetric polarization patterns in both opposite outflows, highlighting the scattering origin of the polarized light. Finally, 3C 109 shows high nuclear polarization, consistent with AGN-dominated emission and parallel with the radio axis, but in tension with polarization arising from dichroic absorption invoked by previous authors. The imaging polarimetry obtained for the narrow-line region and the extended scattering medium surrounding the obscured AGNs is aligned with the predictions of the unified AGN model and demonstrates the power of spatially-resolved polarimetric observation to decipher the complex morphologies at work in AGNs.</description>

      <title>Chemical templates of the Central Molecular Zone. Shock and protostellar object signatures under Galactic Center conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way exhibits extreme conditions, including high gas densities, elevated temperatures, enhanced cosmic-ray ionization rates, and large-scale dynamics. Large-scale molecular surveys reveal increasing chemical and physical complexity in the CMZ. A key step to interpreting the molecular richness found in the CMZ is to build chemical templates tailored to its diverse conditions. The combined impact of high ionization, elevated temperatures, and dense gas remains insufficiently explored for observable tracers. In this study, we utilized UCLCHEM, a gas-grain time-dependent chemical model, to link physical conditions with their corresponding molecular signatures and identify key tracers of temperature, density, ionization, and shock activity. We ran a grid of models of shocks and protostellar objects representative of typical CMZ conditions, focusing on twenty-four species, including complex organic molecules. Shocked and protostellar environments show distinct evolutionary timescales ($\lesssim 10^4$ vs. $\gtrsim 10^4$ years), with 300 K emerging as a key temperature threshold for chemical differentiation. We find that cosmic-ray ionization and temperature are the main drivers of chemical trends. HCO$^+$, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$SH trace ionization, while HCO, HCO$^+$, CH$_3$SH, CH$_3$NCO, and HCOOCH$_3$ show consistent abundance contrasts between shocks and protostellar regions over similar temperature ranges. While our models underpredict some complex organics in shocks, they reproduce observed trends for most species, supporting scenarios involving recurring shocks in Galactic Center clouds and enhanced ionization towards Sgr B2(N2). Future work should assess the role of shock recurrence and metallicity in shaping chemistry.</description>

      <title>Stars Born in the Wind: M82's Outflow and Halo Star Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starburst galaxies, like M82, launch kiloparsec-scale galactic outflows that interact with the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in complex ways. Apart from enriching the CGM with metals and energy, these outflows may trigger star formation in the halo -- either by driving shocks into the CGM or transporting cold, star-forming gas. To investigate such processes, we analyze the star formation history (SFH) of the Southern Arcs -- arc-like stellar features located ~5 kpc from M82's star-forming disk along the minor axis -- using Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 photometry. From resolved stellar populations, we derive SFHs over the last ~500 Myr, finding that ~85% of the stellar mass formed between ~150 and ~70 Myr ago, followed by a brief pause, with the remaining ~15% forming since ~30 Myr ago. The two stellar populations are co-spatial on scales of at least ~200 pc. The timing of the ~100 Myr burst aligns with star formation in the M82 disk and the age distribution of its star clusters, suggesting a causal link between the disk starburst and halo star formation. We explore two mechanisms that could explain these observations. In the first, shocks driven by the interaction between hot outflowing gas and cooler CGM material compress dense clouds, triggering collapse and star formation. In the second, stars form directly within massive, cool clouds associated with the outflow. As these clouds move ballistically through the halo, subsequent interactions with tidal debris may trigger additional star formation, producing the observed episodic structure.</description>

      <title>Can stellar physics explain GW231123?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave event GW231123 detected by the LIGO interferometers during their fourth observing run features two black holes with source-frame masses of $137^{+22}_{-17} M_\odot$ and $103^{+20}_{-52} M_\odot $ -- well within or above the pair-instability black hole mass gap predicted by standard stellar evolution theory. Both black holes are also inferred to be rapidly spinning ($\chi_1 \simeq 0.9$, $\chi_2 \simeq 0.8$). The primary object in GW231123 is the heaviest stellar mass black hole detected to date, which, together with its extreme rotation, raises questions about its astrophysical origin. Accounting for the unusually large spin of $\sim 0.9$ with hierarchical mergers requires some degree of fine tuning. We investigate whether such a massive, highly spinning object could plausibly form from the collapse of a single rotating massive star. We simulate stars with an initial core mass of $160 \rm M_\odot$ -- sufficient to produce BH masses at the upper edge of the 90% credible interval for $m_1$ in GW231123 -- across a range of rotation rates and $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rates. We find that: (i) rotation shifts the pair-instability mass gap to higher masses, introducing a significant ingredient that correlates masses and spins in gravitational wave predictions; and (ii) highly spinning BHs with masses $\gtrsim 150 \rm M_\odot$ can form above the mass gap, implying that stellar evolution alone is sufficient to explain GW231123. Our results suggest that the primary object of GW231123 may be the first directly observed black hole that formed via direct core collapse following the photodisintegration instability.</description>

      <title>Constraining fuzzy dark matter with the 21-cm power spectrum from Cosmic Dawn and Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 21-cm signals from Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization contain valuable information on cosmological structure formation dominated by dark matter. Measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum can thus probe certain dark matter candidates. Here we investigate the impacts of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) on the 21-cm signals, taking into account both the linear matter power spectrum and the halo mass function (HMF) in FDM cosmologies. The full FDM dynamics are implemented in reionization simulations, along with a new ansatz on modulation of the FDM HMF by the linear overdensity. Not only does the suppression of FDM halos on small scales give rise to delay of the signature epochs during cosmic reionization, but these epochs are also shortened relative to the cold dark matter cosmology. In addition, we find that while the FDM effects on the 21-cm power spectrum are dominated by its linear dynamics early in Cosmic Dawn, a correct FDM HMF resulting from nonlinear wave dynamics must be considered when X-ray heating begins. We forecast the constraints on the FDM model parameters from upcoming 21-cm power spectrum measurements by SKA1-Low (central area). In FDM cosmologies with $m_\mathrm{FDM}=10^{-21}$ eV, SKA1-Low will be able to constrain the boson mass to within $\sim10$% at 2$\sigma$ confidence with a mock 1080-hour observation, if the ionizing efficiency is mass independent. However, our results show that realistic astrophysical processes are degenerate with the FDM effects, which shall severely loosen the constraints on the boson mass from 21-cm power spectrum data alone.</description>

      <title>Toward High-Precision Astrometry with CSST Using Multi-Gaussian Fitting of PSF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) presents significant potential for high-precision astrometry. In this study, we show that the point spread function (PSF) modeled by the discrete PSF with Multi-Gaussian function can effectively enhance the astrometric accuracy. We determine that the PSF profile can be accurately modeled by three Gaussians, which takes advantage of reduced computational complexity in PSF convolution. In sparse star fields, the lowest centering accuracy we obtain after aberration correction can be below 1 mas. We find that the proper motion errors remain below 1.0 mas/yr for point sources with five observations and approximately 0.8 mas/yr for seven observations with a time baseline of around 3.5 years. We finally demonstrate that the precision of our position measurements for stars fainter than 21 mag in the simulated CSST crowded field is better than the results from both SExtractor and DOLPHOT.</description>

      <title>Arecibo Wow! II: Revised Properties of the Wow! Signal from Archival Ohio SETI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wow! Signal, detected in 1977 by the Ohio State University SETI project, remains one of the most intriguing unexplained radio transients. The most recent significant revision of its properties took place in the late 1990s; however, further advances were limited by readily available data from this event. Here we retrieved and analyzed decades of previously unpublished Ohio SETI observations, enabling the most comprehensive re-evaluation of the properties of the Wow! Signal to date with modern methods. Our results reveal significant revisions to its parameters that may help explain why its source has been so difficult to identify. We refine its potential origin to two adjacent fields centered on the right ascension $\alpha=19^{\mathrm h}25^{\mathrm m}02^{\mathrm s} \pm 3^{\mathrm s}$ or $19^{\mathrm h}27^{\mathrm m}55^{\mathrm s} \pm 3^{\mathrm s}$, and the declination $\delta=-26^{\deg}57' \pm 20'$ (J2000), a location both narrower and slightly displaced from earlier estimates. We measure a higher peak flux density exceeding 250 Jy and a frequency of $1420.726 \pm 0.005$ MHz, implying a galactic source with a substantially higher radial velocity than previously assumed. Our analysis provides additional support for the hypothesis that the Wow! Signal most likely had an astrophysical origin rather than being attributed to radio interference. In particular, we confirm that small, cold HI clouds can produce narrowband signals similar to its detection, which might suggest a common origin. These findings provide the most precise constraints to date on the location, intensity, and frequency of the Wow! Signal and offer a new path to identify its origin.</description>

      <title>Signature of the explosion mechanism of Type-Ia SNe in substructures of the remnant: the case of Tycho's SNR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type-Ia supernovae (SNe), or runaway thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs (WDs), play a critical role in the chemical evolution of galaxies, and are important cosmological distance indicators due to their 'standardizable' lightcurves. Growing evidence, however, suggests greater diversity in their observed lightcurves (and spectra) than thought previously. This is usually attributed to a variety of WD explosion mechanisms and progenitor system properties, but a direct link between the explosion mechanisms and Type-Ia SN observables remains elusive. Here we present a novel approach to identify explosion mechanisms of Type-Ia SNe, by analyzing the sizes of small-scale turbulent substructures of different elements in their extended ejecta, i.e., in Supernova Remnants (SNRs). Our three-dimensional hydrodynamical models show that substructures in an SNR dominated by iron-group elements may have a typical size different from substructures dominated by intermediate mass elements (e.g., Si, S) in the same SNR. This size difference is governed by the explosion mechanism. Applying this approach to Tycho's SNR, we find that its observed structure is most consistent with the explosion of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass WD via the double-detonation mechanism. Extending this method to other well-characterized SNRs can let us connect the inferred explosion mechanism to the associated historical SNe, which often have spectra reconstructed through light echo observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1309.6258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of the AKARI survey photometric data in the study of galactic star formation. Our aim was to select young stellar objects (YSOs) in the AKARI FIS catalogue. We used AKARI Far-Infrared Surveyor and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer data to derive mid- and far-infrared colours of YSOs. Classification schemes based on Quadratic Discriminant Analysis have been given for YSOs. The training catalogue for QDA was the whole sky selection of previously known YSOs (i.e. listed in SIMBAD). A new catalogue of AKARI FIS YSO candidates including 44001 sources has been prepared. Reliability of the classification is over 90% as tested in comparison to known YSOs. As much as 76% of our YSO candidates are from previously uncatalogued type. The vast majority of these sources are Class I and II types according to the Lada classification. The distribution of AKARI FIS YSOs' is well correlated with that of the galactic ISM. Local over densities were found on infrared loops and towards the cold clumps detected by Planck.</description>

      <title>SF-R You Sure? The Conflicting Role of Star Formation Rates in Constraining the Evolution of Milky Way Analogues in Cosmological Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Milky Way analogues (MWAs) have long been studied by astronomers to place our Galaxy within an extragalactic context. With the power of cosmological simulations, we are now able to not only characterize MWAs today, but also watch as they evolve through cosmic time. We use the EAGLE and IllustrisTNG simulations to study a group of MWAs defined by their stellar mass (SM) and star formation rate (SFR). We trace these galaxies back along their evolution to investigate the star forming and mass assembly tracks taken by a galaxy to become a MWA today in light of these chosen parameters. We also take mock-observations of "MWAs" at $z&gt;0$ and trace them forwards in time to determine if galaxies that looked similar to the Milky Way earlier in their evolution still look like the Milky Way today, thus quantifying a selection efficiency which could inform future observational studies of MWAs. We find that most galaxies with Milky Way-SM follow a similar evolution regardless of present-day SFR, although MWAs in IllustrisTNG generally have not quenched, leading to star formation histories that produce "too-blue" galaxies today. Additionally, we find contamination by MWA-"imposters" in our mock-observations, with low selection efficiency at high redshift due to the tight constraint requiring convergence to the Milky Way's present-day SFR. Our work suggests present-day SM may suffice as a stand-alone selection parameter and helps to clarify how MWAs should be selected, and thus will be an important reference for future studies of both simulated and observed MWAs.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS and EIGER: A merging quasar host at z=7 with an overmassive black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11035v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope is revolutionising our ability to understand the host galaxies and local environments of high-z quasars. Here we obtain a comprehensive understanding of the host galaxy of the z=7.08 quasar J1120+0641 by combining NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy with NIRCam photometry of the host continuum emission. Our emission-line maps reveal that this quasar host is undergoing a merger with a bright companion galaxy. The quasar host and the companion have similar dynamical masses of $\sim10^{10}M_\odot$, suggesting that this is a major galaxy interaction. Through detailed quasar subtraction and SED fitting using the NIRCam data, we obtained an estimate of the host stellar mass of $M_{\ast}=(3.0^{+2.5}_{-1.4})\times10^9M_\odot$, with $M_{*}=(2.7^{+0.5}_{-0.5})\times10^9M_\odot$ for the companion galaxy. Using the H$\beta$ Balmer line we estimated a virial black hole mass of $M_{\rm{BH}}=(1.9^{+2.9}_{-1.1})\times10^9 M_\odot$. Thus, J1120+0641 has an extreme black hole-stellar mass ratio of $M_{\rm{BH}}/M_\ast=0.63^{+0.54}_{-0.31}$, which is ~3 dex larger than expected by the local scaling relations between black hole and stellar mass. J1120+0641 is powered by an overmassive black hole with the highest reported black hole-stellar mass ratio in a quasar host that is currently undergoing a major merger. These new insights highlight the power of JWST for measuring and understanding these extreme first quasars.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the origin and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBH) stands as one of the most important challenges in astrophysics and cosmology, with little current theoretical consensus. Improved observational constraints on the cosmological evolution of SMBH demographics are needed. Here we report results of a search via photometric variability for SMBHs appearing as active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the cosmological volume defined by the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF). This work includes particular focus on a new observation carried out in 2023 with the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope (HST)} using the WFC3/IR/F140W, which is compared directly to equivalent data taken 11 years earlier in 2012. Two earlier pairs of observations from 2009 to 2012 with WFC3/IR/F105W and WFC3/IR/F160W are also analysed. We identify 521, 188, and 109 AGN candidates as nuclear sources that exhibit photometric variability at a level of 2, 2.5 and 3~$\sigma$ in at least one filter. This sample includes 13, 3, and 2 AGN candidates at redshifts $z&gt;6$, when the Universe was $\lesssim900$~Myr old. After variability and luminosity function (down to $M_{\rm UV}=-17\:$mag) completeness corrections, we estimate the co-moving number density of SMBHs, $n_{\rm SMBH}(z)$. At $z \gtrsim 6$, $n_{\rm SMBH}\gtrsim 6\times10^{-3}\:{\rm cMpc^{-3}}$. At low-$z$ our observations are sensitive to AGN fainter than $M_{\rm UV}=-17 \:$mag, and we estimate $n_{\rm SMBH}\gtrsim 10^{-2}\:{\rm cMpc^{-3}}$. We discuss how these results place strong constraints on a variety of SMBH seeding theories.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Multiple Types of Post-Starburst Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quenching mechanisms of galaxies are not yet fully understood, but post-starburst galaxies provide one explanation for the rapid transition between star-forming and quiescent galaxies. At low redshift, it is generally thought that the starburst initiating the post-starburst phase is merger-driven, however, not all post-starburst galaxies show evidence of a merger, and recent studies suggested that post-starburst galaxies may be produced by multiple distinct mechanisms. This study examines whether multiple types of post-starburst galaxies actually exist, that is, whether the properties of post-starburst galaxies are multimodal. We used uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) to cluster post-starburst galaxies based on spectroscopic data. The results suggest that there are three types of post-starburst galaxies that have dissimilar stacked spectral energy distributions and are separated by a combination of their H$\alpha$ and [OII]$\lambda$3727 line strengths with an accuracy of 91%. A comparison of various galaxy properties (e.g., emission line strengths, mass and age distributions, and morphologies) indicates that the grouping is not just an age sequence, but may be correlated to the merger-histories of the galaxies. It suggested that the three post-starburst galaxy types have different origins, some of which may not be merger-driven, and that all typical galaxies go through the post-starburst phase at turnoff.</description>

      <title>Metal-polluted Population III galaxies and How to Find Them</title>

Abstract: Observing Population III (hereafter PopIII) galaxies, the hosts of first-generation stars, remains challenging even with the JWST. The current few candidates have been identified through the combination of a prominent HeII emission and the absence of metal lines, a well-known but extremely brief signature of metal-free systems. Here, we accurately model the evolution of the emission from PopIII galaxies to increase the number of candidates in JWST observations. To achieve this, we employ a locally calibrated galaxy-formation model that self-consistently follows the star formation and chemical evolution initiated by the first stars. We find that PopIII galaxies can emit metal lines in their ``self-polluted'' phase, while galaxies host only metal-free stars but the gas has been chemically-enriched by the first supernovae. In this phase, PopIII galaxies have $\rm [OIII]/H\beta \approx 1$, which opens the pool of candidates to more easily detectable sources. We predict that the high HeII emission of PopIII galaxies can last up to $\rm \approx 20 \, Myrs$ and that it is partly maintained in the ``hybrid'' phase, when PopIII and PopII stars co-exist in the host galaxy. We propose novel diagnostics involving UV metal lines to select PopIII candidates in high-z JWST surveys. In JADES, we identify 9 candidate galaxies with $&gt;25\%$ of their stellar mass in metal-free stars, showcasing the effectiveness of our method. Ultimately, the key to discovering PopIII galaxies could be to catch them during their first episodes of chemical enrichment.</description>

Abstract: JWST observations of quasars in the Epoch of Reionization have revealed that many lie in host galaxies that are severely undermassive relative to the supermassive black holes. It is unclear how these systems will evolve to the tight local relation between stellar mass and black hole mass. We search for companions around the z=7.08 quasar ULAS J1120+0641 using JWST/NIRCam narrow, medium, and wide-band photometry to identify [O III] emitters at the quasar redshift, and explore the potential for growth of the host galaxy through future mergers. We find 22 sources near the quasar's redshift across our two 4.4 arcmin$^2$ fields, indicating that environment of ULAS J1120+0641 is strongly overdense in z~7.1 galaxies relative to the field. We estimate the potential future mass budget of the quasar host galaxy by summing the current stellar and gas masses of the quasar host and surrounding galaxies, correcting for incompleteness and selection effects. With no further black hole growth, ULAS J1120+0641 is unlikely to reach a $M_{\mathrm{BH}}/M_*$ ratio less than ~2.5% at z=0, still much higher than typical for local galaxies. However, such systems -- a quiescent black hole in a low-luminosity galaxy -- may have escaped detection locally if they are sufficiently distant.</description>

      <title>CAPOS: The bulge Cluster APOgee Survey VIII. Final ASPCAP results for all clusters</title>

Abstract: Bulge globular clusters(BGCs) are exceptional tracers of the formation and chemodynamical evolution of this oldest Galactic component. However, until now, observational difficulties have prevented us from taking full advantage of these powerful Galactic archeological tools. CAPOS, the bulge Cluster APOgee Survey, addresses this key topic by observing a large number of BGCs, most of which have been poorly studied. We aim to obtain accurate mean values for metallicity,[alpha/Fe],and radial velocity, as well as abundances for 11 other elements. We present final parameters based on ASPCAP for all 18 CAPOS BGCs. We carry out a stringent membership selection, finding 303 with SNR&gt;70 and 125 with lower SNR. We reinforced the finding that stars with high [N/Fe] abundances show higher [Fe/H] than their lower [N/Fe] counterparts. Mg,Ca and global alpha abundances show similar trends, while Si is well-behaved. The [Fe/H] value of these 2nd population stars is corrected to derive the mean metallicity. Mean metallicities are determined to a precision of 0.05 dex,[alpha/Fe] to 0.06 dex, and radial velocity to 3.4 km/s. No clusters show strong evidence for internal metallicity variation, including M22. Abundances for 11 other elements using only 1st population stars are calculated and are generally in good agreement with the literature. We develope a new chemodynamical GC classification scheme, synthesizing several recent studies. We also compile up-to-date metallicities. The BGC metallicity distribution is bimodal, with peaks at [Fe/H]=-0.45 and -1.1, with the metal-poor peak strongly dominant, while exsitu GCs are unimodal, with a peak at -1.6. Surprisingly, we find only a small, statistically insignificant difference in the mean [Si/Fe] of in and exsitu GCs. The 4 GCs with the lowest [Si/Fe] values are all exsitu, relatively young, and 3 belong to Sagittarius, but no other correlations are evident.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Measurement of Supermassive Black Hole Masses: QPE Timing Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense repeating soft X-ray bursts with recurrence times about a few hours to a few weeks from galactic nuclei. More and more analyses show that (at least a fraction of) QPEs are the result of collisions between a stellar mass object (SMO, a stellar mass black hole or a main sequence star) and an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. Previous studies have shown the possibility of reconstructing the SMO trajectory from QPE timing data, consequently measuring the SMBH mass from tracing a single SMO. In this paper, we construct a comprehensive Bayesian framework for implementing the QPE timing method, explore the optimal QPE observation strategy for measuring SMBH masses, and forecast the measurement precision expected in the era of multi-target X-ray telescope, Chasing All Transients Constellation Hunters (CATCH). Simulations of CATCH observations of GSN 069 and eRO-QPE2 like QPEs confirm the possible applications of the QPE timing method in precise measurement of SMBH masses (and spins), especially in the lower mass end ($\lesssim 10^7 M_\odot$) where QPEs prevail and relevant dynamical timescales are reasonably short to be measured.</description>

      <title>Impact of stellar winds on the pair-instability supernova rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Very massive stars (VMSs, $M_{\star}$ $\geq$ 100 M$_{\odot}$) play a crucial role in several astrophysical processes. At low metallicity, they might collapse directly into black holes, or end their lives as pair-instability supernovae. Recent observational results set an upper limit of $0.7\,{}\mathrm{ yr}^{-1} \,{}\mathrm{ Gpc}^{-3}$ on the rate density of pair-instability supernovae in the nearby Universe. However, most theoretical models predict rates exceeding this limit. Here, we compute new VMS tracks with the MESA code, and use them to analyze the evolution of the (pulsational) pair-instability supernova rate density across cosmic time. We show that stellar wind models accounting for the transition between optically thin and thick winds yield a pair-instability supernova rate $\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{PISN}}\sim{}0.1$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ at redshift $z\sim{}0$, about two orders of magnitude lower than our previous models. We find that the main contribution to the pair-instability supernova rate comes from stars with metallicity $Z\sim{}0.001-0.002$. Stars with higher metallicities cannot enter the pair-instability supernova regime, even if their zero-age main sequence mass is up to 500 M$_\odot$. The main reason is that VMSs enter the regime for optically thick winds during the main sequence at metallicity as low as $Z\sim{4}\times{}10^{-4}$. This enhances the mass loss rate, quenching the growth of the He core and thus preventing the onset of pair-instability in later evolutionary stages. This result highlights the critical role of mass loss in shaping the final fate of very massive stars and the rate of pair-instability supernovae.</description>

      <title>From a Different Star: 3I/ATLAS in the context of the \={O}tautahi-Oxford interstellar object population model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the third interstellar object (ISO), 3I/ATLAS (`3I'), provides a rare chance to directly observe a small body from another Solar System. Studying its chemistry and dynamics will add to our understanding of how the processes of planetesimal formation and evolution happen across the Milky Way's disk, and how such objects respond to the Milky Way's potential. In this Letter, we present a first assessment of 3I in the context of the \={O}tautahi-Oxford model, which uses data from Gaia in conjunction with models of protoplanetary disk chemistry and Galactic dynamics to predict the properties of the ISO population. The model shows that both the velocity and radiant of 3I are within the expected range. Its velocity predicts an age of over 7.6 Gyr and a high water mass fraction, which may become observable shortly. We also conclude that it is very unlikely that 3I shares an origin with either of the previous two interstellar object detections.</description>

      <title>Innermost stable circular orbit of Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black holes and inspirals from it: Exact solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an uncharged test particle in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson spacetime, solutions of two major types of orbits are presented, both in exact forms. First, for both prograde and retrograde motions, the radii of innermost stable circular orbits are expressed fully in terms of the outer and inner horizon radii just in the same form as Kerr black holes, despite the fact that Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black holes have three parameters. Second, closed analytic solutions are given to the problem of a test particle inspiraling toward the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black hole from innermost stable circular orbits at the infinitely distant past. These exact solutions can serve as a springboard for more general solutions and astrophysical applications in the future.</description>

      <title>The impact of galaxy bias on cross-correlation tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cross-correlation of galaxies at different redshifts with other tracers of the large-scale structure can be used to reconstruct the cosmic mean of key physical quantities, and their evolution over billions of years, at high precision. However, a correct interpretation of these measurements must ensure that they are independent of the clustering properties of the galaxy sample used. In this paper we explore different prescriptions to extract tomographic reconstruction measurements and use the FLAMINGO hydrodynamic simulations to show that a robust estimator, independent of the small-scale galaxy bias, can be constructed. We focus on the tomographic reconstruction of the halo bias-weighted electron pressure $\langle bP_e\rangle$ and star-formation density $\langle b\rho_{\rm SFR}\rangle$, which can be reconstructed from tomographic analysis of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and cosmic infrared background maps, respectively. We show that these quantities can be reconstructed with an accuracy of 1-3\% over a wide range of redshifts, using different galaxy samples. We also show that these measurements can be accurately interpreted using the halo model, assuming a sufficiently reliable model can be constructed for the halo mass function, large-scale halo bias, and for the dependence of the physical quantities being reconstructed on halo mass.</description>
