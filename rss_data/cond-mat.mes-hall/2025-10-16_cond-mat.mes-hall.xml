      <title>Dynamical breaking of inversion symmetry and strong second harmonic generation with nonlinear phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how crystalline inversion symmetry can be dynamically broken by optical phonons with generic, hardening Kerr-like non-linearities. The symmetry-broken state is reached through a parametric instability that can be accessed by driving close to half the phonon resonance. After the onset of the instability, the system settles to a steady state with inversion-symmetry breaking phonon trajectories and strong second harmonic generation. The time averaged positions of the atoms are displaced relative to equilibrium in the steady state, resulting in a rectification of the driving signal.</description>

      <title>High Stability Mechanical Frequency Sensing beyond the Linear Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing via a mechanical frequency shift is a powerful measurement tool, and, therefore, understanding and mitigating frequency noise affecting mechanical resonators is imperative. Thermomechanical noise fundamentally limits mechanical frequency stability, and its impact can be reduced with increased coherent amplitude of mechanical motion. However, large enough actuation places the resonator in the nonlinear (Duffing) regime, where conversion of amplitude noise (AM) into frequency noise (FM) can worsen sensor performance. Here, we present an experimentally straightforward method to evade this amplitude tradeoff in micromechanical sensors. Combining knowledge of the Duffing coefficients with readily available amplitude measurements, we avoid AM-FM conversion. Our approach uses dual-mechanical-mode operation on a tensioned thin-film resonator to set a baseline thermomechanically-limited stability by eliminating correlated single-mode frequency drifts. Thus, we cleanly observe AM-FM conversion at high drive, and reduce it using our method. The resulting high-stability operation beyond the linear regime contrasts long-standing perspectives in the field.</description>

      <title>Spin-Selective Second-Order Topological Insulators Enabling Cornertronics in 2D Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in spintronics within the paradigm of altermagnets (AMs) opens new avenues for next-generation electronic device design. Here, we establish a spin-corner locking mechanism that generates second-order topological states in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic systems, through effective model analysis. Remarkably, the breaking of Mxy symmetry under uniaxial strain creates spin-resolved corner modes, driving the system into a corner-polarized second-order topological insulator (CPSOTI). Beyond critical strain, a topological phase transition to quantum anomalous Hall insulator occurs with quantized conductance. Through first-principles calculations, we identify two experimentally viable candidates for 2D intrinsic AM CrO and Cr$_2$Se$_2$O -- which host robust CPSOTI. Moreover, we construct the topological phase diagram of CrO and predict the existence of an altermagnetic Weyl semimetal phase. Our findings open technological avenues in altermagnetism and higher-order topology, while providing opportunities for coupling topological spintronics with cornertronics.</description>

      <title>Hybrid light-matter boundaries of graphene in a chiral cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in chiral cavities that can couple coherently to two-dimensional materials have opened a powerful route to reshape electronic topology without an external drive. Here we establish the bulk-boundary correspondence for graphene embedded in a circularly polarized cavity. By combining exact diagonalization (ED) of zigzag ribbons, a semi-analytic T-matrix for half-infinite lattices, and analytical insights from a Dirac-Jaynes-Cummings model, we show that (i) every light-matter interaction-induced gap hosts pairs of unidirectional light-matter edge currents depending on the Chern number of the band while some of them are even bright; (ii) these chiral states persist throughout the entire photon ladder; and (iii) their dispersion, localization length and photon distribution exhibit a universal scaling controlled by the light-matter interaction. Time-evolution simulations further demonstrate that a dark electronic edge excitation can be converted into a bright and unidirectionally propagating current, that remains coherent over long time scales. Our results predict an experimental signature of the hybrid band topology and a blueprint for reconfigurable chiral channels in next-generation quantum-optical devices.</description>

      <title>Magnetically controllable nonlinear valley Hall effect in centrosymmetric ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Valley Hall effect is fundamental to valleytronics and provides a promising avenue for advancing information technology. While conventional valley Hall effect requires the inversion symmetry breaking, the recently proposed nonlinear valley Hall (NVH) effect removes the symmetry constraint, and broaden material choices. However, existing studies are limited to nonmagnetic materials without spin involvement and rely on external strain to break rotational symmetry. Here, to address these limitations, we design a magnetically controllable NVH effect in centrosymmetric ferromagnets, by the tight-binding model and first-principles calculations. The model calculations demonstrate nonvanishing NVH conductivities can emerge in pristine hexagonal lattice without external strain, with the magnitude, sign, and spin polarization of the conductivities being all dependent on the magnetization orientation. The effect thus generates various spin-polarized valley Hall currents, characterized by distinct combinations of current direction and spin polarization. First-principle results on a ferromagnetic VSi$_2$N$_4$ bilayer confirm considerable NVH conductivities and their dependence on the magnetization. The magnetically controllable NVH effect unlocks the potential of centrosymmetric magnets for valleytronics, and offer opportunities for novel spintronic and valleytronic devices.</description>

      <title>Buckling and flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with its flat bands provides a rich platform for exploring emergent electronic orders. Similarly, periodically buckled monolayer graphene has been proposed as a tunable alternative for realizing flat bands. Here, we investigate the combined effect of buckling and twisting in bilayer graphene. We find that periodic buckling in large-angle TBG initially enhances band flattening compared to monolayer graphene, but for sufficiently strong buckling, it instead increases the band dispersion. This occurs both because of the presence of interlayer coupling, which reduces the in-plane kinetic energy, and due to the opening of a gap at the Dirac point resulting from inversion-symmetry breaking. Additionally, we find that buckling-induced band flattening competes with twist-induced band flattening. While the former breaks sublattice symmetry, generating a sublattice polarization, the latter prefers to preserve it. This prevents buckling from generating even flatter bands at the magic angle. Nevertheless, we find that buckled TBG can exhibit flatter bands than pristine TBG over a wide range of twist angles, with a flatness similar to that of pristine magic-angle TBG.</description>

      <title>Statistical Structure of Charge Disorder in Si/SiGe Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Properties of quantum dot based spin qubits have significant inter-device variability due to unavoidable presence of various types of disorder in semiconductor nanostructures. A significant source of this variability is charge disorder at the semiconductor-oxide interface, which causes unpredictable, yet, as we show here, correlated fluctuations in such essential properties of quantum dots like their mutual tunnel couplings, and electronic confinement energies. This study presents a systematic approach to characterize and mitigate the effects of such disorder. We utilize finite element modeling of a Si/SiGe double quantum dot to generate a large statistical ensemble of devices, simulating the impact of trapped interface charges. This work results in a predictive statistical model capable of generating realistic artificial data for training machine learning algorithms. By applying Principal Component Analysis to this dataset, we identify the dominant modes through which disorder affects the multi-dimensional parameter space of the device. Our findings show that the parameter variations are not arbitrary, but are concentrated along a few principal axes - i.e.there are significant correlations between many properties of the devices.
  We finally compare that against control modes generated by sweeping the gate voltages, revealing limitations of the plunger-only control. This work provides a framework for enhancing the controllability and operational yield of spin qubit devices, by systematically addressing the nature of electrostatic disorder that leads to statistical correlations in properties of double quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Momentum-Resolved Spectroscopy of Superconductivity with the Quantum Twisting Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for probing superconductivity with momentum resolution using the quantum twisting microscope (QTM), a planar tunneling device where a graphene tip is rotated relative to a two-dimensional sample. Due to in-plane momentum conservation, the QTM directly measures the superconducting spectral function along well-defined trajectories in momentum space. The relative intensities of electron and hole excitations encode the Bogoliubov coherence factors, revealing the momentum dependence of the pairing magnitude. Three $C_{3z}$-related tunneling channels enable direct detection of rotational symmetry breaking, as well as nodal points in the superconducting order parameter. We apply our framework to superconductivity within the Bistritzer-MacDonald model of noninteracting electrons and the Topological Heavy Fermion model, which accounts for electron-electron interactions. Together, these capabilities establish the QTM as a direct probe of the pairing symmetry and microscopic origin of superconductivity in two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Excitonic optical absorption in strained monolayer CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the isolation of 2D magnetic materials has opened several avenues for possible new ap- plications in spintronics. Among these materials, CrSBr has sparked interest due to its relatively high Curie temperature, highly anisotropic lattice structure, and high structural stability. These properties ran along others shared by any atomically thin material such as its outstanding defor- mation capacity and a strong optical response dominated by excitonic effects. The combination of these properties provides a fairly uncharted playground where to explore the interplay between magnetism and optical excitations. Here, we focus our attention on the theoretical optical response of CrSBr under several distinct strain configurations, analyzing the resulting changes to both the excitonic peaks and overall shape of the diagonal components of the linear conductivity tensor.</description>

      <title>Optical Response of Graphene Quantum Dots in the Visible Spectrum: A Combined DFT-QED Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model based on density functional theory (DFT) and quantum electrodynamics (QED) to study the dynamical characteristics of graphene quantum dots (GQDs). We assume the GQD edges are saturated with hydrogen atoms, effectively making it a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) such as coronene. By combining the GQD spectrum calculated from a time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) with the dynamical behavior of a QD model derived from QED, we calculate the main optical characteristics of the GQD, such as its transition frequencies, the dipole moment associated to each of those transitions, life-time and the population dynamics of the molecular levels. Owing to the close match between the calculated spectrum and experimental results, our results represent a significant contribution to research on quantum treatments of light-matter interactions in realistic 2D nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>Strong- vs weak-coupling lasing in polymer-film microcavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organic semiconductors are particularly attractive for polaritonics due to their large exciton binding energies and oscillator strengths. Among them, the ladder-type conjugated polymer poly(paraphenylene) (MeLPPP) is distinguished by its rigid backbone, narrow exciton linewidth, high photoluminescence quantum yield, and enhanced photostability, which makes it an excellent candidate for organic polariton devices. While polariton lasing has been reported in various organic systems, systematic studies of the transition from polariton lasing to conventional photon lasing within a single, well-controlled material platform remain limited. Understanding this crossover is crucial for distinguishing polariton-specific signatures from conventional lasing. Here, we present planar organic microcavities incorporating MeLPPP as the active medium that supports polariton lasing. By tuning the effective cavity length, we track the transition from strong to weak coupling and identify its impact on the lasing behaviour. Our results reveal a many fold increase in the lasing threshold when moving from polariton to photon lasing, emission energy pulling towards the polymer gain maximum for either regimes, and an important role of vibron mediated exciton relaxation evidenced by the reduction in lasing thresholds near vibron energy resonances with respect to the S10 exciton. These findings provide fundamental insight into light-matter coupling in organics and highlight MeLPPP microcavities as a versatile platform for future applications in low-threshold lasers.</description>

      <title>Angular Emission Properties of Strained Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolayers of transition-metal dichalcogenides have shown that uniaxial strain changes both the photoluminescence emission energy and intensity. The changes are attributed to the band-structure evolution under tensile strain where both the bandgap decreases and a direct-to-indirect transition occurs. This was shown for relatively high strains, whereas this is not the case at low strain values $&lt;1\%$ in which in this work, we observe the erratic dependency of the photoluminescence intensity at low strain values as a function of strain. We find that the dominant physical property is the dependence of the optical-dipole emission on the curvature of the substrate. We validate the behavior of the photoluminescence intensity with experimental angular emission spectroscopy (k-space imaging). These findings are supported by Finite-Difference Time-Domain simulations, in agreement with the experimental data. Our findings present the importance of choosing the right substrate for flexible devices based on transition-metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coreshell nanoparticles can combine optical features of different materials in a single nanostructure, which makes them interesting for many applications from biomedicine to energy harvesting. On the other hand, periodic arrays of plasmonic nanoparticles can exhibit topological phenomena such as topological edge states. Here we study periodic chains of Si@Ag coreshell nanoparticles. For this task, we combine the hybridization of surface plasmonic modes in complex nanostructures with the coupled electric dipole formalism employed for modelling the scattering of light by periodic arrays of small plasmonic nanoparticles. We propose treating coreshell nanoparticle as several coupled electric dipoles instead of just one and show how this is a more appropriate framework to study arrays of coreshell nanoparticles, which allows to build a one-to-one connection between the resonant modes of the nanoparticles and the dispersion bands of the system. Within this formalism, we show that a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain of coreshell Si@Ag nanoparticles host multiple topological edge states pinned at the resonant frequencies of the coreshell nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Spin Readout in a 22 nm Node Integrated Circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constructing a quantum computer capable of broad and important applications is likely to require millions of addressable physical qubits, posing the challenge of large-scale integration of quantum systems with classical electronics. Fully depleted silicon-on-insulator CMOS technology has been used to develop a range of cryogenic electronic components for the control and readout of different qubit modalities interfaced on separate chips. However, recent measurements of quantum dots on this technology raise the tantalising prospect of realising control electronics and spin qubits on the same manufacturing platform, within a single integrated circuit (IC). Here, we demonstrate single-shot spin readout in addressable quantum dot devices within an IC fabricated using industry-standard 22 nm fully depleted silicon-on-insulator technology. We achieve spin-to-charge conversion via a ramped energy-selective measurement, detected using a radio-frequency single-electron transistor and addressed by on-chip cryogenic electronics. The observation of consistent readout visibilities exceeding 90% and millisecond spin relaxation times in two nominally identical devices within the addressable array supports the reproducibility of the unit cell. The successful observation of spin readout using this CMOS process marks a key step towards realising highly scalable and integrated spin qubits.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the scaling behavior of high harmonic generation (HHG) driven by magnetic dynamics in spin-orbit coupled systems. In contrast to optically driven HHG--where the harmonic cutoff scales as $\omega^{-3}$ with the driving frequency $\omega$--our time-dependent quantum transport simulations reveal a qualitatively distinct scaling law for magnetically driven HHG in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction: the harmonic cutoff $n_{\mathrm{max}}$ scales as $\omega^{-1}$. This fundamental difference arises from distinct excitation mechanisms--namely, spin-flip transitions driven by vectorial magnetic precession, as opposed to scalar electric fields. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the precession cone angle $\theta$ serves as a crucial control parameter. Increasing $\theta$ broadens the harmonic bandwidth, with peak emission achieved for nearly in-plane magnetic dynamics. Our findings establish magnetically driven HHG as a robust and tunable mechanism for nonlinear spin transport, governed by unique scaling laws with potential applications in ultrafast spintronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Tunable linear and nonlinear anomalous Hall transport in two-dimensional CrPS$_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Few-layer CrPS$_{4}$ is a two-dimensional (2D) magnetic material with excellent stability in ambient environment, which attracted significant interest in recent research. Here, via first-principles calculations, we show that 2D CrPS$_{4}$ hosts a variety of anomalous Hall transport phenomena, owing to its layer-dependent magnetism and symmetry character. Monolayer CrPS$_{4}$ can display a sizable linear anomalous Hall effect, while its nonlinear anomalous Hall response is forbidden. In contrast, bilayer CrPS$_{4}$ can produce pronounced intrinsic nonlinear anomalous Hall response from Berry-connection polarizability, in the absence of linear anomalous Hall effect. We clarify that the large peaks in these responses originate from gapped Dirac points in the band structure. Furthermore, we show that linear anomalous Hall effect can be induced and controlled in bilayer CrPS$_{4}$ by gate electric field or in-plane magnetic field, which break the spacetime inversion symmetry. Our findings unveil the interesting layer-dependent Hall transport physics in 2D CrPS$_{4}$ magnets, suggesting its potential in electronic and spintronic device applications.</description>

      <title>Testing Kubo formula on a nonlinear quantum conductor driven far from equilibrium via power exchanges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an experimental test of Kubo formula performed on a nonlinear quantum conductor, a Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor tunnel junction, driven far from equilibrium by a DC voltage bias. We implement the proposal of Lesovik and Loosen [1] and demonstrate experimentally that it is possible to extract both the emission and absorption noise of the conductor by measuring the power it exchanges with a linear detection circuit whose occupation is tuned close to vacuum levels. We then compare their difference to the real part of the admittance which is independently measured by coherent reflectometry, finding that Kubo formula holds within experimental accuracy. Last, we show theoretically that the spectral density of power exchanged between a quantum conductor and its linear detection circuit follows a Lesovik and Loosen like formula, even in the presence of strong detection back-action. This result applies as long as the conductor acts as a current source for the detection circuit and the detection circuit is not singular.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Gauge Enhances Self-Healing for Non-Hermitian Su--Schrieffer--Heeger Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23978v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a non-Hermitian extension of the Su--Schrieffer--Heeger model that incorporates spin-dependent SU(2) gauge fields, represented by non-Abelian couplings between lattice sites, as well as independent nonreciprocal hopping amplitudes. This framework gives rise to a rich phase structure characterized by complex-energy braiding and tunable non-Hermitian skin effects. By employing the generalized Brillouin zone approach, we analyze the bulk-boundary correspondence and identify topological transitions protected by chiral symmetry. Notably, we demonstrate that non-Abelian gauge fields significantly enhance the dynamical resilience of the system, enabling robust self-healing under a moving scattering potential. These results clarify the role of SU(2) gauge fields in stabilizing non-Hermitian topological phases and indicate that the proposed model can be realized with currently available photonic, atomic, and superconducting experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Landau level spectroscopy of Dirac fermions in millimeter-scale twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exotic electronic physics including correlated insulating states and fractional Chern insulators have been observed in twisted bilayer graphene in a magnetic field when the Fermi velocity vanishes, however a question remains as to the stability of these states which is controlled by the gap to the first excited state. Free-space terahertz magneto-optics can directly probe the gap to charge excitations which bounds the stability of electronic states, but this measurement has thus-far been inaccessible due to the micron size of twisted bilayer graphene samples, while the wavelength of terahertz light is up to a millimeter. Here we leverage advances in fabrication to create twisted bilayer graphene samples over 5 mm x 5 mm in size with a uniform twist angle and study the magnetic field dependence of the cyclotron resonance by a complex Faraday rotation experiment in p-doped large angle twisted bilayer graphene. These measurements directly probe charge excitations in inter-Landau level transitions and determine the Fermi velocity as a function of twist angle.</description>

      <title>Multipole order in two-dimensional altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the magnetic-multipole orders in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnets, focusing on two representative models: a generic minimal three-site model, and a four-site model representative of monolayer FeSe. We construct low-energy effective Hamiltonians for both systems and calculate their respective multipole indicators to characterize the underlying magnetic order. Our analysis reveals an intriguing contrast between the two systems. We find that the generic minimal model exhibits the expected non-zero magnetic-octupole order. In the monolayer-FeSe model, however, the magnetic-octupole order vanishes globally, and a magnetic-hexadecapole order is present instead. The emergence of altermagnetic splitting in the band structure then arises via the interplay with a sublattice-isospin degree of freedom. Our work demonstrates how the classification and comprehensive understanding of 2D altermagnetic materials transcends bulk descriptions.</description>

Abstract: Quantum heat transport by electrons in ballistic channels is usually well-described in the Landauer-B\"uttiker framework, which fails when introducing strong Coulomb interactions. We theoretically show that a chain of small metallic dots where charge cannot accumulate, connected by ballistic channels, conducts heat better than charge. We relate this feature to the competition between heat diffusion by neutral excitations and Coulomb interactions in the chain, which defines a temperature gradient over a finite characteristic length. We show that the Lorenz ratio can be arbitrarily large, scaling as the square root of the chain's length, which suggests new approaches for heat manipulation in mesoscopic systems.</description>

Abstract: Bosonic Bogoliubov de Gennes (BBdG) Hamiltonians describe the excitations of weakly interacting Bose condensates as well as photonic systems under parametric driving. Their topological features have been studied mainly by utilizing a generalized symplectic version of the Berry curvature and related Chern numbers. However, a full characterization of geometrical features in BBdG systems is still lacking. Here, we propose a symplectic quantum geometric tensor (SQGT), whose imaginary part leads to the previously studied symplectic Berry curvature, while the real part gives rise to a symplectic quantum metric, providing a natural distance measure in the space of bosonic Bogoliubov modes. The SQGT is directly related to observable properties of BBdG systems. We show how to measure all components of the SQGT by extracting excitation rates in response to periodic modulations of the systems' parameters. Moreover, we connect the symplectic Berry curvature to a generalized symplectic anomalous velocity term for Bogoliubov-Bloch wave packets. We test our results for a bosonic Bogoliubov-Haldane model.</description>

Abstract: Enriching condensed-matter systems with quantum optical phenomena currently drives intense research efforts, particularly to introduce collective quantum correlations. Here we access this paradigm, by confining dipolar excitons in a nanoscopic lattice where long-range hopping, and nearest-neighbour dipolar repulsions, dress the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. Long-range hopping is evidenced by the spontaneous buildup of many-body sub-radiance, signalled by an algebraic slowdown of excitons radiative dissipation. In addition, we observe a threshold increase of temporal coherence for dipolar quantum solids only. It suggests that excitons condense in a single sub-radiant state for Mott-like phases. These combine then spatial order and collectively extended coherence, in a single degree of freedom. Our study unveils that nanoscopic exciton arrays provide a unique platform to design new frontiers of strongly-correlated lattice models with long-range correlations.</description>

      <title>Phonons in Electron Crystals with Berry Curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in 2D materials featuring nonzero Berry curvature have inspired extensions of the Wigner crystallization paradigm. This paper derives a low-energy effective theory for such quantum crystals, including the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) with nonzero Chern number. First we show that the low frequency dispersion of phonons in AHC, despite the presence of Berry curvature, resembles that of the zero field (rather than finite magnetic field) Wigner crystal due to the commutation of translation generators. We explain how key parameters of the phonon theory such as elastic constants and effective mass can be extracted from microscopic models, and apply them to two families of models: the recently introduced $\lambda$-jellium model and a model of rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG). In the $\lambda$-jellium model, we explore the energy landscape as crystal geometry shifts, revealing that AHC can become `soft' under certain conditions. This causes transitions in lattice geometry, although the quantized Hall response remains unchanged. Surprisingly, the Berry curvature seems to enhance the effective mass, leading to a reduction in phonon speed. For the AHC in RMG, we obtain estimates of phonon speed and shear stiffness. We also identify a previously overlooked `kineo-elastic' term in the phonon effective action that is present in the symmetry setting of RMG, and leads to dramatic differences in phonon speeds in opposite directions. We numerically confirm these predictions of the effective actions by time-dependent Hartree-Fock calculations.</description>

Abstract: Atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) dopes silicon with enough carriers to change its electronic structure and can be used to create novel devices by defining metallic regions whose boundaries have single-atom abruptness. Incompatibility with the thermal and lithography process requirements for gated silicon transistor manufacturing have inhibited exploration of both how APAM can enhance CMOS performance and how transistor manufacturing steps can accelerate the discovery of new APAM device concepts. In this work, we introduce an APAM process that enables direct integration into the middle of a transistor manufacturing workflow. We show that a process that combines sputtering and annealing with a hardmask preserves a defining characteristic of APAM, a doping density far in excess of the solid solubility limit, while trading another, the atomic precision, for compatibility with manufacturing. The electrical characteristics of a chip combining a transistor with an APAM resistor show that the APAM module has only affected the transistor through the addition of a resistance and not by altering the transistor. This proof-of-concept demonstration also outlines the requirements and limitations of a unified APAM tool, which could be introduced into manufacturing environments, greatly expanding access to this technology and inspiring a new generation of devices with it.</description>

      <title>Jenga-Krotov algorithm: Efficient compilation of multi-qubit gates for exchange-only qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exchange-only (EO) qubits, implemented in triple-quantum-dot systems, offer a compelling platform for scalable semiconductor-based quantum computing by enabling universal control through purely exchange interactions. While high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates have been demonstrated, the synthesis of efficient multi-qubit operations-such as the Toffoli gate-remains a key bottleneck. Conventional gate decompositions into elementary operations lead to prohibitively long and error-prone pulse sequences, limiting practical deployment. In this work, we introduce a gradient-based optimization algorithm, Jenga-Krotov (JK), tailored to discover compact, high-fidelity EO gate sequences. Applying JK to the Toffoli gate, we reduce the number of required exchange unitaries from 216 (in direct decomposition) to 92, and compress the time steps required from 162 to 50, all while maintaining target fidelity. Under realistic noise, the accumulated gate error from our optimized sequence is an order of magnitude lower than that of conventional approaches. We have also applied the JK algorithm to other multi-qubit gates and algorithm. For the Fredkin gate, it reduces the number of time steps from 200 to 104 and the number of exchange unitaries from 276 to 172. For the quantum Fourier transform, it compresses the sequence from 180 to 80 time steps and from 237 to 202 exchange unitaries. These results demonstrate that the JK algorithm is a general and scalable strategy for multi-qubit gate synthesis in EO architectures, potentially facilitating realization of multi-qubit algorithms on semiconductor platforms.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnets, a novel class of collinear magnetic materials, exhibit unique spin-split band structures, yet topological insulating states in intrinsic altermagnetic systems are rare. Here, we identify monolayer Fe$_2X_2$O ($X$ = Cl, Br, I) as a new family of 2D altermagnetic real Chern insulators. These materials display robust $d$-wave altermagnetic ordering, semiconducting band gaps, and nontrivial real Chern numbers per spin channel, yielding spin-polarized topological corner modes. They also feature spin-polarized valleys with strong altermagnetism-valley-spin-lattice coupling, enabling valley-selective excitation via linear dichroism and strain-induced valley polarization. In multiferroic Fe$_2$Cl$_2$O, magnetism coexists with ferroelasticity, and an applied strain can switche the N\'eel vector. These findings position 2D iron oxyhalides as a promising platform for exploring altermagnetism and magnetic topological states for spintronics and valleytronics.</description>
