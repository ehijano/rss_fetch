      <title>The spectrum of open confining strings in the large-$N_c$ limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the spectra of open flux tubes formed between a static quark-antiquark pair for various gauge groups in the large-$N_c$ limit, focusing on different symmetries manifested by the quantum numbers of angular momentum, parity, and charge conjugation. Specifically, we present spectra from $N_c=3$ up to $N_c=6$ and for eight different irreducible representations of the symmetry characterizing the flux tube. In this study, we employed an anisotropic Wilson action, a large number of suitable spacial operators, and solved the generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) to obtain a significant number of excitations for different combinations of flux tube quantum numbers. The spectra are compared with the Nambu-Goto string model, revealing novel phenomena such as the presence of massive axions in the flux tube spectrum. We find that the mass of the axion in the open flux tube spectra sector is consistent with the mass obtained in the closed flux tube sector.</description>

      <title>Symmetry properties of staggered fermions with taste splitting mass term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analytical and numerical results on symmetry properties of staggered fermions with taste splitting mass terms. As staggered species split differently for different types of taste splitting masses, various lattice symmetry subgroups and symmetry properties emerge. From the breaking of rotational symmetry, gluonic counterterms emerge. Preliminary numerical results are given for lattice sizes up to $8^4$.</description>

      <title>The hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon $g-2$ at long distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our lattice QCD result for the long-distance part of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution, $(a_\mu^{\rm hvp})^{\rm LD}$, to the muon $g-2$ in the time-momentum representation. This is the numerically dominant, and at the same time the most challenging part regarding statistical precision. Our calculation is based on ensembles with dynamical up, down and strange quarks, employing the O($a$)-improved Wilson fermion action with lattice spacings ranging from $0.035-0.099$ fm. In order to reduce statistical noise in the long-distance part of the correlator to the per-mille level, we apply low-mode averaging and combine it with an explicit spectral reconstruction. Our result is $(a_\mu^{\rm hvp})^{\rm LD} = 423.2(4.2)_{\rm stat}(3.4)_{\rm syst}\times 10^{-10}$ in isospin-symmetric QCD, where the pion decay constant is used to set the energy scale. When combined with our previous results for the short- and intermediate-distance window observables and after including all sub-dominant contributions as well as isospin-breaking corrections, we obtain the total leading-order hadronic vacuum polarization contribution as $a_\mu^{\rm hvp} = 724.9(5.0)_{\rm stat}(4.9)_{\rm syst}\times 10^{-10}$. Our result displays a tension of 3.9 standard deviations with the data-driven estimate published in the 2020 White Paper, but leads to a SM prediction for the total muon anomalous magnetic moment that agrees with the current experimental average.</description>

      <title>Data-driven results for light-quark connected and strange-plus-disconnected hadronic $g-2$ short- and long-distance windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key issue affecting the attempt to reduce the uncertainty on the Standard Model prediction for the muon anomalous magnetic moment is the current discrepancy between lattice-QCD and data-driven results for the hadronic vacuum polarization. Progress on this issue benefits from precise data-driven determinations of the isospin-limit light-quark-connected (lqc) and strange-plus-light-quark-disconnected (s+lqd) components of the related RBC/UKQCD windows. In this paper, using a strategy employed previously for the intermediate window, we provide data-driven results for the lqc and s+lqd components of the short- and long-distance RBC/UKQCD windows. Comparing these results with those from the lattice, we find significant discrepancies in the lqc parts but good agreement for the s+lqd components. We also explore the impact of recent CMD-3 $e^+e^-\to \pi^+\pi^-$ cross-section results, demonstrating that an upward shift in the $\rho$-peak region of the type seen in the CMD-3 data serves to eliminate the discrepancies for the lqc components without compromising the good agreement between lattice and data-driven s+lqd results.</description>

      <title>Isospin breaking corrections in $2\pi$ production in tau decays and $e^+e^-$ annihilation: consequences for the muon $g-2$ and CVC tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the isospin-breaking corrections relating the $e^+e^-$ hadronic cross-section and the tau decay spectral function, focusing on the di-pion channel, that gives the dominant contribution to the hadronic vacuum polarization piece of the muon $g-2$. We test different types of electromagnetic and weak form factors and show that both, the Gounaris-Sakurai and a dispersive-based approach, describe accurately $\tau$ lepton and $e^+e^-$ data (less when KLOE measurements are included in the fits) and comply reasonably well with analyticity constraints. From these results we obtain the isospin-breaking contribution to the conserved vector current (CVC) prediction of the ${\rm BR}(\tau \to \pi\pi\nu_{\tau})$ and to the $2\pi$ hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon $g-2$, in agreement with previous determinations and with similar precision. Our results abound in the convenience of using tau data-based results in the updated data-driven prediction of the muon $g-2$ in the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Detecting the flavor content of the vacuum using the Dirac operator spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.05380v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the overlap Dirac spectrum on three gauge ensembles generated using $2+1$-flavor domain wall fermions. The three ensembles have different lattice spacings and two of them have quark masses tuned to the physical point. The spectral density is determined up to $\lambda\sim$100 MeV with subpercentage statistical uncertainty. We find that the density is close to a constant below $\lambda\sim$ 20 MeV as predicted by chiral perturbative theory ($\chi$PT), and then increases linearly due to the strange quark mass. By fitting to the next-to-leading order $\chi$PT form and using the non-perturbative RI/MOM renormalization, the $\rm SU(2)$ (keeping the strange quark mass at the physical point) and $\rm SU(3)$ chiral condensates at $\overline{\textrm{MS}}$ 2 GeV are determined to be $\Sigma=(265.4(0.5)(4.2)\ \textrm{MeV})^3$ and $\Sigma_0=(234.3(0.5)(25.8)\ \textrm{MeV})^3$, respectively. The pion decay constants are also determined to be $F=84.1(1.9)(8.0)$ and $F_0=58.6(0.5)(10.0)$ MeV. The systematic errors are carefully estimated including the effects of fitting ranges and the uncertainty of low-energy constant $L_6$. We also show that one can resolve the sea flavor content of the sea quarks and constrain their masses with {$\sim10\%-20\%$} statistical uncertainties using the Dirac spectral density.</description>

      <title>Odd-Parity Nucleon Electromagnetic Transitions in Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The parity-expanded variational analysis (PEVA) technique enables the isolation of opposite-parity eigenstates at finite momentum. The approach has been used to perform the first lattice QCD calculations of excited-baryon form factors. In particular, these calculations show that the low-lying odd-parity nucleon excitations are described well by constituent quark models at moderate u and d quark masses approaching the strange quark mass. Herein, we extend the PEVA technique to establish a formalism for the determination of odd-parity nucleon electromagnetic transition form factors in lattice QCD. The formalism is implemented in the first calculation of the helicity amplitudes for transitions from the ground state nucleon to the first two odd-parity excitations. Through a comparison with constituent quark model calculations of these amplitudes, these new results give important insight into the structure of these excitations. This work is a critical step towards confronting experimental electroproduction amplitudes for the $N^*(1535)$ and $N^*(1650)$ resonances with ab-initio lattice QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Novel first-order phase transition and critical points in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory with spatial compactification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and phase structure of $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory on $\mathbb{T}^2\times\mathbb{R}^2$ in Euclidean spacetime in an effective-model approach. The model incorporates two Polyakov loops along two compactified directions as dynamical variables, and is constructed to reproduce thermodynamics on $\mathbb{T}^2\times\mathbb{R}^2$ measured on the lattice. The model analysis indicates the existence of a novel first-order phase transition on $\mathbb{T}^2\times\mathbb{R}^2$ in the deconfined phase, which terminates at critical points that should belong to the two-dimensional $Z_2$ universality class. We argue that the interplay of the Polyakov loops induced by their cross term in the Polyakov-loop potential is responsible for the manifestation of the first-order transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the time-momentum representation of the kernel needed to compute hadronic vacuum polarization contributions to the muon $g$-$2$ in the space-like region at next-to-leading order. For small values of the time, we present analytical series expansions; for large values of the time, we present numerical series expansions which overcome the problems showed by na\"ive asymptotic expansions. These results are to be employed in lattice QCD determinations of hadronic vacuum polarization contributions to the muon $g$-$2$ at next-to-leading order.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of pion from top-down holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational form factors (GFFs) of pions are calculated from a top-down holographic quantum chromodynamics (QCD) approach with momentum transfer dependence for the first time. It is important because the GFFs of hadrons have information on the internal stress distribution that may provide insight into the mechanism of how QCD forms hadrons. The forward limit value of this GFFs, i.e. the D-term, was also obtained. Furthermore, in this approach, we observe the so-called glueball dominance, in which pions have gravitational interactions via infinite glueball spectra.</description>
