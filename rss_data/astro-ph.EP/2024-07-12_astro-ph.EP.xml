      <title>Sulphur dioxide in the mid-infrared transmission spectrum of WASP-39b</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent inference of sulphur dioxide (SO$_2$) in the atmosphere of the hot ($\sim$1100 K), Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39b from near-infrared JWST observations suggests that photochemistry is a key process in high temperature exoplanet atmospheres. This is due to the low ($&lt;$1 ppb) abundance of SO$_2$ under thermochemical equilibrium, compared to that produced from the photochemistry of H$_2$O and H$_2$S (1-10 ppm). However, the SO$_2$ inference was made from a single, small molecular feature in the transmission spectrum of WASP-39b at 4.05 $\mu$m, and therefore the detection of other SO$_2$ absorption bands at different wavelengths is needed to better constrain the SO$_2$ abundance. Here we report the detection of SO$_2$ spectral features at 7.7 and 8.5 $\mu$m in the 5-12 $\mu$m transmission spectrum of WASP-39b measured by the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Low Resolution Spectrometer (LRS). Our observations suggest an abundance of SO$_2$ of 0.5-25 ppm (1$\sigma$ range), consistent with previous findings. In addition to SO$_2$, we find broad water vapour absorption features, as well as an unexplained decrease in the transit depth at wavelengths longer than 10 $\mu$m. Fitting the spectrum with a grid of atmospheric forward models, we derive an atmospheric heavy element content (metallicity) for WASP-39b of $\sim$7.1-8.0 $\times$ solar and demonstrate that photochemistry shapes the spectra of WASP-39b across a broad wavelength range.</description>

      <title>The Lowell Observatory Solar Telescope: A fiber feed into the EXtreme PREcision Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The signal induced by a temperate, terrestrial planet orbiting a Sun-like star is an order of magnitude smaller than the host stars' intrinsic variability. Understanding stellar activity is, therefore, a fundamental obstacle in confirming the smallest exoplanets. We present the Lowell Observatory Solar Telescope (LOST), a solar feed for the EXtreme PREcision Spectrometer (EXPRES) at the 4.3-m Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT). EXPRES is one of the newest high-resolution spectrographs that accurately measure extreme radial velocity. With LOST/EXPRES, we observe disk-integrated sunlight autonomously throughout the day. In clear conditions, we achieve a ~137,500 optical spectrum of the Sun with a signal-to-noise of 500 in ~150s. Data is reduced using the standard EXPRES pipeline with minimal modification to ensure the data are comparable to the observations of other stars with the LDT. During the first three years of operation, we find a daily RMS of 71 cm/s. Additionally, having two EPRV spectrometers located in Arizona gives us an unprecedented opportunity to benchmark the performance of these planet-finders. We find a RMS of just 55 cm/s when comparing data taken simultaneously with EXPRES and NEID.</description>

      <title>Rossby Wave Instability and Substructure Formation in 3D Non-Ideal MHD Wind-Launching Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rings and gaps are routinely observed in the dust continuum emission of protoplanetary discs (PPDs). How they form and evolve remains debated. Previous studies have demonstrated the possibility of spontaneous gas rings and gaps formation in wind-launching disks. Here, we show that such gas substructures are unstable to the Rossby Wave Instability (RWI) through numerical simulations. Specifically, shorter wavelength azimuthal modes develop earlier, and longer wavelength ones dominate later, forming elongated (arc-like) anti-cyclonic vortices in the rings and (strongly magnetized) cyclonic vortices in the gaps that persist until the end of the simulation. Highly elongated vortices with aspect ratios of 10 or more are found to decay with time in our non-ideal MHD simulation, in contrast with the hydro case. This difference could be caused by magnetically induced motions, particularly strong meridional circulations with large values of the azimuthal component of the vorticity, which may be incompatible with the columnar structure preferred by vortices. The cyclonic and anti-cyclonic RWI vortices saturate at moderate levels, modifying but not destroying the rings and gaps in the radial gas distribution of the disk. In particular, they do not shut off the poloidal magnetic flux accumulation in low-density regions and the characteristic meridional flow patterns that are crucial to the ring and gap formation in wind-launching disks. Nevertheless, the RWI and their associated vortices open up the possibility of producing non-axisymmetric dust features observed in a small fraction of protoplanetary disks through non-ideal MHD, although detailed dust treatment is needed to explore this possibility.</description>

      <title>Gaia DR3 asteroid reflectance spectra: L-type families, memberships, and ages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) contains reflectance spectra at visible wavelengths for 60,518 asteroids over the range between 374-1034 nm, representing a large sample that is well suited to studies of asteroid families. We want to assess the potential of Gaia spectra in identifying asteroid family members. Here, we focus on two L-type families, namely Tirela/Klumpkea and Watsonia. These families are known for their connection to Barbarian asteroids, which are potentially abundant in calcium-aluminum rich inclusions (CAIs). Our method is based (1) on a color taxonomy specifically built on Gaia data and (2) the similarity of spectra of candidate members with the template spectrum of a specific family. We identified objects in the halo of Tirela/Klumpkea, along with possible interlopers. We also found an independent group of eight asteroids erroneously linked to the family by the hierarchical clustering method (HCM). Consequently, the knowledge of the size distribution of the family has been significantly improved, with a more consistent shape at the larger end. The Watsonia family is a more intricate case, mainly due to its smaller size and the less marked difference between the spectral types of the background and of the family members. However, the spectral selection helps identify objects that were not seen by HCM, including a cluster separated from the family core by a resonance. For both families, the V-shape is better defined, leading to a revised age estimation based on the memberships established mainly from spectral properties. Our work demonstrates the advantage of combining the classical HCM approach to spectral properties obtained by Gaia for the study of asteroid families. Future data releases are expected to further expand the capabilities in this domain</description>

      <title>There is no disk mass budget problem of planet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inferred dust masses from Class II protoplanetary disk observations are lower than or equal to the masses of the observed exoplanet systems. This poses the question of how planets form if their natal environments do not contain enough mass. This hypothesis has entered the literature as the "mass budget problem" of planet formation. We utilize numerical simulations of planet formation via pebble and gas accretion, including migration, in a viscously evolving protoplanetary disk, while tracing the time evolution of the dust mass. As expected, we find that the presence of a giant planet in the disk can influence the evolution of the disk itself and prevent rapid dust mass loss by trapping the dust outside its orbit. Early formation is crucial for giant planet formation, as we found in our previous work; therefore, our findings strengthen the hypothesis that planet formation has already occurred or is ongoing in Class II disks. Most importantly, we find that the optically thin dust mass significantly underestimates the total dust mass in the presence of a dust-trapping deep gap. We also show that the beam convolution would smear out the feature from a deep gap, especially if the planet forms in the inner disk. Such hidden dust mass, along with early planet formation, could be the answer to the hypothetical mass budget problem.</description>

      <title>Enhancing 3D Planetary Atmosphere Simulations with a Surrogate Radiative Transfer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces an approach to enhancing the computational efficiency of 3D atmospheric simulations by integrating a machine-learned surrogate model into the OASIS global circulation model (GCM). Traditional GCMs, which are based on repeatedly numerically integrating physical equations governing atmospheric processes across a series of time-steps, are time-intensive, leading to compromises in spatial and temporal resolution of simulations. This research improves upon this limitation, enabling higher resolution simulations within practical timeframes. Speeding up 3D simulations holds significant implications in multiple domains. Firstly, it facilitates the integration of 3D models into exoplanet inference pipelines, allowing for robust characterisation of exoplanets from a previously unseen wealth of data anticipated from JWST and post-JWST instruments. Secondly, acceleration of 3D models will enable higher resolution atmospheric simulations of Earth and Solar System planets, enabling more detailed insights into their atmospheric physics and chemistry. Our method replaces the radiative transfer module in OASIS with a recurrent neural network-based model trained on simulation inputs and outputs. Radiative transfer is typically one of the slowest components of a GCM, thus providing the largest scope for overall model speed-up. The surrogate model was trained and tested on the specific test case of the Venusian atmosphere, to benchmark the utility of this approach in the case of non-terrestrial atmospheres. This approach yields promising results, with the surrogate-integrated GCM demonstrating above 99.0% accuracy and 101 factor GPU speed-up of the entire simulation compared to using the matched original GCM under Venus-like conditions.</description>

      <title>L-band nulling interferometry at the VLTI with Asgard/NOTT: status and plans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NOTT (formerly Hi-5) is the L'-band (3.5-4.0~microns) nulling interferometer of Asgard, an instrument suite in preparation for the VLTI visitor focus. The primary scientific objectives of NOTT include characterizing (i) young planetary systems near the snow line, a critical region for giant planet formation, and (ii) nearby main-sequence stars close to the habitable zone, with a focus on detecting exozodiacal dust that could obscure Earth-like planets. In 2023-2024, the final warm optics have been procured and assembled in a new laboratory at KU Leuven. First fringes and null measurements were obtained using a Gallium Lanthanum Sulfide (GLS) photonic chip that was also tested at cryogenic temperatures. In this paper, we present an overall update of the NOTT project with a particular focus on the cold mechanical design, the first results in the laboratory with the final NOTT warm optics, and the ongoing Asgard integration activities. We also report on other ongoing activities such as the characterization of the photonic chip (GLS, LiNbO3, SiO), the development of the exoplanet science case, the design of the dispersion control module, and the progress with the self-calibration data reduction software.</description>

      <title>Precise Bolometric Luminosities and Effective Temperatures of 23 late-T and Y dwarfs Obtained with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present infrared spectral energy distributions of 23 late-type T and Y dwarfs obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope. The spectral energy distributions consist of NIRSpec PRISM and MIRI LRS spectra covering the $\sim$1--12 $\mu$m wavelength range at $\lambda/ \Delta \lambda \approx 100$ and broadband photometry at 15, 18, and 21 $\mu$m. The spectra exhibit absorption features common to these objects including H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO, CO$_2$, and NH$_3$. Interestingly, while the spectral morphology changes relatively smoothly with spectral type at $\lambda &lt; 3$ $\mu$m and $\lambda &gt; 8$ $\mu$m, it shows no clear trend in the 5 $\mu$m region where a large fraction of the flux emerges. The broad wavelength coverage of the data enables us to compute the first accurate measurements of the bolometric fluxes of cool brown dwarfs. Combining these bolometric fluxes with parallaxes from Spitzer and HST, we also obtain the first accurate bolometric luminosities of these cool dwarfs. We then used the Sonora Bobcat solar metallicity evolutionary models to estimate the radii of the dwarfs which results in effective temperature estimates ranging from $\sim$1000 to 350 K with a median uncertainty of $\pm$20 K which is nearly an order of magnitude improvement over previous work. We also discuss how various portions of the spectra either do or do not exhibit a clear sequence when ordered by their effective temperatures.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation mechanism of quasihalo orbit from Lissajous orbit in the restricted three-body problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a general analytical method to describe the center manifolds of collinear libration points in the Restricted Three-body Problem (RTBP). It is well-known that these center manifolds include Lissajous orbits, halo orbits, and quasihalo orbits. Previous studies have traditionally treated these orbits separately by iteratively constructing high-order series solutions using the Lindstedt-Poincar\'e method. Instead of relying on resonance between their frequencies, this study identifies that halo and quasihalo orbits arise due to intricate coupling interactions between in-plane and out-of-plane motions. To characterize this coupling effect, a novel concept, coupling coefficient $\eta$, is introduced in the RTBP, incorporating the coupling term $\eta \Delta x$ in the $z$-direction dynamics equation, where $\Delta$ represents a formal power series concerning the amplitudes. Subsequently, a uniform series solution for these orbits is constructed up to a specified order using the Lindstedt-Poincar\'e method. For any given paired in-plane and out-of-plane amplitudes, the coupling coefficient $\eta$ is determined by the bifurcation equation $\Delta = 0$. When $\eta$ = 0, the proposed solution describes Lissajous orbits around libration points. As $\eta$ transitions from zero to non-zero values, the solution describes quasihalo orbits, which bifurcate from Lissajous orbits. Particularly, halo orbits bifurcate from planar Lyapunov orbits if the out-of-plane amplitude is zero. The proposed method provides a unified framework for understanding these intricate orbital behaviors in the RTBP.</description>

      <title>A link between the size and composition of comets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All cometary nuclei that formed in the early Solar System incorporated radionuclides and therefore were subject to internal radiogenic heating. Previous work predicts that if comets have a pebble-pile structure internal temperature build-up is enhanced due to very low thermal conductivity, leading to internal differentiation. An internal thermal gradient causes widespread sublimation and migration of either ice condensates, or gases released from amorphous ice hosts during their crystallisation. Overall, the models predict that the degree of differentiation and re-distribution of volatile species to a shallower near-surface layer depends primarily on nucleus size. Hence, we hypothesise that cometary activity should reveal a correlation between the abundance of volatile species and the size of the nucleus. To explore this hypothesis we have conducted a thorough literature search for measurements of the composition and size of cometary nuclei, compiling these into a unified database. We report a statistically significant correlation between the measured abundance of CO/H$_{2}$O and the size of cometary nuclei. We further recover the measured slope of abundance as a function of size, using a theoretical model based on our previous thermophysical models, invoking re-entrapment of outward migrating high volatility gases in the near-surface pristine amorphous ice layers. This model replicates the observed trend and supports the theory of internal differentiation of cometary nuclei by early radiogenic heating. We make our database available for future studies, and we advocate for collection of more measurements to allow more precise and statistically significant analyses to be conducted in the future.</description>

      <title>The 18 May 2024 Iberian superbolide from a sunskirting orbit: USG space sensors and ground-based independent observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15024v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On 18 May 2024, a superbolide traversed the western part of the Iberian Peninsula, culminating its flight over the Atlantic Ocean and generating significant media attention. This event was caused by a weak carbonaceous meteoroid of 1 m, entering the atmosphere at 40.4 km$\,$s$^{-1}$ with an average slope of 8.5$^\circ$. The luminous phase started at 133 km and ended at an altitude of 54 km. The meteoroid's heliocentric orbit had an inclination of 16.4$^\circ$, a high eccentricity of 0.952, a semi-major axis of 2.4 au, and a short perihelion distance of 0.12 au. The superbolide was recorded by multiple ground-based stations of the Spanish Meteor Network (SPMN) and the European Space Agency (ESA), as well as by the U.S. Government (USG) sensors from space. Due to the absence of observable deceleration, we successfully reconciled satellite radiometric data with a purely dynamic atmospheric flight model, constraining the meteoroid's mass and coherently fitting its velocity profile. Our analysis shows a good agreement with the radiant and velocity data reported by the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), with a deviation of 0.56$^\circ$ and 0.1 km$\,$s$^{-1}$, respectively. The presence of detached fragments in the lower part of the luminous trajectory suggests that the meteoroid was a polymict carbonaceous chondrite, containing higher-strength macroscopic particles in its interior due to collisional gardening, or a thermally processed C-type asteroid. The orbital elements indicate that the most likely source is the Jupiter-Family Comet (JFC) region, aligning with the SOHO comet family, as its sunskirting orbit is decoupled from Jupiter. This event provides important information to characterize the disruption mechanism of near-Sun objects.</description>

Abstract: Most stars form in multiple systems whose properties can significantly impact circumstellar disk evolution. We investigate the physical and chemical properties of the equal-mass, small separation (~66 mas, ~9 au) DF Tau binary system. Previous observations indicated that only DF Tau A has a circumstellar disk. We present JWST-MIRI MRS observations of DF Tau. The MIRI spectrum shows a forest of H2O lines and emission from CO, C2H2, HCN, CO2, and OH. LTE slab models are used to determine the properties of the gas, and we analyze high angular spatial and spectral resolution data from ALMA, VLTI-GRAVITY, and IRTF-iSHELL to aid in the interpretation of the JWST data. The 1.3 mm ALMA continuum data show two equal-brightness sources of compact (R&lt;3 au) emission, with separations and movement consistent with astrometry from VLTI-GRAVITY and the known orbit. This is interpreted as a robust detection of a disk around DF Tau B, which we suggest may host a small (~1 au) cavity to reconcile all observations. The disk around DF Tau A is expected to be a full disk, and spatially and spectrally resolved dust and gas emission points to hot, close-in (&lt;0.2 au) material. Hot (~500-1000 K) H2O, HCN, and C2H2 emission in the MIRI data likely originate in the DF Tau A disk, while a cold (&lt;200 K) H2O component with an extended emitting area is consistent with an origin from both disks. Despite the very compact outer disks, the inner disk composition and conditions are similar to isolated systems, suggesting that the close binary nature is not a driving factor in setting the inner disk chemistry. However, constraining the geometry of the disks, for instance, via higher resolution ALMA observations, would provide additional insight into the mid-infrared gas emission. JWST observations of spatially resolved binaries will be important for understanding the impact of binarity on inner disk chemistry more generally.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Approach to Detecting Albedo Anomalies on the Lunar Surface</title>

Abstract: This study introduces a data-driven approach using machine learning (ML) techniques to explore and predict albedo anomalies on the Moon's surface. The research leverages diverse planetary datasets, including high-spatial-resolution albedo maps and element maps (LPFe, LPK, LPTh, LPTi) derived from laser and gamma-ray measurements. The primary objective is to identify relationships between chemical elements and albedo, thereby expanding our understanding of planetary surfaces and offering predictive capabilities for areas with incomplete datasets. To bridge the gap in resolution between the albedo and element maps, we employ Gaussian blurring techniques, including an innovative adaptive Gaussian blur. Our methodology culminates in the deployment of an Extreme Gradient Boosting Regression Model, optimized to predict full albedo based on elemental composition. Furthermore, we present an interactive analytical tool to visualize prediction errors, delineating their spatial and chemical characteristics. The findings not only pave the way for a more comprehensive understanding of the Moon's surface but also provide a framework for similar studies on other celestial bodies.</description>

      <title>Achieving Quantum Limits of Exoplanet Detection and Localization</title>

Abstract: Discovering exoplanets in orbit around distant stars via direct imaging is fundamentally impeded by the high dynamic range between the star and the planet. Coronagraphs strive to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of exoplanet signatures by optically rejecting light from the host star while leaving light from the exoplanet mostly unaltered. However it is unclear whether coronagraphs constitute an optimal strategy for attaining fundamental limits relevant exoplanet discovery. In this work, we report the quantum information limits of exoplanet detection and localization specified by the Quantum Chernoff Exponent (QCE) and the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) respectively. In view of these quantum limits, we assess and compare several high-performance coronagraph designs that theoretically achieve total rejection of an on-axis point source. We find that systems which exclusively eliminate the fundamental mode of the telescope, without attenuating higher-order orthogonal modes, are quantum-optimal in the regime of high star-planet contrasts. Importantly, the QFIM is shown to persist well below the diffraction-limit of the telescope, suggesting that quantum-optimal coronagraphs may further expand the domain of accessible exoplanets.</description>
