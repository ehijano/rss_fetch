      <title>DecompDiff: Diffusion Models with Decomposed Priors for Structure-Based Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing 3D ligands within a target binding site is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Existing structured-based drug design methods treat all ligand atoms equally, which ignores different roles of atoms in the ligand for drug design and can be less efficient for exploring the large drug-like molecule space. In this paper, inspired by the convention in pharmaceutical practice, we decompose the ligand molecule into two parts, namely arms and scaffold, and propose a new diffusion model, DecompDiff, with decomposed priors over arms and scaffold. In order to facilitate the decomposed generation and improve the properties of the generated molecules, we incorporate both bond diffusion in the model and additional validity guidance in the sampling phase. Extensive experiments on CrossDocked2020 show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating high-affinity molecules while maintaining proper molecular properties and conformational stability, with up to -8.39 Avg. Vina Dock score and 24.5 Success Rate. The code is provided at https://github.com/bytedance/DecompDiff</description>

      <title>ProtLLM: An Interleaved Protein-Language LLM with Protein-as-Word Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose ProtLLM, a versatile cross-modal large language model (LLM) for both protein-centric and protein-language tasks. ProtLLM features a unique dynamic protein mounting mechanism, enabling it to handle complex inputs where the natural language text is interspersed with an arbitrary number of proteins. Besides, we propose the protein-as-word language modeling approach to train ProtLLM. By developing a specialized protein vocabulary, we equip the model with the capability to predict not just natural language but also proteins from a vast pool of candidates. Additionally, we construct a large-scale interleaved protein-text dataset, named InterPT, for pre-training. This dataset comprehensively encompasses both (1) structured data sources like protein annotations and (2) unstructured data sources like biological research papers, thereby endowing ProtLLM with crucial knowledge for understanding proteins. We evaluate ProtLLM on classic supervised protein-centric tasks and explore its novel protein-language applications. Experimental results demonstrate that ProtLLM not only achieves superior performance against protein-specialized baselines on protein-centric tasks but also induces zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities on protein-language tasks.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed generative model for drug-like molecule conformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a diffusion-based, generative model for conformer generation. Our model is focused on the reproduction of bonded structure and is constructed from the associated terms traditionally found in classical force fields to ensure a physically relevant representation. Techniques in deep learning are used to infer atom typing and geometric parameters from a training set. Conformer sampling is achieved by taking advantage of recent advancements in diffusion-based generation. By training on large, synthetic data sets of diverse, drug-like molecules optimized with the semiempirical GFN2-xTB method, high accuracy is achieved for bonded parameters, exceeding that of conventional, knowledge-based methods. Results are also compared to experimental structures from the Protein Databank (PDB) and Cambridge Structural Database (CSD).</description>

      <title>Representing Molecules as Random Walks Over Interpretable Grammars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research in molecular discovery has primarily been devoted to small, drug-like molecules, leaving many similarly important applications in material design without adequate technology. These applications often rely on more complex molecular structures with fewer examples that are carefully designed using known substructures. We propose a data-efficient and interpretable model for representing and reasoning over such molecules in terms of graph grammars that explicitly describe the hierarchical design space featuring motifs to be the design basis. We present a novel representation in the form of random walks over the design space, which facilitates both molecule generation and property prediction. We demonstrate clear advantages over existing methods in terms of performance, efficiency, and synthesizability of predicted molecules, and we provide detailed insights into the method's chemical interpretability.</description>

      <title>MoleculeQA: A Dataset to Evaluate Factual Accuracy in Molecular Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models are playing an increasingly significant role in molecular research, yet existing models often generate erroneous information, posing challenges to accurate molecular comprehension. Traditional evaluation metrics for generated content fail to assess a model's accuracy in molecular understanding. To rectify the absence of factual evaluation, we present MoleculeQA, a novel question answering (QA) dataset which possesses 62K QA pairs over 23K molecules. Each QA pair, composed of a manual question, a positive option and three negative options, has consistent semantics with a molecular description from authoritative molecular corpus. MoleculeQA is not only the first benchmark for molecular factual bias evaluation but also the largest QA dataset for molecular research. A comprehensive evaluation on MoleculeQA for existing molecular LLMs exposes their deficiencies in specific areas and pinpoints several particularly crucial factors for molecular understanding.</description>

      <title>Modern approaches to improving phase contrast electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although defocus can be used to generate partial phase contrast in transmission electron microscope images, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) can be further improved by the development of phase plates which increase contrast by applying a phase shift to the unscattered part of the electron beam. Many approaches have been investigated, including the ponderomotive interaction between light and electrons. We review the recent successes achieved with this method in high-resolution, single-particle cryo-EM. We also review the status of using pulsed or near-field enhanced laser light as alternatives, along with approaches that use scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with a segmented detector rather than a phase plate.</description>

      <title>Assembly Theory is a weak version of algorithmic complexity based on LZ compression that does not explain or quantify selection or evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Assembly Theory, pathway complexity, the assembly index, and the assembly number are subsumed and constitute a weak version of algorithmic (Kolmogorov-Solomonoff-Chaitin) complexity reliant on an approximation method based upon statistical compression, their results obtained due to the use of methods strictly equivalent to the LZ family of compression algorithms used in compressing algorithms such as ZIP, GZIP, or JPEG. Such popular algorithms have been shown to empirically reproduce the results of AT's assembly index and their use had already been reported in successful application to separating organic from non-organic molecules, and the study of selection and evolution. Here we exhibit and prove the connections and full equivalence of Assembly Theory to Shannon Entropy and statistical compression, and AT's disconnection as a statistical approach from causality. We demonstrate that formulating a traditional statistically compressed description of molecules, or the theory underlying it, does not imply an explanation or quantification of biases in generative (physical or biological) processes, including those brought about by selection and evolution, when lacking in logical consistency and empirical evidence. We argue that in their basic arguments, the authors of AT conflate how objects may assemble with causal directionality, and conclude that Assembly Theory does nothing to explain selection or evolution beyond known and previously established connections, some of which are reviewed.</description>
