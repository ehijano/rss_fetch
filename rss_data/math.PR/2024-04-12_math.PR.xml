      <title>Pointwise two-point function estimates and a non-pertubative proof of mean-field critical behaviour for long-range percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In long-range percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, we connect each pair of distinct points $x$ and $y$ by an edge independently at random with probability $1-\exp(-\beta\|x-y\|^{-d-\alpha})$, where $\alpha&gt;0$ is fixed and $\beta\geq 0$ is a parameter. In a previous paper, we proved that if $0&lt;\alpha&lt;d$ then the critical two-point function satisfies the spatially averaged upper bound \[ \frac{1}{r^d}\sum_{x\in [-r,r]^d} \mathbb{P}_{\beta_c}(0\leftrightarrow x) \preceq r^{-d+\alpha} \] for every $r\geq 1$. This upper bound is believed to be sharp for values of $\alpha$ strictly below the crossover value $\alpha_c(d)$, and a matching lower bound for $\alpha&lt;1$ was proven by B\"aumler and Berger (AIHP 2022). In this paper, we prove pointwise upper and lower bounds of the same order under the same assumption that $\alpha&lt;1$. We also prove analogous two-sided pointwise estimates on the slightly subcritical two-point function under the same hypotheses, interpolating between $\| x \|^{-d+\alpha}$ decay below the correlation length and $\| x \|^{-d-\alpha}$ decay above the correlation length. In dimensions $d=1,2,3$, we deduce that the triangle condition holds under the minimal assumption that $0&lt;\alpha&lt;d/3$. While this result had previously been established under additional perturbative assumptions using the lace expansion, our proof is completely non-perturbative and does not rely on the lace expansion in any way. In dimensions $1$ and $2$ our results also treat the marginal case $\alpha=d/3$, implying that the triangle diagram diverges at most logarithmically and hence that mean-field critical behaviour holds to within polylogarithmic factors.</description>

      <title>A complete characterization of a correlated Bernoulli process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete characterization of the asymptotic behaviour of a correlated Bernoulli sequence { which depends on the parameter $\theta \in [0,1]$. A martingale theory based approach will allow} us to prove versions of the law of large numbers, quadratic strong law, law of iterated logarithm, almost sure central limit theorem and functional central limit theorem, in the case $\theta \le 1/2$. For $\theta &gt; 1/2$, we will obtain a strong convergence to a non-degenerated random variable, including a central limit theorem and a law of iterated logarithm for the fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Approximation of non-linear SPDEs with additive noise via weighted interacting particles systems: the stochastic McKean-Vlasov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the problem of approximating non-linear Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) via interacting particle systems. In particular, we consider the Stochastic McKean-Vlasov equation, which is the McKean-Vlasov (MKV) PDE, perturbed by additive trace class noise. As is well-known, the MKV PDE can be obtained as mean field limit of the empirical measure of a stochastic system of interacting particles, where particles are subject to independent sources of noise. There is now a natural question, which is the one we consider and answer in this paper: can we obtain the SMKV equation, i.e. additive perturbations of the MKV PDE, as limit of interacting particle systems? It turns out that, in order to obtain the SMKV equation, one needs to study weighted empirical measures of particles, where the particles evolve according to a system of SDEs with independent noise, while the weights are time evolving and subject to common noise. The work of this manuscript therefore complements and contributes to various streams of literature, in particular: i) much attention in the community is currently devoted to obtaining SPDEs as scaling limits of appropriate dynamics; this paper contributes to a complementary stream, which is devoted to obtaining representations of SPDE through limits of empirical measures of interacting particle systems; ii) since the literature on limits of weighted empirical measures is often constrained to the case of static (random or deterministic) weights, this paper contributes to further expanding this line of research to the case of time-evolving weights.</description>

      <title>Poisson imbedding meets the Clark-Ocone formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a representation formula of Clark-Ocone type for any integrable Poisson functionals, which extends the Poisson imbedding for point processes. This representation formula differs from the classical Clark-Ocone formula on three accounts. First the representation holds with respect to the Poisson measure instead of the compensated one; second the representation holds true in L1 and not in L2; and finally contrary to the classical Clark-Ocone formula the integrand is defined as a pathwise operator and not as a L2-limiting object. We make use of Malliavin's calculus and of the pseudo-chaotic decomposition with uncompensated iteraded integrals to establish this Pseudo-Clark-Ocone representation formula and to characterize the integrand, which turns out to be a predictable integrable process.</description>

      <title>Statistical Independence and the Brockwell Transform -- From an Integral Equation Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical independence is a notion ubiquitous in various fields such as in statistics, probability, number theory and physics. We establish the stability of independence for any pair of random variables by their corresponding Brockwell transforms (Brockwell, 2007) beyond the non-atomic condition that is naturally imposed on their distributions, thereby generalizing the proposition originated by Cai et al. (2022). A central novelty in our work is to formulate the problem as a possibly new type of mathematical inverse problem, which aims to claim that an integral equation has a unique solution in terms of its stochastic kernel -- not under-determined contrary to the usual cases, and also to design a recursive constructive scheme, combined with the property of the quantile function, that solves the aforementioned integral equation in an iterative manner.</description>

      <title>Stein's method and a cubic mean-field model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a mean-field spin model with three- and two-body interactions. In a recent paper by Contucci, Mingione and Osabutey, the equilibrium measure for large volumes was shown to have three pure states, two with opposite magnetization and an unpolarized one with zero magnetization, merging at the critical point. The authors proved a central limit theorem for the suitably rescaled magnetization. The aim of our paper is presenting a prove of a central limit theorem for the rescaled magnetization applying the exchangeable pair approach due to Stein. Moreover we prove (non-uniform) Berry-Esseen bounds, a concentration inequality, Cram\'er-type moderate deviations and a moderate deviations principle for the suitably rescaled magnetization. Interestingly we analyze Berry-Esseen bounds in case the model-parameters $(K_n,J_n)$ converge to the critical point $(0,1)$ on lines with different slopes and with a certain speed, and obtain new limiting distributions and thresholds for the speed of convergence.</description>

      <title>Glauber dynamics for the hard-core model on bounded-degree $H$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hard-core model has as its configurations the independent sets of some graph instance $G$. The probability distribution on independent sets is controlled by a `fugacity' $\lambda&gt;0$, with higher $\lambda$ leading to denser configurations. We investigate the mixing time of Glauber (single-site) dynamics for the hard-core model on restricted classes of bounded-degree graphs in which a particular graph $H$ is excluded as an induced subgraph. If $H$ is a subdivided claw then, for all $\lambda$, the mixing time is $O(n\log n)$, where $n$ is the order of $G$. This extends a result of Chen and Gu for claw-free graphs. When $H$ is a path, the set of possible instances is finite. For all other $H$, the mixing time is exponential in $n$ for sufficiently large $\lambda$, depending on $H$ and the maximum degree of $G$.</description>

      <title>A martingale approach to Gaussian fluctuations and laws of iterated logarithm for Ewens-Pitman model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ewens-Pitman model refers to a distribution for exchangeable random partitions of $[n]=\{1,\ldots,n\}$, which is indexed by a pair of parameters $\alpha\in[0,1)$ and $\theta&gt;-\alpha$, with $\alpha=0$ corresponding to the celebrated Ewens model in population genetics. The large $n$ asymptotic properties of the Ewens-Pitman model have been the subject of numerous studies, with the focus being on the number $K_{n}$ of partition sets and the number $K_{r,n}$ of partition sets that appear $r$ times, for $r=1,\ldots,n$. While for $\alpha=0$ asymptotic results have been obtained in terms of almost-sure convergence and Gaussian fluctuations, for $\alpha\in(0,1)$ only almost-sure convergences are available, with the proof for $K_{r,m}$ being given only as a sketch. In this paper, we make use of martingales to develop a unified and comprehensive treatment of the large $n$ asymptotic behaviours of $K_{n}$ and $K_{r,n}$ for $\alpha\in(0,1)$, providing alternative, and rigorous, proofs of the almost-sure convergences of $K_{n}$ and $K_{r,n}$, and covering the gap of Gaussian fluctuations. We also obtain new laws of the iterated logarithm for $K_{n}$ and $K_{r,n}$.</description>

      <title>$(\log t)^\frac{2}{3}$-superdiffusivity for the 2d stochastic Burgers equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stochastic Burgers equation was introduced in [H. van Beijeren, R. Kutner and H. Spohn, Excess noise for driven diffusive systems, PRL, 1985] as a continuous approximation of the fluctuations of the asymmetric simple exclusion process. It is formally given by $$\partial_t\eta =\frac{1}{2}\Delta\eta+ \mathfrak w\cdot\nabla(\eta^2) + \nabla\cdot\xi,$$ where $\xi$ is $d$-dimensional space time white noise and $\mathfrak w$ is a fixed non-zero vector. In the critical dimension $d=2$ at stationarity, we show that this system exhibits superdiffusve behaviour: more specifically, its bulk diffusion coefficient behaves like $(\log t)^\frac23$, in a Tauberian sense, up to $\log\log\log t$ corrections. This confirms a prediction made in the physics literature and complements [G. Cannizzarro, M. Gubinelli, F. Toninelli, Gaussian Fluctuations for the stochastic Burgers equation in dimension $d\geq 2$, CMP, 2024], where the same equation was studied in the weak-coupling regime. Furthermore this model can be seen as a continuous analogue to [H.T. Yau, $(\log t)^\frac{2}{3}$ law of the two dimensional asymmetric simple exclusion process, Annals of Mathematics, 2004].</description>

      <title>Bootstrap percolation is local</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metastability thresholds lie at the heart of bootstrap percolation theory. Yet proving precise lower bounds is notoriously hard. We show that for two of the most classical models, two-neighbour and Frob\"ose, upper bounds are sharp to essentially arbitrary precision, by linking them to their local counterparts.
  In Frob\"ose bootstrap percolation, iteratively, any vertex of the square lattice that is the only healthy vertex of a $1\times1$ square becomes infected and infections never heal. We prove that if vertices are initially infected independently with probability $p\to0$, then with high probability the origin becomes infected after \[\exp\left(\frac{\pi^2}{6p}-\frac{\pi\sqrt{2+\sqrt2}}{\sqrt p}+\frac{O(\log^2(1/p))}{\sqrt[3]p}\right)\] time steps. We achieve this by proposing a new paradigmatic view on bootstrap percolation based on locality. Namely, we show that studying the Frob\"ose model is equivalent in an extremely strong sense to studying its local version. As a result, we completely bypass Holroyd's classical but technical hierarchy method, yielding the first term above and systematically used throughout bootstrap percolation for the last two decades. Instead, the proof features novel links to large deviation theory, eigenvalue perturbations and others.
  We also use the locality viewpoint to resolve the so-called bootstrap percolation paradox. Indeed, we propose and implement an exact (deterministic) algorithm which exponentially outperforms previous Monte Carlo approaches. This allows us to clearly showcase and quantify the slow convergence we prove rigorously.
  The same approach applies, with more extensive computations, to the two-neighbour model, in which vertices are infected when they have at least two infected neighbours and do not recover. We expect it to be applicable to a wider range of models and correspondingly conclude with a number of open problems.</description>

      <title>Frogs, hats and common subsequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Write $W^{(n)}$ to mean the $n$-letter word obtained by repeating a fixed word $W$ and let $R_n$ denote a uniformly random $n$-letter word sampled from the same alphabet as $W$. We are interested in the average length of the longest common subsequence between $W^{(n)}$ and $R_n$, which is known to be $\gamma(W)\cdot n+o(n)$ for some constant $\gamma(W)$. Bukh and Cox recently developed an interacting particle system, dubbed the frog dynamics, which can be used to compute the constant $\gamma(W)$ for any fixed word $W$. They successfully analyzed the simplest case of the frog dynamics to find an explicit formula for the constants $\gamma(12\cdots k)$. We continue this study by using the frog dynamics to find an explicit formula for the constants $\gamma(12\cdots kk\cdots 21)$. The frog dynamics in this case is a variation of the PushTASEP on the ring where some clocks are identical. Interestingly, exclusion processes with correlated clocks of this type appear to have not been analyzed before. Our analysis leads to a seemingly new combinatorial object which could be of independent interest: frogs with hats!</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ruelle's transfer operator plays an important role in understanding thermodynamic and probabilistic properties of dynamical systems. In this work, we develop a method of finding eigenfunctions of transfer operators based on comparing Gibbs measures on the half-line $\mathbb Z_+$ and the whole line $\Z$. For a rather broad class of potentials, including both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic long-range Dyson potentials, we are able to establish the existence of integrable, but not necessarily continuous, eigenfunctions. For a subset thereof we prove that the eigenfunction is actually continuous.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic estimates of the diameters of the Rubik's Cube groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diameter of the Cayley graph of the Rubik's Cube group is the fewest number of turns needed to solve the Cube from any initial configurations. For the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube, the diameter is 11 in the half-turn metric, 14 in the quarter-turn metric, 19 in the semi-quarter-turn metric, and 10 in the bi-quarter-turn metric. For the 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cube, the diameter was determined by Rikicki et al. to be 20 in the half-turn metric and 26 in the quarter-turn metric. This study shows that a modified version of the coupon collector's problem in probabilistic theory can predict the diameters correctly for both 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes insofar as the quarter-turn metric is adopted. In the half-turn metric, the diameters are overestimated by one and two, respectively, for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes, whereas for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube in the semi-quarter-turn and bi-quarter-turn metrics, they are overestimated by two and underestimated by one, respectively. Invoking the same probabilistic logic, the diameters of the 4$\times$4$\times$4 and 5$\times$5$\times$5 Cubes are predicted to be 48 (41) and 68 (58) in the quarter-turn (half-turn) metric, whose precise determinations are far beyond reach of classical supercomputing. It is shown that the probabilistically estimated diameter is accurately approximated by $\ln N / \ln r + \ln N / r$, where $N$ is the number of configurations and $r$ is the branching ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph independence (also known as $\epsilon$-independence or $\lambda$-independence) is a mixture of classical independence and free independence corresponding to graph products or groups and operator algebras. Using conjugation by certain random permutation matrices, we construct random matrix models for graph independence with amalgamation over the diagonal matrices. This yields a new probabilist,ic proof that graph products of sofic groups are sofic.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of the present work is to expand substantially the type of control and estimation problems that can be addressed following the paradigm of Schr\"odinger bridges, by incorporating stopping (freezing) of a given stochastic flow. Specifically, in the context of estimation, we seek the most likely evolution realizing prescribed spatio-temporal marginals of stopped particles. In the context of control, we seek the control action directing the stochastic flow toward spatio-temporal probabilistic constraints. To this end, we derive a new Schr\"odinger system of coupled, in space and time, partial differential equations to construct the solution of the proposed problem. Further, we show that a Fortet-Sinkhorn type of algorithm is, once again, available to attain the associated bridge. A key feature of the framework is that the obtained bridge retains the Markovian structure in the prior process, and thereby, the corresponding control action takes the form of state feedback.</description>

      <title>Correspondence Research of the Most Probable Transition Paths between a Stochastic Interacting Particle System and its Mean Field Limit System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper derived the indirect approximation theorem of the most probable transition pathway of a stochastic interacting particle system in the mean field sense. This paper studied the problem of indirect approximation of the most probable transition pathway of an interacting particle system (i.e., a high-dimensional stochastic dynamic system) and its mean field limit equation (McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation). This study is based on the Onsager-Machlup action functional, reformulated the problem as an optimal control problem. With the stochastic Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, this paper completed the derivation. This paper proved the existence and uniqueness theorem of the solution to the mean field optimal control problem of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations, and also established a system of equations satisfying the control parameters $\theta^{*}$ and $\theta^{N}$ respectively. There are few studies on the most probable transition pathways of stochastic interacting particle systems, it is still a great challenge to solve the most probable transition pathways directly or to approximate it with the mean field limit system. Therefore, this paper first gave the proof of correspondence between the core equation of Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, that is, Hamiltonian extreme condition equation. That is to say, this correspondence indirectly explain the correspondence between the most probable transition pathways of stochastic interacting particle systems and the mean field systems.</description>

Abstract: We study Nevai's condition from the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the real line. We prove that a large class of measures with unbounded Jacobi parameters satisfies Nevai's condition locally uniformly on the support of the measure away from a finite explicit set. This allows us to give applications to relative uniform and weak asymptotics of Christoffel-Darboux kernel on the diagonal and to limit theorems of unconventionally normalized global linear statistics of orthogonal polynomial ensembles.</description>

      <title>Approximation of Random Evolution Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an abstract framework to obtain convergence rates for the approximation of random evolution equations corresponding to a random family of forms determined by finite-dimensional noise. The full discretisation error in space, time, and randomness is considered, where polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is used for the semi-discretisation in randomness. The main result are regularity conditions on the random forms under which convergence of polynomial order in randomness is obtained depending on the smoothness of the coefficients and the Sobolev regularity of the initial value. In space and time, the same convergence rates as in the deterministic setting are achieved. To this end, we derive error estimates for vector-valued PCE as well as a quantified version of the Trotter-Kato theorem for form-induced semigroups.</description>

      <title>Path Cohomology of Locally Finite Digraphs,Hodge's Theorem and the $p$-Lazy Random Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.04781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of Markov chains on discrete spaces, such as digraphs, has captivated mathematicians in recent decades due to its interconnectedness with topology, geometry, dynamics, spectral theory, and differential equations. Furthermore, extensive exploration of these multifaceted relationships has been pursued for their practical utility in diverse fields, including machine learning and image segmentation. In recent times, these interrelations have been generalized to higher dimensions within the framework of finite-dimensional simplicial complexes.
  In this paper, we embark on a further extension of these concepts. Initially, we introduce a cohomology of infinite (though locally finite) digraphs in arbitrary dimensions. Subsequently, in the latter portion of this manuscript, we define a fresh family of Laplace operators and conduct an examination of their spectrum, culminating in the proof of the Hodge Decomposition Theorem within this framework. Finally, we conclude by presenting a Markov chain, the $p$-Lazy Random Walk, whose asymptotic behavior is intrinsically linked to these cohomologies, while its mixing time is related to the the spectrum of our Laplace operators.
  This development opens doors to numerous unexplored questions, particularly regarding potential generalizations of the Ollivier-Ricci curvature to this topology and these Laplacians.</description>

Abstract: We prove sharp pointwise heat kernel estimates for symmetric Markov processes associated with symmetric Dirichlet forms that are local with respect to some coordinates and nonlocal with respect to the remaining coordinates. The main theorem is a robustness result like the famous estimate for the fundamental solution of second order differential operators, obtained by Donald G. Aronson. Analogous to his result, we show that the corresponding translation-invariant process and the one given by the general Dirichlet form share the same pointwise points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.03323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study the large population limit of a binary branching particle system with Moran type interactions: we introduce a new model where particles evolve, reproduce and die independently and, with a probability that may depend on the configuration of the whole system, the death of a particle may trigger the reproduction of another particle, while a branching event may trigger the death of an other one. We study the occupation measure of the new model, explicitly relating it to the Feynman-Kac semigroup of the underlying Markov evolution and quantifying the L2 distance between their normalisations. This model extends the fixed size Moran type interacting particle system discussed in [18, 19, 6, 7, 57] and we will indeed show that our model outperforms the latter when used to approximate a birth and death process. We discuss several other applications of our model including the neutron transport equation [36, 15] and population size dynamics.</description>

      <title>Discordant edges for the voter model on regular random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.01037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the two-opinion voter model on a regular random graph with n vertices and degree $d \geq 3$. It is known that consensus is reached on time scale n and that on this time scale the volume of the set of vertices with one opinion evolves as a Fisher-Wright diffusion. We are interested in the evolution of the number of discordant edges (i.e., edges linking vertices with different opinions), which can be thought as the perimeter of the set of vertices with one opinion, and is the key observable capturing how consensus is reached. We show that if initially the two opinions are drawn independently from a Bernoulli distribution with parameter $u \in (0, 1)$, then on time scale 1 the fraction of discordant edges decreases and stabilises to a value that depends on d and u, and is related to the meeting time of two random walks on an infinite tree of degree d starting from two neighbouring vertices. Moreover, we show that on time scale n the fraction of discordant edges moves away from the constant plateau and converges to zero in an exponential fashion. Our proofs exploit the classical dual system of coalescing random walks and use ideas from Cooper et al. (2010) built on the so-called First Visit Time Lemma. We further introduce a novel technique to derive concentration properties from weak-dependence of coalescing random walks on moderate time scales.</description>

Abstract: A central limit theorem is established for a sum of random variables belonging to a sequence of random fields. The fields are assumed to have zero mean conditional on the past history and to satisfy certain conditional $\alpha$-mixing conditions in space or time. The limiting normal distribution is obtained for increasing spatial domain or increasing length of the sequence. The applicability of the theorem is demonstrated by examples regarding estimating functions for a space-time point process and a space-time Markov process.</description>

Abstract: We consider non-homogeneous random walks on the positive quadrant in two dimensions. In the 1960's the following question was asked: is it true if such a random walk $X$ is recurrent and $Y$ is another random walk that at every point is more likely to go down and more likely to go left than $Y$, then $Y$ is also recurrent?
  We provide an example showing that the answer is negative. We also show that if either the random walk $X$ or $Y$ is sufficiently homogeneous then the answer is in fact positive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploiting the explicit bijection between the density of singular values and the density of eigenvalues for bi-unitarily invariant complex random matrix ensembles of finite matrix size we aim at finding the induced probability measure on $j$ eigenvalues and $k$ singular values that we coin $j,k$-point correlation measure. We fully derive all $j,k$-point correlation measures in the simplest cases for matrices of size $n=1$ and $n=2$. For $n&gt;2$, we find a general formula for the $1,1$-point correlation measure. This formula reduces drastically when assuming the singular values are drawn from a polynomial ensemble, yielding an explicit formula in terms of the kernel corresponding to the singular value statistics. These expressions simplify even further when the singular values are drawn from a P\'{o}lya ensemble and extend known results between the eigenvalue and singular value statistics of the corresponding bi-unitarily invariant ensemble.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by insurance applications, we propose a new approach for the validation of real-world economic scenarios. This approach is based on the statistical test developed by Chevyrev and Oberhauser (2022) and relies on the notions of signature and maximum mean distance. This test allows to check whether two samples of stochastic processes paths come from the same distribution. Our contribution is to apply this test to a variety of stochastic processes exhibiting different pathwise properties (H{\"o}lder regularity, autocorrelation, regime switches) and which are relevant for the modelling of stock prices and stock volatility as well as of inflation in view of actuarial applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian mixture block models are distributions over graphs that strive to model modern networks: to generate a graph from such a model, we associate each vertex $i$ with a latent feature vector $u_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ sampled from a mixture of Gaussians, and we add edge $(i,j)$ if and only if the feature vectors are sufficiently similar, in that $\langle u_i,u_j \rangle \ge \tau$ for a pre-specified threshold $\tau$. The different components of the Gaussian mixture represent the fact that there may be different types of nodes with different distributions over features -- for example, in a social network each component represents the different attributes of a distinct community. Natural algorithmic tasks associated with these networks are embedding (recovering the latent feature vectors) and clustering (grouping nodes by their mixture component).
  In this paper we initiate the study of clustering and embedding graphs sampled from high-dimensional Gaussian mixture block models, where the dimension of the latent feature vectors $d\to \infty$ as the size of the network $n \to \infty$. This high-dimensional setting is most appropriate in the context of modern networks, in which we think of the latent feature space as being high-dimensional. We analyze the performance of canonical spectral clustering and embedding algorithms for such graphs in the case of 2-component spherical Gaussian mixtures, and begin to sketch out the information-computation landscape for clustering and embedding in these models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To characterize the function space explored by neural networks (NNs) is an important aspect of learning theory. In this work, noticing that a multi-layer NN generates implicitly a hierarchy of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) - named a neural Hilbert ladder (NHL) - we define the function space as an infinite union of RKHSs, which generalizes the existing Barron space theory of two-layer NNs. We then establish several theoretical properties of the new space. First, we prove a correspondence between functions expressed by L-layer NNs and those belonging to L-level NHLs. Second, we prove generalization guarantees for learning an NHL with a controlled complexity measure. Third, we derive a non-Markovian dynamics of random fields that governs the evolution of the NHL which is induced by the training of multi-layer NNs in an infinite-width mean-field limit. Fourth, we show examples of depth separation in NHLs under the ReLU activation function. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the feature learning aspect of NN training through the lens of NHLs.</description>

      <title>On non-negative auto-correlated integer demand processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Methods to generate realistic non-stationary demand scenarios are a key component for analyzing and optimizing decision policies in supply chains. Typical forecasting techniques recommended in standard inventory control textbooks consist of some form of simple exponential smoothing (SES) for both the estimates for the mean and standard deviation. We study demand generating processes (DGPs) that yield non-stationary demand scenarios, and that are consistent with SES, meaning that SES yields unbiased estimates when applied to the generated demand scenarios. As demand in typical practical settings is discrete and non-negative, we study consistent DGPs on the non-negative integers. We derive conditions under which the existence of such DGPs can be guaranteed, and propose a specific DGP that yields autocorrelated, discrete demands when these conditions are satisfied.
  Our subsequent simulation study gains further insights into the proposed DGP. It demonstrates that from a given initial forecast, our DGPs yields a diverse set of demand scenarios with a wide range of properties. To show the applicability of the DGP, we apply it to generate demand in a standard inventory problem with full backlogging and a positive lead time. We find that appropriate dynamic base-stock levels can be obtained using a new and relatively simple algorithm, and we demonstrate that this algorithm outperforms relevant benchmarks.</description>
