      <title>How large can the Light Quark Yukawa couplings be?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate models that can induce significant modifications to the couplings of first- and second-generation quarks with Higgs bosons. Specifically, we identify all simplified models featuring two vector-like quark states which can lead to substantial enhancements in these couplings. In addition, these models generate operators in Standard Model Effective Field Theory, both at tree-level and one-loop, that are constrained by electroweak precision and Higgs data. We show how to evade constraints from flavour physics and consider direct searches for vector-like quarks. Ultimately, we demonstrate that viable ultraviolet models can be found with first-generation quark Yukawa couplings enhanced by several hundred times their Standard Model value, while the Higgs couplings to charm (strange) quarks can be increased by factors of a few (few tens). Given the importance of electroweak precision data in constraining these models, we also discuss projections for future measurements at the Tera-$Z$ FCC-ee machine.</description>

      <title>Real Singlet Scalar Benchmarks in the Multi-TeV Resonance Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar extensions of the Standard Model are of much interest at the LHC and future colliders. In particular, these models can give rise to resonant di-Higgs production and alter the Higgs trilinear coupling. In this paper, we study di-Higgs production in the Standard Model extended by a real scalar singlet with no additional symmetries. We determine how large the resonant di-Higgs rate and variation in the Higgs trilinear coupling can be in four scenarios: current LHC results and projected results at the HL-LHC, the HL-LHC combined with a circular $e^-e^+$ collider such as the CEPC or FCC-ee, and the HL-LHC combined with a linear $e^-e^+$ collider such as the ILC. While these are updated results from a previous study using current LHC data, we go further and find benchmark points in the multi-TeV resonance regime for future colliders beyond the HL-LHC. Considering current LHC results, the resonant di-Higgs rate can still be an order of magnitude larger than the SM predicted di-Higgs rate. In the HL-LHC scenario, the Higgs trilinear coupling can still be a factor of three larger than the SM prediction for resonance masses in the $1.5-3.5$ TeV range, where resonant searches may have less reach. This enhancement is just at the projected 2$\sigma$ sensitivity of the HL-LHC. We find there are resonance masses for which the change in the Higgs trilinear is maximized while the resonant rate is negligible. We provide an analytical understanding of these effects with a discussion on the interplay of various constraints on the parameter space and the Higgs trilinear coupling.</description>

      <title>Light scalar quarkonia from Laplace sum rule at NLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review our results on light scalar quarkonia ($\bar{q}q$ and four-quark states) from (inverse) QCD Laplace sum rules (LSR) and their ratios ${\cal R}$ within stability criteria and including higher order perturbative (PT) corrections up to the (estimated) ${\mathcal O}(\alpha_{s}^{5})$. As the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) usually converges for $D\leqslant 6-8$, we evaluated the QCD spectral functions at Lowest Order (LO) of PT QCD and up to the $D=6$ dimension vaccum condensates. We request that the optimal results obey the constraint: Pole (Resonance) contribution to the spectral integral is larger than the QCD continuum one which excludes an on-shell mass around $(500-600)$MeV obtained for values of the QCD continuum threshold $t_c\leqslant(1\sim 1.5)$ GeV$^2$. Our results for the different assignments of the scalar mesons are compiled in Tables 1 to 3</description>

      <title>Quantum Tomography at Colliders: With or Without Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interpretation of groups of particle spins at colliders as quantum states has opened up the possibility of using colliders for quantum information. While most efforts have focused on utilizing the decays of the particles to infer their spins to reconstruct the quantum density matrix, we show that the production kinematics of the particles provides sufficient information about the spins to establish quantum tomography without using the decays. We perform a comparative study, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of using this "kinematic approach" relative to the usual "decay approach." Since the kinematic approach leverages the simplicity of scattering kinematics, this approach promises to achieve the optimal statistical results for quantum tomography at colliders.</description>

      <title>Consistent chiral limit in on-shell renormalized quark-meson model with ChPT scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) predicted scaling of the pion,~kaon decay constants $f_{\pi}, f_{K} $ and $M_{\eta}^2 = m_{\eta}^2 + m_{\eta^{\prime}}^2 $ has been used in the renormalized $2+1$ flavor quark-meson (RQM) model,~to find a consistent path to chiral limit as the $\pi \ \text{and} \ K $ meson masses approach zero.~The left side of the Columbia plot is generated free from any ambiguity or heuiristic adjustment in the model parameter fixing away from the physical point. The on-shell renormalization of parameters and consistent treatment of the divergent quark one-loop vacuum fluctuations in the RQM model,~make the axial $U_{A}(1)$ anomaly significantly stronger and the light (strange) explicit chiral symmetry breaking strength becomes weaker by a small (relatively large) amount.~The first order chiral transition region in the $m_{\pi}-m_{K}$ and $\mu-m_{K}$ planes of Columbia plot,~increases due to the above novel features of the RQM model.~Comparing the softening effect of quark one-loop vacuum fluctuation on the chiral transition,~it looks overestimated in a recent functional renormalization group study.</description>

      <title>The forward-backward asymmetry induced $CP$ asymmetry in ${\overline{B}}^{0}\rightarrow K^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{0}$ in phase space around the resonances ${\overline{K}}^{*}(892)^{0}$ and ${\overline{K}}^{*}_{0}(700)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interference between amplitudes corresponding to different intermediate resonances plays an important role in generating large CP asymmetries in phase space in multi-body decays of bottom and charmed mesons. In this paper, we study the CP violation in the decay channel ${\overline{B}}^{0}\rightarrow K^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{0}$ in phase space region where the intermediate resonances $\overline{K}^{*}(892)^{0}$ and ${\overline{K}^{*}_{0}(700)}$ dominate. The Forward-Backward Asymmetry (FBA) and the CP asymmetry induced by FBA (FB-CPA), which are closely related to the interference effects between the two aforementioned resonances, are especially investigated. The correlation of the behaviour of FBA and FB-CPA with the relative strong phase between the amplitude is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Can a pseudoscalar with a mass of 365 GeV in two-Higgs-doublet models explain the CMS $t\bar{t}$ excess?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the recently reported $t\bar{t}$ excess by the CMS Collaboration within the framework of conventional Two-Higgs-Doublet Models (2HDMs). Considering all four types (I, II, X, and Y), we perform a comprehensive parameter space scan using the best-fit values for a pseudoscalar boson $A$: $M_A = 365$ GeV, $\Gamma_A/M_A = 2\%$, and $\tan\beta = 1.28$. Theoretical requirements and experimental constraints are systematically applied, including conditions from a bounded-below scalar potential, vacuum stability, unitarity, perturbativity, Flavor-Changing Neutral Currents (FCNCs), and direct searches at high-energy colliders. Our analysis shows that perturbativity imposes upper bounds of around 723 GeV on $M_{H^\pm}$ and $M_H$. FCNC constraints exclude all viable parameter space in Types II and Y, while a small region persists in Types I and X, but this region is ultimately ruled out by recent $t\bar{t} Z$ measurements by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at the LHC. We conclude that conventional 2HDMs alone cannot accommodate a pseudoscalar boson that explains the observed $t\bar{t}$ excess within viable parameter space. However, incorporating toponium effects in the background fit could potentially alter this conclusion.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from cosmic strings in Froggatt-Nielsen flavour models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GW) are a powerful probe of the earliest moments in the Universe, enabling us to test fundamental interactions at energy scales beyond the reach of laboratory experiments. In this work, we assess the GW capability to probe the origin of the flavour sector of the Standard Model (SM). Within the context of Froggatt-Nielsen models of fermion masses and mixing based on a gauged $U(1)$ flavour symmetry, we investigate the formation of cosmic strings and the resulting stochastic GW background (GWB), estimating the sensitivity to the model's parameter space of future GW experiments. Comparing these results with the bounds from low-energy flavour observables, we find that these two types of experimental probes of the model are nicely complementary. Flavour physics observables can probe low to intermediate symmetry-breaking scales $v_\phi$, while future GW experiments are sensitive to the opposite regime, for which the string tension is large enough to yield sizeable GW signals, and in the long run can set an upper limit on the scale as stringent as $v_\phi \lesssim 10^9$ GeV. In certain scenarios, the combination of flavour constraints and future GW bounds can bring about a complete closure of the available parameter space, which illustrates how GWB searches can play an important role in testing the origin of the SM flavour sector even if that occurs at ultra-high energies.</description>

      <title>Almost general analysis of CKM and MNS matrices for hierarchical Yukawa matrices and distinguishability of CP phases by Hyper-Kamiokande experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we perform an almost general analysis of flavor mixing matrices to investigate the discriminative power of CP phases by the next-generation neutrino oscillation experiments. %. As an assumption, we neglect the 1-3 mixing of diagonalization for more hierarchical fermions $u,e$. Thus there are two sources of CP violation in the flavor mixing matrices, the intrinsic CP phase $\delta_{d, \nu}$ in diagonalization of less hierarchical fermions $d, \nu$ and relative phases between two unitary matrices. By eliminating unphysical phases and imposing constraints on the three measured mixing angles, two phases and the 1-2 mixing of more hierarchical fermions $s_{u, e}$ remain free parameters.
  For sufficiently small 1-2 mixing $s_{e}$ of charged leptons, the Dirac phase $\delta$ is almost identical to the intrinsic phase of neutrinos $\delta_{\nu}$. Therefore, future detection of the Dirac phase by the Hyper-Kamiokande experiment indicates the observation of $\delta_{\nu}$. On the other hand, if such a CP violation is not observed, an upper limit is placed on a combination of $\delta_{\nu}$ and relative phases.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopy correlation functions and mass distributions from production experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the relation between the Koonin-Pratt femtoscopic correlation function (CF) and invariant mass distributions from production experiments. We show that the equivalence is total for a zero source-size and that a Gaussian finite-size source provides a form-factor for the virtual production of the particles. Motivated by this remarkable relationship, we study an alternative method to the Koonin-Pratt formula, which connects the evaluation of the CF directly with the production mechanisms. The differences arise mostly from the $T$-matrix quadratic terms and increase with the source size. We study the case of the $D^0 D^{\ast +}$ and $D^+ D^{\ast 0}$ correlation functions of interest to unravel the dynamics of the exotic $T_ {cc}(3875)^+$, and find that these differences become quite sizable already for 1 fm sources. We nevertheless conclude that the lack of coherence in high-multiplicity-event reactions and in the creation of the fire-ball source that emits the hadrons certainly make much more realistic the formalism based on the Koonin-Pratt equation. We finally derive an improved Lednicky-Lyuboshits (LL) approach, which implements a Lorentz ultraviolet regulator that corrects the pathological behaviour of the LL CF in the punctual source-size limit.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Sensitivity to Seesaw Predictions in Gauged $B-L$ Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New gauge bosons coupled to heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) are simple and well-motivated extensions of the Standard Model. In searches for HNLs in proton fixed-target experiments, we find that a large population of gauge bosons ($Z^\prime$) produced by proton bremsstrahlung may decay to HNLs, leading to a significant improvement in existing bounds on the ($m_{HNL}, U_{\alpha}$), where $U_\alpha$ represent the mixing between HNL and the active neutrinos with flavor $\alpha$. We study this possibility in fixed target experiments with the 8 GeV proton beams, including SBND, MicroBooNE, and ICARUS, as well as DUNE and DarkQuest at 120 GeV. We find the projected sensitivities to additional $Z^\prime$-mediated HNL production can bring the seesaw mechanism of the neutrino masses within a broadened experimental reach.</description>

      <title>Prospects for sub-EW ALP searches via $\gamma+b\bar{b}$ signatures at the LHC using jet substructure techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data show no clear indication of new physics and only incremental improvements are anticipated at the energy frontier in the near future. However, while the focus of the LHC has been on constraining TeV scale physics, new particles could still be hiding below the electroweak scale. In order to obtain sensitivity to a new light boson with couplings to SM fermions, a potentially promising decay channel, for resonances with mass $\gtrsim {\cal O}(10)$ GeV, would be the decay to $b\bar b$ pairs. The measurement of such signatures is challenging due to the trigger requirements at the LHC. In this work, we explore the LHC sensitivity to a light pseudoscalar, or axion-like particle (ALP), in the $b\bar{b}$ final state with an associated photon, using jet substructure techniques, in the mass range between 10 GeV and 100 GeV. We obtain projected exclusions on the ALP-fermion coupling in a region of phase space which has not so far been probed by direct searches. We further discuss the impact that lower trigger thresholds may have on the LHC reach.</description>

      <title>Rapid Methods for Modeling Overdensities of Massive Neutrinos and Other Non-Cold Relics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the potentially detectable gravitational-lensing effect of neutrino halos on cosmic-microwave-background (CMB) fluctuations with upcoming instruments like SO, CMB-S4, and CMB-HD. Accurate modeling of neutrino-halo density profiles are essential for making theory predictions of their cosmological effects. Yet, they are computationally intensive, particularly in the nonlinear regime. In this work, we present an efficient numerical framework for computing neutrino profiles based on N-1-body simulations within a flat FRW Universe. Our approach enables highly parallelized, rapid calculations of neutrino trajectories near spherically symmetric dark-matter halos, delivering results within seconds. In addition to neutrinos, we demonstrate an application to model the clustering of other non-cold relics, such as a freeze-in dark-matter component. The framework is flexible in its definitions of cosmological and dark-matter-halo parameters, which can be particularly valuable for rapid-scanning tasks. It can also seamlessly incorporate new physics, as we demonstrate with examples of a time-varying gravitational constant and nonstandard neutrino phase-space distributions.</description>

      <title>Hole in the Deuteron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new observable, $A_{node}$, that allows to isolate the node in the S-partial wave distribution of the deuteron in high $Q^2$ electro-disintegration processes with tensor polarized target. The node is a signature of nuclear repulsive core and represents a crucial test of its strength, size as well as the role of the relativistic and non-nucleonic effects in a deeply bound state. Within plane wave impulse approximation the node immitates a ``hole" through which incoming probe passes through without interaction. It is demonstrated that high $Q^2$ electro-disintegration processes due to their strong anisotropy of final state interaction effects, allow to gain an unprecedented access to the node, opening up a new venue in probing elusive dynamics of the nuclear repulsive core.</description>

In particular, the ground state masses of $\Omega_{llQ}\Omega_{llQ}, \Omega_{QlQ}\Omega_{llQ}$ and $\Omega_{QlQ}\Omega_{QlQ}$ states are computed and compared with their respective lowest non-interacting energy levels, where the flavor $Q \in (c,b)$ denotes charm and bottom quarks, and the other flavor $l \in {s,c,b}$ represents strange, charm and bottom, respectively. Considering their valence quark structures, these hadrons could be thought of as the heavy flavor analogues of spin-singlet nucleon-nucleon states. The gauge configurations employed in this study are HISQ ensembles with $N_f = 2+1+1$ flavors, generated by the MILC collaboration, at four lattice spacings, namely $a=0.1207, 0.0888, 0.0582$ and $0.0448$ fm. The aforementioned states are also computed at different quark masses, between $m_s \le m_l \le m_b$, including at unphysical heavy quark masses, to explore the quark mass dependence of any possible binding. For the dibaryon states $\Omega_{bbc}\Omega_{bbc}, \Omega_{ccb}\Omega_{ccb}$ and $\Omega_{ccb} \Omega_{bbc}$, we find a clear evidence of an energy level below their respective non-interacting energy levels. In addition, for these dibaryons at quark masses $m_c &lt; m_l \le m_b$, a trend is found where the gap, between the lowest energy levels and the respective lowest non-interacting levels, increases as the quark mass $m_l$ increases. We also study the heavy quark spin-symmetry and its breaking for these heavy dibaryons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the non-Gaussian corrections to the energy density and anisotropies of gravitational waves induced after an ultra-slow-roll phase of inflation by using a diagrammatic approach, and present the corresponding Feynman rules. Our two-loop calculation includes both the intrinsic non-Gaussianity of the inflaton perturbation $\delta\phi$ and the non-Gaussianity arising from the nonlinear relation between the latter and the curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}$. We apply our formalism to an analytical model in which the ultra-slow-roll phase is followed by a constant-roll stage with a nonvanishing second slow-roll parameter $\eta$, and address the renormalization of the one-loop scalar power spectrum in this scenario.</description>

      <title>Correlating $B\to K^{(\ast)} \nu\bar{\nu}$ and flavor anomalies in SMEFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent measurement of $\mathcal{B}(B^+\to K^+\nu\bar{\nu})$ by Belle-II reveals a $2.8~\sigma$ deviation from the Standard Model (SM) prediction. Combining this with a prior Belle measurement of $\mathcal{B}(B^{0}\to K^{\ast0}\nu\bar{\nu})$, the upper bound of the ratio $\mathcal{B}(B^{0}\to K^{\ast0}\nu\bar{\nu})/\mathcal{B}(B^+\to K^+\nu\bar{\nu})$ is notably smaller than the SM prediction. In this work, tensions are solved within the framework of Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Flavor observables, described by Low-Energy Effective Field Theory (LEFT) operators, are interconnected by SMEFT at the electroweak scale. Utilizing a set of only four SMEFT operators, the FCNC process $b\to s\nu\bar{\nu}$ is correlated with $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$, $b\to u_i\ell\bar{\nu}$, $u_j\to s\ell\bar{\nu}$, $u_j\to u_i\nu\bar{\nu}$, and $u_j\to u_i\ell^+\ell^-$. Subsequently, we obtain the latest ranges of Wilson coefficients for these four operators through a global fit that accommodates flavor anomalies such as $R_{K^{(\ast)}}$, $R_{D^{(\ast)}}$, and $\mathcal{B}(B\to K^{(\ast)}\nu\bar{\nu})$. Our findings reveal that predictions for $\mathcal{B}(B^+\to \tau^+\nu_\tau)$ and $\mathcal{B}(D_s^+\to \tau^+\nu_\tau)$ align well with measured values from Belle and BESIII, based on the fitted coefficients. The predicted branching fraction for $B^0\to K^{\ast0}\nu\bar{\nu}$ is $(1.42\pm 0.74)\times 10^{-5}$, closely approaching the current experimental upper limit. Anticipation surrounds the rare decay $B_s\to \tau^+ \tau^-$, expected in the near future with a branching fraction on the order of $10^{-4}$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the possibility of disentangling different new physics contributions to the rare meson decays $K\rightarrow\pi+\displaystyle{\not}E$ and $B\rightarrow K(K^*)+\displaystyle{\not}E$ through kinematic distributions in the missing energy $\displaystyle{\not}E$. We employ dimension-$6$ operators within the Low-Energy Effective Field Theory (LEFT), identifying the invisible part of the final state as either active or sterile neutrinos. Special emphasis is given to lepton-number violating (LNV) operators with scalar and tensor currents. We show analytically that contributions from scalar, vector, and tensor quark currents can be uniquely determined from experimental data of kinematic distributions. In addition, we present new correlations of branching ratios for $K$ and $B$-decays involving scalar and tensor currents. As there could a priori also be new invisible particles in the final states, we include dark-sector operators giving rise to two dark scalars, fermions, or vectors in the final state. In this context, we present new calculations of the inclusive decay rate $B\rightarrow X_s+\displaystyle{\not}E$ for dark operators. We show that careful measurements of kinematic distributions make it theoretically possible to disentangle the contribution from LEFT operators from most of the dark-sector operators, even when multiple operators are contributing. We revisit sum rules for vector currents in LEFT and show that the latter are also satisfied in some new dark-physics scenarios that could mimic LEFT. Finally, we point out that an excess in rare meson decays consistent with a LNV hypothesis would point towards highly flavor non-democratic physics in the UV, and could put high-scale leptogenesis under tension.</description>

      <title>Quantum tomography with $\tau$ leptons at the FCC-ee</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Future Circular Collider (FCC) -- in its first incarnation as a lepton collider -- will produce, according to the proposed design, more than 100 billion pairs of $\tau$ leptons after working for four years at the energy of the $Z$-boson resonance. The $\tau$ lepton is special because its relatively long lifetime makes it possible to reconstruct the momenta of neutrinos emitted in the single pion decay mode. The resulting large number of events is an ideal source for a full quantum tomography of the process that will test quantum entanglement and the violation of Bell inequality with unprecedented precision. In addition, the study of polarizations and spin correlations can provide a competitive determination of the Weinberg angle $ \theta_W$ and constrain possible anomalous couplings in the neutral electroweak current. We utilize analytic results and Monte Carlo simulations to explore to what extent these goals might be accomplished.</description>

Abstract: Reaching a high precision of the top quark mass is an important task of the Large Hadron Collider. We perform a feasibility study of measuring the top quark mass through the three-point energy correlator. The expected sensitivity of the top quark mass in the boosted regime is presented. We further introduce its application to the low top $p_\text{T}$ regime and demonstrate that both the W boson and the top quark masses could be extracted from this single observable. Compared to traditional observables, the energy correlator shows robustness to uncertainties that usually dominate experimental measurements and provides a promising way to improve experimental precision.</description>

      <title>Observable gravitational waves and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ with global lepton number symmetry and dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the possibility of testing a dark matter (DM) scenario embedded in a global lepton number symmetry $U(1)_L$ via gravitational waves (GW) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. The spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_L$ symmetry generates the seesaw scale as well as DM mass dynamically. The (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson, known as majoron, acquires non-zero mass due to soft symmetry breaking terms of quadratic type in the scalar potential, which eventually breaks $U(1)_L$ to its $Z_2$ subgroup. The spontaneous symmetry breaking, which effectively breaks $Z_2$, leads to the formation of domain walls (DW), posing a threat to successful cosmology, if allowed to dominate. As gravity does not respect any global symmetries, we consider higher dimensional operators suppressed by the scale of quantum gravity (QG) namely, $\Lambda_{\rm QG}$ which introduces the required bias leading to DW annihilation and emission of stochastic gravitational waves (GW) observable at near future experiments. The same operators also lead to decay of DM bringing interesting indirect detection aspects. While DM is produced non-thermally via scalar portal interactions, light majoron can give rise to additional $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ within reach of future CMB experiments.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high Frequency Gravitational Waves from Scattering, Bremsstrahlung and Decay during Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate ultra-high frequency gravitational waves (GWs) from gravitons generated during inflationary reheating. Specifically, we study inflaton scattering with its decay product, where the couplings involved in this $2 \to 2$ scattering are the same as those in the $1 \to 3$ graviton Bremsstrahlung process. We compute the graviton production rate via such $2 \to 2$ scattering. Additionally, we compare the resulting GW spectrum with that from Bremsstrahlung as well as that from pure $2 \to 2$ inflaton scatterings. For completeness, the GW spectrum from graviton pair production through one-loop induced $1 \to 2$ inflaton decay is also analyzed. With a systematic comparison among the four sources of GWs, we find that $2 \to 2$ inflaton scattering with its decay product can dominate over Bremsstrahlung if the reheating temperature is larger than the inflaton mass. Pure inflaton $2 \to 2$ scattering is typically subdominant compared to Bremsstrahlung except in the high-frequency tail. The contribution from one-loop induced $1 \to 2$ inflaton decay is shown to be suppressed compared to Bremsstrahlung and pure inflaton $2 \to 2$ scattering.</description>

      <title>Induced Domain Walls of QCD Axion, and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that heavy axion domain walls induce domain walls of the QCD axion through a mixing between the heavy axion and the QCD axion, even when the pre-inflationary initial condition is assumed for the QCD axion. The induced domain walls arise because the effective $\theta$ parameter changes across the heavy axion domain walls, shifting the potential minimum of the QCD axion. When the heavy axion domain walls collapse, the induced QCD axion domain walls collapse as well. This novel mechanism for producing the QCD axions can explain dark matter even with the axion decay constant as small as ${\cal O}(10^{9})$ GeV. In particular, this scenario requires domain wall collapse near the QCD crossover, potentially accounting for the stochastic gravitational wave background suggested by recent pulsar timing array observations, including NANOGrav. Using this mechanism, it is also possible to easily create induced domain walls for string axions or axions with a large decay constant, which would otherwise be challenging. We also comment on the implications for cosmic birefringence using induced axion domain walls.</description>

Abstract: The hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to $(g-2)_\mu$ can be determined via dispersive methods from $e^+e^-\to\;$hadrons data. We propose a novel approach to measure the hadronic cross section $\sigma_{\mathrm{had}}$ as an alternative to the initial-state radiation and energy scan techniques, which relies on positron annihilation off atomic electrons of a high $Z$ target ($^{238}$U, $Z=92$). We show that by leveraging the relativistic electron velocities of the inner atomic shells, a high-intensity $12\,$GeV positron beam, such as the one foreseen at JLab, can allow to measure $\sigma_{\mathrm{had}}$ with high statistical accuracy from the two-pion threshold up to above $\sqrt{s} \sim 1\,$GeV.</description>

Abstract: Historically studied in the context of heavy-ion collisions, the extent to which free nucleon-nucleon cross sections are modified in-medium remains undetermined by these data sets. Therefore, we investigate the impact of NN in-medium modifications on neutrino-nucleus cross section predictions using the GiBUU transport model. We find that including an in-medium lowering of the NN cross section and density dependence on $\Delta$ excitation improves agreement with MicroBooNE neutrino-argon scattering data. This is observed for both proton and neutral pion spectra in charged-current muon neutrino and neutral-current single pion production datasets. The impact of collision broadening of the $\Delta$ resonance is also investigated. The absence of $\Delta$ broadening is slightly favored, but the larger uncertainties on the pion production data prevent definitive conclusions.</description>

Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional version of the equation of state (EoS) model NEOS, NEOS-4D, as a function of the temperature and chemical potentials of baryon, electric charge, and strangeness for the hot and dense QCD matter created in relativistic nuclear collisions. This EoS enables multiple conserved charge current evolution in a relativistic fluid. Input from Lattice QCD simulations and a hadron resonance gas model is considered for constructing the equation of state. We investigate its applicability to the relativistic hydrodynamic description of nuclear collisions and present a method for efficient numerical implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological collider signals of primordial non-Gaussianity arise at tree level when an extra scalar has Hubble mass during inflation. We critically review the formalism finding that a large class of inflationary theories, based on Planck-scale physics, predict a scalar bi-spectrum around the gravitational floor level. This mild signal arises for example in $R^2$ gravity, in the regime where its gravitational scalar has Hubble-scale mass. Signals much above the gravitational floor arise in theories where scalars undergo multiple turns during inflation, thanks to sub-Planckian physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive framework for extracting the pole position and properties of the doubly-charmed tetraquark $T_{\rm cc}^+(3875)$ from lattice QCD data using the relativistic three-particle formalism. This approach incorporates the effect of the one-pion exchange diagram in $DD\pi$ and $DD^*$ scattering, making it applicable at energies coinciding with the left-hand cut in the partial-wave projected $DD^*$ amplitude. We present an example application of this framework to existing lattice QCD data at $m_\pi = 280$ MeV. We solve the integral equations describing the $DD\pi$ reaction, use LSZ reduction to determine the corresponding $DD^*$ amplitude, and find the values of the infinite-volume two- and three-body $K$ matrices that lead to agreement with lattice $DD^*$ phase shifts within their uncertainties. Using these $K$ matrices in the three-particle quantization condition, we describe the finite-volume $DD^*$ spectrum and find good agreement with the lattice QCD energies. Our results suggest that, at this pion mass, the tetraquark appears as a pair of subthreshold complex poles whose precise location strongly depends on the value of the $DD\pi$ three-particle $K$ matrix.</description>
