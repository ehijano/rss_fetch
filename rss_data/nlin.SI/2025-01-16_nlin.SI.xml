      <title>Isochronous oscillator with a singular position-dependent mass and its quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analysis of the equation $\ddot{x} - (1/2x) \dot{x}^2 + 2 \omega^2 x - 1/8x = 0$, where $\omega &gt; 0$ and $x = x(t)$ is a real-valued variable. We first discuss the appearance of this equation from a position-dependent-mass scenario in which the mass profile goes inversely with $x$, admitting a singularity at $x = 0$. The associated potential is also singular at $x = 0$, splitting the real axis into two halves, i.e., $x &gt; 0$ and $x &lt; 0$. The dynamics is exactly solvable for both the branches and so for definiteness, we stick to the $x &gt; 0$ branch. Performing a canonical quantization in the position representation and upon employing the ordering strategy of the kinetic-energy operator due to von Roos, we show that the problem is isospectral with the isotonic oscillator. Thus, the quantum spectrum consists of an infinite number of equispaced levels which is in line with the expectation that classical systems that support isochronous oscillations are associated in their quantized versions with equally-spaced spectra. The spacing between energy levels is found to be insensitive to the specific choices of the ambiguity parameters that are employed for ordering the kinetic-energy operator \`a la von Roos.</description>

      <title>Integrals and chaos in generalized H\'{e}non-Heiles Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the approximate (formal) integrals of motion in the Hamiltonian $ H = \frac{1}{2}\left( \dot{x}^2 + \dot{y}^2 + x^2 + y^2 \right) + \epsilon\,\left( xy^2 + \alpha x^3\right)$ which is an extension of the usual H\'{e}non-Heiles Hamiltonian that has $\alpha = -1/3$. We compare the theoretical surfaces of section (at $y=0$) with the exact surfaces of section calculated by integrating numerically many orbits. For small $\epsilon$, the invariant curves of the theoretical and the exact surfaces of section are close to each other, but for large $\epsilon$ there are differences. The most important is the appearance of chaos in the exact case, which becomes dominant as $\epsilon$ approaches the escape perturbation for $\alpha&lt;0$. We study in particular the cases $\alpha = 1/3$, which represents an integrable system, and $\alpha = 0$. Finally we examine the generation of chaos through the resonance overlap mechanism in the case $\alpha=-1/3$ (the original H\'{e}non-Heiles system) by showing both the homoclinic and the heteroclinic intersection of the asymptotic curves of the unstable periodic orbits.</description>

      <title>Integrable deformations of principal chiral model from solutions of associative Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe deformations of the classical principle chiral model and 1+1 Gaudin model related to ${\rm GL}_N$ Lie group. The deformations are generated by $R$-matrices satisfying the associative Yang-Baxter equation. Using the coefficients of the expansion for these $R$-matrices we derive equations of motion based on a certain ansatz for $U$-$V$ pair satisfying the Zakharov-Shabat equation. Another deformation comes from the twist function, which we identify with the cocentral charge in the affine Higgs bundle underlying the Hitchin approach to 2d integrable models.</description>

      <title>Reality conditions for sine-Gordon equation and quasi-periodic solutions in finite phase spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic solutions of the sine-Gordon equation are expressed in terms of $\wp_{1,2g-1}$-function, and reality conditions are completely determined. This new result
  leads to numerical computation and graphical representation of non-linear wave solutions. A way of obtaining finite-gap solutions by means of algebro-geometric integration is also explained, and a construction of the sine-Gordon hierarchy on coadjoint orbits of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ loop group is addressed.</description>

      <title>BKP-Affine Coordinates and Emergent Geometry of Generalized Br\'ezin-Gross-Witten Tau-Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following Zhou's framework, we consider the emergent geometry of the generalized Br\'ezin-Gross-Witten models whose partition functions are known to be a family of tau-functions of the BKP hierarchy. More precisely, we construct a spectral curve together with its special deformation, and show that the Eynard-Orantin topological recursion on this spectral curve emerges naturally from the Virasoro constraints for the generalized BGW tau-functions. Moreover, we give the explicit expressions for the BKP-affine coordinates of these tau-functions and their generating series. The BKP-affine coordinates and the topological recursion provide two different approaches towards the concrete computations of the connected $n$-point functions. Finally, we show that the quantum spectral curve of type $B$ in the sense of Gukov-Su{\l}kowski emerges from the BKP-affine coordinates and Eynard-Orantin topological recursion.</description>

      <title>On integrable nets in general and concordant Chebyshev nets in particular</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider general integrable curve nets in Euclidean space as a particular integrable geometry invariant with respect to rigid motions and net-preserving reparameterisations. For the purpose of their description, we first give an overview of the most important second-order invariants and relations among them. As a particular integrable example, we reinterpret the result of I.S. Krasil'shchik and M. Marvan, Coverings and integrability of the Gauss--Mainardi--Codazzi equations, Acta Appl. Math. 56 (1999) 217--230, \S 2, Case 2 as a curve net satisfying an $\mathbb R$-linear relation between the Schief curvature of the net and the Gauss curvature of the supporting surface. In the special case when the curvatures are proportional (concordant nets), we find a correspondence to pairs of pseudospherical surfaces of equal negative constant Gaussian curvatures. Conversely, we also show that two generic pseudospherical surfaces of equal negative constant Gaussian curvatures induce a concordant Chebyshev net. The construction generalises the well-known correspondence between pairs of curves and translation surfaces.</description>
