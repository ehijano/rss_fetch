      <title>On D-spaces and Covering Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we introduce the subject of D-spaces and some of its most important open problems which are related to well known covering properties. We then introduce a new approach for studying D-spaces and covering properties in general. We start by defining a topology on the family of all principal ultrafilters of a set $X$ called the principal ultrafilter topology. We show that each open neighborhood assignment could be transformed uniquely to a special continuous map using the principal ultrafilter topology. We study some structures related to this special continuous map in the category Top, then we obtain a characterization of D-spaces via this map. Finally, we prove some results on Lindel\"of, paracompact, and metacompact spaces that are related to the property D.</description>

      <title>Wandering Flows on the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study planar flows without non-wandering points and prove several properties of these flows in relation with their prolongational relation. The main results of this article are that a planar (regular) wandering flow has no generalized recurrence and has only two topological invariants: the space of its orbits and its prolongational relation (or, equivalently, its smallest stream). As a byproduct, our results show that, even in absence of any type of recurrence, the stream of a flow contains fundamental information on its behavior.</description>

      <title>Ends and end cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ends and end cohomology are powerful invariants for the study of noncompact spaces. We present a self-contained exposition of the topological theory of ends and prove novel extensions including the existence of an exhaustion of a proper map. We define reduced end cohomology as the relative end cohomology of a ray-based space. We use those results to prove a version of a theorem of King that computes the reduced end cohomology of an end sum of two manifolds. We include a complete proof of Freudenthal's fundamental theorem on the number of ends of a topological group, and we use our results on dimension-zero end cohomology to prove -- without using transfinite induction -- a theorem of N\"obeling on freeness of certain modules of continuous functions.</description>
