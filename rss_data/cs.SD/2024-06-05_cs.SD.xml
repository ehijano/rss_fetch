      <title>TinySV: Speaker Verification in TinyML with On-device Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TinyML is a novel area of machine learning that gained huge momentum in the last few years thanks to the ability to execute machine learning algorithms on tiny devices (such as Internet-of-Things or embedded systems). Interestingly, research in this area focused on the efficient execution of the inference phase of TinyML models on tiny devices, while very few solutions for on-device learning of TinyML models are available in the literature due to the relevant overhead introduced by the learning algorithms.
  The aim of this paper is to introduce a new type of adaptive TinyML solution that can be used in tasks, such as the presented \textit{Tiny Speaker Verification} (TinySV), that require to be tackled with an on-device learning algorithm. Achieving this goal required (i) reducing the memory and computational demand of TinyML learning algorithms, and (ii) designing a TinyML learning algorithm operating with few and possibly unlabelled training data. The proposed TinySV solution relies on a two-layer hierarchical TinyML solution comprising Keyword Spotting and Adaptive Speaker Verification module. We evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed TinySV solution on a dataset collected expressly for the task and tested the proposed solution on a real-world IoT device (Infineon PSoC 62S2 Wi-Fi BT Pioneer Kit).</description>

      <title>MaskSR: Masked Language Model for Full-band Speech Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech restoration aims at restoring high quality speech in the presence of a diverse set of distortions. Although several deep learning paradigms have been studied for this task, the power of the recently emerging language models has not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose MaskSR, a masked language model capable of restoring full-band 44.1 kHz speech jointly considering noise, reverb, clipping, and low bandwidth. MaskSR works with discrete acoustic tokens extracted using a pre-trained neural codec. During training, MaskSR is optimized to predict randomly masked tokens extracted from the high quality target speech, conditioned on the corrupted speech with various distortions. During inference, MaskSR reconstructs the target speech tokens with efficient iterative sampling. Extensive experiments show that MaskSR obtains competitive results on both the full-band speech restoration task and also on sub-tasks compared with a wide range of models.</description>

      <title>Whistle: Data-Efficient Multilingual and Crosslingual Speech Recognition via Weakly Phonetic Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exist three approaches for multilingual and crosslingual automatic speech recognition (MCL-ASR) - supervised pre-training with phonetic or graphemic transcription, and self-supervised pre-training. We find that pre-training with phonetic supervision has been underappreciated so far for MCL-ASR, while conceptually it is more advantageous for information sharing between different languages. This paper explores the approach of pre-training with weakly phonetic supervision towards data-efficient MCL-ASR, which is called Whistle. We relax the requirement of gold-standard human-validated phonetic transcripts, and obtain International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) based transcription by leveraging the LanguageNet grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) models. We construct a common experimental setup based on the CommonVoice dataset, called CV-Lang10, with 10 seen languages and 2 unseen languages. A set of experiments are conducted on CV-Lang10 to compare, as fair as possible, the three approaches under the common setup for MCL-ASR. Experiments demonstrate the advantages of phoneme-based models (Whistle) for MCL-ASR, in terms of speech recognition for seen languages, crosslingual performance for unseen languages with different amounts of few-shot data, overcoming catastrophic forgetting, and training efficiency.It is found that when training data is more limited, phoneme supervision can achieve better results compared to subword supervision and self-supervision, thereby providing higher data-efficiency. To support reproducibility and promote future research along this direction, we will release the code, models and data for the whole pipeline of Whistle at https://github.com/thu-spmi/CAT upon publication.</description>

      <title>Audio Mamba: Selective State Spaces for Self-Supervised Audio Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its widespread adoption as the prominent neural architecture, the Transformer has spurred several independent lines of work to address its limitations. One such approach is selective state space models, which have demonstrated promising results for language modelling. However, their feasibility for learning self-supervised, general-purpose audio representations is yet to be investigated. This work proposes Audio Mamba, a selective state space model for learning general-purpose audio representations from randomly masked spectrogram patches through self-supervision. Empirical results on ten diverse audio recognition downstream tasks show that the proposed models, pretrained on the AudioSet dataset, consistently outperform comparable self-supervised audio spectrogram transformer (SSAST) baselines by a considerable margin and demonstrate better performance in dataset size, sequence length and model size comparisons.</description>

      <title>An Independence-promoting Loss for Music Generation with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music generation schemes using language modeling rely on a vocabulary of audio tokens, generally provided as codes in a discrete latent space learnt by an auto-encoder. Multi-stage quantizers are often employed to produce these tokens, therefore the decoding strategy used for token prediction must be adapted to account for multiple codebooks: either it should model the joint distribution over all codebooks, or fit the product of the codebook marginal distributions. Modelling the joint distribution requires a costly increase in the number of auto-regressive steps, while fitting the product of the marginals yields an inexact model unless the codebooks are mutually independent. In this work, we introduce an independence-promoting loss to regularize the auto-encoder used as the tokenizer in language models for music generation. The proposed loss is a proxy for mutual information based on the maximum mean discrepancy principle, applied in reproducible kernel Hilbert spaces. Our criterion is simple to implement and train, and it is generalizable to other multi-stream codecs. We show that it reduces the statistical dependence between codebooks during auto-encoding. This leads to an increase in the generated music quality when modelling the product of the marginal distributions, while generating audio much faster than the joint distribution model.</description>

      <title>SimpleSpeech: Towards Simple and Efficient Text-to-Speech with Scalar Latent Transformer Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a simple and efficient Non-Autoregressive (NAR) text-to-speech (TTS) system based on diffusion, named SimpleSpeech. Its simpleness shows in three aspects: (1) It can be trained on the speech-only dataset, without any alignment information; (2) It directly takes plain text as input and generates speech through an NAR way; (3) It tries to model speech in a finite and compact latent space, which alleviates the modeling difficulty of diffusion. More specifically, we propose a novel speech codec model (SQ-Codec) with scalar quantization, SQ-Codec effectively maps the complex speech signal into a finite and compact latent space, named scalar latent space. Benefits from SQ-Codec, we apply a novel transformer diffusion model in the scalar latent space of SQ-Codec. We train SimpleSpeech on 4k hours of a speech-only dataset, it shows natural prosody and voice cloning ability. Compared with previous large-scale TTS models, it presents significant speech quality and generation speed improvement. Demos are released.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Hidden Factors: Explainable AI for Feature Boosting in Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) has gained significant attention due to its several application fields, such as mental health, education, and human-computer interaction. However, the accuracy of SER systems is hindered by high-dimensional feature sets that may contain irrelevant and redundant information. To overcome this challenge, this study proposes an iterative feature boosting approach for SER that emphasizes feature relevance and explainability to enhance machine learning model performance. Our approach involves meticulous feature selection and analysis to build efficient SER systems. In addressing our main problem through model explainability, we employ a feature evaluation loop with Shapley values to iteratively refine feature sets. This process strikes a balance between model performance and transparency, which enables a comprehensive understanding of the model's predictions. The proposed approach offers several advantages, including the identification and removal of irrelevant and redundant features, leading to a more effective model. Additionally, it promotes explainability, facilitating comprehension of the model's predictions and the identification of crucial features for emotion determination. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on the SER benchmarks of the Toronto emotional speech set (TESS), Berlin Database of Emotional Speech (EMO-DB), Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS), and Surrey Audio-Visual Expressed Emotion (SAVEE) datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the potential of the proposed technique in developing accurate and explainable SER systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to incorporate model explainability into an SER framework.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Train ASR Models that Memorize Less and Perform Better with Per-core Clipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient clipping plays a vital role in training large-scale automatic speech recognition (ASR) models. It is typically applied to minibatch gradients to prevent gradient explosion, and to the individual sample gradients to mitigate unintended memorization. This work systematically investigates the impact of a specific granularity of gradient clipping, namely per-core clip-ping (PCC), across training a wide range of ASR models. We empirically demonstrate that PCC can effectively mitigate unintended memorization in ASR models. Surprisingly, we find that PCC positively influences ASR performance metrics, leading to improved convergence rates and reduced word error rates. To avoid tuning the additional hyperparameter introduced by PCC, we further propose a novel variant, adaptive per-core clipping (APCC), for streamlined optimization. Our findings highlight the multifaceted benefits of PCC as a strategy for robust, privacy-forward ASR model training.</description>

      <title>Phonetic Enhanced Language Modeling for Text-to-Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent language model-based text-to-speech (TTS) frameworks demonstrate scalability and in-context learning capabilities. However, they suffer from robustness issues due to the accumulation of errors in speech unit predictions during autoregressive language modeling. In this paper, we propose a phonetic enhanced language modeling method to improve the performance of TTS models. We leverage self-supervised representations that are phonetically rich as the training target for the autoregressive language model. Subsequently, a non-autoregressive model is employed to predict discrete acoustic codecs that contain fine-grained acoustic details. The TTS model focuses solely on linguistic modeling during autoregressive training, thereby reducing the error propagation that occurs in non-autoregressive training. Both objective and subjective evaluations validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Understanding Auditory Evoked Brain Signal via Physics-informed Embedding Network with Multi-Task Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the fields of brain-computer interaction and cognitive neuroscience, effective decoding of auditory signals from task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is key to understanding how the brain processes complex auditory information. Although existing methods have enhanced decoding capabilities, limitations remain in information utilization and model representation. To overcome these challenges, we propose an innovative multi-task learning model, Physics-informed Embedding Network with Multi-Task Transformer (PEMT-Net), which enhances decoding performance through physics-informed embedding and deep learning techniques. PEMT-Net consists of two principal components: feature augmentation and classification. For feature augmentation, we propose a novel approach by creating neural embedding graphs via node embedding, utilizing random walks to simulate the physical diffusion of neural information. This method captures both local and non-local information overflow and proposes a position encoding based on relative physical coordinates. In the classification segment, we propose adaptive embedding fusion to maximally capture linear and non-linear characteristics. Furthermore, we propose an innovative parameter-sharing mechanism to optimize the retention and learning of extracted features. Experiments on a specific dataset demonstrate PEMT-Net's significant performance in multi-task auditory signal decoding, surpassing existing methods and offering new insights into the brain's mechanisms for processing complex auditory information.</description>

      <title>M2D-CLAP: Masked Modeling Duo Meets CLAP for Learning General-purpose Audio-Language Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive language-audio pre-training (CLAP) enables zero-shot (ZS) inference of audio and exhibits promising performance in several classification tasks. However, conventional audio representations are still crucial for many tasks where ZS is not applicable (e.g., regression problems). Here, we explore a new representation, a general-purpose audio-language representation, that performs well in both ZS and transfer learning. To do so, we propose a new method, M2D-CLAP, which combines self-supervised learning Masked Modeling Duo (M2D) and CLAP. M2D learns an effective representation to model audio signals, and CLAP aligns the representation with text embedding. As a result, M2D-CLAP learns a versatile representation that allows for both ZS and transfer learning. Experiments show that M2D-CLAP performs well on linear evaluation, fine-tuning, and ZS classification with a GTZAN state-of-the-art of 75.17%, thus achieving a general-purpose audio-language representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) holds the promise of breaking down communication barriers and enabling fluid conversations across languages. However, achieving accurate, real-time translation through mobile devices remains a major challenge. We introduce SimulTron, a novel S2ST architecture designed to tackle this task. SimulTron is a lightweight direct S2ST model that uses the strengths of the Translatotron framework while incorporating key modifications for streaming operation, and an adjustable fixed delay. Our experiments show that SimulTron surpasses Translatotron 2 in offline evaluations. Furthermore, real-time evaluations reveal that SimulTron improves upon the performance achieved by Translatotron 1. Additionally, SimulTron achieves superior BLEU scores and latency compared to previous real-time S2ST method on the MuST-C dataset. Significantly, we have successfully deployed SimulTron on a Pixel 7 Pro device, show its potential for simultaneous S2ST on-device.</description>

      <title>BiVocoder: A Bidirectional Neural Vocoder Integrating Feature Extraction and Waveform Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel bidirectional neural vocoder, named BiVocoder, capable both of feature extraction and reverse waveform generation within the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. For feature extraction, the BiVocoder takes amplitude and phase spectra derived from STFT as inputs, transforms them into long-frame-shift and low-dimensional features through convolutional neural networks. The extracted features are demonstrated suitable for direct prediction by acoustic models, supporting its application in text-to-speech (TTS) task. For waveform generation, the BiVocoder restores amplitude and phase spectra from the features by a symmetric network, followed by inverse STFT to reconstruct the speech waveform. Experimental results show that our proposed BiVocoder achieves better performance compared to some baseline vocoders, by comprehensively considering both synthesized speech quality and inference speed for both analysis-synthesis and TTS tasks.</description>

      <title>Multi-Stage Speech Bandwidth Extension with Flexible Sampling Rate Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The majority of existing speech bandwidth extension (BWE) methods operate under the constraint of fixed source and target sampling rates, which limits their flexibility in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage speech BWE model named MS-BWE, which can handle a set of source and target sampling rate pairs and achieve flexible extensions of frequency bandwidth. The proposed MS-BWE model comprises a cascade of BWE blocks, with each block featuring a dual-stream architecture to realize amplitude and phase extension, progressively painting the speech frequency bands stage by stage. The teacher-forcing strategy is employed to mitigate the discrepancy between training and inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MS-BWE is comparable to state-of-the-art speech BWE methods in speech quality. Regarding generation efficiency, the one-stage generation of MS-BWE can achieve over one thousand times real-time on GPU and about sixty times on CPU.</description>

      <title>MidiCaps -- A large-scale MIDI dataset with text captions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models guided by text prompts are increasingly becoming more popular. However, no text-to-MIDI models currently exist, mostly due to the lack of a captioned MIDI dataset. This work aims to enable research that combines LLMs with symbolic music by presenting the first large-scale MIDI dataset with text captions that is openly available: MidiCaps. MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) files are a widely used format for encoding musical information. Their structured format captures the nuances of musical composition and has practical applications by music producers, composers, musicologists, as well as performers. Inspired by recent advancements in captioning techniques applied to various domains, we present a large-scale curated dataset of over 168k MIDI files accompanied by textual descriptions. Each MIDI caption succinctly describes the musical content, encompassing tempo, chord progression, time signature, instruments present, genre and mood; thereby facilitating multi-modal exploration and analysis. The dataset contains a mix of various genres, styles, and complexities, offering a rich source for training and evaluating models for tasks such as music information retrieval, music understanding and cross-modal translation. We provide detailed statistics about the dataset and have assessed the quality of the captions in an extensive listening study. We anticipate that this resource will stimulate further research in the intersection of music and natural language processing, fostering advancements in both fields.</description>

      <title>Towards Supervised Performance on Speaker Verification with Self-Supervised Learning by Leveraging Large-Scale ASR Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) have shown promising results in Speaker Verification (SV). However, narrowing the performance gap with supervised systems remains an ongoing challenge. Several studies have observed that speech representations from large-scale ASR models contain valuable speaker information. This work explores the limitations of fine-tuning these models for SV using an SSL contrastive objective in an end-to-end approach. Then, we propose a framework to learn speaker representations in an SSL context by fine-tuning a pre-trained WavLM with a supervised loss using pseudo-labels. Initial pseudo-labels are derived from an SSL DINO-based model and are iteratively refined by clustering the model embeddings. Our method achieves 0.99% EER on VoxCeleb1-O, establishing the new state-of-the-art on self-supervised SV. As this performance is close to our supervised baseline of 0.94% EER, this contribution is a step towards supervised performance on SV with SSL.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Singing Voice Pre-Training towards Speech-to-Singing Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech-to-singing voice conversion (STS) task always suffers from data scarcity, because it requires paired speech and singing data. Compounding this issue are the challenges of content-pitch alignment and the suboptimal quality of generated outputs, presenting significant hurdles in STS research. This paper presents SVPT, an STS approach boosted by a self-supervised singing voice pre-training model. We leverage spoken language model techniques to tackle the rhythm alignment problem and the in-context learning capability to achieve zero-shot conversion. We adopt discrete-unit random resampling and pitch corruption strategies, enabling training with unpaired singing data and thus mitigating the issue of data scarcity. SVPT also serves as an effective backbone for singing voice synthesis (SVS), offering insights into scaling up SVS models. Experimental results indicate that SVPT delivers notable improvements in both STS and SVS endeavors. Audio samples are available at https://speech2sing.github.io.</description>

      <title>Seed-TTS: A Family of High-Quality Versatile Speech Generation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Seed-TTS, a family of large-scale autoregressive text-to-speech (TTS) models capable of generating speech that is virtually indistinguishable from human speech. Seed-TTS serves as a foundation model for speech generation and excels in speech in-context learning, achieving performance in speaker similarity and naturalness that matches ground truth human speech in both objective and subjective evaluations. With fine-tuning, we achieve even higher subjective scores across these metrics. Seed-TTS offers superior controllability over various speech attributes such as emotion and is capable of generating highly expressive and diverse speech for speakers in the wild. Furthermore, we propose a self-distillation method for speech factorization, as well as a reinforcement learning approach to enhance model robustness, speaker similarity, and controllability. We additionally present a non-autoregressive (NAR) variant of the Seed-TTS model, named $\text{Seed-TTS}_\text{DiT}$, which utilizes a fully diffusion-based architecture. Unlike previous NAR-based TTS systems, $\text{Seed-TTS}_\text{DiT}$ does not depend on pre-estimated phoneme durations and performs speech generation through end-to-end processing. We demonstrate that this variant achieves comparable performance to the language model-based variant and showcase its effectiveness in speech editing. We encourage readers to listen to demos at \url{https://bytedancespeech.github.io/seedtts_tech_report}.</description>

      <title>CtrSVDD: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline Analysis for Controlled Singing Voice Deepfake Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent singing voice synthesis and conversion advancements necessitate robust singing voice deepfake detection (SVDD) models. Current SVDD datasets face challenges due to limited controllability, diversity in deepfake methods, and licensing restrictions. Addressing these gaps, we introduce CtrSVDD, a large-scale, diverse collection of bonafide and deepfake singing vocals. These vocals are synthesized using state-of-the-art methods from publicly accessible singing voice datasets. CtrSVDD includes 47.64 hours of bonafide and 260.34 hours of deepfake singing vocals, spanning 14 deepfake methods and involving 164 singer identities. We also present a baseline system with flexible front-end features, evaluated against a structured train/dev/eval split. The experiments show the importance of feature selection and highlight a need for generalization towards deepfake methods that deviate further from training distribution. The CtrSVDD dataset and baselines are publicly accessible.</description>

      <title>How Do Neural Spoofing Countermeasures Detect Partially Spoofed Audio?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partially manipulating a sentence can greatly change its meaning. Recent work shows that countermeasures (CMs) trained on partially spoofed audio can effectively detect such spoofing. However, the current understanding of the decision-making process of CMs is limited. We utilize Grad-CAM and introduce a quantitative analysis metric to interpret CMs' decisions. We find that CMs prioritize the artifacts of transition regions created when concatenating bona fide and spoofed audio. This focus differs from that of CMs trained on fully spoofed audio, which concentrate on the pattern differences between bona fide and spoofed parts. Our further investigation explains the varying nature of CMs' focus while making correct or incorrect predictions. These insights provide a basis for the design of CM models and the creation of datasets. Moreover, this work lays a foundation of interpretability in the field of partial spoofed audio detection that has not been well explored previously.</description>

      <title>Language-Universal Speech Attributes Modeling for Zero-Shot Multilingual Spoken Keyword Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel language-universal approach to end-to-end automatic spoken keyword recognition (SKR) leveraging upon (i) a self-supervised pre-trained model, and (ii) a set of universal speech attributes (manner and place of articulation). Specifically, Wav2Vec2.0 is used to generate robust speech representations, followed by a linear output layer to produce attribute sequences. A non-trainable pronunciation model then maps sequences of attributes into spoken keywords in a multilingual setting. Experiments on the Multilingual Spoken Words Corpus show comparable performances to character- and phoneme-based SKR in seen languages. The inclusion of domain adversarial training (DAT) improves the proposed framework, outperforming both character- and phoneme-based SKR approaches with 13.73% and 17.22% relative word error rate (WER) reduction in seen languages, and achieves 32.14% and 19.92% WER reduction for unseen languages in zero-shot settings.</description>

      <title>Parallel Synthesis for Autoregressive Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.11806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autoregressive models have achieved outstanding performance in neural speech synthesis tasks. Though they can generate highly natural human speech, the iterative generation inevitably makes the synthesis time proportional to the utterance's length, leading to low efficiency. Many works were dedicated to generating the whole speech time sequence in parallel and then proposed GAN-based, flow-based, and score-based models. This paper proposed a new thought for the autoregressive generation. Instead of iteratively predicting samples in a time sequence, the proposed model performs frequency-wise autoregressive generation (FAR) and bit-wise autoregressive generation (BAR) to synthesize speech. In FAR, a speech utterance is first split into different frequency subbands. The proposed model generates a subband conditioned on the previously generated one. A full band speech can then be reconstructed by using these generated subbands and a synthesis filter bank. Similarly, in BAR, an 8-bit quantized signal is generated iteratively from the first bit. By redesigning the autoregressive method to compute in domains other than the time domain, the number of iterations in the proposed model is no longer proportional to the utterance's length but the number of subbands/bits. The inference efficiency is hence significantly increased. Besides, a post-filter is employed to sample audio signals from output posteriors, and its training objective is designed based on the characteristics of the proposed autoregressive methods. The experimental results show that the proposed model is able to synthesize speech faster than real-time without GPU acceleration. Compared with the baseline autoregressive and non-autoregressive models, the proposed model achieves better MOS and shows its good generalization ability while synthesizing 44 kHz speech or utterances from unseen speakers.</description>

      <title>Singing Voice Data Scaling-up: An Introduction to ACE-Opencpop and ACE-KiSing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In singing voice synthesis (SVS), generating singing voices from musical scores faces challenges due to limited data availability. This study proposes a unique strategy to address the data scarcity in SVS. We employ an existing singing voice synthesizer for data augmentation, complemented by detailed manual tuning, an approach not previously explored in data curation, to reduce instances of unnatural voice synthesis. This innovative method has led to the creation of two expansive singing voice datasets, ACE-Opencpop and ACE-KiSing, which are instrumental for large-scale, multi-singer voice synthesis. Through thorough experimentation, we establish that these datasets not only serve as new benchmarks for SVS but also enhance SVS performance on other singing voice datasets when used as supplementary resources. The corpora, pre-trained models, and their related training recipes are publicly available at ESPnet-Muskits (\url{https://github.com/espnet/espnet})</description>

      <title>On the Semantic Latent Space of Diffusion-Based Text-to-Speech Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The incorporation of Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) in the Text-to-Speech (TTS) domain is rising, providing great value in synthesizing high quality speech. Although they exhibit impressive audio quality, the extent of their semantic capabilities is unknown, and controlling their synthesized speech's vocal properties remains a challenge. Inspired by recent advances in image synthesis, we explore the latent space of frozen TTS models, which is composed of the latent bottleneck activations of the DDM's denoiser. We identify that this space contains rich semantic information, and outline several novel methods for finding semantic directions within it, both supervised and unsupervised. We then demonstrate how these enable off-the-shelf audio editing, without any further training, architectural changes or data requirements. We present evidence of the semantic and acoustic qualities of the edited audio, and provide supplemental samples: https://latent-analysis-grad-tts.github.io/speech-samples/.</description>

Abstract: Adapting an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system to unseen noise environments is crucial. Integrating adapters into neural networks has emerged as a potent technique for transfer learning. This study thoroughly investigates adapter-based ASR adaptation in noisy environments. We conducted experiments using the CHiME--4 dataset. The results show that inserting the adapter in the shallow layer yields superior effectiveness, and there is no significant difference between adapting solely within the shallow layer and adapting across all layers. The simulated data helps the system to improve its performance under real noise conditions. Nonetheless, when the amount of data is the same, the real data is more effective than the simulated data. Multi-condition training is still useful for adapter training. Furthermore, integrating adapters into speech enhancement-based ASR systems yields substantial improvements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With recent advances of diffusion model, generative speech enhancement (SE) has attracted a surge of research interest due to its great potential for unseen testing noises. However, existing efforts mainly focus on inherent properties of clean speech, underexploiting the varying noise information in real world. In this paper, we propose a noise-aware speech enhancement (NASE) approach that extracts noise-specific information to guide the reverse process in diffusion model. Specifically, we design a noise classification (NC) model to produce acoustic embedding as a noise conditioner to guide the reverse denoising process. Meanwhile, a multi-task learning scheme is devised to jointly optimize SE and NC tasks to enhance the noise specificity of conditioner. NASE is shown to be a plug-and-play module that can be generalized to any diffusion SE models. Experiments on VB-DEMAND dataset show that NASE effectively improves multiple mainstream diffusion SE models, especially on unseen noises.</description>

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques have achieved remarkable results in various speech processing tasks. Nonetheless, a significant challenge remains in reducing the reliance on vast amounts of speech data for pre-training. This paper proposes to address this challenge by leveraging synthetic speech to augment a low-resource pre-training corpus. We construct a high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) system with limited resources using SSL features and generate a large synthetic corpus for pre-training. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively reduces the demand for speech data by 90% with only slight performance degradation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work aiming to enhance low-resource self-supervised learning in speech processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03506v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce DiarizationLM, a framework to leverage large language models (LLM) to post-process the outputs from a speaker diarization system. Various goals can be achieved with the proposed framework, such as improving the readability of the diarized transcript, or reducing the word diarization error rate (WDER). In this framework, the outputs of the automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speaker diarization systems are represented as a compact textual format, which is included in the prompt to an optionally finetuned LLM. The outputs of the LLM can be used as the refined diarization results with the desired enhancement. As a post-processing step, this framework can be easily applied to any off-the-shelf ASR and speaker diarization systems without retraining existing components. Our experiments show that a finetuned PaLM 2-S model can reduce the WDER by rel. 55.5% on the Fisher telephone conversation dataset, and rel. 44.9% on the Callhome English dataset.</description>

      <title>Unrestricted Global Phase Bias-Aware Single-channel Speech Enhancement with Conformer-based Metric GAN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of neural networks in recent years, the ability of various networks to enhance the magnitude spectrum of noisy speech in the single-channel speech enhancement domain has become exceptionally outstanding. However, enhancing the phase spectrum using neural networks is often ineffective, which remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we found that the human ear cannot sensitively perceive the difference between a precise phase spectrum and a biased phase (BP) spectrum. Therefore, we propose an optimization method of phase reconstruction, allowing freedom on the global-phase bias instead of reconstructing the precise phase spectrum. We applied it to a Conformer-based Metric Generative Adversarial Networks (CMGAN) baseline model, which relaxes the existing constraints of precise phase and gives the neural network a broader learning space. Results show that this method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance without incurring additional computational overhead.</description>
