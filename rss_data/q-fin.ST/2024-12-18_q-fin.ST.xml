      <title>AI-Enhanced Factor Analysis for Predicting S&amp;P 500 Stock Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This project investigates the interplay of technical, market, and statistical factors in predicting stock market performance, with a primary focus on S&amp;P 500 companies. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset spanning multiple years, the analysis constructs advanced financial metrics, such as momentum indicators, volatility measures, and liquidity adjustments. The machine learning framework is employed to identify patterns, relationships, and predictive capabilities of these factors. The integration of traditional financial analytics with machine learning enables enhanced predictive accuracy, offering valuable insights into market behavior and guiding investment strategies. This research highlights the potential of combining domain-specific financial expertise with modern computational tools to address complex market dynamics.</description>

      <title>How to Choose a Threshold for an Evaluation Metric for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To ensure and monitor large language models (LLMs) reliably, various evaluation metrics have been proposed in the literature. However, there is little research on prescribing a methodology to identify a robust threshold on these metrics even though there are many serious implications of an incorrect choice of the thresholds during deployment of the LLMs. Translating the traditional model risk management (MRM) guidelines within regulated industries such as the financial industry, we propose a step-by-step recipe for picking a threshold for a given LLM evaluation metric. We emphasize that such a methodology should start with identifying the risks of the LLM application under consideration and risk tolerance of the stakeholders. We then propose concrete and statistically rigorous procedures to determine a threshold for the given LLM evaluation metric using available ground-truth data. As a concrete example to demonstrate the proposed methodology at work, we employ it on the Faithfulness metric, as implemented in various publicly available libraries, using the publicly available HaluBench dataset. We also lay a foundation for creating systematic approaches to select thresholds, not only for LLMs but for any GenAI applications.</description>
