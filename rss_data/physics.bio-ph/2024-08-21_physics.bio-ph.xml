      <title>Physical limits on chemical sensing in bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cells respond to chemical cues, and the precision with which they can sense these cues is fundamentally limited by the stochastic nature of diffusion and ligand binding. Berg and Purcell famously investigated how well a small sensor in an infinite ligand bath can determine the ligand concentration, and a number of subsequent analyses have refined and built upon their classical estimates. Not all concentration sensing problems, however, occur in such an infinite geometry. At different scales, subcellular sensors and cells in tissues are both often confronted with signals whose diffusion is affected by confining boundaries. It is thus valuable to understand how basic limits on chemosensation depend on the sensor's size and on its position in the domain in which ligand diffuses. Here we compute how sensor size and proximity to reflecting boundaries affect the diffusion-limited precision of chemosensation for various geometries in one and three dimensions. We derive analytical expressions for the sensing limit in these geometries. Among our conclusions is the surprising result that, in certain circumstances, smaller sensors can be more effective than larger sensors. This effect arises from a trade-off between spatial averaging and time averaging that we analyze in detail. We also find that proximity to confining boundaries can degrade a sensor's precision significantly compared to the precision of the same sensor far from any boundaries.</description>

      <title>Geometric decomposition of planar vector fields with a limit cycle</title>

Abstract: Mathematical modelling is a cornerstone of computational biology. While mechanistic models might describe the interactions of interest of a system, they are often difficult to study. On the other hand, abstract models might capture key features but remain disconnected from experimental manipulation. Geometric methods have been useful in connecting both approaches, although they have only been established for specific type of systems. Phenomena of biological relevance, such as limit cycles, are still difficult to study using conventional methods. In this paper, I explore an alternative description of planar dynamical systems and I present an algorithm to compute numerically the geometric structure of planar systems with a limit cycle.</description>

      <title>Mechanics promotes coherence in heterogeneous active media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization of activity among myocytes constituting vital organs, e.g., the heart, is crucial for physiological functions. Self-organized coordination in such heterogeneous ensemble of excitable and oscillatory cells is therefore of clinical importance. We show by varying the strength of intercellular coupling and the electrophysiological diversity, a wide range of collective behavior emerges including clusters of synchronized activity. Strikingly, stretch-activated currents allow waves of mechanical deformation to alter the activity of neighboring cells, promoting robust global coherence.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Neutron Irradiation for Genetic Mutations: Spallation, Reactor, and Compact Neutron Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron beam, being electrically neutral and highly penetrating, offers unique advantages for irradiation of biological species such as plants, seeds, and microorganisms. We comprehensively investigate the potential of neutron irradiation for inducing genetic mutations using simulations of J-PARC BL10, JRR-3 TNRF, and KUANS for spallation, reactor, and compact neutron sources. We analyze neutron flux, energy deposition rates, and Linear Energy Transfer (LET) distributions. KUANS demonstrated the highest dose rate of 17 Gy/h, significantly surpassing BL10, due to the large solid angle by the optimal sample placement. The findings highlight KUANS's suitability for efficient genetic mutations and neutron breeding, particularly for inducing targeted mutations in biological samples. The LET range of KUANS is concentrated in 20-70 keV/{\mu}m, which is potentially ideal for inducing specific genetic mutations. The importance of choosing neutron sources based on LET requirements to maximize mutation induction efficiency is emphasized. This research shows the potential of compact neutron sources like KUANS for effective biological irradiation and neutron breeding, offering a viable alternative to larger facilities. The neutron filters used in BL10 and TNRF effectively excluded low-energy neutrons with keeping the high LET component. The neutron capture reaction, 14N(n,p)14C, was found to be the main dose under thermal neutron-dominated conditions.</description>

      <title>Nanodiamond-based spatial-temporal deformation sensing for cell mechanics</title>

Abstract: Precise assessment of the mechanical properties of soft biological systems at the nanoscale is crucial for understanding physiology, pathology, and developing relevant drugs. Conventional atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based indentation methods suffer from uncertainties in local tip-sample interactions and model choice. This can be overcome by adopting spatially resolved nonlocal deformation sensing for mechanical analysis. However, the technique is currently limited to lifeless/static systems, due to the inadequate spatial or temporal resolution, or difficulties in differentiating the indentation-induced deformation from that associated with live activities and other external perturbations. Here, we develop an innovative dynamic nonlocal deformation sensing approach allowing both spatially and temporally resolved mechanical analysis, which achieves a tens of microsecond time-lag precision, a nanometer vertical deformation precision, and a sub-hundred nanometer lateral spatial resolution. Using oscillatory nanoindentation and spectroscopic analysis, the method can separate the indentation-caused signal from random noise, enabling live cell measurement. Using this method, we discover a distance-dependent phase of surface deformation during indentation, leading to the disclosure of surface tension effects (capillarity) in the mechanical response of live cells upon AFM indentation. A viscoelastic model with surface tension is used to enable simultaneous quantification of the viscoelasticity and capillarity of cell. We show that neglecting surface tension, as in conventional AFM methods, would underestimate the liquid-like characteristics and overestimate the apparent viscoelastic modulus of cells. The study lays down a foundation for understanding a broad range of elastocapillarity-related interfacial mechanics and mechanobiological processes in live cells.</description>

      <title>Synergy as the failure of distributivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03455v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of emergence, or synergy in its simplest form, is widely used but lacks a rigorous definition. Our work connects information and set theory to uncover the mathematical nature of synergy as the failure of distributivity. It resolves the persistent self-contradiction of information decomposition theory and reinstates it as a primary route toward a rigorous definition of emergence. Our results suggest that non-distributive variants of set theory may be used to describe emergent physical systems.</description>

      <title>Escape of an Active Ring from an Attractive Surface: Behaving Like a Self-Propelled Brownian Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Escape of active agents from metastable states is of great interest in statistical and biological physics. In this study, we investigate the escape of a flexible active ring, composed of active Brownian particles, from a flat attractive surface using Brownian dynamics simulations. To systematically explore the effects of activity, persistence time, and the shape of attractive potentials, we calculate escape time and effective temperature. We observe two distinct escape mechanisms: Kramers-like thermal activation at small persistence times and the maximal force problem at large persistence time, where escape time is determined by persistence time. The escape time explicitly depends on the shape of the potential barrier at high activity and large persistence time. Moreover, when the propulsion force is biased along the ring's contour, escape becomes more difficult and is primarily driven by thermal noise. Our findings highlight that, despite its intricate configuration, the active ring can be effectively modeled as a self-propelled Brownian particle when studying its escape from a smooth surface.</description>
