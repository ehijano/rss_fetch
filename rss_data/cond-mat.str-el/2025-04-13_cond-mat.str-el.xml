      <title>Exchange interactions in itinerant magnets: the effects of local particle-hole irreducible vertex corrections and SU(2) symmetry of Hund interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study exchange interactions in iron and nickel within the DFT+DMFT approach with density-density and SU(2) symmetric Coulomb interaction. In particular, we analyze the representation of exchange interactions through the non-local part of the particle-hole bubble, supplemented by the local particle-hole (ph) irreducible interaction vertices. The neglect of the local ph-irreducible vertex corrections, suggested previously within the dual fermion approach [E. A. Stepanov, et.al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 037204 (2018)], yields the result, corresponding to generalization of the magnetic force theorem approach. While we argue that these vertex corrections are not important for strong localized magnets, such as iron, they become more essential for weak itinerant magnets, such as nickel. At the same time, the account of the full local vertex and self-energy corrections in the renormalized approach is essential for iron, and less important for nickel. The difference of the results of density-density and SU(2) symmetric Coulomb interaction is found relatively small, in contrast to the Curie temperature and the value of the local magnetic moment.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Projected Spin-AGP Methods Applied to Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-projected wave function methods capture static correlation by breaking and restoring the symmetries of a system. In this article, we present the symmetry-projected spin antisymmetrized geminal power (spin-AGP) state projected onto space group symmetry as well as complex conjugation, spin-flip, and time-reversal symmetries. The method is benchmarked on the 1D XXZ model and 2D $\mathrm{J_1-J_2}$ model with square and triangular lattices. Our results indicate that symmetry projection methods provide a powerful tool for frustrated spin systems.</description>

      <title>Investigation into the low temperature state of the spin-ice material Dy_2 Ti_2 O_7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal equilibrium properties of the spin-ice material DTO, including specific heat, magnetization, and spin correlations, could be successfully reproduced by a model featuring magnetic interactions up to the third nearest neighbor and long-ranged dipolar forces. With the best-fit parameters, the model predicts an ordered ground state which breaks the cubic symmetry of the lattice. In this work, we analyze results from a neutron scattering experiment in which, instead of sharp Bragg peaks, a diffuse pattern was observed down to 300mK, despite very slow cooling [A. M. Samarakoon et al., Physical Review Research 4,033159 (2022).]. Using a reverse Monte Carlo approach, we found compatible spin configurations, analyze the suitability of antiferromagnetic spin chains as building blocks for the ground-state and provide various measures of correlation and calculate their energy. Our analysis suggests that while infinitely long chains are not present in the experimental configuration, antiferromagnetic spin chains provide a good approximation of the data. There are indications of possible evidence for short-range chains, but further investigation is needed for confirmation.</description>

      <title>NMR study of supersolid phases in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Na2BaCo(PO4)2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report ultra-low-temperature $^{23}$Na NMR measurements on the Ising triangular lattice antiferromagnet Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$, which precisely resolve the phase diagram under magnetic field applied along the crystalline $c$ axis. With increasing field, the NMR spectra resolve three ordered phases with distinct spin configurations: the Y, up-up-down (UUD), and V phases. The spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ data demonstrate gapless excitations in the Y and V phases, strongly supporting their supersolid nature. However, the phase transitions from the UUD phase to the two supersolid phases exhibit dramatically different behaviors upon cooling. Prior to entering the Y phase, $1/T_1$ identifies a gapless regime within the UUD phase, suggesting a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase above a second-order phase transition. In contrast, the coexistence of the UUD and V phases observed in our experiments provides direct evidence of a first-order phase transition between these phases.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism Without Crystal Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a collinear magnetic order in which opposite spin species are exchanged under a real-space rotation. Hence, the search for physical realizations has focussed on crystalline solids with specific rotational symmetry. Here, we show that altermagnetism can also emerge in non-crystalline systems, such as amorphous solids, despite the lack of global rotational symmetries. We construct a Hamiltonian with two directional orbitals per site on an amorphous lattice with interactions that are invariant under spin rotation. Altermagnetism then arises due to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the spin and orbital degrees of freedom around each atom, displaying a common point group symmetry.This form of altermagnetism exhibits anisotropic spin transport and spin spectral functions, both experimentally measurable. Our mechanism generalizes to any lattice and any altermagnetic order, opening the search for altermagnetic phenomena to non-crystalline systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fluctuation-enhanced Milli-Kelvin Magnetic Refrigeration in Triangular Lattice Magnet GdBO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth-based triangular lattice antiferromagnets, with strong quantum fluctuations and weak magnetic interactions, can often retain large magnetic entropy down to very low temperatures, making them excellent candidates for magnetic refrigeration at ultra-low temperatures. These materials exhibit a substantial magnetocaloric effect (MCE) due to enhanced spin fluctuations, particularly near quantum critical points, which leads to significant changes in magnetic entropy. This study reports on the crystal growth, structure, magnetism, and MCE of a Gd-based triangular lattice material, GdBO3, characterized by a large spin quantum number (S = 7/2). Successive phase transitions (T1 = 0.52 K, T2 = 0.88 K, and T3 = 1.77 K) were observed in zero-field specific heat measurements. Furthermore, thermal dynamic analysis under external magnetic fields identified five distinct phase regions and three quantum critical points for GdBO3. Due to its broad specific heat features and the high density of magnetic Gd3+ ions, we achieved a minimum temperature of 50 mK near the field-induced quantum critical point, using a custom-designed GdBO3-based adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator. Our findings reveal significant quantum fluctuations below 2 K, demonstrating GdBO3's potential for milli-Kelvin magnetic cooling applications.</description>

      <title>Designing Topological High-Order Van Hove Singularities: Twisted Bilayer Kagom\'e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of high-order Van Hove singularities and topology plays a central role in determining the nature of the electronic correlations governing the phase of a system with unique signatures characterising their presence. Layered van der Waals heterostuctures are ideal systems for band engineering through the use of twisting and proximity effects. Here, we use symmetry to demonstrate how twisted Kagom\'e bilayers can host topological high-order Van Hove singularities. We study a commensurate system with a large twist angle and demonstrate how the initial choice of high-symmetry stacking order can greatly influence the electronic structure and topology of the system. We, furthermore, study the sublattice interference in the system. Our results illustrate the rich energy landscape of twisted Kagom\'e bilayers and unveil large Chern numbers (of order 10), establishing twisted bilayer Kagom\'e as a natural playground for probing the mixing of strong correlations and topology.</description>

      <title>Emergent phases in the Yao-Lee model via coupling to topological spin textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrons in metals experience an effective vector potential when coupled to spin textures with non-zero scalar spin chirality, such as skyrmions. This coupling can generate a substantial field, leading to pronounced observable phenomena, including the topological Hall effect. Motivated by this, we consider a bilayer model in which the Majorana fermions in the Yao-Lee model on one layer interact with topological spin textures on the second layer via a spin-spin interaction. Unlike the Kitaev model, the Yao-Lee model remains exactly solvable, allowing us to perform Monte Carlo simulations to determine its ground state. Our analysis indicates that skyrmion crystals can give rise to a variety of vison crystals that are periodic arrangements of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes with unusual patterns such as a kagome pattern. In addition, Majorana fermions acquire a substantial Berry phase from skyrmion crystals, resulting in phases with finite Chern numbers up to $\nu =5$. In the case of a single skyrmion defect in the magnetic layer, a corresponding defect in the vison configuration can be realized. These defects support localized states when the spin liquid is gapped. Similar to skyrmion crystals, spiral spin textures also give rise to a diverse range of flux crystals. However, in this case, most of these phases are gapless, with only a few being trivially-gapped. Our results highlight the rich physics emerging from the interplay between topological spin textures and fractionalized quasiparticles in quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Replica manifolds, pole skipping, and the butterfly effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The black hole butterfly effect is a signal of quantum chaos in holographic theories that can be probed in different ways, including out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), pole skipping (PS), and entanglement wedge (EW) reconstruction. Each of these three phenomena can be used to define a butterfly velocity that measures the speed at which chaos spreads. In a general quantum system the three velocities $v_B^{\text{OTOC}}$, $v_B^{\text{PS}}$, and $v_B^{\text{EW}}$ can be different, but it is known from explicit calculations that they are all equal in certain holographic theories dual to Einstein gravity plus higher-curvature corrections. A conceptual explanation for this apparent coincidence is lacking. We show that it follows from a deeper relationship: The pole-skipping mode, added to the black hole background, can be reinterpreted as the gravitational replica manifold for the late-time entanglement wedge, and its imaginary part is the shockwave that computes the OTOC. Thus pole skipping is directly related to entanglement dynamics in holographic theories, and the origin of the pole-skipping mode is an extremal surface on the horizon. This explains the coincidence $v_B^{\text{OTOC}} = v_B^{\text{PS}} = v_B^{\text{EW}}$ in known cases, and extends it to general theories of gravity with a pole-skipping mode having the usual behavior.</description>

      <title>Oxygen-isotope effect on the density wave transitions in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The isotope effect in solid-state physics is fundamental to understanding how atomic mass influences the physical properties of materials and provides crucial insights into the role of electron-phonon coupling in the formation of various quantum states. In this study, we investigate the effect of oxygen isotope ($^{16}$O/$^{18}$O) substitution on density wave transitions in the double- and triple-layer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. The charge-density wave (CDW) transitions in both systems are influenced by isotope substitution, with the CDW transition temperature ($T_{\rm CDW}$) shifting to higher values in the $^{18}$O-substituted samples. In contrast, the isotope effect on the spin-density wave (SDW) transition temperature ($T_{\rm SDW}$) differs between the two systems. Specifically, a significant isotope effect on $T_{\rm SDW}$ is observed only in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, where the CDW and SDW orders are intertwined. This interplay results not only in equal values for $T_{\rm CDW}$ and $T_{\rm SDW}$ but also in an identical isotope effect on both transitions. In contrast, in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, where the SDW transition occurs at a temperature distinct from the CDW, no isotope effect is observed on $T_{\rm SDW}$.</description>

      <title>Boundary Scattering and Non-invertible Symmetries in 1+1 Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies by Copetti, C\'ordova and Komatsu have revealed that when non-invertible symmetries are spontaneously broken, the conventional crossing relation of the S-matrix is modified by the effects of the corresponding topological quantum field theory (TQFT). In this paper, we extend these considerations to $(1+1)$-dimensional quantum field theories (QFTs) with boundaries. In the presence of a boundary, one can define not only the bulk S-matrix but also the boundary S-matrix, which is subject to a consistency condition known as the boundary crossing relation. We show that when the boundary is weakly-symmetric under the non-invertible symmetry, the conventional boundary crossing relation also receives a modification due to the TQFT effects. As a concrete example of the boundary scattering, we analyze kink scattering in the gapped theory obtained from the $\Phi_{(1,3)}$-deformation of a minimal model. We explicitly construct the boundary S-matrix that satisfies the Ward-Takahashi identities associated with non-invertible symmetries.</description>

      <title>Stripes, pair density wave, and holon Wigner crystal in single-band Hubbard model on diagonal square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state properties of the Hubbard model on wide diagonal square cylinders, rotated by $\pi/4$ relative to the regular lattice orientation. Using state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculations with a large number of states, we convincingly demonstrate the development of a unidirectional charge density wave (CDW) characterized by infinite-length stripes along the primitive vector of square lattice in models with next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'=-0.1\sim -0.3$ and doping $\delta \sim 14\%$. Intriguingly, analysis of pair-pair correlation functions along these stripes reveals incommensurate pair density wave (PDW) superconductivity with diverged susceptibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is probably the first controlled numerical evidence of dominant PDW in the single-band Hubbard model on square lattices. At lower doping $\delta \sim 10\%$, we observed the formation of an additional CDW order within each stripe, which aligns across different stripes, forming a holon Wigner crystal phase. The spin pattern retains antiferromagnetic stripes with anti-phase domain walls. The ordering momentum of this emerged CDW order is remarkably close to the center-of-mass momentum of Cooper pairs in the PDW phase, suggesting a multifaceted relationship between CDW and PDW ordering.</description>

      <title>Fermion liquids as quantum Hall liquids in phase space: A unified approach for anomalies and responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of many strongly correlated metallic phases has inspired different routes to generalize or go beyond the celebrated Landau Fermi liquid theory. To this end, from universal consideration of symmetries and anomalies, Else, Thorngren and Senthil (ETS) have introduced a class of theories called ersatz Fermi liquids which possess a Fermi surface and satisfy a generalized Luttinger's theorem. In this work, we view all such fermion liquids obeying the Luttinger theorem as incompressible quantum Hall liquids in higher-dimensional phase space and use it as the starting point to derive their effective low-energy field theory. The noncommutativity of phase space motivates us to use the Seiberg-Witten map to derive the field theory in an ordinary (commutative) space and naturally leads to terms that correspond to the correct topological Chern-Simons action postulated by ETS in one, two, and three dimensions. Additionally, our approach also reproduces all the non-topological terms that characterize important contributions to the response, including the semiclassical equations of motion. Finally, our derivations of Chern-Simons terms from the Seiberg-Witten map also verify a longstanding conjecture in noncommutative field theory.</description>

Abstract: We develop a new method to construct simple and explicit variational approximations for the ground state of Kitaev's honeycomb model with a non-trivial Z2 flux configuration consisting of a pair of visons on neighbouring plaquettes. The method consists of retaining only the largest singular values of the generator of the transformation between the vison-pair and flux-free ground states. We compare physical quantities calculated using the approximate state to those obtained by extrapolating results of exact diagonalisation of finite lattices, finding them to be in very good agreement.

      <title>Many-body quantum geometry in time-dependent quantum systems with emergent quantum field theory instantaneously</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study many-body quantum geometric effects in time-dependent system with emergent quantum integrable field theory instantaneously. We establish a theorem stating that the Berry connection matrix thus all associated geometric quantities of the system can be precisely characterized by excitations up to two particles from the initial quantum integrable system. To illustrate the many-body geometric influence, we analyze an Ising chain subjected to both a small longitudinal field and a slowly rotating transverse field, whose low-energy physics in the scaling limit is instantaneously governed by the quantum $E_8$ integrable field theory. Focusing on the quantum geometric potential (QGP), we show the QGP continuously suppresses the instantaneous energy gaps with decreasing longitudinal field, thereby enhancing many-body Landau-Zener tunneling as evidenced by the Loschmidt echo and its associated spectral entropy. The critical threshold for the longitudinal field strength is determined,where the spectral entropy linearly increases with system size and exhibits hyperscaling behavior when approaching to the threshold. As the longitudinal field passes the threshold and decreases toward zero, the QGP continuously leads to vanishing instantaneous energy gaps involving more low-energy excitations, resulting in increasing spectral entropy indicative of many-body Landau-Zener tunneling.Our results unveil telltale quantum geometric signatures in time-dependent many-body systems, elucidating the intricate interplay between quantum geometry and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Direction-dependent conductivity in planar Hall set-ups with tilted Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10203v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the magnetoelectric conductivity tensors in planar Hall set-ups, which are built with tilted Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and multi-Weyl semimetals (mWSMs), considering all possible relative orientations of the electromagnetic fields ($\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt. The non-Drude part of the response arises from a nonzero Berry curvature in the vicinity of the WSM/mWSM node under consideration. Only in the presence of a nonzero tilt do we find linear-in-$ | \mathbf B| $ terms in set-ups where the tilt-axis is not perpendicular to the plane spanned by $\mathbf E $ and $ \mathbf B $. The advantage of the emergence of the linear-in-$ | \mathbf B| $ terms is that, unlike the various $| \mathbf B|^2 $-dependent terms that can contribute to experimental observations, they have purely a topological origin, and they dominate the overall response-characteristics in the realistic parameter regimes. The important signatures of these terms are that they (1) change the periodicity of the response from $\pi $ to $2\pi$, when we consider their dependence on the angle $\theta $ between $\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $; and (2) lead to an overall change in sign of the conductivity depending on $\theta$, when measured with respect to the $\mathbf B =0$ case.</description>

      <title>Realizing string-net condensation: Fibonacci anyon braiding for universal gates and sampling chromatic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remarkable complexity of the vacuum state of a topologically-ordered many-body quantum system encodes the character and intricate braiding interactions of its emergent particles, the anyons.} Quintessential predictions exploiting this complexity use the Fibonacci string-net condensate (Fib-SNC) and its Fibonacci anyons to go beyond classical computing. Sampling the Fib-SNC wavefunction is expected to yield estimates of the chromatic polynomial of graph objects, a classical task that is provably hard. At the same time, exchanging anyons of Fib-SNC is expected to allow fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. Nevertheless, the physical realization of Fib-SNC and its anyons remains elusive. Here, we introduce a scalable dynamical string-net preparation (DSNP) approach, suitable even for near-term quantum processors, which dynamically prepares Fib-SNC and its anyons through reconfigurable graphs. Using a superconducting quantum processor, we couple the DSNP approach with composite error-mitigation on deep circuits to successfully create, measure, and braid anyons of Fib-SNC in a scalable manner. We certify the creation of anyons by measuring their `anyon charge', finding an average experimental accuracy of $94\%$. Furthermore, we validate that exchanging these anyons yields the { expected} golden ratio~$\phi$ with~$98\%$ average accuracy and~$8\%$ measurement uncertainty. Finally, we sample the Fib-SNC to estimate the chromatic polynomial at~$\phi+2$ for {several} graphs. Our results establish the proof of principle for using Fib-SNC and its anyons for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation and {for aiming at} a classically-hard problem.</description>

      <title>More global randomness from less random local gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random circuits giving rise to unitary designs are key tools in quantum information science and many-body physics. In this work, we investigate a class of random quantum circuits with a specific gate structure. Within this framework, we prove that one-dimensional structured random circuits with non-Haar random local gates can exhibit substantially more global randomness compared to Haar random circuits with the same underlying circuit architecture. In particular, we derive all the exact eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the second-moment operators for these structured random circuits under a solvable condition, by establishing a link to the Kitaev chain, and show that their spectral gaps can exceed those of Haar random circuits. Our findings have applications in improving circuit depth bounds for randomized benchmarking and the generation of approximate unitary 2-designs from shallow random circuits.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Resistant Order in 2+1 Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High temperatures are typically thought to increase disorder. Here we examine this idea in Quantum Field Theory in 2+1 dimensions. For this sake we explore a novel class of tractable models, consisting of nearly-mean-field scalars interacting with critical scalars. We identify UV-complete, local, unitary models in this class and show that symmetry breaking $\mathbb{Z}_2 \to \emptyset$ occurs at any temperature in some regions of the phase diagram. This phenomenon, previously observed in models with fractional dimensions, or in the strict planar limits, or with non-local interactions, is now exhibited in a local, unitary 2+1 dimensional model with a finite number of fields.</description>

      <title>Atomic Origins of Magnetic Anisotropy in Ru-substituted Manganite Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy in complex oxides often originates from the complex interplay of several factors, including crystal structure, spin-orbit coupling, and electronic interactions. Recent studies on Ru-substituted $La_{0.70}Sr_{0.30}MnO_3$ (Ru-LSMO) films demonstrate emerging magnetic and magneto-transport properties, where magnetic anisotropy plays a crucial role. However, the atomic origin and underlying mechanisms of the magnetic anisotropy of this material system remain elusive. This work sheds light on these aspects. Detailed element-specific X-ray magnetic dichroism analysis suggests that Ru single ion anisotropy governs the overall magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, the magnetic property of Mn ions changes dramatically due to strong antiferromagnetic coupling between Ru and Mn ions. Our findings clarify the role of Ru single ion anisotropy behind magnetic anisotropy in Ru-LSMO, offering a promising avenue for designing advanced materials with tailored magnetic properties for next generation magnetic and spintronic technologies. As the Curie temperature of these materials is close to room temperature, such tunable magnetic anisotropy holds prospects for functional room-temperature magnetic devices.</description>

      <title>Large $N$ Wess-Zumino model at finite temperature and large chemical potential in $3d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model at large $N$ in $(2+1)$ dimension. We introduce a chemical potential($\mu$) at finite temperature($T$). The non-trivial fixed point of this model is described by a pair of coupled gap equations. This fixed point behaves as a thermal CFT for all values of the coupling. We find that at large chemical potential these coupled equations simplify and solutions become analytically tractable. We solve them analytically for all values of the coupling at this limit. The solutions admit a systematic series expansion in $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Thus, using the solutions of the gap equation at large chemical potential we can evaluate the analytic form of the partition function, stress tensor and spin-1 current as a perturbative expansion in orders of $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Applying the OPE inversion formula on the scalar and fermion two point functions of the theory, we compute higher spin currents at large $\mu$.</description>
