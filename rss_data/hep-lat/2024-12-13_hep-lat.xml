      <title>Grassmann Tensor Renormalization Group for $N_f=2$ massive Schwinger model with a $\theta$ term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Grassmann tensor renormalization group method to investigate the $N_f=2$ Schwinger model with the staggered fermions in the presence of a $2\pi$ periodic $\theta$ term in a broad range of mass. The method allows us to deal with the massive staggered fermions straightforwardly and to study the $\theta$ dependence of the free energy and topological charge in the thermodynamic limit. Our calculation provides consistent results with not only the analytical solution in the large mass limit but also the previous Monte Carlo studies in the small mass regime. Our numerical results also suggest that the $N_f=2$ Schwinger model on a lattice has a different phase structure, than the model in the continuum limit.</description>

      <title>Magnetic polarisability of octet baryons near the physical quark-mass point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic polarisabilities of octet baryons are calculated close to the physical quark-mass point using the background field method in lattice QCD. This first calculation draws on the identification and elimination of exceptional configurations that have hindered previous attempts. The origin of the exceptional configuration problem lies in the use of a Wilson-type fermion action on electro-quenched gauge field configurations, where the dynamical-fermion gauge-field generation algorithm the electric charges of the quarks. Changes in the fermion determinant that would suppress some gauge fields in the background magnetic field are neglected, leaving improbable gauge fields that generate large additive mass renormalisations which manifest as significant outliers in correlation-function distributions. An algorithm for the systematic identification and removal of these exceptional configurations is described. We find the light up and down quarks to be problematic, particularly the up quark with its larger electric charge. The heavier mass of the strange quark protects the hyperon correlation functions to some extent. However, these also benefit from the removal of exceptional configurations. In many cases, the magnetic polarisability is calculated with good precision. We find our results to be in accord with the behaviour anticipated by chiral perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Physical interpretation of the 2s excitation of the nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice QCD calculations of the $2s$ radial excitation of the nucleon place the state at an energy of approximately 1.9 GeV, raising the possibility that it is associated with the $N1/2^+(1880)$ and $N1/2^+(1710)$ resonances through mixing with two-particle meson-baryon states. The discovery of the $N1/2^+(1880)$ resonance in pion photoproduction but not in $\pi N$ scattering and the small width of the $N1/2^+(1710)$ resonance suggest that a state associated with these resonances would be insensitive to the manner in which pions are permitted to dress it. To explore this possibility, we examine the spectrum of nucleon radial excitations in both 2+1 flavour QCD and in simulations where the coupling to meson-baryon states is significantly modified through quenching. We find the energy of the $2s$ radial excitation to be insensitive to this modification for quark masses close to the physical point. This invariance provides further evidence that the $2s$ radial excitation of the nucleon is associated with the $N1/2^+(1880)$ and $N1/2^+(1710)$ resonances.</description>

      <title>Topological data analysis of the deconfinement transition in SU(3) lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the confining and deconfining phases of pure $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory with topological data analysis. This provides unique insights into long range correlations of field configurations across the confinement-deconfinement transition. Specifically, we analyze non-trivial structures in electric and magnetic field energy densities as well as Polyakov loop traces and a Polyakov loop-based variant of the topological density. The Betti curves for filtrations based on the electric and magnetic field energy densities reveal signals of electromagnetic dualities. These dualities can be associated with an interchange in the roles of local lumps of electric and magnetic energy densities around the phase transition. Moreover, we show that plaquette susceptibilities can manifest in the geometric features captured by the Betti curves. We also confront the results obtained for $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ with that for $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and elaborate on the significant differences. Our results demonstrate that topological data analysis can discriminate phase transitions of different order for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories. Moreover, it provides unprecedented insights into the relevant structures in their vicinity.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Quantization and Minkowskian Statistical Mechanics: simulations on a 1+1 lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce symplectic quantization, a novel functional approach to quantum field theory which allows to sample quantum fields fluctuations directly in Minkowski space-time, at variance with the traditional importance sampling protocols, well defined only for Euclidean Field Theory. This importance sampling procedure is realized by means of a deterministic dynamics generated by Hamilton-like equations evolving with respect to an auxiliary time parameter $\tau$. In this framework, expectation values over quantum fluctuations are computed as dynamical averages along the trajectories parameterized by $\tau$. Assuming ergodicity, this is equivalent to sample a microcanonical partition function. Then, by means of a large-M calculation, where M is the number of degrees of freedom on the lattice, we show that the microcanonical correlation functions are equivalent to those generated by a Minkowskian canonical theory where quantum fields fluctuations are weighted by the factor $\exp(S/\hbar )$, with $S$ being the original relativistic action of the system.</description>

      <title>Distillation and position-space sampling for local multiquark interpolators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distillation in lattice QCD is a smearing method that uses the lowest eigenvectors of the spatial Laplacian to construct a subspace in which the Dirac operator can be fully inverted. However, local multiquark interpolators are expensive in this framework because the cost of the contractions scales with a high power of the number of Laplacian eigenvectors. To address this, a position-space sampling method within distillation is presented that avoids this cost scaling. Our simulations show that this method works well for meson operators, but also for local tetraquark operators. In a preliminary study, we investigate the relevance of the latter for the ground state energy of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ tetraquark. There we find a downward shift in the lowest level when local tetraquark operators are added to a basis of bilocal scattering operators in the variational method. However, this shift is small compared to the error of the energy.</description>

      <title>The EFT of Large Spin Mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use effective string theory to study mesons with large spin $J$ in large $N_c$ QCD as rotating open strings. In the first part of this work, we formulate a consistent effective field theory (EFT) for open spinning strings with light quarks. Our EFT provides a consistent treatment of the endpoints' singularities that arise in the massless limit. We obtain results, in a systematic $1/J$ expansion, for the spectrum of the leading and daughter Regge trajectories. Interestingly, we find that the redshift factor associated with the quarks' acceleration implies that the applicability regime of the EFT is narrower compared to that of static flux tubes. In the second part of this work, we discuss several extensions of phenomenological interests, including mesons with heavy quarks, the quarks' spin and the daughter Regge trajectories associated with the worldsheet axion, a massive string mode identified in lattice simulations of $4d$ flux tubes. We compare our predictions with $4d$ QCD spectroscopy data, and suggest potential $stringy$ interpretations of the observed mesons. We finally comment on the relation between the EFT spectrum and the Axionic String Ansatz, a recently proposed characterization of the spectrum of Yang-Mills glueballs.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping time-evolution in quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for obtaining a hierarchy of rigorous bounds on the time-evolution of a quantum mechanical system from an arbitrary initial state, systematically generalizing Mandelstam-Tamm-like relations. For any fixed level in the hierarchy, the bounds are tightest after short time-evolution and gradually loosen over time; we present evidence that for any fixed amount of time-evolution, the bounds can be made arbitrarily tight by moving up in the hierarchy. The computational effort to obtain the bounds scales polynomially with the number of degrees of freedom in the system being simulated. We demonstrate the method on both a single anharmonic oscillator and a system of two coupled anharmonic oscillators.</description>

      <title>Testing the RG-flow $M(3,10)+\phi_{1,7}\to M(3,8)$ with Hamiltonian Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian Truncation (HT) methods provide a powerful numerical approach for investigating strongly coupled QFTs. In this work, we develop HT techniques to analyse a specific Renormalization Group (RG) flow recently proposed in Refs. [1, 3]. These studies put forward Ginzburg-Landau descriptions for the conformal minimal models $M(3,10)$ and $M(3,8)$, as well as the RG flow connecting them. Specifically, the RG-flow is defined by deforming the $M(3,10)$ with the relevant primary operator $\phi_{1,7}$ (whose indices denote its position in the Kac table), yielding $M(3,10)+ \phi_{1,7}$. From the perspective of HT, realising such an RG-flow presents significant challenges, as the $\phi_{1,7}$ deformation requires renormalizing the UV theory up to third order in the coupling constant of the deformation. In this study, we carry out the necessary calculations to formulate HT for this theory and numerically investigate the spectrum of $M(3,10)+ \phi_{1,7}$ in the large coupling regime, finding strong evidence in favour of the proposed flow.</description>

      <title>Gauge-invariant scalar and vector operators in the $SU\left(2\right)\times U\left(1\right)$ Higgs model: Ward identities and renormalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the renormalization of the gauge-invariant composite operators proposed in \cite{Dudal:2023jsu} to describe the $SU(2)\times U(1)$ Higgs model from a gauge-invariant perspective. To establish the relationship between the counterterms, we use the Algebraic Renormalization approach \cite{Piguet:1995er}. Therefore, we also derive the set of Ward identities of the model after introducing these composite operators. Using these Ward identities, we demonstrate important exact relations between the correlation functions of elementary fields and composite fields.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD Calculation of $x$-dependent Meson Distribution Amplitudes at Physical Pion Mass with Threshold Logarithm Resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculation of the $x$-dependent pion and kaon distribution amplitudes (DA) in the framework of large momentum effective theory. This calculation is performed on a fine lattice of $a=0.076$ fm at physical pion mass, with the pion boosted to $1.8$ GeV and kaon boosted to $2.3$ GeV. We renormalize the matrix elements in the hybrid scheme and match to $\overline{\rm MS }$ with a subtraction of the leading renormalon in the Wilson-line mass. The perturbative matching is improved by resumming the large logarithms related to the small quark and gluon momenta in the soft-gluon limit. After resummation, we demonstrate that we are able to calculate a range of $x\in[x_0,1-x_0]$ with $x_0=0.25$ for pion and $x_0=0.2$ for kaon with theoretical systematic errors under control. The kaon DA is shown to be slighted skewed, and narrower than pion DA. Although the $x$-dependence cannot be direct calculated beyond these ranges, we estimate higher moments of the pion and kaon DAs by complementing our calculation with short-distance factorization.</description>

      <title>Revisiting light-flavor diquarks in the inverse matrix method of QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study reexamines the spectroscopic parameters of light-flavor diquarks within the framework of quantum chromodynamics sum rules (QCDSR) using the inverse matrix method. Conventional QCDSR analyses are based on assumptions such as quark-hadron duality and continuum models, which introduce a degree of systematic uncertainty. The inverse matrix method circumvents these assumptions by reformulating the problem as an inverse integral equation and expanding the unknown spectral density using orthogonal Laguerre polynomials. This method allows for a direct determination of spectral densities, thereby enhancing the precision of predictions regarding resonance masses and decay constants. By employing this methodology with regard to light-flavor diquarks ($sq$ and $ud$), it is possible to extract the associated masses and decay constants. The results indicate that the masses of diquarks with quantum numbers $J^P = 0^+$ and $J^P = 0^-$ are nearly degenerate. We compare our results regarding masses and decay constants with those of other theoretical predictions, which could prove a useful complementary tool in interpretation. Our results are consistent with those in the literature and can be shown as evidence for the consistency of the method. The results achieved in this study highlight the potential of the inverse matrix method as a robust tool for exploring nonperturbative QCD phenomena and elucidating the internal structure of exotic hadronic systems.</description>
