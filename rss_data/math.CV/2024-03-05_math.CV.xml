      <title>The P\'olya-Tchebotarev problem with semiclassical external fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical P\'olya-Tchebotarev problem, commonly stated as a max-min logarithmic energy problem, asks for finding a compact of minimal capacity in the complex plane which connects a prescribed collection of fixed points. Variants of this problem have found ramifications and applications in the theory of non-hermitian orthogonal polynomials, random matrices, approximation theory, among others. Here we consider an extension of this classical problem, including a semiclassical external field, and enforcing finitely many prescribed collections of points to be connected, possibly also to infinity. Our method is based on Rakhmanov's approach to max-min problems in logarithmic potential theory, utilizes the developed machinery by Mart\'inez-Finkelshtein and Rakhmanov on critical measures, and extends the development of Kuijlaars and the second named author from the context of polynomial external fields to the semiclassical case considered here.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity and fundamental groups of complex quasi-projective varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between the hyperbolicity of complex quasi-projective varieties $X$ and the (topological) fundamental group $\pi_1(X)$ in the presence of a linear representation $\varrho: \pi_1(X) \to {\rm GL}_N(\mathbb{C})$. We present our main results in three parts.
  Firstly, we show that if $\varrho$ is bigand the Zariski closure of $\varrho(\pi_1(X))$ semisimple, then for any $X^\sigma:=X\times_\sigma\mathbb{C}$ where $\sigma\in {\rm Aut}(\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Q})$, there exists a proper Zariski closed subset $Z \subsetneqq X^\sigma$ such that any closed irreducible subvariety $V$ of $X^\sigma$ not contained in $Z$ is of log general type, and any holomorphic map from the punctured disk $\mathbb{D}^*$ to $X^\sigma$ with image not contained in $Z$ does not have an essential singularity at the origin. In particular, all entire curves in $X^\sigma$ lie on $Z$. We provide examples to illustrate the optimality of this condition.
  Secondly, assuming that $\varrho$ is big and reductive, we prove the generalized Green-Griffiths-Lang conjecture for $X^\sigma$. Furthermore, if $\varrho$ is large, we show that the special subsets of $X^\sigma$ that capture the non-hyperbolicity locus of $X^\sigma$ from different perspectives are equal, and this subset is proper if and only if $X$ is of log general type.
  Lastly, we prove that if $X$ is a special quasi-projective manifold in the sense of Campana or $h$-special, then $\varrho(\pi_1(X))$ is virtually nilpotent. We provides examples to demonstrate that this result is sharp and thus revise Campana's abelianity conjecture for smooth quasi-projective varieties.
  To prove these theorems, we develop new features in non-abelian Hodge theory, geometric group theory, and Nevanlinna theory. Some byproducts are obtained.</description>
