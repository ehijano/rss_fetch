      <title>Fluctuating interfaces in barotropic beta-plane turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zonal jets manifest themselves as bands with sharp interfaces in the vorticity configuration. We develop an algorithm to track these fluctuating vorticity interfaces and systematically investigate their characteristic spatio-temporal behavior. While the interfacial height fluctuations are typically sub-Gaussian, the corresponding $\textit{fluctuation speeds}$ exhibit wider, heavy-tailed distributions reflecting the influence of lateral dispersion induced by the zonal velocity profile along the interfacial contours. The temporal evolution of these fluctuations is further characterized through their power spectrum displaying scale invariance in the frequency domain. The sharp, dense, shock-like features present in the time series of the $\textit{height}$ field suggest a possible lacking of differentiability. We confirm this by calculating the moments of the time-increments of the interfacial height fluctuations. Finally, the fractal nature of these boundaries is investigated systematically through a multifractal approach, revealing the non-trivial, complex statistics of interfaces in such geophysical, turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Reduced Cloud Cover Errors in a Hybrid AI-Climate Model Through Equation Discovery And Automatic Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04358</link>

Abstract: Cloud-related parameterizations remain a leading source of uncertainty in climate projections. Although machine learning holds promise for Earth system models (ESMs), many data-driven parameterizations lack interpretability, physical consistency, and smooth integration into ESMs. Here, a two-step method is presented to improve a climate model with data-driven parameterizations. First, we incorporate a physically consistent cloud cover parameterization -- derived from storm-resolving simulations via symbolic regression, preserving interpretability while enhancing accuracy -- into the ICON global atmospheric model. Second, we apply the gradient-free Nelder-Mead optimizer to automatically recalibrate the hybrid model against Earth observations, tuning in nested stages (2-, 7-, 30- and 365-day runs) to ensure stability and tractability. The tuned hybrid model substantially reduces long-standing biases in cloud cover -- particularly over the Southern Ocean (by 75%) and subtropical stratocumulus regions (by 37%) -- and remains robust under +4K surface warming. These results demonstrate that interpretable machine-learned parameterizations, paired with practical tuning, can efficiently and transparently strengthen ESM fidelity.</description>

      <title>Climate in a Bottle: Towards a Generative Foundation Model for the Kilometer-Scale Global Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06474</link>

Abstract: Climate modeling is reaching unprecedented resolution, producing petabytes of data. AI climate model emulators offer a path to computationally cheap analysis, enabling new scientific insight and scenario planning. Recent advances show promise in faithfully emulating climate data. However, prevailing auto-regressive paradigms are difficult to train on climate time horizons due to drifts, instabilities, and component-coupling challenges. They are hard to scale to high resolution and require sifting through troves of output to identify rare extremes of interest. We present Climate in a Bottle (cBottle), a generative diffusion-based framework emulating global 5 km climate simulations and reanalysis on the HEALPix grid. cBottle samples directly from the full distribution of atmospheric states, avoiding auto-regressive rollout, and is the first to reach this 12.5M-pixel global resolution. It consists of two stages: a coarse-resolution generator conditioned on sea surface temperatures and solar position, followed by a patch-based 16x super-resolution stage. cBottle passes a battery of tests, including diurnal-to-seasonal variability, large-scale modes of variability, tropical cyclone statistics, and trends of climate change and weather extremes. It is a step toward a foundation model: bridging data modalities (reanalysis and simulation), enabling zero-shot bias correction, downscaling, and data infilling. It also enables new interactivity via guided diffusion. For example, we train a tropical cyclone (TC) classifier alongside the generator, guide towards TC states, and obtain physically credible samples. This opens the door to guidance methods for a wide array of user queries and new ways of interacting with climate data.</description>
