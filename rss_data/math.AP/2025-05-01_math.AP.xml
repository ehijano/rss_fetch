      <title>Existence of variational solutions to doubly nonlinear systems in nondecreasing domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $q \in (0, \infty)$, we consider the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem to doubly nonlinear systems of the form \begin{align*}
  \partial_t \big( |u|^{q-1}u \big) - \operatorname{div} \big( D_\xi f(x,u,Du) \big) = - D_u f(x,u,Du) \end{align*} in a bounded noncylindrical domain $E \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. We assume that $x \mapsto f(x,u,\xi)$ is integrable, that $(u,\xi) \mapsto f(x,u,\xi)$ is convex, and that $f$ satisfies a $p$-coercivity condition for some $p \in (1,\infty)$. However, we do not impose any specific growth condition from above on $f$. For nondecreasing domains that merely satisfy $\mathcal{L}^{n+1}(\partial E) = 0$, we prove the existence of variational solutions $u \in C^{0}([0,T];L^{q+1}(E,\mathbb{R}^N))$ via a nonlinear version of the method of minimizing movements. Moreover, under additional assumptions on $E$ and a $p$-growth condition on $f$, we show that $|u|^{q-1}u$ admits a weak time derivative in the dual $(V^{p,0}(E))^{\prime}$ of the subspace $V^{p,0}(E) \subset L^p(0,T;W^{1,p}(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^N))$ that encodes zero boundary values.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of Solutions to classes of parabolic inequalities in the Riemannian setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish conditions for nonexistence of global solutions for a class of quasilinear parabolic problems with a potential on complete, non-compact Riemannian manifolds, including the Porous Medium Equation and the p-Laplacian with a potential term. Our results reveal the interplay between the manifold's geometry, the power nonlinearity, and the potential's behavior at infinity. Using a test function argument, we identify explicit parameter ranges where nonexistence holds.</description>

      <title>Local classical solutions of a kinetic equation for three waves interactions in presence of a Dirac measure at the origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of local, classical solutions is proved, for a system of two coupled equations that describe, in the framework of the wave turbulence theory, the fluctuations around an equilibrium, of a system of nonlinear waves satisfying the 3-d cubic Schr\"odinger equation, weakly interacting in presence of a condensate. The function that describes the density of waves behaves like a singular Rayleigh Jeans equilibria near the origin, and induces a strictly increasing behavior in time of the function describing the condensate's density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a nonlinear logistic model for age-structured population dynamics. The model incorporates interdependent fertility and mortality functions within a logistic framework, offering insights into stationary solutions and asymptotic behavior. Theoretical findings establish conditions for the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium solutions and explore long-term population dynamics. This study provides valuable tools for demographic modeling and opens avenues for further mathematical exploration.</description>

      <title>Gravity water waves over constant vorticity flows: From laminar flows to touching waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Hur &amp; Wheeler [J. Differential Equations, 338:572-590, 2022] proved the existence of periodic steady water waves over an infinitely deep, two-dimensional and constant vorticity flow under the influence of gravity. These solutions include overhanging wave profiles, some of which exhibit surfaces that touch at a point and thereby enclose a bubble of air. We extend these results by formulating a problem that encompasses both infinitely deep and finitely deep flows, and by proving the existence of a continuous curve of water waves that connects a laminar flow to a touching wave for fixed, nonzero gravity. This implies the existence of a wave profile featuring a vertical tangent at a point, which is not overhanging, and is referred to as a breaking wave. We also study the behaviour of critical layers, which are points where the horizontal velocity vanishes, near the surface.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness Domains for ${\bf L}^\infty$ Solutions of $2 \times 2$ Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a genuinely nonlinear $2\times 2$ hyperbolic system of conservation laws, assuming that the initial data have small ${\bf L}^\infty$ norm but possibly unbounded total variation, the existence of global solutions was proved in a classical paper by Glimm and Lax (1970). In general, the total variation of these solutions decays like $t^{-1}$. Motivated by the theory of fractional domains for linear analytic semigroups, we consider here solutions with faster decay rate: $\hbox{Tot.Var.}\bigl\{u(t,\cdot)\bigr\}\leq C t^{\alpha-1}$. For these solutions, a uniqueness theorem is proved. Indeed, as the initial data range over a domain of functions with $\|\bar u\|_{{\bf L}^\infty} \leq\varepsilon_1$ small enough, solutions with fast decay yield a H\"older continuous semigroup. The H\"older exponent can be taken arbitrarily close to $1$ by further shrinking the value of $\varepsilon_1&gt;0$. An auxiliary result identifies a class of initial data whose solutions have rapidly decaying total variation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the well-posedness and solution regularity of an evolution equation with non-positive type variable-exponent memory, which describes multiscale viscoelasticity in materials with memory. The perturbation method is applied for model transformation, based on which the well-posedness is proved. Then the weighted solution regularity is derived, where the initial singularity is characterized by the initial value of variable exponent.</description>

      <title>Post-Lie deformations of pre-Lie algebras and their applications in Regularity Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study post-Lie deformations of a pre-Lie algebra, namely deforming a pre-Lie algebra into a post-Lie algebra. We construct the differential graded Lie algebra that governs post-Lie deformations of a pre-Lie algebra. We also develop the post-Lie cohomology theory for a pre-Lie algebra, by which we classify infinitesimal post-Lie deformations of a pre-Lie algebra using the second cohomology group. The rigidity of such kind of deformations is also characterized using the second cohomology group. Finally, we apply this deformation theory to Regularity Structures. We prove that the post-Lie algebraic structure on the decorated trees which appears spontaneously in Regularity Structures is a post-Lie deformation of a pre-Lie algebra.</description>

Abstract: We study the differential inclusion $Du\in K$, where $K$ is an unbounded and rotationally invariant subset of the real symmetric $3\times 3$ matrices. We exhibit a subset of all possible average fields. The corresponding microgeometries are laminates of infinite rank. The problem originated in the search for the effective conductivity of polycrystalline composites. In the latter context, our result is an improvement of the previously known bounds established by Nesi $\&amp;$ Milton, hence proving the optimality of a new full-measure class of microgeometries.</description>

      <title>Ground states of a coupled pseudo-relativistic Hartree system: existence and concentration behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the ground states of a coupled pseudo-relativistic Hartree system in $\mathbb{R} ^{3} $ with trapping potentials, where the intraspecies and the interspecies interaction are both attractive. By investigating an associated constraint minimization problem, the existence and non-existence of ground states are classified completely. Under certain conditions on the trapping potentials, we present a precise analysis on the concentration behavior of the minimizers as the coupling coefficient goes to a critical value, where the minimizers blow up and the maximum point sequence concentrates at a global minima of the associated trapping potentials. We also identify an optimal blowing up rate under polynomial potentials by establishing some delicate estimates of energy functionals.</description>

Abstract: We deal with Calder\'on's problem in a layered anisotropic medium $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\geq 3$, with complex anisotropic admittivity $\sigma=\gamma A$, where $A$ is a known Lipschitz matrix-valued function. We assume that the layers of $\Omega$ are fixed and known and that $\gamma$ is an unknown affine complex-valued function on each layer. We provide H\"{o}lder and Lipschitz stability estimates of $\sigma$ in terms of an ad hoc misfit functional as well as the more classical Dirichlet to Neumann map localised on some open portion $\Sigma$ of $\partial\Omega$, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present several identities with a form of polynomials or rational functions that involve Pochhammer and q-Pochhammer symbols and q-binomials (i.e. Gauss polynomials). All these identities were obtained by some analytical methods based on infinite expansions of the ratio of densities in a Fourier series of polynomials orthogonal with respect to the density in the denominator. We want a unified approach to justify many known and unknown identities. The purpose of studying these identities is to simplify calculations occurring while dealing with Pochhammer and q-Pochhammer symbols. Additional possible applications of the results presented in the paper are applications within the Combinatorics and the transformation formulae of hypergeometric and basic hypergeometric functions.</description>

Under certain assumptions on the trapping potentials $V_i(x) \ (i=1,2),$ we derive some delicate estimates for the related energy functional and establish a criterion for the existence and non-existence of solutions, in which way several existence results are obtained.</description>

      <title>A Note on Continuous dependence of Navier-Stokes equations with oscillating force</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the averaging effect of a highly oscillating external force on the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations. We show that, as long as the force time-average decays over time, if the frequency and amplitude of the oscillating force grow, then the corresponding solutions to Navier-Stokes equations converge (in a suitable topology) to the solution of the homogeneous equations with same initial data. Our approach involves reformulating the system as an abstract evolution equation in a Banach space, and then proving continuous dependence of solutions on both initial conditions and the external forcing.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the Dirichlet problem for a non-divergence form elliptic operator $L$ in a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^2$. Assuming that the principal coefficients satisfy the Dini mean oscillation condition, we establish the equivalence between regular points for $L$ and those for the Laplace operator. This result closes a gap left in the authors' recent work on higher-dimensional cases (Math. Ann. 392(1): 573--618, 2025). Furthermore, we construct the Green's function for $L$ in regular two-dimensional domains, extending a result by Dong and Kim (SIAM J. Math. Anal. 53(4): 4637--4656, 2021).</description>

      <title>Long-time dynamics for the Kelvin-Helmholtz equations close to circular vortex sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Kelvin-Helmholtz system describing the evolution of a vortex-sheet near the circular stationary solution. Answering previous numerical conjectures in the 90s physics literature, we prove an almost global existence result for small-amplitude solutions. We first establish the existence of a linear stability threshold for the Weber number, which represents the ratio between the square of the background velocity jump and the surface tension. Then, we prove that for almost all values of the Weber number below this threshold any small solution lives for almost all times, remaining close to the equilibrium. Our analysis reveals a remarkable stabilization phenomenon: the presence of both non-zero background velocity jump and capillarity effects enables to prevent nonlinear instability phenomena, despite the inherently unstable nature of the classical Kelvin-Helmholtz problem. This long-time existence would not be achievable in a setting where capillarity alone provides linear stabilization, without the richer modulation induced by the velocity jump. Our proof exploits the Hamiltonian nature of the equations. Specifically, we employ Hamiltonian Birkhoff normal form techniques for quasi-linear systems together with a general approach for paralinearization of non-linear singular integral operators. This approach allows us to control resonances and quasi-resonances at arbitrary order, ensuring the desired long-time stability result.</description>

      <title>A decomposition lemma in convex integration via classical algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a decomposition lemma that allows error terms to be expressed using fewer rank-one symmetric matrices than $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ within the convex integration scheme of constructing flexible $C^{1,\alpha}$ solutions to a system of nonlinear PDEs in dimension $n\geq 2$, which can be viewed as a kind of truncation of the codimension one local isometric embedding equation in Nash-Kuiper Theorem. This leads to flexible solutions with higher H\"older regularity, and consequently, improved very weak solutions to certain induced equations for any $n$, including Monge-Amp\`ere systems and $2$-Hessian systems. The H\"older exponent of the solutions can be taken as any $\alpha &lt;(n^2+1)^{-1}$ for $n=2,4,8,16$, and any $\alpha&lt;(n^2+n-2\rho(\frac{n}{2})-1)^{-1}$ for other $n$, thereby improving the previously known bound $\alpha&lt;(n^2+n+1)^{-1}$ for $n\geq 3$. Here, $\rho(n)$ is the Radon-Hurwitz number, which exhibits an $8$-fold periodicity on $n$ that is related to Bott periodicity.
  Our arguments involve novel applications of several results from algebraic geometry and topology, including Adams' theorem on maximum linearly independent vector fields on spheres, the intersection of projective varieties, and projective duality. We also use an elliptic method ingeniously that avoids loss of differentiability.</description>

      <title>Solutions to the stochastic thin-film equation for the range of mobility exponents $n\in (2,3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, many existence results for the stochastic thin-film equation were established in the case of a quadratic mobility exponent $n=2$, in which the noise term $\partial_x(u^\frac{n}{2}\mathcal{W})$ becomes linear. In the case of a non-quadratic mobility exponent, results are only available in the situation that $n\ge \frac{8}{3}$ leaving the interval of mobility exponents $n\in (2,\frac{8}{3})$ untreated. In this article we resolve the current gap in the literature by presenting a proof, which works under the assumption $n\in (2,3)$, i.e., the regime of weak slippage. The key idea is to use that the $\log$-entropy dissipation coincides with the energy production due to the noise. To realize this idea, we approximate the stochastic thin-film equation by stochastic thin-film equations with inhomogeneous mobility functions, which behave like a higher power near $0$. As a consequence the approximate solutions are non-negative, which is vital to use the $\log$-entropy estimate.</description>

      <title>The Ricci iteration towards cscK metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the problem of finding constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics, we investigate a Ricci iteration sequence of Rubinstein that discretizes the pseudo-Calabi flow. While the long time existence of the flow is still an open question, we show that the iteration sequence does exist for all steps, along which the K-energy decreases. We further show that the iteration sequence, modulo automorphisms, converges smoothly to a constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metric if there is one, thus confirming a conjecture of Rubinstein from 2007 and extending results of Darvas--Rubinstein to arbitrary K\"ahler classes.</description>

      <title>$PINN - a Domain Decomposition Method for Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19013v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a novel computational approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with noisy and sparse initial and boundary data. Although, efficient quantification of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in big multi-scale problems remains challenging. We propose \$PINN a novel method of computing global uncertainty in PDEs using a Bayesian framework, by combining local Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks (BPINN) with domain decomposition. The solution continuity across subdomains is obtained by imposing the flux continuity across the interface of neighboring subdomains. To demonstrate the effectiveness of \$PINN, we conduct a series of computational experiments on PDEs in 1D and 2D spatial domains. Although we have adopted conservative PINNs (cPINNs), the method can be seamlessly extended to other domain decomposition techniques. The results infer that the proposed method recovers the global uncertainty by computing the local uncertainty exactly more efficiently as the uncertainty in each subdomain can be computed concurrently. The robustness of \$PINN is verified by adding uncorrelated random noise to the training data up to 15% and testing for different domain sizes.</description>
