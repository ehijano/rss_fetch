      <title>Resonance for life: Metabolism and Social Interactions in Bacterial Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The social organization of microorganisms has long been a fascinating and challenging subject in both biology and sociology. In these organisms, the role of the individual is far less dominant than that of the community, which functions as a superorganism. The coordination is achieved through a communication mechanism known as quorum sensing. When the community is healthy, quorum sensing enables it to regulate the development of potentially harmful individuals. This study employs an agent-based quorum sensing model to explore the relationship between metabolic functions and social behavior. It also examines how a polyculture responds to variations in the metabolic characteristics of its components. Finally, we identify a particularly stable condition in which the components cooperate to maximize the overall health of the colony. We refer to this state as resonance for life.</description>

      <title>Resonance-Driven Mechanisms of Ion Transport and Selectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion channels selectively transport ions, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We propose a physical model based on the Driven Damped Harmonic Oscillator (DDHO), where self-organizing turbulent structures in the ionic flow generate oscillating pressure waves and toroidal vortices. These structures drive aqua-ions into resonance, facilitating the shedding of hydration shells and enabling ion permeation as free ions.
  To capture the spatiotemporal complexity of this process, we develop a macroscopic continuum model integrating the Navier--Stokes equations, Gauss's law, and convection-diffusion dynamics. Numerical simulations reveal strong oscillations that drive dehydration and ionic jet formation, supporting the DDHO mechanism. Model predictions closely match patch-clamp experimental data.
  The DDHO framework predicts a frequency-dependent resonance response, effectively acting as a selective filter. Applied to experimental data, the model reveals distinct separation between ion species and hydration states, quantified by a high Mahalanobis distance and oscillator quality factor.
  Furthermore, the model provides insight into the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on ion selectivity. Mutations that alter channel geometry shift resonance peaks, disrupting selective transport and potentially leading to genetic disorders.</description>

      <title>Spatial competition and repulsion: pattern formation and the role of movement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter investigates some mechanisms behind pattern formation driven by competitive-only or repelling interactions, and explores how these patterns are influenced by different types of particle movement. Despite competition and repulsion are both anti-crowding interactions, collective effects may lead to clusters of individuals, which can arrange periodically. Through the analysis of two models, it provides insights into the similarities and differences in the patterns formed and underlines the role of movement in shaping the spatial distribution of biological populations.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Analysis of Relative Pressure Estimation Methods Utilizing 4D Flow MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 4D flow MRI allows for the estimation of three-dimensional relative pressure fields, providing rich pressure information, unlike catheterization and Doppler echocardiography, which provide one-dimensional pressure drops only. The accuracy of one-dimensional pressure drops derived from 4D flow has been explored in previous literature, but additional work must be done to evaluate the accuracy of three-dimensional relative pressure fields. This work presents an analysis of three state-of-the-art relative pressure estimators: virtual Work-Energy Relative Pressure (vWERP), the Pressure Poisson Estimator (PPE), and the Stokes Estimator (STE). Spatiotemporal behavior and sensitivity to noise were determined in silico. Estimators were validated with a type B aortic dissection (TBAD) flow phantom with varying tear geometry and an array of twelve catheter pressure measurements. Finally, the performance of each estimator was evaluated across eight patient cases. In silico pressure field errors were lower in STE compared to PPE, although PPE pressures were less affected by noise. High velocity gradients and low spatial resolution contributed most significantly to local variations in 3D error fields. Low temporal resolution leads to highly transient peak pressure events being averaged, systematically underestimating peak pressures. In the flow phantom analysis, vWERP was the most accurate method, followed by STE and PPE. Each pressure estimator strongly correlated with ground truth pressure values despite the tendency to underestimate peak pressures. Patient case results demonstrated that the pressure estimators could be feasibly integrated into a clinical workflow.</description>

      <title>P2DFlow: A Protein Ensemble Generative Model with SE(3) Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological processes, functions, and properties are intricately linked to the ensemble of protein conformations, rather than being solely determined by a single stable conformation. In this study, we have developed P2DFlow, a generative model based on SE(3) flow matching, to predict the structural ensembles of proteins. We specifically designed a valuable prior for the flow process and enhanced the model's ability to distinguish each intermediate state by incorporating an additional dimension to describe the ensemble data, which can reflect the physical laws governing the distribution of ensembles, so that the prior knowledge can effectively guide the generation process. When trained and evaluated on the MD datasets of ATLAS, P2DFlow outperforms other baseline models on extensive experiments, successfully capturing the observable dynamic fluctuations as evidenced in crystal structure and MD simulations. As a potential proxy agent for protein molecular simulation, the high-quality ensembles generated by P2DFlow could significantly aid in understanding protein functions across various scenarios.
