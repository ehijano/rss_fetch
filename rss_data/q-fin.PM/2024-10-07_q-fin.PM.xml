      <title>Two-fund separation under hyperbolically distributed returns and concave utility function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portfolio selection problems that optimize expected utility are usually difficult to solve. If the number of assets in the portfolio is large, such expected utility maximization problems become even harder to solve numerically. Therefore, analytical expressions for optimal portfolios are always preferred.
  In our work, we study portfolio optimization problems under the expected utility criterion for a wide range of utility functions, assuming return vectors follow hyperbolic distributions. Our main result demonstrates that under this setup, the two-fund monetary separation holds. Specifically, an individual with any utility function from this broad class will always choose to hold the same portfolio of risky assets, only adjusting the mix between this portfolio and a riskless asset based on their initial wealth and the specific utility function used for decision making. We provide explicit expressions for this mutual fund of risky assets. As a result, in our economic model, an individual's optimal portfolio is expressed in closed form as a linear combination of the riskless asset and the mutual fund of risky assets.
  Additionally, we discuss expected utility maximization problems under exponential utility functions over any domain of the portfolio set. In this part of our work, we show that the optimal portfolio in any given convex domain of the portfolio set either lies on the boundary of the domain or is the unique globally optimal portfolio within the entire domain.</description>

      <title>Improving Portfolio Optimization Results with Bandit Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (RL), multi-armed Bandit (MAB) problems have found applications across diverse domains such as recommender systems, healthcare, and finance. Traditional MAB algorithms typically assume stationary reward distributions, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios characterized by non-stationary dynamics. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing and evaluating novel Bandit algorithms designed for non-stationary environments. First, we present the \textit{Adaptive Discounted Thompson Sampling} (ADTS) algorithm, which enhances adaptability through relaxed discounting and sliding window mechanisms to better respond to changes in reward distributions. We then extend this approach to the Portfolio Optimization problem by introducing the \textit{Combinatorial Adaptive Discounted Thompson Sampling} (CADTS) algorithm, which addresses computational challenges within Combinatorial Bandits and improves dynamic asset allocation. Additionally, we propose a novel architecture called Bandit Networks, which integrates the outputs of ADTS and CADTS, thereby mitigating computational limitations in stock selection. Through extensive experiments using real financial market data, we demonstrate the potential of these algorithms and architectures in adapting to dynamic environments and optimizing decision-making processes. For instance, the proposed bandit network instances present superior performance when compared to classic portfolio optimization approaches, such as capital asset pricing model, equal weights, risk parity, and Markovitz, with the best network presenting an out-of-sample Sharpe Ratio 20\% higher than the best performing classical model.</description>

      <title>Signature Methods in Stochastic Portfolio Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of stochastic portfolio theory we introduce a novel class of portfolios which we call linear path-functional portfolios. These are portfolios which are determined by certain transformations of linear functions of a collections of feature maps that are non-anticipative path functionals of an underlying semimartingale. As main example for such feature maps we consider the signature of the (ranked) market weights. We prove that these portfolios are universal in the sense that every continuous, possibly path-dependent, portfolio function of the market weights can be uniformly approximated by signature portfolios. We also show that signature portfolios can approximate the growth-optimal portfolio in several classes of non-Markovian market models arbitrarily well and illustrate numerically that the trained signature portfolios are remarkably close to the theoretical growth-optimal portfolios. Besides these universality features, the main numerical advantage lies in the fact that several optimization tasks like maximizing (expected) logarithmic wealth or mean-variance optimization within the class of linear path-functional portfolios reduce to a convex quadratic optimization problem, thus making it computationally highly tractable. We apply our method also to real market data based on several indices. Our results point towards out-performance on the considered out-of-sample data, also in the presence of transaction costs.</description>
