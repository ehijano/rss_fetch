      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Toolpath Generation for Thermal Uniformity in Laser Powder Bed Fusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is a widely used metal additive manufacturing technology. However, the accumulation of internal residual stress during printing can cause significant distortion and potential failure. Although various scan patterns have been studied to reduce possible accumulated stress, such as zigzag scanning vectors with changing directions or a chessboard-based scan pattern with divided small islands, most conventional scan patterns cannot significantly reduce residual stress. The proposed adaptive toolpath generation (ATG) algorithms, aiming to minimize the thermal gradients, may result in extremely accumulated temperature fields in some cases. To address these issues, we developed a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based toolpath generation framework, with the goal of achieving uniformly distributed heat and avoiding extremely thermal accumulation regions during the LPBF process. We first developed an overall pipeline for the DRL-based toolpath generation framework, which includes uniformly sampling, agent moving and environment observation, action selection, moving constraints, rewards calculation, and the training process. To accelerate the training process, we simplified the data-intensive numerical model by considering the turning angles on the toolpath. We designed the action spaces with three options, including the minimum temperature value, the smoothest path, and the second smoothest path. The reward function was designed to minimize energy density to ensure the temperature field remains relatively stable. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed DRL-based toolpath generation framework, we performed numerical simulations of polygon shape printing domains. In addition, four groups of thin plate samples with different scan patterns were compared using the LPBF process.</description>

      <title>HomoGenius: a Foundation Model of Homogenization for Rapid Prediction of Effective Mechanical Properties using Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homogenization is an essential tool for studying multiscale physical phenomena. However, traditional numerical homogenization, heavily reliant on finite element analysis, requires extensive computation costs, particularly in handling complex geometries, materials, and high-resolution problems. To address these limitations, we propose a numerical homogenization model based on operator learning: HomoGenius. The proposed model can quickly provide homogenization results for arbitrary geometries, materials, and resolutions, increasing the efficiency by a factor of 80 compared to traditional numerical homogenization methods. We validate effectiveness of our model in predicting the effective elastic modulus on periodic materials (TPMS: Triply Periodic Minimal Surface), including complex geometries, various Poisson's ratios and elastic modulus, and different resolutions for training and testing. The results show that our model possesses high precision, super efficiency, and learning capability.</description>

      <title>Detection of financial opportunities in micro-blogging data with a stacked classification system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micro-blogging sources such as the Twitter social network provide valuable real-time data for market prediction models. Investors' opinions in this network follow the fluctuations of the stock markets and often include educated speculations on market opportunities that may have impact on the actions of other investors. In view of this, we propose a novel system to detect positive predictions in tweets, a type of financial emotions which we term "opportunities" that are akin to "anticipation" in Plutchik's theory. Specifically, we seek a high detection precision to present a financial operator a substantial amount of such tweets while differentiating them from the rest of financial emotions in our system. We achieve it with a three-layer stacked Machine Learning classification system with sophisticated features that result from applying Natural Language Processing techniques to extract valuable linguistic information. Experimental results on a dataset that has been manually annotated with financial emotion and ticker occurrence tags demonstrate that our system yields satisfactory and competitive performance in financial opportunity detection, with precision values up to 83%. This promising outcome endorses the usability of our system to support investors' decision making.</description>

      <title>RiskLabs: Predicting Financial Risk Using Large Language Model Based on Multi-Sources Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly large language models (LLMs), in finance has garnered increasing academic attention. Despite progress, existing studies predominantly focus on tasks like financial text summarization, question-answering (Q$\&amp;$A), and stock movement prediction (binary classification), with a notable gap in the application of LLMs for financial risk prediction. Addressing this gap, in this paper, we introduce \textbf{RiskLabs}, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze and predict financial risks. RiskLabs uniquely combines different types of financial data, including textual and vocal information from Earnings Conference Calls (ECCs), market-related time series data, and contextual news data surrounding ECC release dates. Our approach involves a multi-stage process: initially extracting and analyzing ECC data using LLMs, followed by gathering and processing time-series data before the ECC dates to model and understand risk over different timeframes. Using multimodal fusion techniques, RiskLabs amalgamates these varied data features for comprehensive multi-task financial risk prediction. Empirical experiment results demonstrate RiskLab's effectiveness in forecasting both volatility and variance in financial markets. Through comparative experiments, we demonstrate how different data sources contribute to financial risk assessment and discuss the critical role of LLMs in this context. Our findings not only contribute to the AI in finance application but also open new avenues for applying LLMs in financial risk assessment.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Primitive Conservative Solver for the Euler Equations with Arbitrary Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a procedure to solve the Euler equations by explicitly updating, in a conservative manner, a generic thermodynamic variable such as temperature, pressure or entropy instead of the total energy. The presented procedure is valid for any equation of state and spatial discretization. When using complex equations of state such as Span-Wagner, choosing the temperature as the generic thermodynamic variable yields great reductions in the computational costs associated to thermodynamic evaluations. Results computed with a state of the art thermodynamic model are presented, and computational times are analyzed. Particular attention is dedicated to the conservation of total energy, the propagation speed of shock waves and jump conditions. The procedure is thoroughly tested using the Span-Wagner equation of state through the CoolProp thermodynamic library and the Van der Waals equation of state, both in the ideal and non-ideal compressible fluid-dynamics regimes, by comparing it to the standard total energy update and analytical solutions where available.</description>

      <title>Learning to Predict 3D Rotational Dynamics from Images of a Rigid Body with Unknown Mass Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many real-world settings, image observations of freely rotating 3D rigid bodies may be available when low-dimensional measurements are not. However, the high-dimensionality of image data precludes the use of classical estimation techniques to learn the dynamics. The usefulness of standard deep learning methods is also limited, because an image of a rigid body reveals nothing about the distribution of mass inside the body, which, together with initial angular velocity, is what determines how the body will rotate. We present a physics-based neural network model to estimate and predict 3D rotational dynamics from image sequences. We achieve this using a multi-stage prediction pipeline that maps individual images to a latent representation homeomorphic to $\mathbf{SO}(3)$, computes angular velocities from latent pairs, and predicts future latent states using the Hamiltonian equations of motion. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on new rotating rigid-body datasets of sequences of synthetic images of rotating objects, including cubes, prisms and satellites, with unknown uniform and non-uniform mass distributions. Our model outperforms competing baselines on our datasets, producing better qualitative predictions and reducing the error observed for the state-of-the-art Hamiltonian Generative Network by a factor of 2.</description>
