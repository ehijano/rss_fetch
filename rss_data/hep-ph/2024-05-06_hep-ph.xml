      <title>Is holographic quark-gluon plasma homogeneous?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present evidence for a spatially modulated instability within the deconfined quark-gluon plasma phase of QCD. This evidence is based on robust predictions from generic holographic models, accurately fitted to lattice data, where the instability is driven by the Chern-Simons term mandated by the flavor anomalies of QCD. Such an instability occurs universally across holographic models at surprisingly low densities, within the crossover region amenable to lattice and experimental studies, therefore inviting further explorations of inhomogeneous phases in this region.</description>

      <title>Probing protoneutron stars with gamma-ray axionscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) coupled to nucleons can be efficiently produced in the interior of protoneutron stars (PNS) during supernova (SN) explosions. If these ALPs are also coupled to photons they can convert into gamma rays in the Galactic magnetic field. This SN-induced gamma-ray burst can be observable by gamma-ray telescopes like ${\textit Fermi}$-LAT if the SN is in the field of view of the detector. We show that the observable gamma-ray spectrum is sensitive to the production processes in the SN core. In particular, if the nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung is the dominant axion production channel, one expects a thermal spectrum with average energy $E_a \simeq 50$ MeV. In this case the gamma-ray spectrum observation allows for the reconstruction of the PNS temperature. In case of a sizable pion abundance in the SN core, one expects a second spectral component peaked at $E_a\simeq 200$ MeV due to axion pionic processes. We demonstrate that, through a dedicated LAT analysis, we can detect the presence of this pionic contribution, showing that the detection of the spectral shape of the gamma-ray signal represents a unique probe of the pion abundance in the PNS.</description>

      <title>Fast and Accurate Algorithm for Calculating Long-Baseline Neutrino Oscillation Probabilities with Matter Effects: NuFast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillation experiments will be entering the precision era in the next decade with the advent of high statistics experiments like DUNE, HK, and JUNO. Correctly estimating the confidence intervals from data for the oscillation parameters requires very large Monte Carlo data sets involving calculating the oscillation probabilities in matter many, many times. In this paper, we leverage past work to present a new, fast, precise technique for calculating neutrino oscillation probabilities in matter optimized for long-baseline neutrino oscillations in the Earth's crust including both accelerator and reactor experiments. For ease of use by theorists and experimentalists, we provide fast c++ and fortran codes.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Axion Portal to Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are good candidates for mediators to the dark sector. We explore scenarios in which an ALP mediates interactions between dark matter and electroweak gauge bosons. These models yield testable electromagnetic signals in astrophysical, cosmological, and terrestrial probes. We find promising prospects for both indirect detection and accelerator tests, with interesting parameter space already constrained by current experiments. Our work provides concrete benchmarks for future tests of the electroweak ALP portal.</description>

      <title>Lepton-neutron interaction and S-wave low energy parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A lepton-neutron potential in configuration space is obtained. It is based on the Coulomb plus hyperfine interaction Hamiltonian integrated over the neutron charge and magnetic densities. Different parametrisations of the neutron electromagnetic form factors are compared. It is given in the operator form with a central, spin-spin, tensor and spin-orbit terms. The potentials for lowest partial waves states are presented. We compute the lepton-neutron lepton ($ln$) low-energy parameters for the S-waves, estimate the zero-energy cross sections for higher angular momentum states, and point out a possible divergence in the partial wave summation due to the spin-orbit potential.</description>

      <title>Higgs criticality in and beyond the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of the Higgs potential are determined by three parameters: the mass parameter, the quartic self-coupling, and a constant term. Remarkably, all three of these parameters seem subject to a significant amount of fine-tuning. All these tunings can be seen as their corresponding parameters being close to critical values marking quantum phase transitions. While such behavior is surprising from a conventional particle physics perspective, it is a common feature of dynamical systems. This has motivated the conjecture that the values of the Higgs' parameters are the result of some dynamical mechanism. This possibility suggests the construction of mechanisms dynamically choosing sets of Higgs parameters. In these notes, I discuss a complementary approach. Taking seriously that such a mechanism could exist in nature, it is plausible to assume that it also influences Beyond-Standard-Model physics. This suggests considering near-criticality in any model of interest and investigating its consequences more generally, in particular independent of a concrete mechanism responsible for it. I first explain what it means for the parameters of the Higgs potential to be near-critical. This includes a discussion of the recently discovered "metastability bound" on the Higgs mass, which can be understood through a critical point. I then review two concrete examples of mechanisms in which the parameters of the Higgs potential are dynamically driven towards critical values. These mechanisms also serve as an important proof on concept for the feasibility of the assumptions at the foundation of these notes. Using a simple example for concreteness, the final part of these notes then explicitly demonstrates how to approach a given model in the light of the near-criticality conjecture.</description>

      <title>Solar Neutrinos in Cryogenic Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) poses an irreducible background in the search for dark matter-nucleus elastic scatterings, which is commonly known as the neutrino floor. As direct dark matter search experiments keep improving their sensitivity into so far unexplored regions, they face the challenge of approaching this neutrino floor. A precise description of the CE$\nu$NS signal is therefore crucial for the description of backgrounds for future DM searches. In this work we discuss the scenario of detecting neutrinos in low-threshold, high-exposure cryogenic solid state experiments optimized for the search of low-mass dark matter. The energy range considered is completely dominated by solar neutrinos. In absence of any dark matter events, we treat solar neutrinos as the main signal of interest. We show that sensitivity to the flux of neutrinos from different production mechanisms can be achieved. In particular we investigate the sensitivity to the flux of pp and $^{7}$Be neutrinos, as well as CNO neutrinos. Furthermore, we investigate the sensitivity to dark matter signals in the presence of a solar neutrino background for different experimental scenarios, which are defined by three parameters: the target material, the energy threshold and the exposure. We show that experiments with thresholds of $\mathcal{O}$(eV) and exposures of $\mathcal{O}$(tonne-years), using CaWO$_{4}$ or Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ targets, have discovery potential for dark matter interaction cross sections in the neutrino floor.</description>

      <title>Production of hidden-heavy and double-heavy hadronic molecules at the $Z$ factory of CEPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a clean environment and high collision energy, the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) would be an excellent facility for heavy flavor physics. Using the Monte Carlo event generator Pythia, we simulate the production of the charmed (bottom) hadron pairs in the electron-positron collisions at the $Z$ factory of CEPC, and the inclusive production rates for typical candidates of the hidden/double-charm and hidden/double-bottom $S$-wave hadronic molecules are estimated at an order-of-magnitude level with the final state interactions after the hadron pair production. The predicted cross sections for the hidden-charm meson-meson molecules $X(3872)$ and $Z_c(3900)$ are at $\rm{pb}$ level, which are about two to three orders of magnitude larger than the production cross sections for the double-charm meson-meson molecules $T_{cc}$ and $T_{cc}^{*}$, as the double-charmed ones require the production of two pairs of $c\bar{c}$ from the $Z$ boson decay. The production cross sections for the hidden-charm pentaquark states $P_{c}$ and $P_{cs}$ as meson-baryon molecules are a few to tens of fb, which are about one magnitude larger than those of the possible hidden-charm baryon-antibaryon and double-charm meson-baryon molecules. In the bottom sector, the production cross sections for the $Z_b$ states as $B^{(*)}\bar{B}^{*}$ molecules are about tens to hundreds of fb, indicating $10^6$ - $10^7$ events from a two-year operation of CEPC, and the expected events from the double-bottom molecules are about 2 - 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the $Z_b$ states. Our results shows great prospects of probing heavy exotic hadrons at CEPC.</description>

      <title>Exploration of the LHCb $P_c$ states and possible resonances in a unitary coupled-channel model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our previous study of the interactions of $\bar{D}^{(*)} \Lambda_c - \bar{D}^{(*)}\Sigma_c^{(*)}$ within an analytic, unitary, coupled-channel approach by including the $J/\psi p$ channel and performing fits to the $J/\psi p$ invariant mass distributions in the $\Lambda_b^0 \to J/\psi p K^-$ decay by the LHCb Collaboration. We take into account the contributions of $t$-channel pseudoscalar and vector meson exchanges and $u$-channel baryon exchanges in this work, and a series of bound states and resonances with different spin-parities are dynamically generated. According to the results, four states have a significant impact on the physical observables, with two having a spin-parity of $1/2^-$ and the other two having $3/2^-$. These states can be associated with the LHCb hidden-charm pentaquarks. We further provide the coupling strength between each pole and different channels, which provides some insights on how to search for them in future experiments. Moreover, we also search for poles in higher partial waves up to $J=7/2$ and find indications for the existence of several states with larger widths.</description>

      <title>Composite effective field theory signal from anomalous quartic gauge couplings for $ZZ(\rightarrow\ell\ell\nu\nu)jj$ and $Z\gamma(\rightarrow\nu\nu\gamma)jj$ productions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameterization of heavy effects beyond the Standard Model is available using higher-dimension operators of the effective field theory and their Wilson coefficients, where their values are not known. Experimental sensitivity to the Wilson coefficients can be significantly changed in case of the usage of composite anomalous signal, which contains anomalous contributions from background processes in addition to the conventional ones from the signal process. In this work, this approach is applied to the search for anomalous quartic gauge couplings with seven EFT operators in the electroweak production of $ZZ(\rightarrow\ell\ell\nu\nu)jj$ and $Z\gamma(\rightarrow\nu\nu\gamma)jj$ in $pp$ collisions. For the majority of coefficients sensitivity in the former channel is smaller than that in the latter one. However, it is shown that composite anomalous signal affects $ZZ(\rightarrow\ell\ell\nu\nu)jj$ production stronger than $Z\gamma(\rightarrow\nu\nu\gamma)jj$ production, making sensitivities closer. One-dimensional limits on the Wilson coefficients are changed up to 27.3% and 9.7% due to the background anomalous contributions in $ZZ(\rightarrow\ell\ell\nu\nu)jj$ and $Z\gamma(\rightarrow\nu\nu\gamma)jj$ productions respectively.</description>

      <title>Production of meson molecules in ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a calculation of exotic charmonium production in ultra-peripheral collisions, in which the exotic state is explicitly treated as a meson molecule. Our formalism is general but we focus on the lightest possible exotic charmonium state: a $D^+ D^-$ molecular bound state. It was proposed some time ago and it has been object of experimental searches. Here we study the production of the open charm pair in the process $\gamma \gamma \to D^+ D^-$. Then we use a prescription to project the free pair $ |D^+ D^- \rangle$ onto a bound state at the amplitude level and compute the cross section of the process $\gamma \gamma \to B$ (where $B$ is the bound state). Finally, we convolute this last cross section with the equivalent photon distributions coming from the projectile and target in an ultra-peripheral collision and find the $A A \to A A B$ cross section, which, for $Pb-Pb$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV, is of the order of $3 \, \mu \mbox{b}$.</description>

      <title>Composite effective field theory signal in case of searching for neutral triple gauge couplings with $ZZ\rightarrow\ell\ell\nu\nu$ production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work manifestations of physics beyond the Standard Model are parameterized with higher-dimension operators and Wilson coefficients using effective field theory. In order to set more stringent experimental limits on the Wilson coefficients it is crucial to use new methods of sensitivity increasing that work independently with luminosity growth. Method of composite anomalous signal allows one to set the limits on Wilson coefficients more precisely and stringent by accounting for impact of EFT operators on background processes in addition to the conventional anomalous contribution from the signal process. This work presents aforementioned methodology applied to the $ZZ\rightarrow\ell\ell\nu\nu$ production, that is sensitive to the neutral triple couplings of gauge bosons $Z$ and $\gamma$. It is found that the main background BSM contribution comes from $WZ\rightarrow\ell\nu\ell\ell$ background. Improvement of the limits on the Wilson coefficients due to this background depends on the coefficient and is up to 57.5% (59.1%) for one- (two-) dimensional limits in linear + quadratic effective field theory model and up to 94.4% for one-dimensional limits in linear effective field theory model.</description>

      <title>Prospect study for measurement of $Hb\bar{b}$ coupling at the LHC and FCC-hh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper employs the $H+b+\text{jets}$ signature in proton-proton collisions to explore the structure of the $Hb\bar{b}$ couplings.The focus of the analysis lies in the decay of the Higgs boson into a photon pair, taking into account both reducible and irreducible backgrounds and a realistic simulation of the detector effects. To enhance the discrimination between signal and background, a multivariate analysis is employed to analyse the kinematic variables and optimise the signal-to-background ratio. The results indicate that the $H+b+\text{jets}$ process can significantly contribute to the precise measurement of CP-even and CP-odd couplings between the bottom quark and the Higgs boson at the LHC and FCC-hh. Finally, a novel asymmetry is introduced for the purpose of probing CP violation within the $Hb\bar{b}$ coupling, formulated exclusively based on lab-frame momenta.</description>

      <title>Consequences of the $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry for leptogenesis in a seesaw model with diagonal Dirac neutrino mass matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have studied the consequences of the $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry for leptogenesis in the type-I seesaw model with diagonal Dirac neutrino mass matrix. We have first obtained the phenomenologically allowed values of the model parameters, which show that there may exist zero or equal entries in the Majorana mass matrix for the right-handed neutrinos, and then studied their predictions for three right-handed neutrino masses, which show that there may exist two nearly degenerate right-handed neutrinos. Then, we have studied the consequences of the model for leptogenesis. Due to the $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry, leptogenesis can only work in the two-flavor regime. Furthermore, leptogenesis cannot work for the particular case of $r=1$. Accordingly, for some benchmark values of $r \neq 1$, we have given the constraints of leptogenesis for relevant parameters. Furthermore, we have investigated the possibilities of leptogenesis being induced by the renormalization group evolution effects for two particular scenarios. For the particular case of $r=1$, the renormalization group evolution effects will break the orthogonality relations among different columns of $M^{}_{\rm D}$ and consequently induce leptogenesis to work. For the low-scale resonant leptogenesis scenario which is realized for nearly degenerate right-handed neutrinos, the renormalization group evolution effects can break the $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry and consequently induce leptogenesis to work.</description>

Abstract: We revisited the computation of the cross section for the $\mu^-\mu^-\to \ell^-\ell^{-}$ $(\ell^-=\tau^-,\, e^-)$ transitions in the presence of new heavy Majorana neutrinos. We focus on scenarios where the masses of the new states are around some few TeV, the so-called low-scale seesaw models. Our analysis is set in a simple model with only two new heavy Majorana neutrinos considering the current limits on the heavy-light mixings. Our results illustrate the difference between the genuine effects of two nondegenerate heavy Majorana states and the degenerate case where they form a Dirac singlet field.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, using soft-collinear effective theory we study the invariant mass distribution for dijet production in $e^+e^-$-annihilation. Near threshold, where the dijet takes most of the energy, there arise the large threshold logarithms, which are sensitive to soft gluon radiations. To systematically resum the logarithms, we factorize the scattering cross section into the hard, the collinear, and the soft parts. And we additionally factorize the original soft part into the global soft function and the two collinear-soft functions, where the latter can be combined with the collinear parts to form the fragmentation functions to jet (FFJs). The factorization theorem derived here can be easily applicable to other processes near threshold. Using the factorized result, we show the resummed result for the dijet invariant mass to the accuracy of next-to-leading logarithms. We have also obtained the result in the case of the heavy quark dijet and compared it with the case of the light quark.</description>

      <title>HEP ML Lab: An end-to-end framework for applying machine learning into phenomenology studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen the development and growth of machine learning in high energy physics. There will be more effort to continue exploring its full potential. To make it easier for researchers to apply existing algorithms and neural networks and to advance the reproducibility of the analysis, we develop the \texttt{HEP ML Lab} (\texttt{hml}), a Python-based, end-to-end framework for phenomenology studies. It covers the complete workflow from event generation to performance evaluation, and provides a consistent style of use for different approaches. We propose an observable naming convention to streamline the data extraction and conversion processes. In the \texttt{Keras} style, we provide the traditional cut-and-count and boosted decision trees together with neural networks. We take the $W^+$ tagging as an example and evaluate all built-in approaches with the metrics of significance and background rejection. With its modular design, \texttt{HEP ML Lab} is easy to extend and customize, and can be used as a tool for both beginners and experienced researchers.</description>

      <title>Superposition of CP-Even and CP-Odd Higgs Resonances: Explaining the 95 GeV Excesses within a Two-Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an explanation for the observed excesses around 95 GeV in the di-photon and di-tau invariant mass distributions, as reported by the CMS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These findings are complemented by a long-standing discrepancy in the $b\bar{b}$ invariant mass at the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) Collider. Additionally, the ATLAS collaboration has reported a corroborative excess in the di-photon final state within the same mass range, albeit with slightly lower significance. Our approach involves the superposition of CP-even and CP-odd Higgs bosons within the Type-III Two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) to simultaneously explain these excesses at 1$\sigma$ Confidence Level (C.L.), while remaining consistent with current theoretical and experimental constraints.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Momentum Spectra of pair created in a pulsed field at finite times: Are Oscillations "Real"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the production of electron-positron pairs from the vacuum in a time-varying, spatially uniform pulsed electric field given by $E(t) = E_0 sech^2(t/\tau)$, with height of $E_0$ and width of $\tau$. Sah recently discussed the problem of pair production after a finite evolution time [9]. This raises questions about the instantaneous appearance of particles in pair production and their behavior at intermediate times when using a formalism that involves solving an evolution equation for a dynamical quantity. Is it possible to make general statements about this behavior? To address these questions, we analytically compute the probability of $(e^+ e^-)$ pair production in momentum space using the exact solution of the one-particle time-dependent Dirac equation, and we compare the result with quantum kinetic theory (QKT). Both approaches allow us to study the particle momentum spectrum at any instant in time and can potentially unveil valuable information regarding quantum non-equilibrium physics. We analyze both approaches' Longitudinal Momentum Spectrum (LMS) of the created particles at finite times. We observe oscillatory structure in the LMS. This oscillation behavior at finite time clearly illustrates the quantum interference effects associated with particle production. It is worth noting that both approaches exhibit quantum interference patterns at finite times, manifested as oscillations observed in the LMS. This reveals that these oscillations are not due to transient excitations and basis-dependent signatures. Again, we emphasize that the oscillations seen in the LMS from both approaches are not artifacts but possess significant physical relevance.</description>

      <title>Quantum Corrections to the Decay Law in Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deviation of the decay law from the exponential is a well known effect of quantum mechanics. Here we analyze the relativistic survival probabilities, $S(t,p)$, where $p$ is the momentum of the decaying particle and provide analytical expressions for $S(t,p)$ in the exponential (E) as well as the nonexponential (NE) regions at small and large times. Under minimal assumptions on the spectral density function, analytical expressions for the critical times of transition from the NE to the E at small times and the E to NE at large times are derived. The dependence of the decay law on the relativistic Lorentz factor, $\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$, reveals several interesting features. In the short time regime of the decay law, the critical time, $\tau_{st}$, shows a steady increase with $\gamma$, thus implying a larger NE region for particles decaying in flight. Comparing $S(t,p)$ with the well known time dilation formula, $e^{-\Gamma t/\gamma}$, in the exponential region, an expression for the critical $\gamma$ where $S(t,p)$ deviates most from $e^{-\Gamma t/\gamma}$ is presented. This is a purely quantum correction. Under particular conditions on the resonance parameters, there also exists a critical $\gamma$ at large times which decides if the NE region shifts backward or forward in time as compared to that for a particle at rest. All the above analytical results are supported by calculations involving realistic decays of hadrons and leptons.</description>

      <title>The $H\rightarrow Z\gamma$ decay and $CP$ violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of $CP$-violation on the reported result by the LHC $\mu^{Z\gamma}=2.2\pm 0.7$ for the $H\rightarrow Z\gamma$ signal strength are studied in new physics models, where bounds on the real and absorptive parts of the $CP$-violating form factor $h_3^{Z\gamma}$ are obtained, which are found to be less than 1.02 GeV. The leading order SM contributions to the $H\rightarrow Z\gamma$ decay are also revisited, whereas contributions to the $CP$-violating form factor $h_3^{Z\gamma}$ from FCNC complex couplings mediated by the $Z$ and $H$ bosons are reported. Using the current bounds on such a couplings, where for these related to the Higgs boson are calculated to be or order $10^{-1}$. We find that the FCNC contribution to $h_3^{Z\gamma}$ with top and charm quarks in the loop is of order $10^{-6}$. A generic model with new quarks is also studied. It is found a parameter space, which agrees with the $H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ decay and the new $\mu^{Z\gamma}$ LHC result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two excesses reported recently at the LHC in the lighter Higgs mass region around 95 GeV and in the rare $Z \gamma$ final state of the Standard Model (SM) 125 GeV Higgs decay are simultaneously scrutinized within the framework of minimal gauged two-Higgs-doublet model (G2HDM). Viable parameter space in G2HDM is obtained to account for both excesses. We find a strong correlation between the signal strengths of SM 125 GeV Higgs decays into $\gamma \gamma$ and $Z \gamma$ modes, whereas this correlation does not extend to its lighter 95 GeV cousin.</description>

      <title>Beam energy dependence of transverse momentum distribution and elliptic flow in Au-Au collisions using HYDJET++ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the transverse momentum spectra and elliptic flow ($v_2$) of $\pi^\pm,k^\pm,$ $p$ and $\bar{p}$ in Au-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 62.4, 39.0, 27.0, 19.6 and 11.5 GeV using HYDJET++ model. For each beam energy the transverse momentum spectra are shown in four centrality classes at mid rapidity $|y|\le$ 0.1 and for elliptic flow ($v_2$) we have shown results for minimum bias events. We have performed a qualitative comparison between the hard and soft processes at different beam energies. The HYDJET++ model calculations for particle ratios, $p_T$ spectra, and $v_2$ agree well with the available experimental data. The HYDJET++ parameters like baryonic and strangeness chemical potential, and chemical and thermal freeze-out temperature vary with collision energy. Azimuthal spatial anisotropy ($\epsilon$) and azimuthal momentum anisotropy ($\delta$) decrease with collision energy which leads to a smaller value of $v_2$ at lower collision energies. Furthermore, the hadrons containing strange quarks tend to have smaller values of spatial and momentum anisotropy than the non-strange hadrons.</description>

      <title>Probing flavor violation and baryogenesis via primordial gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that observations of primordial gravitational waves of inflationary origin can shed light into the scale of flavor violation in a flavon model which also explains the mass hierarchy of fermions. The energy density stored in oscillations of the flavon field around the minimum of its potential redshifts as matter and is expected to dominate over radiation in the early universe. At the same time, the evolution of primordial gravitational waves acts as bookkeeping to understand the expansion history of the universe. Importantly, the gravitational wave spectrum is different if there is an early flavon dominated era compared to radiation domination expected from a standard cosmological model and this spectrum gets damped by the entropy released in flavon decays, determined by the mass of the flavon field $m_S$ and new scale of flavor violation $\Lambda_{\rm FV}$. We derive analytical expressions of the frequency above which the spectrum is damped, as-well-as the amount of damping, in terms of $m_S$ and $\Lambda_{\rm FV}$. We show that the damping of the gravitational wave spectrum would be detectable at BBO, DECIGO, U-DECIGO, $\mu-$ARES, LISA, CE and ET detectors for $\Lambda_{\rm FV}=10^{5-10}$ GeV and $m_S=\mathcal{O({\rm TeV})}$. Furthermore, the flavon decays can source the baryon asymmetry of the universe. We identify the $m_S-\Lambda_{\rm FV}$ parameter space where the observed baryon asymmetry $\eta \sim 10^{-10}$ is produced and can be tested by gravitational wave detectors like LISA and ET. We also discuss our results in the context of the recently measured stochastic gravitational background signals by NANOGrav.</description>

Abstract: Generalized thermodynamic relations are introduced into the framework of a relativistic perfect spin hydrodynamics. They allow for consistent treatment of spin degrees of freedom, including the use of spin tensors whose structure follows from microscopic calculations. The obtained results are important for establishing consistency between different formulations of spin hydrodynamics and form the basis for introducing dissipative corrections.</description>

      <title>Ladder top-quark condensation imprints in supercooled electroweak phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electroweak (EW) phase transition in the early Universe might be supercooled due to the presence of the classical scale invariance involving Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) sectors and the supercooling could persist down till a later epoch around which the QCD chiral phase transition is supposed to take place. Since this supercooling period keeps masslessness for all the six SM quarks, it has simply been argued that the QCD phase transition is the first order, and so is the EW one. However, not only the QCD coupling but also the top Yukawa and the Higgs quartic couplings get strong at around the QCD scale due to the renormalization group running, hence this scenario is potentially subject to a rigorous nonperturbative analysis. In this work, we employ the ladder Schwinger-Dyson (LSD) analysis based on the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis formalism at the two-loop level in such a gauge-Higgs-Yukawa system. We show that the chiral broken QCD vacuum emerges with the nonperturbative top condensate and the lightness of all six quarks is guaranteed due to the accidental U(1) axial symmetry presented in the top-Higgs sector. We employ a quark-meson model-like description in the mean field approximation to address the impact on the EW phase transition arising due to the top quark condensation at the QCD phase transition epoch. In the model, the LSD results are encoded to constrain the model parameter space. We then observe the cosmological phase transition of the first-order type and discuss the induced gravitational wave (GW) productions. We find that in addition to the conventional GW signals sourced from an expected BSM at around or over the TeV scale, the dynamical topponium-Higgs system can yield another power spectrum sensitive to the BBO, LISA, and DECIGO, etc.</description>

      <title>Study of quantum decoherence at Protvino to ORCA experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protvino to ORCA (Oscillation Research with Cosmics in the Abyss) (P2O) is an upcoming neutrino oscillation experiment with a very long baseline of 2595 km. Due to the substantial baseline, this experiment provides a unique opportunity to study the earth matter effects over very large distances. This makes it a suitable experiment to investigate the environmental decoherence in neutrino oscillations, where the neutrino system could interact with a stochastic environment and lead to a loss in the coherence of neutrino states. In this work, we consider an open quantum system framework to simulate the neutrino oscillations in P2O experiment and obtain bounds on the decoherence parameters in different phenomenological models. We assume that the decoherence parameter $\Gamma$ depends on neutrino energy $E_\nu$ as $\Gamma_{ij}(E_\nu) = \Gamma_{0} (\frac{E_\nu}{E_0})^n$. Further, we use these bounds to study the effect on the neutrino mass ordering sensitivity and CP violation sensitivity of P2O experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of prospective scenarios for observing quantum vacuum signals in high-intensity laser experiments requires both accurate theoretical predictions and the exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces. Numerical simulations address the first requirement, while optimization provides an efficient solution for the second one. In the present work, we demonstrate the potential of Bayesian optimization in maximizing photonic quantum vacuum signals on the example of two-beam collisions. This allows us to find the optimal waist sizes for beams with elliptic cross sections, and to identify the specific physical process leading to a discernible signal in a coherent harmonic focusing configuration scenario.</description>

      <title>Dark matter models with suppressed dark matter nuclei elastic cross section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two generalizations of the dark photon model which predict the suppressed elastic dark matter nuclei cross section in comparison with the corresponding prediction of the dark photon model. In the first model the main difference from dark photon model is that the mixing parameter $\epsilon$ is nonlocal formfactor $\epsilon(q^2)= \frac{q^2}{\Lambda^2}V(\frac{q^2}{\Lambda^2}) $ depending on the square of the momentum transfer $q^2$. Here $V(\frac{q^2}{\Lambda^2})$ is an entire function of the growth $\rho \geq \frac{1}{2}$ and $\Lambda$ is nonlocal scale. In this model our world and dark world are described by renormalizable field theories while the communication between them is performed by nonlocal interaction. The second model is renormalizable model where besides dark photon field $A'$ additional vector boson $Z'$ interacts with $B - L$ current. The communication between our world and dark world is performed due to nonzero kinetic mixing between $Z'$ and $A'$ fields. The predictions of the models for the search for dark matter at the accelerators don't contain additional suppression factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive NLO pQCD study on inclusive dijet photoproduction in ultraperipheral nucleus-nucleus collisions (UPCs). Our analysis takes into account the finite size of both the photon-emitting and the target nucleus, estimated using the Wood-Saxon nuclear density profile. We show that a significant part of the measured dijets at large $z_\gamma$ in UPC Pb+Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV come from events with relatively small impact parameters of the order of a few nuclear radii, and the cross section predictions thus become sensitive to the modelling of the collision geometry and photon flux near the source nucleus. In addition, we include the modelling of electromagnetic breakup survival factor needed for a direct comparison with the experimental data and study the resolution power of this process in terms of the impact-parameter dependent nuclear parton distribution functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting constraints on kinetic mixing between a new $U(1)'$ gauge boson hiding under the Standard Model $Z$ boson resonance requires the formalism of non-Hermitian two-point correlation functions at 1-loop order. We derive self-consistent collider constraints on $Z'$ bosons with kinetic mixing in a narrow mass window around the $Z$ boson, considering both model-independent and model-dependent bounds. Our treatment elucidates the importance of both avoided level crossing and width suppression due to the quantum Zeno effect in interpreting the existing constraints. We also discuss the implications for future measurements on the $Z$-pole.</description>

Abstract: Radiative corrections due to initial state radiation in electron-positron annihilation are calculated within the QED structure function approach. Results are shown in the next-to-leading logarithmic approximation up to $O(\alpha^4 L^3)$ order, where $L=\ln(s/m_e^2)$ is the large logarithm. Several mistakes in previous calculations are corrected. The results are relevant for future high-precision experiments at $e^+e^-$ colliders.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent observation of the Higgs boson radiative decay into $Z^0$ by {\tt ATLAS} and {\tt CMS} Collaborations, we investigate the next-to-leading-order (NLO) electroweak correction to this rare decay process in Standard Model (SM). Implementing the on-shell renormalization scheme, we find that the magnitude of the NLO electroweak correction may reach $7\%$ of the leading order (LO) prediction, much more significant than that of the NLO QCD correction, which is merely about $0.3\%$. After incorporating the ${\cal O}(\alpha)$ correction, the predicted partial width from various $\alpha$ schemes tend to converge to each other. Including both NLO electroweak and QCD corrections, we present the most accurate SM prediction for the branching fraction of this rare decay channel to be ${\cal B}_{\rm th}[H\to Z^0\gamma]=(1.55\pm 0.06)\times 10^{-3}$, considerably lower than the measured value ${\cal B}_{\rm exp}[H\to Z^0\gamma]=(3.4\pm 1.1)\times 10^{-3}$. Resolving this alarming discrepancy clearly calls for further theoretical investigations, and, more importantly, experimental efforts from {\tt HL-LHC} and the prospective Higgs factories such as {\tt CEPC} and {\tt FCC}.</description>

      <title>A Full Model of the Response of Surface Detectors to Extensive Air Showers Based on Shower Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a full model of surface-detector responses to extensive air showers. The model is motivated by the principles of air-shower universality and can be applied to different types of surface detectors. Here we describe a parametrization for both water-Cerenkov detectors and scintillator surface detectors, as for instance employed by the upgraded detector array of the Pierre Auger Observatory. Using surface detector data, the model can be used to reconstruct with reasonable precision shower observables such as the depth of the shower maximum $X_\text{max}$ and the number of muons $R_\mu$.</description>

      <title>Opening a meV mass window for Axion-like particles with a microwave-laser-mixed stimulated resonant photon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a microwave-laser-mixed three-beam stimulated resonant photon collider, which enables access to axion-like particles in the meV mass range. Collisions between a focused pulse laser beam and a focused microwave pulse beam directly produce axion-like particles (ALPs) and another focused pulse laser beam stimulates their decay. The expected sensitivity in the meV mass range has been evaluated. The result shows that the sensitivity can reach the ALP-photon coupling down to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-13})$~GeV${}^{-1}$ with $10^6$ shots if 10-100 TW class high-intensity lasers are properly combined with a conventional 100 MW class S-band klystron. This proposal paves the way for identifying the nature of ALPs as candidates for dark matter, independent of any cosmological and astrophysical models.</description>

      <title>$D^0$ meson production in $pp$ collisions at large $Q_s^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of the non-linear effects in the QCD dynamics on the observables is directly related to the magnitude of the saturation scale $Q_s$, which is predicted to increase with the energy, rapidity and multiplicity. In this paper, we investigate the $D^0$ meson production in $pp$ collisions at forward rapidities and/or high multiplicities considering the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) formalism and the solutions of the running coupling Balitsky - Kovchegov (BK) equation. The contributions of gluon - and charm - initiated processes are taken into account, and a comparison with the current LHCb data is performed. The impact of an intrinsic charm component in the proton's wave function is also estimated. Predictions for the self-normalized yields of $D^0$ mesons as a function of the multiplicity of coproduced charged hadrons are presented, considering $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV and different values of the meson rapidity. A comparison with the predictions for the kaon and isolated photon production is performed. Our results indicate that a future experimental analysis of the $D^0$ meson production at forward rapidities and high multiplicities can be useful to probe the CGC formalism and to disentangle the contribution of initial - and final - state effects.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the reaction $\psi(3686) \to \bar{\Xi}^+ \bar{K}^0 \Sigma^{*-}$, with the $\Sigma^{*-}$ decaying to $\pi^- \Lambda$ in order to show evidence for the existence of two $\Xi(1820)$ states, one around $1824$ MeV and narrow, and another one around $1875$ MeV and wide. The phase space for $\bar{K}^0 \Sigma^{*-}$ production reduces the effect of the lower mass resonance, magnifying the effect of the higher mass resonance that shows clearly over the phase space. The estimated rate of the production is bigger than the one of the $\psi(3686) \to \bar{\Xi}^+ K^- \Lambda$ reaction, where a clear peak for $\Xi(1820)$ was observed by the BESIII collaboration, what makes the Beijing facility ideal to carry out the reaction proposed.</description>

      <title>Dark Kinetic Heating of Exoplanets and Brown Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark kinetic heating of neutron stars has been previously studied as a promising dark matter detection avenue. Kinetic heating occurs when dark matter is sped up to relativistic speeds in the gravitational well of high-escape velocity objects, and deposits kinetic energy after becoming captured by the object, thereby increasing its temperature. We show that dark kinetic heating can be significant even in objects with low-escape velocities, such as exoplanets and brown dwarfs, increasing the discovery potential of such searches. This can occur if there is a long-range dark force, creating a "dark escape velocity", leading to heating rates substantially larger than those expected from neutron stars. We consequently set constraints on dark sector parameters using Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and JWST data on Super-Jupiter WISE 0855-0714, and map out future sensitivity to the dark matter scattering cross section below $10^{-40}~{\rm cm}^2$. We compare dark kinetic heating rates of other lower escape velocity objects such as the Earth, Sun, and white dwarfs, finding complementary kinetic heating signals are possible depending on particle physics parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quark-gluon plasma at nonzero density by using two holographic models for QCD based on either brane or Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton actions. We determine the parameters of these models through a systematic statistical fitting procedure to lattice QCD data, which encompasses the equation of state (through the entropy density) and the two lowest baryon number susceptibilities. The predictions from the two models for the higher-order susceptibilities and the equation of state at nonzero density are strikingly similar. In particular, both models suggest the presence of a critical point on the $(\mu_B,T)$-phase diagram near $\mu_B/T \approx 6$. The results for the equation of state are in agreement with lattice data for higher-order susceptibilities and experimental data for the cumulants of the net-proton number from the Beam Energy Scan program at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>External magnetic field induced paramagnetic squeezing effect in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In non-central heavy-ion collisions, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) encounters the most intense magnetic field ever produced in nature, with a strength of approximately 10$^{19\sim 20}$ Gauss. Recent lattice-QCD calculations reveal that the QGP exhibits paramagnetic properties at high temperatures. When an external strong magnetic field is applied, it generates an anisotropic squeezing force density that competes with pressure gradients resulting from the purely QGP geometric expansion. In this study, we employ (3+1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamics simulations to estimate the paramagnetic squeezing effect of this force density on the anisotropic expansion of QGP in non-central Pb+Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We consider both up-to-date magnetic susceptibility and various magnetic field profiles in this work. We find that the impact of rapidly decaying magnetic fields is insignificant, while enduring magnetic fields produce a strong force density that diminishes the momentum anisotropy of the QGP by up to 10\% at the intial stage, leaving a visible imprint on the elliptic flow $v_{2}$ of final charged particles. Our results provide insights into the interplay between magnetic fields and the dynamics of QGP expansion in non-central heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an emergent cosmological model rooted in the Asymptotically Safe antiscreening behavior of the Newton constant at Planckian energies. Distinguishing itself from prior approaches, our model encapsulates the variable nature of $G$ through a multiplicative coupling within the matter Lagrangian, characterized by a conserved energy-momentum tensor. The universe emerges from a quasi-de Sitter phase, transitioning to standard cosmological evolution post-Planck Era. Our analysis demonstrates the feasibility of constraining the transition scale to nearly classical cosmology using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data and the potential to empirically probe the antiscreening trait of Newton's constant, as predicted by Asymptotic Safety.</description>

      <title>An extended NJL model for baryonic matter and quark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By considering baryons as clusters of three quarks, we extend the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model to describe baryonic matter, quark matter, and their transitions in a unified manner, where the Dirac sea and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking are considered. In particular, a density-dependent structural function $\alpha_S$ is introduced to modulate the four(six)-point interaction strengths to reproduce the baryon masses in vacuum and medium. Vector interactions are considered with the exchange of $\omega$ and $\rho$ mesons, where the density-dependent coupling constants are fixed by reproducing nuclear matter properties as well as the $\Lambda$-hyperon potential depth in nuclear medium. As density increases, quarks will emerge as quasi-free particles and coexist with baryons. This phase is interpreted as quarkyonic matter, where quarks are restricted to the lowest energy states in the presence of baryons, i.e., quarks are still confined. Similar to the treatment of $\alpha$ clustering in nuclear medium, a Pauli blocking term is added to baryon masses so that baryons eventually become unbound in the presence of a quark Fermi Sea. Then at large enough densities baryons vanish and a Mott transition takes place, we consider such a transition as deconfinement phase transition. Depending on the strengths of Pauli blocking term and quark-vector meson couplings, both first-order and continues phase transitions are observed for quarkyonic, chiral, and deconfinement phase transitions. The corresponding compact star structures are then investigated and confronted with various astrophysical constraints.</description>

      <title>Silk Damping in Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves: A Novel Probe for New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silk damping is well known in the study of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and accounts for suppression of the angular power spectrum of CMB on large angular multipoles. In this Letter, we study the effect of Silk damping on the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). Resulting from the dissipation of cosmic fluid, the Silk damping notably suppresses the energy-density spectrum of SIGWs on scales comparable to a diffusion scale at the decoupling time of feebly-interacting particles. The effect offers a novel observable for probing the underlying particle interaction, especially for those mediated by heavy gauge bosons beyond the standard model of particles. We anticipate that pulsar timing arrays are sensitive to gauge bosons with mass $\sim10^{3}-10^{4}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, while space- and ground-based interferometers to those with mass $\sim10^7-10^{12}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, leading to essential complements to on-going and future experiments of high-energy physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have applied thermodynamic stability analysis to derive the stability and causality conditions for conventional relativistic viscous hydrodynamics and spin hydrodynamics. We obtain the thermodynamic stability conditions for second-order relativistic hydrodynamics with shear and bulk viscous tensors, finding them identical to those derived from linear mode analysis. We then derive the thermodynamic stability conditions for minimal causal extended second-order spin hydrodynamics in canonical form, both with and without viscous tensors. Without viscous tensors, the constraints from thermodynamic stability exactly match those from linear mode analysis. In the presence of viscous tensors, the thermodynamic stability imposes more stringent constraints than those obtained from linear mode analysis. Our results suggest that conditions derived from thermodynamic stability analysis can guarantee both causality and stability in linear mode analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-redshift probes, such as Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Supernovae Ia luminosity distances, have been shown to be crucial for improving the bounds on the total neutrino mass from cosmological observations, due to their ability to break degeneracies among the different parameters. Here, we expand background observations to include $H(z)$ measurements from cosmic chronometers, distance moduli from Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), and angular diameter distances from galaxy clusters. For the very first time, we find neutrino mass limits below the minimal expectations from neutrino oscillation probes, suggesting non-standard neutrino and/or cosmological scenarios. The tightening of the neutrino mass bound is due to the slightly higher value of the Hubble constant $H_0$ preferred by the former three background probes, and also due to the improved errors on $H_0$ and the matter mass-energy density $\Omega_{\rm m}$. All values of $H_0$ are however in agreement at the $1-2\sigma$ level. Interestingly, it is not only the combination of the three background probes that is responsible for the $\sum m_\nu &lt;0.06$~eV limits, but also each of them independently. The tightest bound we find here is $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.043$~eV at $2\sigma$ after combining Cosmic Microwave Background Planck data with DESI BAO, Supernovae Ia, GRBs, cosmic chronometers, and galaxy clusters, showing a clear tension between neutrino oscillation results and cosmological analyses. In general, removing either one of the two background probes still provides a limit $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.06$~eV, reassuring the enormous potential of these low-redshift observations in constraining the neutrino mass.</description>

Abstract: This work shows that the known phase boundary between the phase with chiral symmetry and the phase of spatially inhomogeneous chiral symmetry breaking in the phase diagram of the $(1 + 1)$-dimensional chiral Gross-Neveu model can be detected from the bosonic two-point function alone and thereby confirms and extends previous results arXiv:hep-th/0008175, arXiv:0807.2571, arXiv:0909.3714, arXiv:1810.03921, arXiv:2203.08503. The analysis is refered to as the stability analysis of the symmetric phase and does not require knowledge about spatial modulations of condensates. We perform this analysis in the infinite-$N$ limit at nonzero temperature and nonzero quark and chiral chemical potentials also inside the inhomogeneous phase. Thereby we observe an interesting relation between the bosonic $1$-particle irreducible two-point vertex function of the chiral Gross-Neveu model and the spinodal line of the Gross-Neveu model.</description>

Abstract: We study coherent diffractive photon and vector meson production in electron-proton and electron-nucleus collisions within the Color Glass Condensate effective field theory. We show that electron-photon and electron-vector meson azimuthal angle correlations are sensitive to non-trivial spatial correlations in the gluon distribution of the target, and perform explicit calculations using spatially dependent McLerran-Venugopalan initial color charge configurations coupled to the numerical solution of small $x$ JIMWLK evolution equations. We compute the cross-section differentially in $Q^2$ and $|t|$ and find sizeable anisotropies in the electron-photon and electron-$\mathrm{J}/\psi$ azimuthal correlations ($v_{1,2} \approx 2 - 10 \%$) in electron-proton collisions for the kinematics of the future Electron-Ion Collider. In electron-gold collisions these modulations are found to be significantly smaller ($v_{1,2} &lt;0.1 \%$). We also compute incoherent diffractive production where we find that the azimuthal correlations are sensitive to fluctuations of the gluon distribution in the target.</description>

Abstract: The effective interaction of a neutrino with a photon in magnetized plasma is obtained from a strong field expansion in the electroweak standard model. The interaction is expressed by a Chern-Simons form of the neutrino current and the electromagnetic vector potential of the coupling strength proportional to $\frac{n_e}{B} \times e G_F$. The derivation of the interaction Lagrangian and its properties are presented.</description>

      <title>Dark Moments for the Standard Model ?</title>

Abstract: If dark matter (DM) interacts with the Standard Model (SM) via the kinetic mixing (KM) portal, it necessitates the existence of portal matter (PM) particles which carry both dark and SM quantum numbers that will appear in vacuum polarization-like loop graphs. In addition to the familiar $\sim e\epsilon Q$ strength, QED-like interaction for the dark photon (DP), in some setups different loop graphs of these PM states can also induce other coupling structures for the SM fermions that may come to dominate in at least some regions of parameter space regions and which can take the form of `dark' moments, eg, magnetic dipole-type interactions in the IR, associated with a large mass scale, $\Lambda$. In this paper, motivated by a simple toy model, we perform a phenomenological investigation of a possible loop-induced dark magnetic dipole moment for SM fermions, in particular, for the electron. We show that at the phenomenological level such a scenario can not only be made compatible with existing experimental constraints for a significant range of correlated values for $\Lambda$ and the dark $U(1)_D$ gauge coupling, $g_D$, but can also lead to quantitatively different signatures once the DP is discovered. In this setup, assuming complex scalar DM to satisfy CMB constraints, parameter space regions where the DP decays invisibly are found to be somewhat preferred if PM mass limits from direct searches at the LHC and our toy model setup are all taken seriously. High precision searches for, or measurements of, the $e^+e^- \to \gamma +{\rm DP}$ process at Belle II are shown to provide some of the strongest future constraints on this scenario.</description>

      <title>A dress of flavour to suit any jet</title>

Abstract: Identifying the flavour of reconstructed hadronic jets is critical for precision phenomenology and the search for new physics at collider experiments, as it allows to pinpoint specific scattering processes and reject backgrounds. Jet measurements at the LHC are almost universally performed using the anti-$k_T$ algorithm, however no approach exists to define the jet flavour for this algorithm that is infrared and collinear (IRC) safe. We propose a new approach, a flavour dressing algorithm, that is IRC safe to all orders in perturbation theory and can be combined with any definition of a jet. We test the algorithm in $\mathrm{e}^+\mathrm{e}^-$ and $\mathrm{p}\mathrm{p}$ environments, and consider the $\mathrm{p}\mathrm{p} \to \mathrm{Z}+\mathrm{b}\text{-jet}$ process as a practical application.</description>

      <title>Testing Meson Portal Dark Sector Solutions to the MiniBooNE Anomaly at CCM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A solution to the MiniBooNE excess invoking rare three-body decays of the charged pions and kaons to new states in the MeV mass scale was recently proposed as a dark-sector explanation. This class of solution illuminates the fact that, while the charged pions were focused in the target-mode run, their decay products were isotropically suppressed in the beam-dump-mode run in which no excess was observed. This suggests a new physics solution correlated to the mesonic sector. We investigate an extended set of phenomenological models that can explain the MiniBooNE excess as a dark sector solution, utilizing long-lived particles that might be produced in the three-body decays of the charged mesons and the two-body anomalous decays of the neutral mesons. Over a broad set of interactions with the long-lived particles, we show that these scenarios can be compatible with constraints from LSND, KARMEN, and MicroBooNE, and evaluate the sensitivity of the ongoing and future data taken by the Coherent CAPTAIN Mills experiment (CCM) to a potential discovery in this parameter space.</description>

      <title>CMS results for the $\gamma \gamma$ production at the LHC: do they give a hint for a Higgs boson of the maximally CP symmetric two-Higgs-doublet model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the CMS experiment at the LHC show possibly, with about $3\sigma$ significance, a resonance in di-photon events with an invariant mass of 95.4 GeV. If this resonance can be confirmed, this could be a hint for a new elementary particle beyond the Standard Model. An additional Standard-model-like Higgs boson with this mass could be excluded by the CMS experiment. We investigate whether this resonance could fit into a two-Higgs-doublet model highly constrained by CP symmetry, the so-called maximally-CP-symmetric model (MCPM). Our finding shows that indeed the enhancement measured by CMS could originate from the pseudoscalar Higgs boson $h''$ of this model. According to the model the boson $h''$ would mainly be produced in the Drell-Yan reaction by charm-anticharm-quark fusion. The main decay mode of $h''$ is predicted to be $h'' \to c\bar{c}$. We then consider the so called oblique parameters $S$, $T$, $U$ which give us an allowed region for the mass of the scalar Higgs boson $h'$ versus that of the charged ones $H^\pm$ of the MCPM. We calculate the effect of these charged bosons $H^\pm$ in the leptonic decay of the charm-strange mesons $D_s^\pm$. Our results indicate that the mass $m_H$ of the charged Higgs bosons $H^\pm$ of the MCPM should be around 300 GeV.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Higgs inflation and dark matter models with dark $U(1)$ gauge symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate dark matter phenomenology and Higgs inflation in a dark $U(1)_D$-extended model. The model features two dark matter candidates, a dark fermion and a dark vector boson. When the fermion dark matter $\psi$ is heavier than the vector dark matter $W_D$, there is an ample parameter space where $\psi$ is dominant over $W_D$. The model can then easily evade the stringent bounds from direct detection experiments, since $\psi$ has no direct coupling to the Standard Model particles. Furthermore, the model can accommodate inflation in three different ways, one along the Standard Model Higgs direction, one along the dark Higgs direction, and one along the combination of the two. Considering the running of the parameters and various observational constraints, we perform a detailed numerical analysis and identify allowed parameter spaces that explain both dark matter and Higgs inflation in a unified manner. We discuss in detail how the imposition of Higgs inflation severely constrains the dark matter parameter space. The existence of the dark Higgs field is found to play a crucial role both in dark matter phenomenology and in generalised Higgs inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we investigate $X_0(2900)$ and its spin partners productions in the $B^+$ decay processes, where $X_0(2900)$ is regarded as a $\bar{D}^\ast K^\ast$ molecular state. We infer that the initial $B^+$ meson and the final $D^+ X_0(2900)$ are connected through $D_{s1}^+(2460) \bar{D}^{\ast 0} $ mesons by exchanging a $K^{\ast 0}$ meson. The contributions from such a meson loop to the process $B^+ \to D^+ X_0(2900)$ are evaluated and our estimations indicate that the measured branching fraction of $B^+\to D^+ X_0(2900)$ could be well reproduced in a reasonable model parameter range, which indicates that $X_0(2900)$ could be interpreted as a $\bar{D}^\ast K^\ast $ molecular state. In addition, the production processes $B^+ \to D^+ \tilde{X}_{1,2}$, $B^+ \to D^{\ast +} X_0(2900)$, and $B^+ \to D^{\ast +}\tilde{X}_{1,2}$ are investigated, and we find that the fit fraction of $\tilde{X}_1$ in the process $B^+ \to D^{\ast +} D^{\ast -} K^+$ is aobut $6\%$, which should be accessible experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\gamma$-ray emission of blazars infer the presence of large-scale magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium, but their origin remains a mystery. Using recent data from MAGIC, H.E.S.S. and $\textit{Fermi}$-LAT, we investigate whether the large-scale magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium could have been generated by a first-order electroweak phase transition in the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM). We study two representative scenarios where we vary the initial conditions of the magnetic field and the plasma, assuming either a primordial magnetic field with maximal magnetic helicity or a primordial magnetic field with negligible magnetic helicity in a plasma with kinetic helicity. By considering a primordial magnetic field with maximal helicity and applying the conservative constraints derived from MAGIC and $\textit{Fermi}$-LAT data, we demonstrate that a first-order electroweak phase transition within the 2HDM may account for the observed intergalactic magnetic fields in the case of the strongest transitions. We show that this parameter space also predicts strong gravitational wave signals in the reach of space-based detectors such as LISA, providing a striking multi-messenger signal of the 2HDM.</description>

      <title>Polarized fragmenting jet functions in Inclusive and Exclusive Jet Production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a complete theoretical framework for analyzing the distribution of polarized hadrons within jets, with and without measuring the transverse momentum relative to the standard jet axis. Using soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), we derive the factorization and provide the theoretical calculation of both semi-inclusive and exclusive fragmenting jet functions (FJFs) under longitudinal and transverse polarization. With the polarized FJFs, one gains access to a variety of new observables that can be used for extracting both collinear and transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs) and fragmentation functions (FFs). As examples, we provide numerical results for the spin asymmetry $A_{TU,T}^{\cos(\phi _S - \hat{\phi}_{S_h})}$ from polarized semi-inclusive hadron-in-jet production in polarized $pp$ collisions at RHIC kinematics, where a transversely polarized quark would lead to the transverse spin of the final-state hadron inside the jet and is thus sensitive to the transversity fragmentation functions. Similarly, another spin asymmetry, $A_{TU, L}^{\cos(\phi _q - \phi _{S})}$ from polarized exclusive hadron-in-jet production in polarized $ep$ collisions at EIC kinematics would allow us to access the helicity fragmentation functions. These observables demonstrate promising potential in investigating transverse momentum dependent PDFs and FFs and are worthwhile for further measurements.</description>

Abstract: We propose an external field approach to evaluating effective action allowing the interaction to act everywhere at all times (everlasting). Requiring that the asymptotic gauge fields are always-interacting, we implement displacement fields encoding polarization corrections into the derivation of effective action. The result is a novel polarization summation for one-cut reducible loop diagrams, which can be applied to two cases: transient quasi-constant electromagnetic fields, and everlasting interactions. In the first case, a perturbative expansion of our result recovers the Schwinger-Dyson reducible diagram series with a Landau pole. The everlasting summation evaluated in nonperturbative fashion removes the Landau pole, providing a new avenue for modeling strongly interacting theories.</description>

      <title>Effects of Electroweak Symmetry Breaking on Axion Like Particles as Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion like particles (ALPs), the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated to the spontaneous breaking of global symmetry, have emerged as promising dark matter candidates. Conventionally, in the context of misalignment mechanism, the non-thermally produced ALPs happen to stay frozen due to Hubble friction initially and at a later stage, they begin to oscillate (before matter-radiation equality) at characteristic frequencies defined by their masses and behaving like cold dark matter. In this work, we study the influence of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB), through a higher order Higgs portal interaction, on the evolution of ALPs. Such an interaction is found to contribute partially to the ALP's mass during EWSB, thereby modifying oscillation frequencies during EWSB as well as impacting upon the existing correlation between the scale of symmetry breaking and their masses. The novelty of the work lies in broadening the relic satisfied parameter space so as to probe it in near future via a wide range of experiments.</description>

      <title>First Detailed Calculation of Atmospheric Neutrino Foregrounds to the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background in Super-Kamiokande</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) -- a probe of the core-collapse mechanism and the cosmic star-formation history -- has not been detected, but its discovery may be imminent. A significant obstacle for DSNB detection in Super-Kamiokande (Super-K) is detector backgrounds, especially due to atmospheric neutrinos (more precisely, these are foregrounds), which are not sufficiently understood. We perform the first detailed theoretical calculations of these foregrounds in the range 16--90 MeV in detected electron energy, taking into account several physical and detector effects, quantifying uncertainties, and comparing our predictions to the 15.9 livetime years of pre-gadolinium data from Super-K stages I--IV. We show that our modeling reasonably reproduces this low-energy data as well as the usual high-energy atmospheric-neutrino data. To accelerate progress on detecting the DSNB, we outline key actions to be taken in future theoretical and experimental work. In a forthcoming paper, we use our modeling to detail how low-energy atmospheric-neutrino events register in Super-K and suggest new cuts to reduce their impact.</description>

      <title>Towards a systematic study of non-thermal leptogenesis from inflaton decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates non-thermal leptogenesis from inflaton decays in the minimal extension of the canonical type-I seesaw model, where a complex singlet scalar $\phi$ is introduced to generate the Majorana masses of right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) and to play the role of inflaton. First, we systematically study non-thermal leptogenesis with the least model dependence. We give a general classification of the parameter space and find four characteristic limits by carefully examining the interplay between inflaton decay into RHNs and the decay of RHNs into the standard-model particles. Three of the four limits are truly non-thermal, with a final efficiency larger than that of thermal leptogenesis. Two analytic estimates for these three limits are provided with working conditions to examine the validity. In particular, we find that the {\it strongly non-thermal RHNs} scenario occupies a large parameter space, including the oscillation-preferred $K$ range, and works well for a relatively-low reheating temperature $T^{}_{\rm RH} \geq 10^3~{\rm GeV}$, extending the lower bound on the RHN mass to $2\times 10^{7}~{\rm GeV}$. The lepton flavor effects are discussed. Second, we demonstrate that such a unified picture for inflation, neutrino masses, and baryon number asymmetry can be realized by either a Coleman-Weinberg potential (for the real part of $\phi$) or a natural inflation potential (for the imaginary part of $\phi$). The allowed parameter ranges for successful inflation and non-thermal leptogenesis are much more constrained than those without inflationary observations. We find that non-thermal leptogenesis from inflaton decay offers a testable framework for the early Universe. It can be further tested with upcoming cosmological and neutrino data. The model-independent investigation of non-thermal leptogenesis should be useful in exploring this direction.</description>

Abstract: Particle collisions at the energy frontier can probe the nature of invisible dark matter via production in association with recoiling visible objects. We propose a new potential production mode, in which dark matter is produced by the decay of a heavy dark Higgs boson radiated from a heavy $W'$ boson. In such a model, motivated by left-right symmetric theories, dark matter would not be pair produced in association with other recoiling objects due to its lack of direct coupling to quarks or gluons. We study the hadronic decay mode via $W'\rightarrow tb$ and estimate the LHC exclusion sensitivity at 95\% confidence level to be $10^2-10^5$ fb for $W'$ boson masses between 250 and 1750 GeV.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of CP-violation in atoms, molecules and role of medium-heavy systems</title>

Abstract: Detection of parity (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetry-odd electric dipole moments (EDMs) within currently achievable resolution would evidence physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Via the CPT-theorem, which includes charge conjugation (C), such low-energy searches complement high-energy physics experiments that probe CP-violation up to the TeV scale. Heavy-elemental atoms and molecules are considered to be among the most promising candidates for a first direct detection of P,T-violation due to enhancement effects that increase steeply with increasing nuclear charge number $Z$. However, different P,T-odd sources on the subatomic level can contribute to molecular or atomic EDMs, which are target of measurements, and this complicates obtaining rigorous bounds on P,T-violation on a fundamental level. Consequently, several experiments of complementary sensitivity to these individual P,T-odd sources are required for this purpose. Herein, a simply-applicable qualitative model is developed for global analysis of the P,T-odd parameter space from an electronic-structure theory perspective. Rules of thumb are derived for the choice of atoms and molecules in terms of their angular momenta and nuclear charge number. Contrary to naive expectations from $Z$-scaling laws, it is demonstrated that medium-heavy molecules with $Z\leq54$ can be of great value to tighten global bounds on P,T-violating parameters, in particular, if the number of complementary experiments increases. The model is confirmed by explicit density functional theory calculations of all relevant P,T-odd electronic structure parameters in systems that were used in past experiments or are of current interest for future experiments, respectively: the atoms Xe, Cs, Yb, Hg, Tl, Ra, Fr and the molecules CaOH, SrOH, YO, CdH, BaF, YbF, YbOH, HfF$^+$, WC, TlF, PbO, RaF, ThO, ThF$^+$ and PaF$^{3+}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the neutrino-electron elastic scattering cross section, extending the results previously obtained in arXiv:1702.05721v2, in the presence of generic new interactions that take into account all the effects caused by finite neutrino masses. We address the potential significance of a heavy neutrino sector during precision measurements, particularly for tau neutrinos scattering with masses in the MeV range, for which the existing upper bounds on $|U_{\tau 4}|^2$ would result in conceivably measurable contributions. Finally, we comment on the possibility to distinguish between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos, including the analysis of the new emerging parameters and its application to illustrative model-dependent scenarios.</description>

      <title>Mixed NNLO QCD $\times$ electroweak corrections to single-Z production in pole approximation: differential distributions and forward-backward asymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiative corrections in pole approximation, which are based on the leading contribution in a systematic expansion of amplitudes about resonance poles, naturally decompose into factorizable corrections attributed to the production or decay of the resonance and non-factorizable corrections induced by soft photon (or gluon) exchange between those subprocesses. In this paper we complete an earlier calculation of mixed QCD$\times$electroweak corrections of $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s\alpha)$ to the neutral-current Drell-Yan cross section in pole approximation by including the previously neglected corrections that are solely related to the Z-boson production process. We present numerical results both for differential distributions and for the forward-backward asymmetry differential in the lepton-pair invariant mass, which is the key observable in the measurement of the effective weak mixing angle at the LHC. Carefully disentangling the various types of factorizable and non-factorizable corrections, we find (as expected in our earlier work) that the by far most important contribution at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s\alpha)$ originates from the interplay of initial-state QCD corrections and electroweak final-state corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the confining color flux tube picture, we assess the color electric field generated by quark-antiquark pairs within the framework of the Schwinger model and estimate its impact on the chiral condensate. We observe differences in the distribution of the color flux tube generated by quark-antiquark pairs at different separation distances, leading to discrepancies in the partial restoration of chiral symmetry. Furthermore, we suggest incorporating the color magnetic field in the calculation of chiral condensate, leading to quantum entanglement effects, and proceed to compute the entanglement entropy. We observe that the entanglement entropy increases with the distance of the color source (the separation distance between quark and anti-quark), and the magnitude of the color electric field and chiral condensate restoration after spatial integration also increases with the distance of the color source. Then, we try to provide a qualitative explanation for the existence of these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Decoupling of the structure functions in momentum space based on the Laplace transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Laplace transform techniques, we describe the determination of the longitudinal structure function $F_{L}(x,Q^2)$, at the leading-order approximation in momentum space, from the structure function $F_{2}(x,Q^2)$ and its derivative with respect to ${\ln}Q^2$ in a kinematical region of low values of the Bjorken variable $x$. Since the $x$ dependence of $F_2(x,Q^2)$ and its evolution with $Q^2$ are determined much better by the data than $F_L(x,Q^2)$, this method provides both a direct check on $F_L(x,Q^2)$ where measured, and a way of extending $F_L(x,Q^2)$ into regions of $x$ and $Q^2$ where there are currently no data. In our calculations, we ultilize the Block-Durand-Ha parametrization for the structure function $F_{2}(x,Q^2)$ [M. M. Block, L. Durand and P. Ha, Phys.Rev.D {\bf89}, 094027 (2014)]. We find that the Laplace transform method in momentum space provides correct behaviors of the extracted longitudinal structure function $F_{L}(x,Q^2)$ and that our obtained results are in line with data from the H1 Collaboration and other results for $F_{L}(x,Q^2)$ obtained using Mellin transform method.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Dark Matter from Dynamical Heating of Stars in Ultrafaint Dwarfs. Part 2: Substructure and the Primordial Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a large and growing interest in observations of small-scale structure in dark matter. We propose a new way to probe dark matter structures in the $\sim 10 - 10^8 \, M_\odot$ range. This allows us to constrain the primordial power spectrum over shorter distances scales than possible with direct observations from the CMB. For $k$ in the range $\sim 10 - 1000 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ our constraints on the power spectrum are orders of magnitude stronger than previous bounds.
  We also set some of the strongest constraints on dark matter isocurvature perturbations. Our method relies on the heating effect such dark matter substructures would have on the distribution of stars in an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy. Many models of inflation produce enhanced power at these short distance scales and can thus be constrained by our observation. Further, many dark matter models such as axion dark matter, self-interacting dark matter and dissipative dark matter, produce dense structures which could be constrained this way.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity and gluon cascades in the high energy limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We point out an interesting connection between the mathematical framework of the Krylov basis, which is used to quantify quantum complexity, and the entanglement entropy in high-energy QCD. In particular, we observe that the cascade equation of the dipole model is equivalent to the $SL(2,R)$ Schrodinger equation in the Krylov basis. Consequently, the Krylov complexity corresponds to the average distribution of partons and the Krylov entropy is the counterpart the entanglement entropy computations of \cite{Kharzeev:2017qzs}. Our work not only brings new tools for exploring quantum information and complexity in QCD, but also gives hope for experimental tests of some of the recent, physical probes of quantum complexity.</description>

      <title>Topological susceptibility and axion potential in two-flavor superconductive quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the potential of the axion, $a$, of Quantum Chromodynamics, in the two-flavor color superconducting phase of cold and dense quark matter. We adopt a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-like model. Our interaction contains two terms, one preserving and one breaking the $U(1)_A$ symmetry: the latter is responsible of the coupling of axions to quarks. We introduce two quark condensates, $h_L$ and $h_R$, describing condensation for left-handed and right-handed quarks respectively; we then study the loci of the minima of the thermodynamic potential, $\Omega$, in the $(h_L,h_R)$ plane, noticing how the instanton-induced interaction favors condensation in the scalar channel when the $\theta-$angle, $\theta=a/f_a$, vanishes. Increasing $\theta$ we find a phase transition where the scalar condensate rotates into a pseudo-scalar one. We present an analytical result for the topological susceptibility, $\chi$, in the superconductive phase, which stands both at zero and at finite temperature. Finally, we compute the axion mass and its self-coupling. In particular, the axion mass $m_a$ is related to the full topological susceptibility via $\chi=m_a^2 f_a^2$, hence our result for $\chi$ gives an analytical result for $m_a$ in the superconductive phase of high-density Quantum Chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Probing bottom-associated production of a TeV scale scalar decaying to a top quark and dark matter at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A minimal non-thermal dark matter model that can explain both the existence of dark matter and the baryon asymmetry in the universe is studied. It requires two color-triplet, iso-singlet scalars with $\mathcal{O}$(TeV) masses and a singlet Majorana fermion with a mass of $\mathcal{O}$(GeV). The fermion becomes stable and can play the role of the dark matter candidate. We consider the fermion to interact with a top quark via the exchange of QCD-charged scalar fields coupled dominantly to third generation fermions. The signature of a single top quark production associated with a bottom quark and large missing transverse momentum opens up the possibility to search for this type of model at the LHC in a way complementary to existing monotop searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-intensity neutron beams, such as those available at the European Spallation Source (ESS), provide new opportunities for fundamental discoveries. Here we discuss a novel Ramsey neutron-beam experiment to search for ultralight axion dark matter through its coupling to neutron spins, which would cause the neutron spins to rotate about the velocity of the neutrons relative to the dark matter halo. We estimate that experiments at the HIBEAM beamline at the ESS can improve the sensitivity to the axion-neutron coupling compared to the current best laboratory limits by up to $2-3$ orders of magnitude over the axion mass range $10^{-22} \, \textrm{eV} - 10^{-16}$ eV.</description>

Abstract: Transverse momentum spectra of identified pions, Kaons , protons and Lambdas produced at mid-rapidity (0 &lt; ycm &lt; 0.5) in p-Pb collisions at root(sNN) = 5.02 TeV is studied for different collision centralities by using a Unified Statistical Thermal Freeze-out Model (USTFM). A fairly good agreement is seen between the calculated results and the experimental data points taken from the ALICE experiment. Kinetic freeze-out conditions are extracted from the fits of the transverse momentum spectra of these hadrons for each centrality class. A comparison of the obtained freeze-out parameters with those of heavy-ion collisions (Pb + Pb) is made and discussed.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark photon dark matter using data from LIGO's and Virgo's third observing run</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.13085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a search for dark photon dark matter that could couple to gravitational-wave interferometers using data from Advanced LIGO and Virgo's third observing run. To perform this analysis, we use two methods, one based on cross-correlation of the strain channels in the two nearly aligned LIGO detectors, and one that looks for excess power in the strain channels of the LIGO and Virgo detectors. The excess power method optimizes the Fourier Transform coherence time as a function of frequency, to account for the expected signal width due to Doppler modulations. We do not find any evidence of dark photon dark matter with a mass between $m_{\rm A} \sim 10^{-14}-10^{-11}$ eV/$c^2$, which corresponds to frequencies between 10-2000 Hz, and therefore provide upper limits on the square of the minimum coupling of dark photons to baryons, i.e. $U(1)_{\rm B}$ dark matter. For the cross-correlation method, the best median constraint on the squared coupling is $\sim2.65\times10^{-46}$ at $m_{\rm A}\sim4.31\times10^{-13}$ eV/$c^2$; for the other analysis, the best constraint is $\sim 2.4\times 10^{-47}$ at $m_{\rm A}\sim 5.7\times 10^{-13}$ eV/$c^2$. These limits improve upon those obtained in direct dark matter detection experiments by a factor of $\sim100$ for $m_{\rm A}\sim [2-4]\times 10^{-13}$ eV/$c^2$, and are, in absolute terms, the most stringent constraint so far in a large mass range $m_A\sim$ $2\times 10^{-13}-8\times 10^{-12}$ eV/$c^2$.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound in dense strong-interaction matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.06328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the speed of sound in strong-interaction matter at zero temperature and in density regimes which are expected to be governed by the presence of a color-superconducting gap. At (very) high densities, our analysis indicates that the speed of sound approaches its asymptotic value associated with the non-interacting quark gas from below, in agreement with first-principles studies which do not take the presence of a color-superconducting gap into account. Towards lower densities, however, the presence of a gap induces an increase of the speed of sound above its asymptotic value. Importantly, even if gap-induced corrections to the pressure may appear small, we find that derivatives of the gap with respect to the chemical potential can still be sizeable and lead to a qualitative change of the density dependence of the speed of sound. Taking into account constraints on the density dependence of the speed of sound at low densities, our general considerations suggest the existence of a maximum in the speed of sound. Interestingly, we also observe that specific properties of the gap can be related to characteristic properties of the speed of sound which are indirectly constrained by observations.</description>

      <title>Local Thermodynamics and Entropy for Relativistic Hydrostatic Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By refining the method proposed in arXiv:2010.07660, entropy current and entropy density for a relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium system with spherical symmetry are constructed as a non-Noether conserved charge in the Einstein gravity with cosmological constant. It is shown that the constructed entropy density satisfies both the local Euler relation and the first law of thermodynamics non-perturbatively with respect to the Newton constant. Finally the established relativistic thermodynamics is applied to one of the systems with uniform energy density as a crude model of a degenerate star and its local thermodynamic observables are determined analytically.</description>

      <title>Palatini $F(R,X)$: a new framework for inflationary attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Palatini $F(R)$ gravity proved to be a powerful tool in order to realize asymptotically flat inflaton potentials. Unfortunately, it also inevitably implies higher-order inflaton kinetic terms in the Einstein frame that might jeopardize the evolution of the system out of the slow-roll regime. We prove that a $F(R+X)$ gravity, where $X$ is the inflaton kinetic term, solves the issue. Moreover, when $F$ is a quadratic function such a choice easily leads to a new class of inflationary attractors, fractional attractors, that generalizes the already well-known polynomial $\alpha$-attractors.</description>

      <title>The state of the dark energy equation of state circa 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We critically examine the state of current constraints on the dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) $w$. Our study is motivated by the observation that, while broadly consistent with the cosmological constant value $w=-1$, several independent probes appear to point towards a slightly phantom EoS ($w \sim -1.03$) which, if confirmed, could have important implications for the Hubble tension. We pay attention to the apparent preference for phantom DE from Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data alone, whose origin we study in detail and attribute to a wide range of (physical and geometrical) effects. We deem the combination of Planck CMB, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Type Ia Supernovae, and Cosmic Chronometers data to be particularly trustworthy, inferring from this final consensus dataset $w=-1.013^{+0.038}_{-0.043}$, in excellent agreement with the cosmological constant value. Overall, despite a few scattered hints, we find no compelling evidence forcing us away from the cosmological constant (yet).</description>

      <title>Probing Parity Violation in the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background with Astrometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrometry holds the potential for testing fundamental physics through the effects of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) in the $\sim 1-100$ nHz frequency band on precision measurements of stellar positions. Such measurements are complementary to tests made possible by the detection of the SGWB using Pulsar Timing Arrays. Here, the feasibility of using astrometry for the identification of parity-violating signals within the SGWB is investigated. This is achieved by defining and quantifying a non-vanishing $EB$ correlation function within astrometric correlation functions, and investigating how one might estimate the detectability of such signals.</description>

      <title>Search for Non-Tensorial Gravitational-Wave Backgrounds in the NANOGrav 15-Year Data Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of a stochastic signal in the NANOGrav 15-year data set has aroused great interest in uncovering its origin. However, the evidence for the Hellings-Downs correlations, a key signature of the gravitational-wave background (GWB) predicted by general relativity, remains inconclusive. In this letter, we search for an isotropic non-tensorial GWB, allowed by general metric theories of gravity, in the NANOGrav 15-year data set. Our analysis reveals a Bayes factor of approximately 2.5, comparing the quadrupolar (tensor transverse, TT) correlations to the scalar transverse (ST) correlations, suggesting that the ST correlations provide a comparable explanation for the observed stochastic signal in the NANOGrav data. We obtain the median and the $90\%$ equal-tail amplitudes as $\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{ST} = 7.8^{+5.1}_{-3.5} \times 10^{-15}$ at the frequency of 1/year. Furthermore, we find that the vector longitudinal (VL) and scalar longitudinal (SL) correlations are weakly and strongly disfavoured by data, respectively, yielding upper limits on the amplitudes: $\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{VL}^{95\%} \lesssim 1.7 \times 10^{-15}$ and $\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{SL}^{95\%} \lesssim 7.4 \times 10^{-17}$. Lastly, we fit the NANOGrav data with the general transverse (GT) correlations parameterized by a free parameter $\alpha$. Our analysis yields $\alpha=1.74^{+1.18}_{-1.41}$, thus excluding both the TT ($\alpha=3$) and ST ($\alpha=0$) models at the $90\%$ confidence level.</description>

      <title>First Results from a Broadband Search for Dark Photon Dark Matter in the $44$ to $52\,\mu$eV range with a coaxial dish antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present first results from a dark photon dark matter search in the mass range from 44 to 52 $\mu{\rm eV}$ ($10.7 - 12.5\,{\rm GHz}$) using a room-temperature dish antenna setup called GigaBREAD. Dark photon dark matter converts to ordinary photons on a cylindrical metallic emission surface with area $0.5\,{\rm m}^2$ and is focused by a novel parabolic reflector onto a horn antenna. Signals are read out with a low-noise receiver system. A first data taking run with 24 days of data does not show evidence for dark photon dark matter in this mass range, excluding dark photon - photon mixing parameters $\chi \gtrsim 10^{-12}$ in this range at 90% confidence level. This surpasses existing constraints by about two orders of magnitude and is the most stringent bound on dark photons in this range below 49 $\mu$eV.</description>

      <title>Dark matter signatures of black holes with Yukawa potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study uses a nonsingular Yukawa--modified potential to obtain a static and spherically symmetric black hole solution with a cosmological constant. Such Yukawa--like corrections are encoded in two parameters, $\alpha$ and $\lambda$, that modify Newton's law of gravity in large distances, and a deformation parameter $\ell_0$, which plays an essential role in short distances. The most significant effect is encoded in $\alpha$, which modifies the total black hole mass with an extra mass proportional to $\alpha M$, mimicking the dark matter effects at large distances from the black hole. On the other hand, the effect due to $\lambda$ is small for astrophysical values. We scrutinize the \textit{quasinormal} frequencies and shadows associated with a spherically symmetric black hole and the thermodynamical behavior influenced by the Yukawa potential. In particular, the thermodynamics of this black hole displays a rich behavior, including possible phase transitions. We use the WKB method to probe the \textit{quasinormal} modes of massless scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational field perturbations. In order to check the influence of the parameters on the shadow radius, we consider astrophysical data to determine their values, incorporating information on an optically thin radiating and infalling gas surrounding a black hole to model the black hole shadow image. In particular, we consider Sgr A* black hole as an example and we find that its shadow radius changes by order of $10^{-9}$, meaning that the shadow radius of a black hole with Yukawa potential practically gives rise to the same result encountered in the Schwarzschild black hole. Also, in the eikonal regime, using astrophysical data for Yukawa parameters, we show that the value of the real part of the QNMs frequencies changes by $10^{-18}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering an arbitrary dimensional FLRW universe in the framework of a generalized S\'{a}ez--Ballester (SB) theory, we establish a noncommutative (NC) cosmological model. We concentrate on the predictions of NC model and compare them with their commutative counterparts in both the classical and quantum regimes. For the classic case, taking a very small NC parameter, we apply two different methods to analyze the model features. First, we show through numerical analysis that our NC model is a successful inflationary model capable of overcoming the graceful exit and horizon problems. Furthermore, the NC traces are visible the late time, which supports the UV/IR mixing characteristic of the NC models. In the second method, we show that our NC model can correspond to the previously developed NC inflationary models. In the commutative quantum case, we obtain an exact wave function and then use the WKB approximation to show that the solutions of the corresponding classical regime are recovered. Finally, with regard to the NC quantum level, we focus on the special case for which we show that a constant of motion exists. The latter helps us to conveniently transform the corresponding complicated NC-WDW equation into an ordinary differential equation, which can be easily solved numerically for the general case or analytically for some special cases. The resultant solutions show a damping behavior in the wave function associated with the proposed NC model, which may be important in determining the viable initial states for the very early universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In analogy to null electromagnetic fields we define null YM fields. We show that the null non-abelian $SU(N)$ gauge fields admit a set of $2 N^2$ conserved "helicities". We derive null YM solutions that carry finite helicities by uplifting the abelian Hopfion solution and their generalizations. Another method that we implement is to deform YM solutions which do not carry helicities into ones that have nontrivial helicities. A nontrivial non-Abelian solution with helicities is found as a wave of infinite energy. We also discuss non-abelian generalizations of the Bateman parameterization for null abelian gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy of $\boldsymbol{(2+1)}$D SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory on Plaquette Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy of Hamiltonian SU(2) lattice gauge theory in $2+1$ dimensions on linear plaquette chains and show that the entanglement entropies of both ground and excited states follow Page curves. The transition of the subsystem size dependence of the entanglement entropy from the area law for the ground state to the volume law for highly excited states is found to be described by a universal crossover function. Quantum many-body scars in the middle of the spectrum, which are present in the electric flux truncated Hilbert space, where the gauge theory can be mapped onto an Ising model, disappear when higher electric field representations are included in the Hilbert space basis. This suggests the continuum $(2+1)$-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory does not have such scarred states.</description>

      <title>Non-perpetual Eternal Inflation and the Emergent de Sitter Swampland Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel correlation, $n_s$ - $\Delta N$, connecting CMB parameters to the required total e-folds for eternal inflation. This correlation provides a robust tool for evaluating eternal (string) inflation models using CMB data and explores the impact of quantum fluctuations on non-attractor phases. By generalizing eternal inflation criteria, our parameterization simplifies rigorous testing of predictions and reveals a link between refined de Sitter conjecture parameters and the eternal nature of the cosmic landscape. This points to a general tendency towards eternal behavior in low-energy effective field theories within the landscape, opening the possibility for our cosmic stage to potentially embrace a 'multiverse' scenario.</description>

      <title>Local-in-time Conservative Binary Dynamics at Fourth Post-Minkowskian Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging scattering information to describe binary systems in generic orbits requires identifying local- and nonlocal-in-time tail effects. We report here the derivation of the universal (non-spinning) local-in-time conservative dynamics at fourth Post-Minkowskian order, i.e. ${\cal O}(G^4)$. This is achieved by computing the nonlocal-in-time contribution to the deflection angle, and removing it from the full conservative value in [2112.11296,2210.05541]. Unlike the total result, the integration problem involves two scales, velocity and mass ratio, and features multiple polylogarithms, complete elliptic and iterated elliptic integrals, notably in the mass ratio. We reconstruct the local radial action, center-of-mass momentum and Hamiltonian, as well as the exact logarithmic-dependent part(s), all valid for generic orbits. We incorporate the remaining nonlocal terms for elliptic-like motion to sixth Post-Newtonian order. The combined Hamiltonian is in perfect agreement in the overlap with the Post-Newtonian state of the art. The results presented here provide the most accurate description of gravitationally-bound binaries harnessing scattering data to date, readily applicable to waveform modelling.</description>

      <title>Phantom matter: a challenging solution to the cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The idea of composite dark energy (DE) is quite natural since on general grounds we expect that the vacuum energy (associated to the cosmological term $\Lambda$) may appear in combination with other effective forms of DE, denoted $X$. This was indeed the old proposal from 2006 (cf. Ref. [42]), called the `$\Lambda$XCDM model'. In the current work, we deal with a simplified version of this model and exploit the possibility that $X$ behaves as `phantom matter' (PM), which appears in stringy versions of the running vacuum model (RVM). Unlike phantom DE, it satisfies the strong energy condition like usual matter, hence bringing to bear positive pressure at the expense of negative energy. Bubbles of PM may appear in the manner of a transitory `phantom vacuum' tunneled into the late universe before it heads towards a new de Sitter era, thereby offering a crop field for the growing of structures earlier than expected. Using SNIa, cosmic chronometers, transversal BAO, LSS data and the full CMB likelihood from Planck 2018, we find that the tensions virtually disappear in this stringy RVM scenario characterized by axionic dark matter. The value of $H_0$ emerging from our analysis proves compatible with SH0ES to within less than $0.25\sigma$ and the LSS growth tension is nonexistent. The statistical information criteria point to very strong evidence in favor of the PM solution. Finally, our approach favors quintessence-like behavior of the DE below $z\simeq 1.5$ at $\gtrsim 3\sigma$ CL, which is compatible with the recent DESI measurements.</description>

      <title>On possible embeddings of the standard model of particle physics and gravity in $E_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I investigate the structure of $E_8$ under the action of the subalgebra/subgroup $A_1+G_2+C_3$, as a potential route to unification of the fundamental forces of nature into a single algebraic structure. The particular real form $E_{8(-24)}$ supports a decomposition into compact $G_2$ plus split $A_1+C_3$, which allows a restriction from $G_2$ to $SU(3)$ for the strong force, together with split $SL_2(\mathbb R)$ to break the symmetry of the weak interaction and give mass to the intermediate vector bosons. The factor $C_3$ contains various copies of the Lorentz group $SL_2(\mathbb C)$ and extends the `spacetime' symmetries to the full group of symplectic symmetries of real $3+3$-dimensional phase space.
  Restricting $G_2$ to the Standard Model $SU(3)$ extends $C_3$ to $A_5$, in the real form $SU(3,3)$, acting on a complex phase space that includes both momentum and current. There is then a natural restriction from $SU(3,3)$ to $SO(3,3)$, describing the action of $SL_4(\mathbb R)$ on phase space. The resulting action of $SL_4(\mathbb R)$ on $E_8$ includes tensors that are equivalent to the stress-energy tensor, the Ricci tensor and the Riemann tensor, and therefore permits the formalism of general relativity to be developed inside $E_{8(-24)}$. The model then suggests unexpected and perhaps subtle ways in which general relativity and particle physics may be forced to modify each other, in order to produce a unified theory.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the inflationary complexity of the two-mode squeezed state with thermal effect for the single field inflation, modified dispersion relation, and non-trivial sound speed with the method of closed system and open system, respectively. Since the various quantum gravitational framework could lead to this kind of modified dispersion relation and non-trivial sound speed, so that our analysis is valid for most inflationary models. $(a)$. The numeric of Krylov complexity in the method of the closed system indicates that the evolution of Krylov complexity highly depends on the squeezed angle parameter once taking the thermal effect into account, which will decay into some very tiny values, but the Krylov complexity will always enhance without thermal effect. $(b)$. The numeric of circuit complexity shows that the evolution is always increasing no matter whether there are thermal effects or not which is independent of the evolution of squeezed angle parameter. $(c)$. By utilizing the method of open system, we first construct the wave function. Our investigations show the evolution of Krylov complexity will enhance upon some peaks factoring in the thermal effects and the Krylov complexity will always increase without thermal effect. $(d)$. We also calculate the Krylov entropy in the method of closed system and open system, which indicates that the hotter the universe is, the more chaotic the universe becomes. Furthermore, our derivation for the Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy could nicely recover into the case of closed system under the weak dissipative approximation, which confirms the validity of construction for the wave function. Finally, our numeric of Lanczos coefficient shows that the non-trivial sound speed has minimal chaos compared to the other two cases.</description>

Abstract: The bubble wall velocity in the first order phase transition plays an important role in determining both the amplitude and the pivot frequency of stochastic gravitational wave background. In the framework of the minimal left-right symmetric model, we study the wall velocity when the first order phase transition can occur. The wall velocity can be determined by matching the distribution functions in the free particle approximation and the local thermal equilibrium approximation. It is found that the wall velocity can be determined in the range $ 0.2 &lt; v_w &lt; 0.5 $ for the parameter space with the first order phase transition. It is also found that for the case when the wall velocity is close to the speed of sound, the peak amplitude of gravitational wave spectrum can be larger than that in the runaway case. Moreover, It is also found that there exists an approximate power law between the wall velocity and pressure difference between broken and symmetry phases, and the power index is equal to 0.41 or so.</description>
