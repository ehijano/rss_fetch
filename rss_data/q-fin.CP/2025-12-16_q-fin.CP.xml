      <title>EXFormer: A Multi-Scale Trend-Aware Transformer with Dynamic Variable Selection for Foreign Exchange Returns Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately forecasting daily exchange rate returns represents a longstanding challenge in international finance, as the exchange rate returns are driven by a multitude of correlated market factors and exhibit high-frequency fluctuations. This paper proposes EXFormer, a novel Transformer-based architecture specifically designed for forecasting the daily exchange rate returns. We introduce a multi-scale trend-aware self-attention mechanism that employs parallel convolutional branches with differing receptive fields to align observations on the basis of local slopes, preserving long-range dependencies while remaining sensitive to regime shifts. A dynamic variable selector assigns time-varying importance weights to 28 exogenous covariates related to exchange rate returns, providing pre-hoc interpretability. An embedded squeeze-and-excitation block recalibrates channel responses to emphasize informative features and depress noise in the forecasting. Using the daily data for EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and GBP/USD, we conduct out-of-sample evaluations across five different sliding windows. EXFormer consistently outperforms the random walk and other baselines, improving directional accuracy by a statistically significant margin of up to 8.5--22.8%. In nearly one year of trading backtests, the model converts these gains into cumulative returns of 18%, 25%, and 18% for the three pairs, with Sharpe ratios exceeding 1.8. When conservative transaction costs and slippage are accounted for, EXFormer retains cumulative returns of 7%, 19%, and 9%, while other baselines achieve negative. The robustness checks further confirm the model's superiority under high-volatility and bear-market regimes. EXFormer furnishes both economically valuable forecasts and transparent, time-varying insights into the drivers of exchange rate dynamics for international investors, corporations, and central bank practitioners.</description>

      <title>Extending the application of dynamic Bayesian networks in calculating market risk: Standard and stressed expected shortfall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last five years, expected shortfall (ES) and stressed ES (SES) have become key required regulatory measures of market risk in the banking sector, especially following events such as the global financial crisis. Thus, finding ways to optimize their estimation is of great importance. We extend the application of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) to the estimation of 10-day 97.5% ES and stressed ES, building on prior work applying DBNs to value at risk. Using the S&amp;P 500 index as a proxy for the equities trading desk of a US bank, we compare the performance of three DBN structure-learning algorithms with several traditional market risk models, using either the normal or the skewed Student's t return distributions. Backtesting shows that all models fail to produce statistically accurate ES and SES forecasts at the 2.5% level, reflecting the difficulty of modeling extreme tail behavior. For ES, the EGARCH(1,1) model (normal) produces the most accurate forecasts, while, for SES, the GARCH(1,1) model (normal) performs best. All distribution-dependent models deteriorate substantially when using the skewed Student's t distribution. The DBNs perform comparably to the historical simulation model, but their contribution to tail prediction is limited by the small weight assigned to their one-day-ahead forecasts within the return distribution. Future research should examine weighting schemes that enhance the influence of forward-looking DBN forecasts on tail risk estimation.</description>

      <title>Explainable Prediction of Economic Time Series Using IMFs and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the contribution of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) derived from economic time series to the predictive performance of neural network models, specifically Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. To enhance interpretability, DeepSHAP is applied, which estimates the marginal contribution of each IMF while keeping the rest of the series intact. Results show that the last IMFs, representing long-term trends, are generally the most influential according to DeepSHAP, whereas high-frequency IMFs contribute less and may even introduce noise, as evidenced by improved metrics upon their removal. Differences between MLP and LSTM highlight the effect of model architecture on feature relevance distribution, with LSTM allocating importance more evenly across IMFs.</description>

      <title>Empirical Mode Decomposition and Graph Transformation of the MSCI World Index: A Multiscale Topological Analysis for Graph Neural Network Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study applies Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to the MSCI World index and converts the resulting intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) into graph representations to enable modeling with graph neural networks (GNNs). Using CEEMDAN, we extract nine IMFs spanning high-frequency fluctuations to long-term trends. Each IMF is transformed into a graph using four time-series-to-graph methods: natural visibility, horizontal visibility, recurrence, and transition graphs. Topological analysis shows clear scale-dependent structure: high-frequency IMFs yield dense, highly connected small-world graphs, whereas low-frequency IMFs produce sparser networks with longer characteristic path lengths. Visibility-based methods are more sensitive to amplitude variability and typically generate higher clustering, while recurrence graphs better preserve temporal dependencies. These results provide guidance for designing GNN architectures tailored to the structural properties of decomposed components, supporting more effective predictive modeling of financial time series.</description>

      <title>CapOptix: An Options-Framework for Capacity Market Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electricity markets are under increasing pressure to maintain reliability amidst rising renewable penetration, demand variability, and occasional price shocks. Traditional capacity market designs often fall short in addressing this by relying on expected-value metrics of energy unserved, which overlook risk exposure in such systems. In this work, we present CapOptix, a capacity pricing framework that interprets capacity commitments as reliability options, i.e., financial derivatives of wholesale electricity prices. CapOptix characterizes the capacity premia charged by accounting for structural price shifts modeled by the Markov Regime Switching Process. We apply the framework to historical price data from multiple electricity markets and compare the resulting premium ranges with existing capacity remuneration mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Hypothesis-Driven Trading:A Rigorous Walk-Forward Validation Framework for Market Microstructure Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a rigorous walk-forward validation framework for algorithmic trading designed to mitigate overfitting and lookahead bias. Our methodology combines interpretable hypothesis-driven signal generation with reinforcement learning and strict out-of-sample testing. The framework enforces strict information set discipline, employs rolling window validation across 34 independent test periods, maintains complete interpretability through natural language hypothesis explanations, and incorporates realistic transaction costs and position constraints. Validating five market microstructure patterns across 100 US equities from 2015 to 2024, the system yields modest annualized returns (0.55%, Sharpe ratio 0.33) with exceptional downside protection (maximum drawdown -2.76%) and market-neutral characteristics (beta = 0.058). Performance exhibits strong regime dependence, generating positive returns during high-volatility periods (0.60% quarterly, 2020-2024) while underperforming in stable markets (-0.16%, 2015-2019). We report statistically insignificant aggregate results (p-value 0.34) to demonstrate a reproducible, honest validation protocol that prioritizes interpretability and extends naturally to advanced hypothesis generators, including large language models. The key empirical finding reveals that daily OHLCV-based microstructure signals require elevated information arrival and trading activity to function effectively. The framework provides complete mathematical specifications and open-source implementation, establishing a template for rigorous trading system evaluation that addresses the reproducibility crisis in quantitative finance research. For researchers, practitioners, and regulators, this work demonstrates that interpretable algorithmic trading strategies can be rigorously validated without sacrificing transparency or regulatory compliance.</description>

      <title>Advancing Financial Engineering with Foundation Models: Progress, Applications, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of foundation models (FMs), large-scale pre-trained models with strong generalization capabilities, has opened new frontiers for financial engineering. While general-purpose FMs such as GPT-4 and Gemini have demonstrated promising performance in tasks ranging from financial report summarization to sentiment-aware forecasting, many financial applications remain constrained by unique domain requirements such as multimodal reasoning, regulatory compliance, and data privacy. These challenges have spurred the emergence of financial foundation models (FFMs): a new class of models explicitly designed for finance. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of FFMs, with a taxonomy spanning three key modalities: financial language foundation models (FinLFMs), financial time-series foundation models (FinTSFMs), and financial visual-language foundation models (FinVLFMs). We review their architectures, training methodologies, datasets, and real-world applications. Furthermore, we identify critical challenges in data availability, algorithmic scalability, and infrastructure constraints and offer insights into future research opportunities. We hope this survey can serve as both a comprehensive reference for understanding FFMs and a practical roadmap for future innovation.</description>

      <title>CBDC Stress Test in a Dual-Currency Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13384v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the potential impact of introducing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) on financial stability in an emerging dual-currency economy (Romania), where the domestic currency (RON) coexists with the euro. It develops an integrated analytical framework combining econometrics, machine learning, and behavioural modelling. CBDC adoption probabilities are estimated using XGBoost and logistic regression models trained on behavioural and macro-financial indicators rather than survey data. Liquidity stress simulations assess how banks would respond to deposit withdrawals resulting from CBDC adoption, while VAR, MSVAR, and SVAR models capture the macro-financial transmission of liquidity shocks into credit contraction and changes in monetary conditions. The findings indicate that CBDC uptake (co-circulating Digital RON and Digital EUR) would be moderate at issuance, amounting to around EUR 1 billion, primarily driven by digital readiness and trust in the central bank. The study concludes that a non-remunerated, capped CBDC, designed primarily as a means of payment rather than a store of value, can be introduced without compromising financial stability. In dual currency economies, differentiated holding limits for domestic and foreign digital currencies (e.g., Digital RON versus Digital Euro) are crucial to prevent uncontrolled euroisation and preserve monetary sovereignty. A prudent design with moderate caps, non remuneration, and macroprudential coordination can transform CBDC into a digital liquidity buffer and a complementary monetary policy instrument that enhances resilience and inclusion rather than destabilising the financial system.</description>
