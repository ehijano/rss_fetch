      <title>High-Purity Diamond Integration on $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ via Microwave Plasma CVD for Enhanced Thermal Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of diamond with $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ presents a promising pathway to enhance thermal management in high-power electronic devices, where the inherently low thermal conductivity of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ can lead to localized self-heating and elevated junction temperatures. In this work, we demonstrate a scalable, low-damage method to integrate high-quality polycrystalline diamond films on (010) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ substrates using microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD), enabled by dielectric interlayers and polymer-assisted electrostatic nanodiamond seeding. A systematic investigation of processing conditions was conducted to assess their effects on film morphology, grain evolution, sp3-phase purity, and optical characteristics. Diamond films grown at 800 degC exhibit grain sizes up to 126.6 nm, RMS roughness of 16.3 nm, and a sharp diamond Raman peak at around 1332 cm-1 with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 34.98 cm-1. The corresponding sp$^3$-phase purity exceeds 97.5 percent, with an optical bandgap up to 5.13 eV. Deposition time variation from 10 to 60 minutes at 800 degC results in thicknesses from 53 nm to 315 nm and corresponding grain coarsening. Interlayer comparison reveals that SiO2 yields slightly larger grains and higher purity than SiNx under identical conditions. Notably, films with more than 96 percent sp$^3$ content were achieved at temperatures as low as 480 degC, confirming the compatibility of this approach with reduced thermal budgets. These results provide a robust framework for scalable $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/diamond integration in thermally resilient high power and RF device technologies.</description>

      <title>Strain-tunable inter-valley scattering defines universal mobility enhancement in n- and p-type 2D TMDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain fundamentally alters carrier transport in semiconductors by modifying their band structure and scattering pathways. In transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), an emerging class of 2D semiconductors, we show that mobility modulation under biaxial strain is dictated by changes in inter-valley scattering rather than effective mass renormalization as in bulk silicon. Using a multiscale full-band transport framework that incorporates both intrinsic phonon, extrinsic impurity, and dielectric scattering, we find that tensile strain enhances n-type mobility through K-Q valley separation, while compressive strain improves p-type mobility via {\Gamma}-K decoupling. The tuning rates calculated from our full-band model far exceed those achieved by strain engineering in silicon. Both relaxed and strain-modulated carrier mobilities align quantitatively with experimentally verified measurements and are valid across a wide range of practical FET configurations. The enhancement remains robust across variations in temperature, carrier density, impurity level, and dielectric environment. Our results highlight the pivotal role of strain in improving the reliability and performance of 2D TMD-based electronics.</description>

      <title>L-Band Milliwatt Room-Temperature Solid-State Maser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular room temperature masers have emerged as promising sources of coherent microwaves, but systematic comparisons of organic gain media under uniform conditions remain limited. This paper presents a characterization of two systems, pentacene doped para terphenyl (Pc:PTP, 1.45 GHz) and 6,13 diazapentacene doped para terphenyl (DAP:PTP, 1.478 GHz), examined at four concentrations, including a new 0.05 percent DAP:PTP sample. By evaluating L band masing media under identical conditions, optimal doping levels and gain materials for high power operation are identified. The optimized system produced room temperature continuous wave masing with a peak output of 2.34 mW (+3.69 dBm), marking the first milliwatt level emission from an organic maser. Spectral coherence times of 465 ns and coherence lengths up to 150 m were obtained. Coupling to a high Q cavity mode enables collective spin photon interactions, with Rabi oscillations revealing coherent ensemble dynamics. Frequency domain analysis shows normal mode splitting of 1.37 MHz for Pc:PTP and 2.14 MHz for DAP:PTP, confirming strong coupling. Cavity QED analysis yields cooperativities C* = 304-803 for Pc:PTP and 405-1071 for DAP:PTP, among the highest for organic systems. Quantitative metrics of signal to noise ratio, spectral coherence distance, and throughput demonstrate the potential of these masers for radar, secure communication, and quantum interface technologies.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of Free-Space Transmission using L-Band Maser Signals in Organic Gain Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric conditions such as fog, humidity, and scattering by foliage routinely degrade optical free-space (FS) links, motivating alternatives that are robust in adverse conditions. Coherent microwave sources offer a compelling alternative for quantum-secure communication, yet their propagation outside enclosed resonators has remained untested. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature FS transmission of maser signals generated using organic L-band (1-2 GHz) gain media, pentacene doped p-terphenyl (Pc: PTP), and Diazapentacene-doped p-terphenyl (DAP:PTP). Spectral and temporal coherence is preserved over distances up to 25 cm, approximately one wavelength at the masing frequency. Tests included polarisation misalignment, high-humidity conditions, and partial occlusion by foliage to emulate realistic FS reception scenarios. Strong spin-photon coupling was maintained, as confirmed by persistent rabi oscillations and normal-mode splitting. An instantaneous peak output of 4.29 mW (+6.32 dBm) from a 0.01% DAP:PTP gain medium. with a pulse duration of ~4 {\mu}s, marks a performance benchmark for directly coupled masers. These findings demonstrate a proof-of-concept for masers as viable platforms for short-range, interference-resilient coherent microwave links, with future relevance to quantum sensing and secure communication technologies.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution imaging of azimuthal features with illumination carrying OAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-resolution imaging refers to imaging techniques that surpass the Rayleigh resolution limit. One standard way to achieve super-resolution is by structuring the phase of the field illuminating the object. Although super-resolution techniques are already employed in commercial imaging devices, intense research efforts continue to enhance the resolution even further. In this work, we show that if the field illuminating the object is structured in the azimuthal coordinate--such as a field carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM)--the azimuthal features of the object can be imaged with enhanced imaging resolution. We experimentally demonstrate it with two objects, namely, an azimuthal double-slit and a Siemens star. We find that for a given azimuthal feature, there is an optimum OAM mode index of the illumination that gives the best imaging resolution. Super-resolution imaging of azimuthal feature can have important implications, especially for some biological objects that are known to have predominantly azimuthal features.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Composition and Band Gap in $\kappa$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Heterostructures via STEM-EELS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution mapping of electronic properties at oxide heterointerfaces remains challenging due to probe delocalization and overlapping signals. In this work, we employ monochromated, probe-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with electron energy-loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) to resolve band gap variations across $\kappa$-Ga$_2$O$_3$-based multilayers with nanometer-scale precision. A custom automated quantitative-based EELS analysis framework enabled automated band gap fitting and visualization, ensuring reproducibility and high spatial resolution. By optimizing acquisition parameters and quantifying inelastic delocalization, we demonstrate reliable extraction of band gap excitations from layers only a few nanometers thick. For heterostructures grown on ITO templates, strain at defect-free interfaces induces a gradual band gap transition from $5.08~\mathrm{eV}$ to $4.28~\mathrm{eV}$ over $\sim 10~\mathrm{nm}$, despite an abrupt compositional change. In contrast, ZnO-based templates introduce structural defects that relieve strain, yielding band gaps consistent with composition. These results establish STEM-EELS as a powerful tool for nanoscale electronic characterization and highlight the dominant role of interfacial strain over composition in governing local band structure.</description>

      <title>Enhanced spectral range of strain-induced tuning of quantum dots in circular Bragg grating cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tunable sources of entangled and single photons are essential for implementing entanglement-based quantum information protocols, as quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping depend on photon indistinguishability. Tunable devices are fabricated from indium arsenide (InAs) quantum dots (QDs) embedded in gallium arsenide (GaAs) nanomembranes placed on monolithic piezoelectric substrates. Circular Bragg grating (CBG) resonators enhance emission brightness and exploit the Purcell effect; however, the inclusion of CBGs reduces strain-mediated tunability compared to planar nanomembranes. A simple and effective solution is introduced: filling the CBG trenches with a stiff dielectric (aluminum oxide) via atomic layer deposition (ALD) restores up to 95% of the tunability of planar structures. Finite element analysis (FEA) confirms that the tunability loss originates from bending in the device layers due to strain relief in the CBG geometry. Lowering the stiffness of intermediate layers between the QDs and the piezoelectric actuator, such as in bonding or reflector layers, further increases strain losses in uncoated CBGs. Coated devices maintain 98-99% strain-tuning efficiency across all simulated underlayer stiffnesses. The results demonstrate that advantageous optical cavity properties can be effectively combined with piezoelectric strain tuning, enabling scalable, bright, and tunable quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>Assessing Band Gap Stability of Organic Semiconductor Thin Films for Flexible Electronic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integration of organic semiconductors into flexible electronics requires that their optoelectronic properties remain stable under mechanical deformation. Among these, the optical band gap governs exciton generation and limits photovoltaic voltage, making it a key parameter for strain-resilient design. In this work, we investigate band gap shifts in poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/P3HT thin films deposited on flexible poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrates under uniaxial tensile strain ranging from 1\% to 10\%. Samples were subjected to mechanical deformation and then characterized by ultraviolet--visible (UV--Vis) absorption spectroscopy. The optical band gaps extracted using a standardized Tauc analysis and statistically validated through equivalence testing and robust regression models. We find that up to 7\% strain, the band gap shift ($\Delta E_g$) remains effectively invariant, independent of annealing condition or stack configuration, demonstrating electronic stability. However, at 10\% strain, all groups exhibit a reproducible widening of $\sim$4--5~meV. This threshold-like behavior marks a transition from mechanical accommodation to electronic perturbation. These findings confirm that the optical band gap in semicrystalline P3HT-based thin films is robust under practical deformation, which provides clear strain thresholds to inform mechanical modeling and device-level simulation of flexible organic optoelectronic systems.</description>

      <title>Millikelvin Si-MOSFETs for Quantum Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large power consumption of silicon CMOS electronics is a challenge in very-large-scale integrated circuits and a major roadblock to fault-tolerant quantum computation. Matching the power dissipation of Si-MOSFETs to the thermal budget at deep cryogenic temperatures, below 1 K, requires switching performance beyond levels facilitated by currently available CMOS technologies. We have manufactured fully depleted silicon-on-insulator MOSFETs tailored for overcoming the power dissipation barrier towards sub-1 K applications. With these cryo-optimized transistors we achieve a major milestone of reaching subthreshold swing of 0.3 mV/dec at 420 mK, thereby enabling very-large-scale integration of cryo-CMOS electronics for ultra-low temperature applications.</description>

      <title>Geometric Features of Higher-Order Networks via the Spectral Triplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our work is concerned with simplicial complexes that describe higher-order interactions in real complex systems. This description allows to go beyond the pairwise node-to-node representation that simple networks provide and to capture a hierarchy of interactions of different orders. The prime contribution of this work is the introduction of geometric measures for these simplicial complexes. We do so by noting the non-commutativity of the algebra associated with their matrix representations and consequently we bring to bear the spectral triplet formalism of Connes on these structures and then notions of associated dimensions, curvature, and distance can be computed to serve as characterizing features in addition to known topological metrics.</description>

      <title>A Certifiable Machine Learning-Based Pipeline to Predict Fatigue Life of Aircraft Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fatigue life prediction is essential in both the design and operational phases of any aircraft, and in this sense safety in the aerospace industry requires early detection of fatigue cracks to prevent in-flight failures. Robust and precise fatigue life predictors are thus essential to ensure safety. Traditional engineering methods, while reliable, are time consuming and involve complex workflows, including steps such as conducting several Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations, deriving the expected loading spectrum, and applying cycle counting techniques like peak-valley or rainflow counting. These steps often require collaboration between multiple teams and tools, added to the computational time and effort required to achieve fatigue life predictions. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising complement to traditional fatigue life estimation methods, enabling faster iterations and generalization, providing quick estimates that guide decisions alongside conventional simulations.
  In this paper, we present a ML-based pipeline that aims to estimate the fatigue life of different aircraft wing locations given the flight parameters of the different missions that the aircraft will be operating throughout its operational life. We validate the pipeline in a realistic use case of fatigue life estimation, yielding accurate predictions alongside a thorough statistical validation and uncertainty quantification. Our pipeline constitutes a complement to traditional methodologies by reducing the amount of costly simulations and, thereby, lowering the required computational and human resources.</description>
