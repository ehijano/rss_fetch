      <title>ANOVA for High-dimensional Non-stationary Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal dependence and the resulting autocovariances in time series data can introduce bias into ANOVA test statistics, thereby affecting their size and power. This manuscript accounts for temporal dependence in ANOVA and develops a test statistic suitable for high-dimensional, non-stationary time series. Recognizing that the presence of complex fourth-order cumulants may introduce difficulties in variance estimation of the test statistic, we develop a bootstrap algorithm to conduct hypothesis testing through computer simulations. Theoretical results including the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis and the validity of the proposed bootstrap algorithm are established. Numerical studies demonstrate a good finite-sample performance of the proposed test statistic. In addition to the new test procedure, this manuscript derives theoretical results on consistency, Gaussian approximation, and variance estimation for quadratic forms of high-dimensional non-stationary time series, which may be of independent interest to researchers.</description>

      <title>Quantile-based Fractional Generalized Cumulative Past Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty in past lifetime distributions and the timing of inactivity in systems and their components can be effectively measured using the fractional generalized cumulative past entropy (FGCPE) and its dynamic extension (DFGCPE), introduced by Di Crescenzo et al. (2021). Building on this framework, we propose a quantile-based variant, the quantile fractional generalized cumulative past entropy (QFGCPE), along with its dynamic time-dependent counterpart (DQFGCPE). Closed-form expressions of these measures are derived analytically for a variety of lifetime distributions, including those with and without explicit distribution functions. Fundamental properties such as bounds, monotonicity, and stochastic orderings are investigated to assess robustness and interpretability. Furthermore, we construct a nonparametric estimator of QFGCPE and establish its asymptotic validity through extensive simulation studies involving bias, mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). Finally, the sensitivity of the proposed QFGCPE measure is examined by comparing its behavior with the logistic map, demonstrating its ability to capture transitions from order to chaos.</description>

      <title>Similarity-based Outlier Detection for Noisy Object Re-Identification Using Beta Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise, which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection (OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy, contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%), demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios. The implementation of Beta-SOD is available at: https://github.com/waqar3411/Beta-SOD</description>

      <title>A semiparametric probability distribution estimator of sample maximums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.07268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a computationally efficient semiparametric distribution estimator, which is a slight modification of the naive mixture proposed by Schuster and Yakowitz (1985) and Olkin and Spiegelman (1987). The proposed method is applied to probability distribution estimation of a sample maximum. Two approaches for the sample maximum distribution estimation, one based on extreme value theory and the other on nonparametric smoothing, exist; however, theoretical and numerical properties of the two approaches are known to heavily depend on the case and greatly differ. This study demonstrates that the semiparametric mixture distribution estimators have good properties of both approaches. The cross-validation method is proposed for the mixing ratio selection for the proposed mixture distribution estimator. The result of simulation experiments and three case studies are reported.</description>

      <title>Precise Asymptotics for Linear Mixed Models with Crossed Random Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain an asymptotic normality result that reveals the precise asymptotic behavior of the maximum likelihood estimators of parameters for a very general class of linear mixed models containing cross random effects. In achieving the result, we overcome theoretical difficulties that arise from random effects being crossed as opposed to the simpler nested random effects case. Our new theory is for a class of Gaussian response linear mixed models which includes crossed random slopes that partner arbitrary multivariate predictor effects and does not require the cell counts to be balanced. Statistical utilities include confidence interval construction, Wald hypothesis test and sample size calculations.</description>

      <title>Joint parameter estimations for spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin glass models with quadratic-type Hamiltonians are disordered statistical physics systems with competing ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic spin interactions. The corresponding Gibbs measures belong to the exponential family parametrized by (inverse) temperature $\beta&gt;0$ and external field $h\in\mathbb{R}$. Given a sample from these Gibbs measures, a statistically fundamental question is to infer the temperature and external field parameters. In 2007, Chatterjee (Ann. Statist. 35 (2007), no.5, 1931-1946) first proved that in the absence of external field $h=0$, the maximum pseudolikelihood estimator for $\beta$ is $\sqrt{N}$-consistent under some mild assumptions on the disorder matrices. It was left open whether the same method can be used to estimate the temperature and external field simultaneously. In this paper, under some easily verifiable conditions, we prove that the bivariate maximum pseudolikelihood estimator is indeed jointly $\sqrt{N}$-consistent for the temperature and external field parameters. The examples cover the classical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model and its diluted variants.</description>

      <title>Euclidean Distance Deflation Under High-Dimensional Heteroskedastic Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pairwise Euclidean distance calculation is a fundamental step in many machine learning and data analysis algorithms. In real-world applications, however, these distances are frequently distorted by heteroskedastic noise$\unicode{x2014}$a prevalent form of inhomogeneous corruption characterized by variable noise magnitudes across data observations. Such noise inflates the computed distances in a nontrivial way, leading to misrepresentations of the underlying data geometry. In this work, we address the tasks of estimating the noise magnitudes per observation and correcting the pairwise Euclidean distances under heteroskedastic noise. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that in general high-dimensional settings and without assuming prior knowledge on the clean data structure or noise distribution, both tasks can be performed reliably, even when the noise levels vary considerably. Specifically, we develop a principled, hyperparameter-free approach that jointly estimates the noise magnitudes and corrects the distances. We provide theoretical guarantees for our approach, establishing probabilistic bounds on the estimation errors of both noise magnitudes and distances. These bounds, measured in the normalized $\ell_1$ norm, converge to zero at polynomial rates as both feature dimension and dataset size increase. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method accurately estimates distances in challenging regimes, significantly improving the robustness of subsequent distance-based computations. Notably, when applied to single-cell RNA sequencing data, our method yields noise magnitude estimates consistent with an established prototypical model, enabling accurate nearest neighbor identification that is fundamental to many downstream analyses.</description>
