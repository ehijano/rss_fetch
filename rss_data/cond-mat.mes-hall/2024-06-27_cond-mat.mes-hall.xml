      <title>Topological phases, van Hove singularities, and spin texture in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene in the presence of proximity-induced spin-orbit couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) with proximity-induced Ising and Rashba spin-orbit couplings (SOC) in the top layer, as recently achieved experimentally. Utilizing the Bistritzer-MacDonald model with SOCs, we reveal a rich single-particle topological phase diagram featuring topological flat bands across different twist angles and interlayer hopping energies. The evolution of Dirac cones and Chern numbers is examined to understand the topological phase transitions. We find that all phases can be achieved with an experimentally accessible SOC strength ($\sim$1 meV) in systems with angles very close to the magic angle. Furthermore, the van Hove singularity for each topological flat band splits in the presence of SOC, significantly altering the electronic properties. Additionally, we investigate the spin textures of each band in momentum space, discovering a skyrmion-like spin texture in the center of the moir\'e Brillouin zone, which is correlated with the topological phase transitions and can be tuned via the SOCs and an out-of-plane electric field. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the topological flat bands, establishing a foundation for grasping the intrinsic and rich roles of SOCs in MATBG.</description>

      <title>Orbital currents in lattice multiorbital systems: Continuity equation, torques, and RKKY interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing the electron orbital degree of freedom in heterostructures is attracting increasing attention due to the possibility of achieving much larger conversion rates between charge and orbital angular momentum flow compared to the intrinsic electron spin. Here, we consider orbital angular momentum currents in a tight-binding multiorbital lattice model and derive their continuity equation. From it, we observe that the current is not conserved and apply similar considerations to the recently discovered altermagnets. We find nonzero orbital torque terms, elucidate their physical mechanism, and show numerically that they contribute to dampening the orbital angular momentum current flowing in multiorbital heterostructures. Moreover, we compute the orbital RKKY interaction and find it exhibits similar characteristics as the orbital angular momentum current mediating it, thus serving as a direct experimental probe of such currents.</description>

      <title>Microwave-optical spectroscopy of Rydberg excitons in the ultrastrong driving regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ultrastrong driving of Rydberg excitons in Cu$_2$O by a microwave field. The effect of the microwaves was studied using optical absorption specstroscopy, and via the observation of sidebands on the transmitted laser light. A model based on Floquet theory was constructed to explore the system beyond the rotating wave approximation. We obtain near quantitative agreement between theory and experiment across a 16-fold range of microwave field strength, from $43.5\pm 0.3$ V m$^{-1}$ up to $688 \pm 5$ V m$^{-1}$, crossing from the perturbative to the ultrastrong driving regime. Compared to Rydberg atoms, the large non-radiative width of Rydberg exctions leads to new behaviour such as the emergence of an absoprtion continuum without ionization.</description>

      <title>Subharmonic oscillations in the Floquet circuit with the frequency-synthesis dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The period-doubling oscillation emerges with the coexistence between zero and {\pi} modes in Floquet topological insulator. Here, utilized the flexibility of the circuit, we construct the Floquet circuit with frequency-synthetic dimension and find the topological-protected deeply-subharmonic oscillations with the period extensively exceeding the doubling-driven period. In the construction framework, the periodically-driven mechanism is attained by implementing the circuit-oscillator hierarchy with the stepping-variation resonances in frequency domain. The zero and {\pi} modes that arise at the Floquet band in the circuit indicate the anomalous boundary-bulk correspondence. The coexistence of zero and {\pi} modes, results in a subharmonic oscillation with the extremely-low frequency on the edge of the Floquet circuit. Furthermore, we explore the Floquet band with the enhanced periodically-driven strength tailored by the component flexibility of the circuit. Our method provides a flexible scheme to study Floquet topological phases, and open a new path for realizing the deeply subwavelength system.</description>

      <title>Flat and tunable moire phonons in twisted transition-metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Displacement fields are one of the main tuning knobs employed to engineer flat electronic band dispersions in twisted van der Waals multilayers. Here, we show that electric fields can also be used to tune the phonon dispersion of moir\'e superlattices formed by non-centrosymmetric materials, focusing on twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers. This effect arises from the intertwining between the local stacking configuration and the formation of polar domains within the moir\'e supercell. For small twist angles, increasing the electric field leads to a universal moir\'e phonon spectrum characterized by a substantially softened longitudinal acoustic phason mode and a flat optical phonon mode, both of which cause a significant enhancement in the vibrational density of states. The phasons also acquire a prominent chiral character, displaying a nonzero angular momentum spread across the Brillouin zone. We discuss how the tunability of the moir\'e phonon spectra may affect electronic properties, focusing on the recently discovered phenomenon of van der Waals ferroelectricity.</description>

      <title>1/f noise of a tiny tunnel magnetoresistance sensor originated from a wide distribution of bath correlation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) sensor is a highly sensitive magnetic field sensor and is expected to be applied in various fields, such as magnetic recording, industrial sensing, and bio-medical sensing. To improve the detection capability of TMR sensors in low frequency regime it is necessary to suppress the 1/f noise. We theoretically study 1/f noise of a tiny TMR sensor using the macrospin model. Starting from the generalized Langevin equation, 1/f noise power spectrum and the Hooge parameter are derived. The calculated Hooge parameter of a tiny TMR sensor is much smaller than that of a conventional TMR sensor with large junction area. The results provide a new perspective on magnetic 1/f noise and will be useful for improvement of TMR sensors.</description>

      <title>Tunneling valley Hall effect induced by coherent geometric phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a geometric phase-resolved tunneling valley Hall effect based on the coherent transmission through two combined electric barriers in $\alpha-\mathcal{T}_3$ lattices. It is shown that the backreflected electrons at the barrier interface may acquire a valley-dependent geometric phase. The coherence of this geometric phase leads to the valley-dependent skew tunneling, which is responsible for the transverse valley current with zero net charge. We further demonstrate that this charge-neutral transverse valley Hall current can be electrically controlled by the gate voltages applied across the two combined barrier regions and is absent when the two barriers are of equal height. Our work opens a new approach to generating the valley Hall effect, suggesting potential applications for valleytronic devices.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian minimal Kitaev chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a double quantum dot realization of a minimal Kitaev chain, we demonstrate that non-Hermicity stabilizes the so-called poor man's Majorana zero modes in a region of parameter space that is much broader than in the Hermitian regime. In particular, we consider the simplest non-Hermitian mechanism which naturally appears due to coupling to normal reservoirs and is commonly present in all transport experiments. Specifically, such couplings induce exceptional points which connect stable and highly tunable zero energy real lines that are well separated from the quasicontinuum. Such zero-energy lines reflect spectral degeneracies protected by topology and represent the non-Hermitian generalization of the Hermitian poor mans Majorana modes occurring at single points in parameter space. Our findings pave the way for realizing robust non-Hermitian effects by combining unconventional superconductors and non-Hermitian topology.</description>

      <title>Wedge-type engineered analog SiO$_\mathrm{x}$/Cu/SiO$_\mathrm{x}$-Memristive Devices for Neuromorphic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive examination of the development of TiN/SiO$_\mathrm{x}$/Cu/SiO$_\mathrm{x}$/TiN memristive devices, engineered for neuromorphic applications using a wedge-type deposition technique and Monte Carlo simulations. Identifying critical parameters for the desired device characteristics can be challenging with conventional trial-and-error approaches, which often obscure the effects of varying layer compositions. By employing an \textit{off-center} thermal evaporation method, we created a thickness gradient of SiO$_\mathrm{x}$ and Cu on a 4-inch wafer, facilitating detailed resistance map analysis through semiautomatic measurements. This allows to investigate in detail the influence of layer composition and thickness on single wafers, thus keeping every other process condition constant. Combining experimental data with simulations provides a precise understanding of the layer thickness distribution and its impact on device performance. Optimizing the SiO$_\mathrm{x}$ layers to be below 12.5 nm, coupled with a discontinuous Cu layer with a nominal thickness lower than 0.6 nm, exhibits analog switching properties with an R$_\mathrm{on}$/R$_\mathrm{off}$ ratio of $&gt;$100, suitable for neuromorphic applications, whereas R $\times$ A analysis shows no clear signs of filamentary switching. Our findings highlight the significant role of carefully choosing the SiO$_\mathrm{x}$ and Cu thickness in determining the switching behavior and provide insights that could lead to the more systematic development of high-performance analog switching components for bio-inspired computing systems.</description>

      <title>Manipulation and creation of domain-wall skyrmions in chiral magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the capture of a magnetic skyrmion into a domain wall (DW) structure in thin films of chirally magnetic type of materials like $[{\rm Pt}({\rm Co/Ni})_M/{\rm Ir}_N]$ and find that in the respective ground states of the DW and the skyrmion, they repel each other. However, rotating the DW's phase away from the stable phase using local external magnets may cause the successful capture and hence creation of a stable bound state of a magnetic skyrmion and a DW. We also find that inaccurate manipulation of the DW's phase may destroy the magnetic skyrmion by inducing its shrinkage. En passant, we find the possibility of pair creation of a skyrmion anti-DW-skyrmion pair and a creation of two skyrmions from a decaying meron pair (MP) on the DW. Finally, we contemplate the operation of capturing magnetic skyrmions into DWs as a part in a larger toolbox of spintronic applications, including memory and computing.</description>

      <title>Imaging semiconductor-to-metal transition and topological flat bands of twisted bilayer MoTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) moir\'e materials have emerged as a highly tunable platform for investigating novel quantum states of matter arising from strong electronic correlations and nontrivial band topology. Recently, topological flat bands formed in 2D semiconducting moir\'e superlattices have attracted great interests. In particular, a series of topological quantum phases, including the long-sought fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect, have recently been experimentally observed in twisted bilayer MoTe2 (tMoTe2). However, the microscopic information of tMoTe2 moir\'e superlattice and its electronic structure is still lacking. Here, we present scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) studies of the tMoTe2 moir\'e superlattice, with twist angles ranging from about 2.3{\deg} to 2.8{\deg}. We developed a contact-STM mode to apply pressure on tMoTe2 and observed a phase transition from band insulator to metal of tMoTe2 under pressure at the charge neutrality point. STM imaging reveals a pronounced in-plane lattice reconstruction with periodic strain redistribution in the tMoTe2, which serves as gauge fields for generating topological moir\'e bands. Importantly, the electronic states of the low-energy moir\'e flat bands primarily concentrate at the XM and MX regions as revealed by STS imaging. Such spatial distributions are nicely reproduced by our first principal calculations with a large-scale basis, suggesting the low-energy moir\'e flat bands are formed through the hybridization of K valley bands of the top layer and K' valley bands of the bottom layer. Overall, our findings provide compelling real-space evidence of electronic structure under pressure and topological flat bands of tMoTe2, paving the way for further STM/STS investigations of correlated topological states within the topological flat band in gate-tunable tMoTe2 devices.</description>

      <title>Nonuniqueness in Defining the Polarization: Nonlocal Surface Charges and the Electrostatic, Energetic, and Transport Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionic crystals play a central role in functional applications. Mesoscale descriptions of these crystals are based on the continuum polarization density field to represent the effective physics of charge distribution at the scale of the atomic lattice. However, a long-standing difficulty is that the classical electrostatic definition of the macroscopic polarization -- as the dipole or first moment of the charge density in a unit cell -- is not unique. This unphysical non-uniqueness has been shown to arise from starting directly with an infinite system rather than starting with a finite body and taking appropriate limits. This limit process shows that the electrostatic description requires not only the bulk polarization density, but also the surface charge density, as the effective macroscopic descriptors; that is, a nonlocal effective description. Other approaches to resolve this difficulty include relating the change in polarization to the transport of charge; or, to define the polarization as the energy-conjugate to the electric field.
  This work examines the relation between the classical electrostatic definition of polarization, and the transport and energy-conjugate definitions of polarization. We show the following: (1) The transport of charge does not correspond to the change in polarization in general; instead, one requires additional simplifying assumptions on the electrostatic definition of polarization for these approaches to give rise to the same macroscopic electric fields. Thus, the electrostatic definition encompasses the transport definition as a special case. (2) The energy-conjugate definition has both bulk and surface contributions; while traditional approaches neglect the surface contribution, we find that accounting for the nonlocal surface contributions is essential to obtain the correct macroscopic electric fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-critical nanopores are known to inhibit continuous evaporation within heat pipes, posing a challenge in understanding the limitations of nanopore size on wicking action. This study addresses this by systematically investigating the wicking capabilities in nanoscale heat pipes using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The results reveal that temperature-induced flow in these heat pipes is primarily driven by surface interactions rather than traditional wicking action. Additionally, the water fill ratio and thermal gradient significantly influence the performance of these systems. These insights can substantially benefit heat transfer research, providing a foundation for improving thermal performance through nanoscale design innovations.</description>

      <title>A fully analytical equation of motion approach for the double quantum dot in the Coulomb blockade regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fully analytical approach based on the equation of motion technique to investigate the spectral properties and orbital occupations in an interacting double quantum dot in equilibrium is presented. By solving a linear system for the density correlators analytically, an explicit expression for the one body Green's function in terms of local occupations, intra- and inter-dot Coulomb interactions, and the model parameters is derived. In the uncontacted limit, the results coincide with those obtained from the grand canonical ensemble. The analytical results compare favourably with numerical results obtained with the Non-Crossing Approximation and the Hierarchical Equation of Motion methods accurately reproducing peak positions and spectral weight distributions in the Coulomb blockade regime.</description>

Abstract: We show that the static structure factor of general many-body systems with $U(1)$ symmetry has a lower bound determined only by the ground state Chern number. Our bound relies only on causality and non-negative energy dissipation, and holds for a wide range of systems. We apply our theory to (fractional) Chern insulators, (fractional) quantum spin Hall insulators, topological superconductors, and chiral spin liquids. Our results uncover a universal feature of topological phases beyond the quantized response.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing with Nanoelectronics: Fisher Information for an Adiabatic Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems used for metrology can offer enhanced precision over their classical counterparts. The design of quantum sensors can be optimized by maximizing the quantum Fisher information (QFI), which characterizes the precision of parameter estimation for an ideal measurement. Here we consider the response of a quantum system as a means to estimate the strength of an external perturbation that has been switched on slowly. General expressions for the QFI are derived, which also hold for interacting many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit at finite temperatures, and can be related to linear-response transport coefficients. For quantum dot nanoelectronics devices, we show that electron interactions can lead to exponential scaling of the QFI with system size, highlighting that quantum resources can be utilized in the full Fock space. The precision estimation of voltages and fields can also be achieved by practical global measurements, such as the electric current, making quantum circuits good candidates for metrological applications.</description>

      <title>Signatures of ballistic and diffusive transport in the time-dependent Kerr-response of magnetic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the influence of diffusive and ballistic transport on ultrafast magnetization in thick metallic films. When only diffusive transport is present, gradients of magnetization in the material remain up to picosecond timescales. In contrast, in the extreme superdiffusive limit where ballistic transport dominates, the magnetization changes homogeneously in space. We calculate the measurable magneto-optical responses for a $\SI{40}{\nano\meter}$ Nickel film. Although the resulting Kerr rotation dynamics are found to be very similar in the two limits of transport, our simulations reveal a clear signature of magnetization gradients in the Kerr ellipticity dynamics, namely a strong probe-angle dependence for the case when diffusive transport allows gradients to persist. We then perform probe-angle dependent complex magneto-optical Kerr effect (CMOKE) measurements on an excited \SI{40}{\nano\meter} Nickel film. The angle dependence of the measured Kerr signals closely matches the simulated response with diffusive transport. Therefore we conclude that the influence of ballistic transport on ultrafast magnetization dynamics in such films is negligible.</description>

      <title>Constant search time algorithm via topological quantum walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that quantum algorithms such as Grover's can provide a quadradic speed-up for unstructured search problems. By adding topological structure to a search problem, we show that it is possible to achieve a constant search-time quantum algorithm with a constant improvement of the search probability over classical search. Specifically, we study the spatial search algorithm implemented by a two-dimensional split-step quantum random walks that realize topologically nontrivial phases and show the asymptotic search behavior is constant with growing system size. Using analytical and numerical calculations, we determine the efficient search regions in the parameter space of the quantum walker. These regions correspond to pairs of trapped states formed near a lattice defect. By studying the spectral properties of the discrete time-evolution-operators, we show that these trapped states have large overlap with the initial state. This correspondence, which is analogous to localization by constructive interference of bound states, makes it possible to reach the best possible search-time asymptotic and produce a disorder-protected fast search in quantum random walks.</description>

      <title>Lattice Energy Reservoir in Metal Halide Perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskite-based technologies have been rapidly developed during the last decade. However, to date, the fundamental question, why are halide perovskites superior to conventional semiconductors? has remained elusive. Here, we propose a new theory of lattice energy reservoir (LER) in halide perovskites and elucidate that LER can comprehensively impact charge carrier dynamics and thus enhance device performance, from hot carrier cooling, carrier recombination, anomalous upconversion fluorescence, illumination induced fluorescence enhancement (photobrightening), to high efficiency solar cells and light-emitting diodes. An LER is a dynamic nanodomain in halide perovskites with suppressed thermal transport that can accumulate energy from phonon coupling and then feedback to subgap carriers and result in subgap carrier upconversion. The LER directly results in slowed cooling of hot carriers and significantly prolonged carrier recombination, anomalous upconversion fluorescence, as usually termed as defect tolerance, as well as the anomalous ultraslow phenomena including persistent polarization, memory effect, and photobrightening. The LER theory rationalizes the superior optoelectronic properties and device performance and provides a novel physical understanding for anomalous phenomena observed uniquely in halide perovskites.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent control has enabled various novel phenomena in wave scattering. We introduce an effect called coherent orthogonal scattering, where the output wave becomes orthogonal to the reference output state without scatterers. This effect leads to a unity extinction coefficient and complete mode conversion. We examine the conditions for this effect and reveal its topological nature by relating it to the indivisibility between the dimension and the winding number of scattering submatrices. These findings deepen our understanding of topological scattering phenomena.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Interfacial Hydration Structure Induced by Ion Condensation and Correlation Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfacial hydration structures are crucial in wide-ranging applications, including battery, colloid, lubrication etc. Multivalent ions like Mg2+ and La3+ show irreplaceable roles in these applications, which are hypothesized due to their unique interfacial hydration structures. However, this hypothesis lacks experimental supports. Here, using three-dimensional atomic force microscopy (3D-AFM), we provide the first observation for their interfacial hydration structures with molecular resolution. We observed the evolution of layered hydration structures at La(NO3)3 solution-mica interfaces with concentration. As concentration increases from 25 mM to 2 M, the layer number varies from 2 to 1 and back to 2, and the interlayer thickness rises from 0.25 to 0.34 nm, with hydration force increasing from 0.27+-0.07 to 1.04+-0.24 nN. Theory and molecular simulation reveal that multivalence induces concentration-dependent ion condensation and correlation effects, resulting in compositional and structural evolution within interfacial hydration structures. Additional experiments with MgCl2-mica, La(NO3)3-graphite and Al(NO3)3-mica interfaces together with literature comparison confirm the universality of this mechanism for both multivalent and monovalent ions. New factors affecting interfacial hydration structures are revealed, including concentration and solvent dielectric constant. This insight provides guidance for designing interfacial hydration structures to optimize solid-liquid-interphase for battery life extension, modulate colloid stability and develop efficient lubricants.</description>

      <title>Topotaxial Mutual-Exchange Growth of Magnetic Zintl Eu$_3$In$_2$As$_4$ Nanowires with Axion Insulator Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanomaterials bring to expression unique electronic properties that promote advanced functionality and technologies. Albeit, nanoscale growth presents paramount challenges for synthesis limiting the diversity in structures and compositions. Here, we demonstrate solid-state topotactic exchange that converts Wurtzite InAs nanowires into Zintl phase Eu$_3$In$_2$As$_4$ nanowires. In situ evaporation of Eu and As over InAs nanowire cores in molecular beam epitaxy results in mutual exchange of Eu from the shell and In from the core. A continuous Eu$_3$In$_2$As$_4$ shell thereby grows that gradually consumes the InAs core and converts it into a single phase Eu$_3$In$_2$As$_4$ nanowire. Topotaxy, which facilitates the mutual exchange, is supported by the substructure of the As matrix which is similar across the Wurtzite InAs and Zintl Eu$_3$In$_2$As$_4$. We provide initial evidence of an antiferromagnetic transition at T$_N$ $\sim$ 6.5 K in the Zintl phase Eu$_3$In$_2$As$_4$ nanowires. Ab initio calculation confirms the antiferromagnetic state and classifies Eu$_3$In$_2$As$_4$ as a $C_2 T$ axion insulator hosting both chiral hinge modes and unpinned Dirac surface states. The topotactic mutual-exchange growth of Zintl Eu$_3$In$_2$As$_4$ nanowires thus enables the exploration of intricate magneto-topological states of nanomaterials. Moreover, it may open the path for topotactic mutual-exchange synthesis of nanowires made of other exotic compounds.</description>

Abstract: Magnetism of oxide antiferromagnets (AFMs) has been studied in single crystals and extended thin films. The properties of AFM nanostructures still remain underexplored. Here, we report on the fabrication and magnetic imaging of granular 100-nm-thick magnetoelectric Cr$_2$O$_3$ films patterned in circular bits with diameters ranging from 500 down to 100 nm. With the change of the lateral size, the domain structure evolves from a multidomain state for larger bits to a single domain state for the smallest bits. Based on spin-lattice simulations, we show that the physics of the domain pattern formation in granular AFM bits is primarily determined by the energy dissipation upon cooling, which results in motion and expelling of AFM domain walls of the bit. Our results provide a way towards the fabrication of single domain AFM-bit-patterned memory devices and the exploration of the interplay between AFM nanostructures and their geometric shape.</description>

      <title>Stark Control of Plexcitonic States in Incoherent Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electro-optic control of quantum dots embedded in the plasmonic nanocavities enables active tuning of photonic devices for emerging applications in Quantum optics such as quantum information processing, entanglement and ultrafast optical switching. Here, we demonstrate the coherent control of plexcitonic states in (i) an off-resonant and (ii) a resonant coupled quantum systems through optical Stark effect (OSE). We analyze a hybrid plasmon-emitter system which exhibits tunable Fano resonance, Stark induced transparency (SIT) and vacuum Rabi splitting due to quadratic Stark shift in the degenerate states of quantum emitter (QE). In addition, a resonantly coupled system shows the signature of double Fano resonance due to Stark-induced splitting in a two-level QE. Our study shows that Stark tuning of plexcitons not only mitigates decoherence in the quantum system but it also stimulates on/off switching of spontaneous photon emission in the visible regime. Such tunable systems can be used to operate photonic integrated circuits (PIC) for applications in quantum computing and information processing.</description>

Abstract: The theory of quantum thermodynamics investigates how the concepts of heat, work, and temperature can be carried over to the quantum realm, where fluctuations and randomness are fundamentally unavoidable. These lecture notes provide an introduction to the thermodynamics of small quantum systems. It is illustrated how the laws of thermodynamics emerge from quantum theory and how open quantum systems can be modeled by Markovian master equations. Quantum systems that are designed to perform a certain task, such as cooling or generating entanglement are considered. Finally, the effect of fluctuations on the thermodynamic description is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the first time, robust superconductivity has been independently observed in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers by two separate groups [Y. Xia et al., arXiv:2405.14784; Y. Guo et al., arXiv:2406.03418.]. In light of this, we explore the possibility of a universal superconducting pairing mechanism in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers. Using a continuum band structure model and a phenomenological boson-mediated effective electron-electron attraction, we find that intervalley intralayer pairing predominates over interlayer pairing. Notably, despite different experimental conditions, both twisted WSe$_2$ samples exhibit a comparable effective attraction strength. This consistency suggests that the dominant pairing glue is likely independent of the twist angle and layer polarization, pointing to a universal underlying boson-induced pairing mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisional Brownian engines have been proposed as alternatives for nonequilibrium nanoscale engines. However, most studies have focused on the simpler overdamped case, leaving the role of inertia much less explored. In this work, we introduce the idea of collisional engines to underdamped Brownian particles, where each stage is sequentially subjected to a distinct driving force. A careful comparison between the performance of underdamped and overdamped Brownian work-to-work engines has been undertaken. The results show that underdamped Brownian engines generally outperform their overdamped counterparts. A key difference is the presence of a resonant regime in underdamped engines, in which both efficiency and power output are enhanced across a broad set of parameters. Our study highlights the importance of carefully selecting dynamics and driving protocols to achieve optimal engine performance.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking in open quantum systems: strong, weak, and strong-to-weak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depending on the coupling to the environment, symmetries of open quantum systems manifest in two distinct forms, the strong and the weak. We study the spontaneous symmetry breaking among phases with different symmetries. Concrete Liouvillian models with strong and weak symmetry are constructed, and different scenarios of symmetry-breaking transitions are investigated from complementary approaches. It is demonstrated that strong symmetry always spontaneously breaks into the corresponding weak symmetry. For strong $U(1)$ symmetry, we show that strong-to-weak symmetry breaking leads to gapless Goldstone modes dictating diffusion of the symmetry charge in translational invariant systems. We conjecture that this relation among strong-to-weak symmetry breaking, gapless modes, and symmetry-charge diffusion is general for continuous symmetries. It can be interpreted as an "enhanced Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem" for open quantum systems, according to which the gapless spectrum does not require non-integer filling. We also investigate the scenario where the strong symmetry breaks completely. In the symmetry-broken phase, we identify an effective Keldysh action with two Goldstone modes, describing fluctuations of the order parameter and diffusive hydrodynamics of the symmetry charge, respectively. For a particular model studied here, we uncover a transition from a symmetric phase with a "Bose surface" to a symmetry-broken phase with long-range order induced by tuning the filling. It is also shown that the long-range order of $U(1)$ symmetry breaking is possible in spatial dimension $d\geq 3$, in both weak and strong symmetry cases. Our work outline the typical scenarios of spontaneous symmetry breaking in open quantum systems, and highlights their physical consequences.</description>

      <title>Nonlocality of local Andreev conductances as a probe for topological Majorana wires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a protocol based only on local conductance measurements for distinguishing trivial from topological phases in realistic three-terminal superconducting nanowires coupled to normal leads, capable of hosting Majorana zero modes (MZMs). By using Green functions and the scattering matrix approach, we calculate the conductance matrix and the local density of states (LDOS) as functions of the asymmetry in the couplings to the left ($\Gamma_L$) and right ($\Gamma_R$) leads. In the trivial phase, we find that the zero-bias local conductances are distinctively affected by variations in $\Gamma_R$ (for fixed $\Gamma_L$): while $G_{LL}$ is mostly constant, $G_{RR}$ decays exponentially as $\Gamma_R$ is decreased. In the topological phase, surprisingly, $G_{LL}$ and $G_{RR}$ are both suppressed with $G_{LL} \sim G_{RR}$. This \textit{nonlocal} suppression of $G_{LL}$ with $\Gamma_R$ scales with the MZM hybridization energy $\varepsilon_m$ and arises from the emergence of a dip in the LDOS near zero energy at the left end of the wire, which affects the local Andreev reflection. We further exploit this nonlocality of the local Andreev processes and the gate-controlled suppression of the LDOS by proposing a Majorana-based transistor. Our results hold for zero and low electron temperatures $T&lt;20$ mK. For $T = 30, 40$ mK, $G_{LL}$ and $G_{RR}$ become less correlated. As an additional nonlocal fingerprint of the topological phase at higher $T$'s, we predict modulations in our \textit{asymmetric} conductance deviation $\delta G^{asym}_{LL}= G_{LL}^{\Gamma_R = \Gamma_L} - G_{LL}^{\Gamma_R \ll \Gamma_L}$ that remains commensurate with the Majorana oscillations in $\varepsilon_m$ over the range $30&lt;T&lt; 150~\rm{mK}$.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic anomalous Hall effect arising from antiferromagnetic structure revealed by high-quality NbMnP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in antiferromagnetic (AF) materials arises from symmetry breaking equivalent to a ferromagnetic (FM) state. Consequently, this suggests that the observed AHE is induced by the intrinsic mechanism of the band structure effect, which in turn induces dissipationless transverse conductivity. Confirmation of impurity-insensitive anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) is crucial to conclude this interpretation; however, experimental investigations in AF materials are limited by the lack of high quality systems. In this study, we show that the AF material NbMnP, which exhibits a large AHE, offers a high quality single crystal. Our findings clearly revealed that the large AHC and the tiny net magnetization of $\sim10^{-3} \mu_{\mathrm{B}}$/Mn are inherent in this material, irrespective of disorder. NbMnP is a novel AF material that generates FM responses in the regime where there is less impurity scattering.</description>

      <title>Super-Planckian radiative heat transfer between coplanar two-dimensional metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, we propose a general microscopic framework to investigate the radiative heat transfer (RHT) between coplanar objects with a square lattice. We employ the obtained formulas to two-dimensional (2D) metal configurations with a tight-binding model and the Drude model. Our results reveal that the RHT between coplanar 2D metals is significantly larger than black-body radiation in both the near and far fields, leading to a global super-Planckian RHT. As the separation distance increases, the heat flux density exhibits a rapid decrease in the near field, followed by a slower decrease and eventual $1/d$ dependence in the far field, while maintaining a much higher magnitude than black-body radiation. Evanescent waves dominate the heat transfer in the near field, while propagating waves dominate the far field. Surprisingly, the propagating heat flux remains almost constant over a wide range of distances, resulting in a super-Planckian behavior in the far field. The dispersion relation of the spectrum function reveals distinct contributions from propagating and evanescent waves, with possible origins from surface plasmon resonance. These findings provide insights into the unique characteristics of RHT between coplanar 2D metals and highlight the potential for achieving enhanced heat transfer beyond the black-body limit. Our method is applicable to any coplanar objects with square lattices, paves the way for expanded investigations into various lattice geometries.</description>

      <title>Electroluminescence rectification and high harmonic generation in molecular junctions</title>

Abstract: The field of molecular electronics has emerged from efforts to understand electron propagation through single molecules and to use them in electronic circuits. Serving as a testbed for advanced theoretical methods, it reveals a significant discrepancy between the operational time scales of experiments (static to GHz frequencies) and theoretical models (femtoseconds). Utilizing a recently developed time-linear nonequilibrium Green's functions formalism, we model molecular junctions on experimentally accessible timescales. Our study focuses on the quantum pump effect in a Benzenedithiol molecule connected to two copper electrodes and coupled with cavity photons. By calculating both electric and photonic current responses to an ac bias voltage, we observe pronounced electroluminescence and high harmonic generation in this setup. The mechanism of the latter effect is more analogous to that from solids than from isolated molecules, with even harmonics being suppressed or enhanced depending on the symmetry of the driving field.</description>

Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators are an intriguing new family of topological states that host lower-dimensional boundary states. Concurrently, quasiperiodic systems have garnered significant interest due to their complex localization and topological properties. In this work we study the impact of quasiperiodic modulations on the paradigmatic Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model, which hosts topological insulating phases with zero-energy corner modes. We find that the topological properties are not only robust to the quasiperiodic modulation, but can even be enriched. In particular, we unveil the first instance of a quasiperiodic induced second-order topological insulating phase. Furthermore, in contrast with disorder, we find that quasiperiodic modulations can induce multiple reentrant topological transitions, showing an intricate sequence of localization properties. Our results open a promising avenue for exploring the rich interplay between higher-order topology and quasiperiodicity.</description>

      <title>From incommensurate bilayer heterostructures to Allen-Cahn: An exact thermodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18186v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a complete and rigorous derivation of the mechanical energy for twisted 2D bilayer heterostructures without any approximation beyond the existence of an empirical many-body site energy. Our results apply to both the continuous and discontinuous continuum limit. Approximating the intralayer Cauchy-Born energy by linear elasticity theory and assuming an interlayer coupling via pair potentials, our model reduces to a modified Allen-Cahn functional. We rigorously control the error, and, in the case of sufficiently smooth lattice displacements, provide a rate of convergence for twist angles satisfying a Diophantine condition.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian phase-biased Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study non-Hermitian Josephson junctions formed by superconductors with a finite phase difference under non-Hermiticity, which naturally appears due to coupling to normal reservoirs. Depending on the structure of non-Hermiticity, captured in terms of retarded self-energies, the low-energy spectrum hosts topologically stable exceptional points either at zero or finite real energies as a function of the superconducting phase difference. Interestingly, the corresponding phase-biased supercurrents may acquire divergent profiles at such exceptional points. This instance is a natural and unique non-Hermitian effect that signals a possible way to enhance the sensitivity of Josephson junctions. Our work opens a way for realizing unique non-Hermitian phenomena due to the interplay between non-Hermitian topology and the Josephson effect.</description>

      <title>Composite (multi)ferroic order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formalism of composite and intertwined orders has been remarkably successful in discussing the complex phase diagrams of strongly correlated materials and high-$T_c$ superconductors. Here, we propose that composite orders are also realized in ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials when lattice anisotropy is taken into account. This composite order emerges above the ferroic phase transition, and its existence is determined by the easy axis of magnetization or polarization, respectively. In multiferroic materials, where polarization and magnetization are coupled, composites of both orders are possible. This formalism of composite orders naturally accounts for magnetoelectric monopole, toroidal, and quadrupole orders. More broadly, composite orders may explain precursor phenomena in incipient (multi)ferroic materials, arising at temperatures above the ferroic phase transition and potentially contributing to the characterization of currently hidden orders.</description>

      <title>Geometrically Taming Dynamical Entanglement Growth in Purified Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement properties of purified quantum states are of key interest for two reasons. First, in quantum information theory, minimally entangled purified states define the Entanglement of Purification as a fundamental measure for the complexity of the corresponding physical mixed state. Second, dynamical entanglement growth in purified states represents the main bottleneck for calculating dynamical physical properties on classical computers in the framework of tensor network states. Here, we demonstrate how geometric methods including parallel transport may be harnessed to reduce such dynamical entanglement growth, and to obtain a general prescription for maintaining (locally) optimal entanglement entropy when time-evolving a purified state. Adapting and extending by higher order skew corrections the notion of Uhlmann geometric phases, we reveal the relation between dynamical entanglement growth and the geometry of the Hilbert-Schmidt bundle as the mathematical foundation of purified states. With benchmarks on a non-integrable spin chain model, we compare the computational performance of matrix product state algorithms based on our present geometric disentangling method to previous approaches for taming entanglement growth in purified states. Our findings provide numerical evidence that geometric disentanglers are a powerful approach, superior in various aspects to known methods for disentangling purified states in a range of physically relevant computational scenarios. To exclude the effect of algorithmic imperfections, we also provide a numerically exact analysis for systems of moderate size.</description>

      <title>Controlling energy storage crossing quantum phase transitions in an integrable spin quantum battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the performance of a one-dimensional dimerized XY chain as a spin quantum battery. Such integrable model shows a rich quantum phase diagram that emerges through a mapping of the spins onto auxiliary fermionic degrees of freedom. We consider a charging protocol relying on the double quench of an internal parameter, namely the strength of the dimerization, and address the energy stored in the systems. We observe three distinct regimes, depending on the time-scale characterizing the duration of the charging: a short-time regime related to the dynamics of the single dimers, a long-time regime related to the recurrence time of the system at finite size, and a thermodynamic limit time regime. In the latter, the energy stored is almost unaffected by the charging time and the precise values of the charging parameters, provided the quench crosses a quantum phase transition. Such a robust many-body effect, that characterizes also other models like the quantum Ising chain in a transverse field, as we prove analytically, can play a relevant role in the design of stable solid-state quantum batteries.</description>

      <title>Towards the superlubricity of polymer-steel interfaces with ionic liquids and carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frictional losses are responsible for significant energy waste in many practical applications, and superlubricity with a coefficient of friction lower than 0.01 is the goal of tribologists. In this paper, metal-on-polymer contact was analysed and close to superlubricity conditions for this material configuration were explored. A new lubricant has been proposed hinge on the phosphorus-based ionic liquid and carbon nanotubes as thickeners. Additionally, carbon nanotube mesh was doped with copper nanoparticles that allowed for the close to superlubricity state in a mild steel/polymer contact configuration under low normal load conditions. The adsorption of phosphorus onto metallic and polymer surfaces has been reported in EDS analysis. The formulation of the new lubricant allowed for stable dispersion with a carbon nanotube content as low as 0.1% wt. The carbon nanotubes and Cu nanoparticles have been analysed using TEM and SEM imaging. A tribological test in a block-on-ring system has been carried out. The wear of material, topography, and surface free energy have been analysed along with SEM/EDS images to explore the underlying mechanisms of friction and wear.</description>

      <title>Vertex corrections to conductivity in the Holstein model: A numerical-analytical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optical-conductivity profile carries information on electronic dynamics in interacting quantum many-body systems. Its computation is a formidable task that is usually approached by invoking the single-particle (bubble) approximation and neglecting the vertex corrections, the importance of which remains elusive even in model Hamiltonian calculations. Here, we combine analytical arguments with our recent breakthroughs in numerically exact and approximate calculations of finite-temperature real-time correlation functions to thoroughly assess the importance of vertex corrections in the one-dimensional Holstein polaron model. We find, both analytically and numerically, vanishing vertex corrections to optical conductivity in the limits of zero electron--phonon interaction, zero electronic bandwidth, and infinite temperature. Furthermore, our numerical results show that vertex corrections to the electron mobility also vanish in many parameter regimes between these limits. In some of these cases, the vertex corrections still introduce important qualitative changes to the optical-conductivity profile in comparison to the bubble approximation even though the self-energy remains approximately local. We trace these changes back to the bubble approximation not fully capturing a time-limited slow-down of the electron on intermediate time scales between ballistic and diffusive transport. We find that the vertex corrections are overall most pronounced for intermediate electron--phonon interaction and may increase or decrease the bubble-approximation mobility depending on the values of model parameters.</description>
