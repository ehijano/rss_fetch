      <title>An elementary definition of opetopic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose elementary definitions of opetopes and opetopic sets. We directly define opetopic sets by a simple structure and several axioms. Opetopes are then opetopic sets satisfying one more axiom. We show that our definition is equivalent to the polynomial monad definition given by Kock, Joyal, Batanin, and Mascari. We also show that our category of opetopes is equivalent to the one given by Ho Thanh.</description>

      <title>Brown--Adams representability for triangulated categories with locally coherent cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with two types of representability. The first is a variant of the Brown representability theorem in the spirit of Rouquier and Neeman. The second is a variant of the Brown-Adams representability. If $A$ is a dg-algebra over a commutative noetherian ring $R$, such that $A$ has coherent cohomology, it is shown that every cohomological (contravariant) functor $M:\mathbf{D}_{perf}(A)\to\mathrm{Mod}\textrm{-}R$, also satisfying $M(A[-n])\in\mathrm{mod}\textrm{-}R$, for all $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbf{D}(A)(-,X)|_{\mathbf{D}_{perf}(A)}$, where $X\in\mathbf{D}(A)$ is such that $H^n(X)$ is coherent for all $n\in\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>An elementary proof of a criterion for subfunctors of Ext to be closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01203v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an abelian category and let $F$ be a subbifunctor of the additive bifunctor $\text{Ext}_{\mathcal{A}}^{1}(-,-)\colon \mathcal{A}^{\text{op}}\times \mathcal{A}\to \mathsf{Ab}$. Buan proved in [4] that $F$ is closed if, and only if, $F$ has the $3\times 3$-lemma property, a certain diagrammatic property satisfied by the class of $F$-exact sequences. The proof of this result relies on the theory of exact categories and on the Freyd--Mitchell embedding theorem, a very well-known overpowered result. In this paper we provide a proof of Buan's result only by means of elementary methods in abelian categories. To achieve this we survey the required theory of subfunctors leading us to a self-contained exposition of this topic.</description>

      <title>A 2-dimensional torsion theory on symmetric monoidal categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we describe a homotopy torsion theory in the category of small symmetric monoidal categories. Thanks to the use of natural isomorphisms as basis for the nullhomotopy structure, this homotopy torsion theory enjoys some interesting 2-dimensional properties which may be the starting point for a definition of "2-dimensional torsion theory". As torsion objects we take symmetric 2-groups, thus generalising a known pointed torsion theory in the category of commutative monoids where abelian groups play the part of torsion objects. In the last part of the paper we carry out an analogous generalisation for the classical torsion theory in the category of abelian groups given by torsion and torsion-free groups.</description>

      <title>Objective Mackey and Tambara functors via parametrized categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first word in the title is intended in a sense suggested by Lawvere and Schanuel whereby finite sets are objective natural numbers. At the objective level, the axioms defining abstract Mackey and Tambara functors are categorically familiar. The first step was taken by Harald Lindner in 1976 when he recognized that Mackey functors, defined as pairs of functors, were single functors with domain a category of spans. We define objective Mackey and objective Tambara functors as parametrized categories which have local finite products and satisfy some parametrized completeness and cocompleteness restriction. However, we can replace the original parametrizing base for objective Mackey functors by a bicategory of spans while the replacement for objective Tambara functors is a bicategory obtained by iterating the span construction; these iterated spans are polynomials. There is an objective Mackey functor of ordinary Mackey functors. We show that there is a distributive law relating objective Mackey functors to objective Tambara functors analogous to the distributive law relating abelian groups to commutative rings. We remark on hom enrichment matters involving the 2-category $\mathrm{Cat}_{+}$ of categories admitting finite coproducts and functors preserving them, both as a closed base and as a skew-closed base.</description>

      <title>Regular Lagrangians are smooth Lagrangians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for any element in the $\gamma$-completion of the space of smooth compact exact Lagrangian submanifolds of a cotangent bundle, if its $\gamma$-support is a smooth Lagrangian submanifold, then the element itself is a smooth Lagrangian. We also prove that if the $\gamma$-support of an element in the completion is compact, then it is connected.</description>

      <title>Connections on a principal Lie groupoid bundle and representations up to homotopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02284v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Lie groupoid principal $\mbbX$ bundle is a surjective submersion $\pi\colon P\to M$ with an action of $\mathbb{X}$ on $P$ with certain additional conditions. This paper offers a suitable definition for the notion of a connection on such bundles. Although every Lie groupoid $\mathbb{X}$ has its associated Lie algebroid $A:=1^*\ker ds\to X_0$, it does not admit a natural action on its Lie algebroid. There is no natural action of $\mathbb{X}$ on $TP$ either. Choosing a connection $\mathbb{H}\subset TX_1$ on the Lie groupoid $\mathbb{X},$ and considering its induced action up to homotopy of $\mathbb{X}$ on graded vector bundle $TX_0\oplus A,$ we prove the existence of a short exact sequence of diffeological groupoids over the discrete category $M$ (with appropriate vector space structures on the fibres) for the $\mbbX$ bundle $\pi\colon P\to M.$ We introduce a notion of connection on $\mbbX$ bundle $\pi\colon P\to M,$ and show that such a connection $\omega$ splits the sequence. Finally, we show that a connection pair $(\omega, \mathbb{H})$ on $\mbbX$ bundle $\pi\colon P\to M$ is isomorphic to any other connection pair.}</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Interpretation of the Internal Model Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The internal model principle, originally proposed in the theory of control of linear systems, nowadays represents a more general class of results in control theory and cybernetics. The central claim of these results is that, under suitable assumptions, if a system (a controller) can regulate against a class of external inputs (from the environment), it is because the system contains a model of the system causing these inputs, which can be used to generate signals counteracting them. Similar claims on the role of internal models appear also in cognitive science, especially in modern Bayesian treatments of cognitive agents, often suggesting that a system (a human subject, or some other agent) models its environment to adapt against disturbances and perform goal-directed behaviour. It is however unclear whether the Bayesian internal models discussed in cognitive science bear any formal relation to the internal models invoked in standard treatments of control theory. Here, we first review the internal model principle and present a precise formulation of it using concepts inspired by categorical systems theory. This leads to a formal definition of ``model'' generalising its use in the internal model principle. Although this notion of model is not a priori related to the notion of Bayesian reasoning, we show that it can be seen as a special case of possibilistic Bayesian filtering. This result is based on a recent line of work formalising, using Markov categories, a notion of ``interpretation'', describing when a system can be interpreted as performing Bayesian filtering on an outside world in a consistent way.</description>

      <title>The Topological Structures of the Orders of Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide first a categorical exploration of, and then completion of the mapping of the relationships among, three fundamental perspectives on binary relations: as the incidence matrices of hypergraphs, as the formal contexts of concept lattices, and as specifying topological cosheaves of simplicial (Dowker) complexes on simplicial (Dowker) complexes. We provide an integrative, functorial framework combining previously known with three new results: 1) given a binary relation, there are order isomorphisms among the bounded edge order of the intersection complexes of its dual hypergraphs and its concept lattice; 2) the concept lattice of a context is an isomorphism invariant of the Dowker cosheaf (of abstract simplicial complexes) of that context; and 3) a novel Dowker cosheaf (of chain complexes) of a relation is an isomorphism invariant of the concept lattice of the context that generalizes Dowker's original homological result. We illustrate these concepts throughout with a running example, and demonstrate relationships to past results.</description>
