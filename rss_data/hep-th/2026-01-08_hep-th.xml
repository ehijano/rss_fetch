      <title>Curvatures and Non-metricities in the Non-Relativistic Limit of Bosonic Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a diffeomorphism-covariant formulation of the non-relativistic (NR) limit of bosonic supergravity. This formulation is particularly useful for decomposing relativistic tensors, such as powers of the Riemann tensor, in a manifest covariant form with respect to the NR degrees of freedom. The construction is purely geometrical and is based on a torsionless connection. The non-metricities are associated with the gravitational fields of the theory, $\tau_{\mu\nu}, h_{\mu\nu}, \tau^{\mu\nu}$ and $h^{\mu\nu}$, and are fixed by requiring compatibility with the relativistic metric. We provide a fully covariant decomposition of the relativistic Riemann tensor, Ricci tensor, and scalar curvature. Our results establish an equivalence between the proposed construction and the intrinsic torsion framework of string Newton-Cartan geometry. We also discuss potential applications, including a manifestly diffeomorphism-covariant rewriting of the two-derivative finite bosonic supergravity Lagrangian under the NR limit, a powerful simplification in deriving bosonic $\alpha'$-corrections under the same limit, and extensions to more general $f(R,Q)$ Newton-Cartan geometries.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative data for Weil-Petersson volumes and intersection numbers using ordinary differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a new method was introduced for computing $V_{g,1}(b)$, the Weil-Petersson volumes of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces of genus $g$ with one geodesic boundary of length $b$, various supersymmetric generalizations of them, as well as analogous quantities in intersection theory. The physical setting is the computation of a certain one-point function in a variety of models of 2D gravity for which there is a double-scaled random matrix model (RMM) description. The method combines perturbative solutions of two ordinary differential equations (ODEs), the Gel'fand-Dikii resolvent equation, and the RMM's string equation. In this paper, we extend the method to extract non-perturbative information about the $V_{g,1}(b)$ (and their analogues) that is naturally contained in the full ODEs, providing an efficient prescription for computing the transseries coefficients of the one-point correlation function, fully incorporating ZZ-brane and FZZT-brane effects, and for the first time, mixed ZZ-FZZT-effects. We use as a case study the (2,3) minimal string, computing perturbative and non-perturbative quantities, comparing them to perturbative results from topological recursion, and to results from the recent non-perturbative topological recursion framework of Eynard et.al. As a particularly powerful further application we provide general predictions for the large order in $g$ growth of $V_{g,1}(b)$, and apply them to JT gravity, finding agreement with known results, and for analogous quantities in ${N} {=} 1$ JT supergravity, proving a conjecture of Stanford and Witten. Our predictions yield new growth formulae for the cases of ${N} {=} 2$ and ${N}{=}4$ JT supergravity.</description>

      <title>Black hole thermodynamics at null infinity. Part 1: Dual Generalized Second Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized second law (GSL) of black hole thermodynamics asserts the monotonic increase of the generalized entropy combining the black hole area and the entropy of quantum fields outside the horizon. Modern proofs of the GSL rely on information theoretic methods and are typically formulated using algebras of observables defined on the event horizon together with a vacuum state invariant under horizon symmetries, inducing a geometric modular flow. In this work, we formulate a dual version of the generalized second law from the perspective of asymptotic observers at future null infinity, who do not have access to the black hole area. Our approach exploits the dependence of the second law on the choice of algebra of observables and of a reference state invariant under suitable symmetries, in close analogy with open quantum thermodynamics. Using algebraic quantum field theory and modular theory, we analyze several physically motivated vacuum states, including the Hartle Hawking state and two classes of regularized vacua. We show that, at null infinity, the monotonic quantity governing an irreversible evolution is no longer the generalized entropy, but rather a thermodynamic potential constructed from asymptotic observables. Depending on the chosen vacuum, this potential takes the form of the free energy or of a generalized grand potential built from the Bondi mass and additional (angular) mode dependent chemical potentials. The resulting inequalities define a dual generalized second law at future null infinity, which can be consistently combined with the standard GSL involving variations of the black hole area.</description>

      <title>Black hole thermodynamics at null infinity. Part 2: Open systems, Markovian dynamics and work extraction from non-rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole thermodynamics provides a unique setting in which general relativity, quantum field theory, and statistical mechanics converge. In semiclassical gravity, this interplay culminates in the generalized second law (GSL), whose modern proofs rely on information theoretic techniques applied to algebras of observables defined on null hypersurfaces. These proofs exhibit close structural parallels with the thermodynamics of open quantum systems governed by Markovian dynamics. In this work, we draw parallels between the dynamics of quantum fields in regions bounded by non expanding causal horizons and the thermodynamics of quantum systems weakly coupled to equilibrium reservoirs. We introduce a dictionary relating late time boundary conditions to the choice of reservoir, vacuum states to fixed points of the dynamics, and modular Hamiltonians to thermodynamic potentials. Building on results from a companion paper on dual generalized second laws at future null infinity, we show that additional terms appearing in the associated thermodynamic potentials admit a natural interpretation as work contributions. We demonstrate that certain non thermal vacuum states at null infinity allow for the operation of autonomous thermal engines and enable work extraction from the radiation. Extending the analysis to the Unruh vacuum in Schwarzschild and Kerr backgrounds, we obtain generalized grand potential type laws incorporating grey body effects and angular momentum fluxes. Altogether, our results clarify the thermodynamic description of black hole dynamics and place it within the broader framework of open quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>All loop soft photon theorems and higher spin currents on the celestial sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft factorization theorems can be reinterpreted as Ward identities for (asymptotic) symmetries of scattering amplitudes in asymptotically flat space-time. In this paper we study the symmetries implied by the all loop soft photon theorems when all external particles are massless. Loop level soft theorems are qualitatively different from the tree level soft theorems because loop level soft factors contain multi-particle sums. If we want to interpret them as Ward identities then we need to introduce additional fields which live on the celestial sphere but do not appear as asymptotic states in any scattering experiment. For example, if we want to interpret the one-loop exact $O(\ln\omega)$ soft theorem for a positive helicity soft photon (with energy $\omega$) as a Ward identity then we need to introduce a pair of antiholomorphic currents on the celestial sphere which transform as a doublet under the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})_{R}$. We call them dipole currents because the corresponding charges measure the monopole and the dipole moment of an electrically charged particle on the celestial sphere. More generally, the soft photon theorem at $O(\omega^{2j-1}(\ln\omega)^{2j})$ for every $j\in \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}_+$ gives rise to $(2j+1)$ antiholomorphic currents which transform in the spin-$j$ representation of the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})_{R}$. These currents exist in the quantum theory because they follow from loop level soft theorems. We argue that under certain circumstances the (classical) algebra of the higher spin currents is the wedge subalgebra of the $w_{1+\infty}$.</description>

      <title>Real-time Gravitational Wave Response in Thermal Spinning fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how the spin content of the thermal plasmas affects the propagation of gravitational waves in a radiation-dominated universe. As a simple but representative setup, we consider conformal scalar, Weyl fermion, and Maxwell fields that provide the background radiation, and we ask whether the resulting damping and phase shift of gravitational waves retain any memory of their spins. We revisit this question in a real-time quantum-field-theoretic framework, where the stress tensor splits into a background part, a dynamical (history-dependent) response, and local contact terms, with an additional on-shell projection fixed by the Friedmann equation. We find that the dynamical spin-dependent response arises on a short time scale characterized by the radiation temperature, which is exactly canceled by the local responses. As a result, the remaining long-time response is universal and consistent with kinetic theory in the hard thermal limit. Although the underlying mechanism exhibits strong spin dependence, it leaves no observable imprint on the large-scale effective dynamics of gravitational waves in this setup.</description>

      <title>Scalar vacuum densities on Beltrami pseudosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the combined effects of spatial curvature and topology on the properties of the vacuum state for a charged scalar field localized on the (2+1)-dimensional Beltrami pseudosphere, assuming that the field obeys quasiperiodicity condition with constant phase. As important local characteristics of the vacuum state the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the field squared and energy-momentum tensor are evaluated. The contributions in the VEVs coming from geometry with an uncompactified azimuthal coordinate are divergent, whereas the compact counterparts are finite and are analysed both numerically and asymptotically. For small values of proper radius of the compactified dimension, the leading terms of topological contributions are independent of the field mass and curvature coupling parameter, increasing by a power-law. In the opposite limit, the VEVs decay following a power-law in the general case. In the special case of a conformally coupled massless field the behavior is different. Unlike the VEV of field squared and vacuum energy density, the radial and azimuthal stresses are increasing by absolute value. As a consequence, the effects of nontrivial topology are strong for the stresses in this case at small values of radial coordinate.</description>

      <title>A glimpse into the Ultrametric spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-relativistic string spectrum is built from integer-spaced energy quanta in such a way that the high-temperature asymptotics, via the Hardy-Ramanujan formula for integer partitions, reduces to standard two-dimensional thermodynamics. Here we explore deformed realizations of this behavior motivated by $p$-adic string theory and Lorentzian versions thereof with a non-trivial spectrum. We study the microstate scaling that results on associating quantum harmonic oscillators to the normal modes of tree-graphs rather than string graphs and observe that Hardy-Ramanujan scaling is not realized. But by computing the eigenvalues of the derivative operator on the $p$-adic circle and by determining the eigenspectrum of the Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator, we uncover a spectrum of exponentially growing energies but with exponentially growing degeneracies balanced in such a way that Hardy-Ramanujan scaling is realized, but modulated with log-periodic fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons-like formulation of 3D MMG-like massive gravity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Chern-Simons-like formulation of 3D MMG-like massive gravity models that are "third-way consistent". Building on previous work on exotic massive gravities, we analyze a class of MMG-like theories characterized by a specific parity structure and an auxiliary field hierarchy. Focusing on the simplest non-trivial case, we solve the full set of field equations, determine the AdS background solutions, compute the central charges of the dual CFT, and perform a linearized analysis to obtain the mass spectrum. Along the chiral line, the linearized mass operator develops a rank-2 Jordan block, signaling logarithmic behavior of massive modes in the dual two-dimensional CFT. At a special degenerate point, this structure is enhanced to a rank-3 Jordan block, giving rise to two logarithmic partners and an ultra-logarithmic sector in the boundary theory.</description>

      <title>Renormalizable and unitary nonlocal quantum field theory with CPT violation and its implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a common belief that any relativistic nonlocal quantum field theory encounters either the problem of renormalizability or unitarity or both of them. It is also known that any local relativistic quantum field theory (QFT) possesses the CPT symmetry. In this Letter we show that a previously proposed nonlocal Lorentz invariant QFT, which violates the CPT theorem, is both renormalizable and unitary, thus being a first presented example in the literature of such a nonlocal theory. The theory satisfies the requirement of causality as well. A further generalization of such a nonlocal QFT to include the gauge theories is also envisaged. In particular, dressing such a Standard Model with a CP violating phase, will make the theory satisfying most of the necessary criteria to finally explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe by a viable QFT. As for the necessity of baryon number violation, there are hopefully several possibilities such as by GUT and electroweak baryogenesis, leptogenesis or sphalerons.</description>

      <title>Freelance Fluid/Gravity Correspondence, 3d Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Freelance holography program is an extension of gauge/gravity correspondence, where the gravity theory is defined on a portion of AdS with an arbitrary timelike boundary, with any desired boundary conditions. It is also known that gauge/gravity correspondence admits a fluid/gravity correspondence limit, where the gauge theory side is well described by a fluid. In this work, combining the two, we work through ``freelance fluid/gravity''. In particular, we study in detail the 2d fluid (3d Einstein gravity) case, where one has a good analytical control over the bulk equations due to their integrability and absence of viscosity in the 2d fluid. We study consistency and validity requirements for the freelance fluid/gravity and how the fluid changes along the renormalization group (RG) flow. We prove the $v_g$-theorem, stating that the group velocity of fluid waves $v_g$ is a decreasing function as we move toward the infrared region along the RG flow, regardless of the adopted boundary conditions. We also study examples of holographic fluid with various asymptotic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>2d Conformal Field Theories on Magic Triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magic triangle due to Cvitanovi\'c and Deligne--Gross is an extension of the Freudenthal--Tits magic square of semisimple Lie algebras. In this paper, we identify all 2d rational conformal field theories associated to the magic triangle. These include various Wess--Zumino--Witten (WZW) models, Virasoro minimal models, compact bosons and their non-diagonal modular invariants. At level one, we find a two-parameter family of modular linear differential equation of fourth order whose solutions produce the affine characters of all elements in the magic triangle. We find a universal coset relation for the whole triangle which generalizes the dual pairs with respect to $(E_8)_1$ in the Cvitanovi\'c--Deligne exceptional series. This leads to the dimension and degeneracy of each primary field and also to five atomic models which constitute all theories in the triangle. At level two, we find a special row of the triangle -- the subexceptional series has novel $N=1$ supersymmetry, and the Neveu--Schwarz/Ramond characters satisfy a one-parameter family of fermionic modular linear differential equations. Moreover, we find many new coset constructions involving WZW models at higher levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum description of dust cores for black hole geometries can be obtained by quantising the geodesic motion of dust particles and finding the corresponding many-body ground state. We here generalise previous works in spherical symmetry to rotating geometries and show the effect of angular momentum on the size of the core and effective interior geometry.</description>

      <title>Discrete symmetries in classical and quantum oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the nature of the wave function using the example of a harmonic oscillator. We show that the eigenfunctions $\psi_n{=}z^n$ of the quantum Hamiltonian in the complex Bargmann-Fock-Segal representation with $z\in\mathbb C$ are the coordinates of a classical oscillator with energy $E_n=\hbar\omega n$, $n=0,1,2,...\,$. They are defined on conical spaces ${\mathbb C}/{\mathbb Z}_n$ with cone angles $2\pi/n$, which are embedded as subspaces in the phase space $\mathbb C$ of the classical oscillator. Here ${\mathbb Z}_n$ is the finite cyclic group of rotations of the space $\mathbb C$ by an angle $2\pi/n$. The superposition $\psi =\sum_n c_n\psi_n$ of the eigenfunctions $\psi_n$ arises only with incomplete knowledge of the initial data for solving the Schr\"odinger equation, when the conditions of invariance with respect to the discrete groups ${\mathbb Z}_n$ are not imposed and the general solution takes into account all possible initial data parametrized by the numbers $n\in\mathbb N$.</description>

      <title>Consistent Truncation of Linearized gravitational waves in de Sitter space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important step in using observations of gravitational waves from bounded sources is to relate the observed waveforms far away from a source to the local dynamics and environment of the source. To isolate and identify different features of the source, multipole expansion of radiation field as well as that of the source distribution is crucial. Unlike the waves on Minkowski background, those on de Sitter background do not have a convenient, close form relation among these multipoles of arbitrary order to draw general conclusions. This requires truncation to some multipole order to be employed and a consistency issue arises. This was flagged in \cite{CHK} as emergence of disallowed $log(r)$ terms in certain asymptotic forms and a particular quadrupolar truncation was proposed which was consistent with the source conservation.
  In \cite{NKD80}, it was noticed that a truncated solution while satisfying the wave equation, may fail to satisfy the gauge condition. Truncation in a fully gauge fixed form should not generate the unwanted $log(r)$ terms. In this work, we clarify the consistency issue and also correct a couple of erroneous statements in \cite{NKD80}. The consistency is analyzed by explicitly integrating the gauge conditions and the source conservation equations over the conformal time. This gives a general procedure for a consistent truncation. The procedure is applied to truncations of completely gauge fixed solution illustrating its consistency.</description>

      <title>From Loop Quantum Gravity to a Theory of Everything</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Witten described how a path integral quantization of Wilson Loop observables will define Jones polynomial type of link invariants, using the Chern-Simons gauge theory in $\mathbb{R}^3$. In this gauge theory, a compact Lie group ${\rm G}$, together with a representation of its Lie Algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, describe the symmetry group and fundamental forces acting on the particles respectively. However, it appears that this theory might be part of a bigger theory.
  We will incorporate this theory into the Einstein-Hilbert theory, which when reformulated and quantized using a ${\rm SU}(2) \times {\rm SU}(2)$ gauge group, gives us a quantized theory of gravity in $\mathbb{R}^4$. In this theory, we can quantize area, volume and curvature into quantum operators. By using both the Chern-Simons and Einstein-Hilbert action, we will write down a path integral expression, and compute the Wilson Loop observable for a time-like hyperlink in $\mathbb{R}^4$, each component loop is coloured with a representation for the Lie Algebra $\mathfrak{g} \times [\mathfrak{su}(2) \times \mathfrak{su}(2)]$, unifying the fundamental forces with gravity. This Wilson Loop observable can be computed using link diagrams, and it can be written as a state model, satisfying a Homfly-type skein relations.
  We will show that the Wilson Loop observable remains an eigenstate for the quantum operators corresponding to spin curvature, but it is not an eigenstate for the area and volume quantized operators, unless the representation for $\mathfrak{g}$ is trivial. This implies that in the Planck scale where quantum gravity is important, we see that all the particles are indistinguishable, hence the fundamental forces disappear and only interaction between matter and space-time remains.</description>

      <title>Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: A Non-Hermitian Pilot-Wave Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Weyl's abandoned idea of local scale invariance has a natural realization at the quantum level in pilot-wave (deBroglie-Bohm) theory. We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter. The resultant non-hermiticity has a natural interpretation in terms of local scale invariance of the quantum state in pilot-wave theory. The conserved current density is modified from $|\psi|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\psi|^2/ \mathbf{1}^2[\mathcal{C}]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schr\"odinger, Pauli, and Dirac equations coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique.</description>

      <title>Double interval entanglement in quasiparticle excited states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate double-interval entanglement measures, specifically reflected entropy, mutual information, and logarithmic negativity, in quasiparticle excited states for classical, bosonic, and fermionic systems. We develop an algorithm that efficiently calculates these measures from density matrices expressed in a non-orthonormal basis, enabling straightforward numerical implementation. We find a universal additivity property that emerges at large momentum differences, where the entanglement measures for states with distinct quasiparticle sets equal the sum of their individual contributions. The classical limit arises as a special case of this additivity, with both bosonic and fermionic results converging to classical behavior when all momentum differences are large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a low-energy effective approach, the extended linear sigma model, to study realizations of the $U(1)_A$ anomaly with different operators, linear and quadratic in the 't Hooft determinant. After discussing the parameterization in agreement with vacuum's phenomenology, we investigate the influence of these different anomaly terms on the Columbia plot: the square of the 't Hooft determinant favors a cross-over for small quark masses. Finally, we also discuss the extension of the 't Hooft determinant to cases in which different mesonic multiplets interact with each other. Novel chiral anomalous interaction terms involving excited (pseudo)scalar states, pseudovector, and pseudotensor mesons are expressed via a mathematical extension of the determinant, denoted as a polydeterminant.</description>

      <title>Addicted to Flavour: 1976-2026</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I describe my activities in Flavour Physics from 1976 to 2026. However, this 50th anniversary is not the only motivation for this writing. The second reason is the 350th anniversary of the discovery of the first animalcula by van Leeuvanhoek in 1676. Flavour physics makes it possible to search for new animalcula at distance scales far shorter than those resolved by van Leeuwenhoek in 1676 and even shorter than those directly accessible at the Large Hadron Collider. Achieving this goal requires not only precise measurements of a wide variety of processes, but also equally precise theoretical calculations, both within the Standard Model (SM) and beyond it. In this respect, next-to-leading-order (NLO) and next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) QCD calculations of various Wilson coefficients in the SM and beyond it, in which I was involved for two decades, as well as reliable treatments of non-perturbative QCD effects, are indispensable. Equally important is the proper choice of observables that are best suited to revealing these new animalcula of particle physics. Moreover, in my view it is crucial to develop strategies for the search for New Physics (NP) that go beyond the global fits that are very popular today. While effective field theories such as WET and SMEFT are formulated in terms of Wilson coefficients of the relevant operators, with correlations characteristic of the SM and of specific NP scenarios, the most direct tests of the SM and its extensions are, in my opinion, correlations among different observables that are characteristic of particular new animalcula at work. Numerous colourful plots in this article illustrate this point. I hope that these ideas are clearly conveyed in my Flavour Autobiography, which also includes my memories of many conferences, workshops, and schools, as well as related anecdotes that are not always directly connected to physics.</description>

      <title>Motions of spinning particles and chaos bound in Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03751v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Lyapunov exponents of classical chaos of spinning particles orbiting a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and examine whether the values of the exponents exceed the chaos bound. For the neutral particle, when its spin magnitude surpasses a specific threshold, the value of the exponent exceeds the surface gravity, resulting in a violation. Given a fixed total angular momentum of the particle, its spin direction opposite to the angular momentum direction leads to a greater exponent value than when the two directions are aligned. For the charged particle, taking into account the influence of the electromagnetic force, we find that, for relatively large angular momenta, although the electromagnetic force does not change the trend of the exponent's variation with respect to spin and angular momentum and only modifies the specific values of the exponent, it still leads to violations of the bound. Therefore, the chaos bound is violated in the spinor field.</description>

      <title>Phases of the $q$-deformed $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang-Mills theory at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the $(2+1)$-dimensional $q$-deformed $\mathrm{SU}(N)_k$ Yang-Mills theory in the lattice Hamiltonian formalism, which is characterized by three parameters: the number of colors $N$, the coupling constant $g$, and the level $k$. By treating these as tunable parameters, we explore how key properties of the theory, such as confinement and topological order, emerge in different regimes. Employing a variational mean-field analysis that interpolates between the strong- and weak-coupling regimes, we determine the large-$N$ phase structure in terms of the 't Hooft coupling $\lambda_\mathrm{tH}=g^2N$ and the ratio $k/N$. We find that the topologically ordered phase remains robust at large $N$ under appropriate scalings of these parameters. This result indicates that the continuum limit of large-$N$ gauge theory may be more intricate than naively expected, and motivates studies beyond the mean-field theory, both to achieve a further understanding of confinement in gauge theories and to guide quantum simulations of large-$N$ gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Open $r$-spin theory in genus one, and the Gelfand-Dikii wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the $g=1$ sector of the open $r$-spin theory, that is, an open $r$-spin theory on the moduli space of cylinders. This is the second construction of a $g&gt;0$ open intersection theory, which includes descendents (the first is the all genus construction of the intersection theory on moduli of open Riemann surfaces with boundaries [23,30], whose $g=1$ case equals to the $r=2$ case of our construction). Unlike the construction of [30], in order to construct the $r$-spin cylinder theory we had to overcome the foundational problem of dimension jump loci, which in analogous closed theories has been treated using virtual fundamental class techniques, that are currently absent in the open setting. For this reason our construction is much more involved, and relies on the point insertion technique developed in [31,32].
  We prove that the open $g=1$ potential equals, after a coordinate change, to the $g=1$ part of the Gelfand-Dikii wave function, thus confirming a conjecture of [7]. We also prove that our $g=1$ intersection numbers satisfy a $g=1$ recursion, also predicted in [7,15]. This recursion is the $g=1$ analogue of Solomon's famous $g=0$ Open WDVV equation [25], with descendents, and is also the universal $g=1$ recursion for $F$-Cohomological field theories [1]. Again, this is first geometric construction which is not the $g=1$ sector of [23,30], proven to satisfy this universal recursion.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a mixed-state generalization of the multi-entropy through the canonical purification, which we call reflected multi-entropy. We propose the holographic dual of this measure. For the tripartite case, a field-theoretical calculation is performed using a six-point function of twist operators at large $c$ limit. At both zero and finite temperature, the field-theoretical results match the holographic results, supporting our holographic conjecture of this new measure.</description>

      <title>Counterflow and coflow instabilities in miscible binary superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore instabilities in binary superfluids with a nonvanishing relative superflow, particularly focusing on counterflow and coflow instabilities. We extend recent results on the thermodynamic origin of finite superflow instabilities in single-component superfluids to binary systems and derive a criterion for the onset of instability through a hydrodynamic analysis, which applies to interacting many-body systems at finite temperature. We find that the onset of these instabilities is signaled by the determinant of the Hessian of the thermal free energy diverging and changing sign. We verify this hydrodynamic prediction in a holographic binary superfluid modeled with gauge/gravity duality, which naturally incorporates strong coupling, finite temperature, and dissipation. We also compare to results obtained using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates and find that the same criterion continues to apply at zero temperature, where it reduces to evaluating derivatives of the supercurrents with respect to the superfluid velocities. We observe that the critical velocities of these instabilities follow a general scaling law related to the interaction strength between superfluid components. Finally, the nonlinear stages of the instabilities are studied by full time evolution using gauge/gravity duality, where vortex annihilation leads to a decrease of superfluid velocity back to a value where the binary superfluid phase is stable.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Lie-Poisson algebra and Lie algebra solutions of mass-deformed type IIB matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24060v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantization of Lie-Poisson algebras is studied. Classical solutions of the mass-deformed Ishibashi-Kawai-Kitazawa-Tsuchiya (IKKT) matrix model can be constructed from semisimple Lie algebras whose dimension matches the number of matrices in the model. We consider the geometry described by the classical solutions of the Lie algebras in the limit where the mass vanishes and the matrix size tends to infinity. Lie-Poisson varieties are regarded as such geometric objects. We provide a quantization called ``weak matrix regularization'' of Lie-Poisson algebras (linear Poisson algebras) on the algebraic varieties defined by their Casimir polynomials. This quantization is a generalization of matrix regularization, and neither faithfulness of the map nor the correspondence between integration and trace in the commutative limit is required. Casimir polynomials correspond with Casimir operators of the Lie algebra by the quantization. This quantization is a generalization of the method for constructing the fuzzy sphere. In order to define the weak matrix regularization of the quotient space by the ideal generated by the Casimir polynomials, we take a fixed reduced Gr\"obner basis of the ideal. The Gr\"obner basis determines remainders of polynomials. The operation of replacing these remainders with representation matrices of a Lie algebra roughly corresponds to a weak matrix regularization. As concrete examples, we construct weak matrix regularization for $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ and $\mathfrak{su}(3)$. In the case of $\mathfrak{su}(3)$, we not only construct weak matrix regularization for the quadratic Casimir polynomial, but also construct weak matrix regularization for the cubic Casimir polynomial.</description>

      <title>Dimensional Uplift in Conformal Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The n-point functions of any Conformal Field Theory (CFT) in $d$ dimensions can always be interpreted as spatial restrictions of corresponding functions in a higher-dimensional CFT with dimension $d'&gt; d$. In particular, when a four-point function in $d$ dimensions has a known conformal block expansion, this expansion can be easily extended to $d'=d+2$ due to a remarkable identity among conformal blocks, discovered by Kaviraj, Rychkov, and Trevisani (KRT) as a consequence of Parisi-Sourlas supersymmetry and confirmed to hold in any CFT with $d &gt; 1$. In this note, we provide an elementary proof of this identity using simple algebraic properties of the Casimir operators. Additionally, we construct five differential operators, $\Lambda_i$, which promote a conformal block in $d$ dimensions to five conformal blocks in $d+2$ dimensions. These operators can be normalized such that $\sum_i \Lambda_i = 1$, from which the KRT identity immediately follows. Similar, simpler identities have been proposed, all of which can be reformulated in the same way.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that the BMS evolution equations for the mass and angular momentum aspects in asymptotically flat Einstein gravity follow from local Carroll, Weyl, and diffeomorphism invariance at the null conformal boundary, upon providing a minimalistic holographic dictionary as the sole input from the bulk. This result is a significant step in the quest for a flat-space holographic correspondence and offers a geometric implementation of the radiative degrees of freedom that source the boundary theory in the presence of bulk gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Scalar parity-odd trispectrum from gravitational Chern-Simons interaction vertices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore parity violation in a scalar trispectrum from a dynamical Chern-Simons gravity theory. So far, a graviton-mediated diagram with two vertexes being of general relativity has been studied in this theory by taking into account the impact of a modified dispersion relation of gravitons on graviton's bulk propagators. We instead study a parity-odd trispectrum from both a graviton-mediated diagram, where one of the two vertexes originates from the Chern-Simons term, and a contact diagram by using the bulk propagators in general relativity. After computing the scalar-scalar-tensor cubic interactions and the scalar quartic ones originating from the Chern-Simons term, first we show that the resultant parity-odd trispectrum vanishes in the case of Bunch-Davies initial conditions, which is consistent with a no-go theorem for a non-vanishing parity-odd trispectrum. Then, we discuss a way to acquire a non-vanishing parity-odd trispectrum from the viewpoint of non-Bunch-Davies initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Anomaly of 4d Weyl fermion with discrete symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive explicit anomaly index formulas for 4d Weyl fermions charged under discrete symmetries $\mathrm{Spin} \times \mathbb{Z}_n$ and $\mathrm{Spin} \times_{\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathrm{F}}} \mathbb{Z}_{2m}$ by systematically reducing the known perturbative local anomaly indices for $\mathrm{Spin} \times \mathrm{U}(1)$ and $\mathrm{Spin} \times_{\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathrm{F}}} \mathrm{U}(1) \equiv \mathrm{Spin}^c$ symmetries. Our approach leverages the natural group homomorphisms $$ \mathrm{TP}_5(\mathrm{Spin} \times \mathrm{U}(1)) \longrightarrow \mathrm{TP}_5(\mathrm{Spin} \times \mathbb{Z}_n), \quad \mathrm{TP}_5(\mathrm{Spin}^c) \longrightarrow \mathrm{TP}_5(\mathrm{Spin} \times_{\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathrm{F}}} \mathbb{Z}_{2m}), $$ which map continuous topological phases to their discrete counterparts. We compute the images of these homomorphisms explicitly by evaluating $\eta$-invariants on key manifold generators: the 5d lens space bundle $X(n;1,1)$ and $L(n;1) \times \mathrm{K3}$ (with $\mathrm{K3}$ the K3 surface) for $\mathrm{Spin} \times \mathbb{Z}_n$, and the 5d lens space $L(m;1,1,1)$ and $L(m;1) \times \mathrm{E}$ (with $\mathrm{E}$ the Enriques surface) if $m$ is even, or $L(m;1) \times \mathrm{K3}$ if $m$ is odd for $\mathrm{Spin} \times_{\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathrm{F}}} \mathbb{Z}_{2m}$. These results provide a unifying framework to compute and classify nonperturbative global anomalies of discrete symmetries -- in fermionic theories with discrete gauge or global symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Klein-Gordon and Dirac equation for a massive charged field in a uniform electric field has a symmetry of two-dimensional global de Sitter (dS) and anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. In the in-out formalism the mean numbers of spinors (spin-1/2 fermions) and scalars (spin-0 bosons) spontaneously produced by the uniform electric field are exactly found from the Bogoliubov relations both in the global and planar coordinates of (A)dS$_2$ space. We show that the uniform electric field enhances the production of charged spinor and scalar pairs in the planar and global dS space while the AdS space reduces the pair production in which weak electric fields below the Breitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound prohibits pair production. The leading Boltzmann factor in dS space can be written as the Gibbons-Hawking radiation or Schwinger effect enhanced by e-folding factors less than one that give the QED effect or the curvature effect. We observe that dS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ spaces are connected by QED, such as a reciprocal relation between the mean number of spinors and scalars provided that the spacetime curvature is analytically continued. The leading behavior of the mean numbers for spinors and scalars is explained as a residue sum of contour integrals of the frequency or momentum in the phase-integral formulation.</description>

      <title>Matter Coupling of Dirac Matter in the Context of the SYK Model: Non-Gaussian Random Couplings and Bulk Mass Deformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We elaborate further on the matter coupling of Dirac matter in the SYK framework, incorporating non-Gaussian coupling distributions and bulk fermion mass effects. Our study analyzes quartic matter couplings generated by a non-Gaussian distribution as an illustrative example. The introduction of bulk-fermion mass alters the boundary coupling between the Dirac and Majorana fermions. The averaged adjacent gap ratio is sensitive to the distribution of random couplings, which remains independent of the Hamiltonian's symmetry. The generalization of the SYK model to non-Gaussian distributions and the inclusion of bulk fermion mass remain qualitatively similar to the Gaussian and massless cases. Key deviations are observed only in the time scales for the linear ramp in the spectral form factor and the saturation of entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of spin-spin correlators weighted by fermion number measurements with low rapidity threshold in the 2D Ising free-fermion QFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the work, we study the averaged number of massive fermions above a low rapidity threshold $Y$, underlying the form-factor expansions of the spin-spin two-point correlators at an Euclidean distance $r$, in the 2D Ising QFT at the free massive fermion point. Despite the on-shell freeness, the spin operators are still far away from being Gaussian, and create particles in the asymptotic states with complicated correlations. We show how the number observables can still be incorporated into the integrable Sinh-Gordon/Painleve-III framework and controlled by linear differential equations with two variables $(r,Y)$. We show how the differential equations and the information of two crucial scaling functions arising in the $r\rightarrow 0$, $e^{Y}r={\cal O}(1)$ scaling limit, can be combined to fully determine the small-$r$ asymptotics of the observables, in the $\lambda$-extended form. The scaling functions, on the other hand, are analyzed by summing the exponential form-factor expansions directly, generalizing the traditional Ising connecting computations. We show carefully, how the singularities cancel in the physical value limit $\lambda \pi \rightarrow 1$ and how the power-corrections that collapse at this value can be resummed. In particular, we show for the physical $\lambda$-value, the scaling functions are related to an integrated four-point function in the Ising CFT and continue to control the asymptotics of the number-observables in the scaling limit up to ${\cal O}(r^3)$.</description>

Abstract: This research investigates a novel class of one-dimensional theories characterised by a distinctly defined infinite interaction range. We propose that such theories emerge naturally through a mesoscopic feedback mechanism. In this proof-of-concept study, we examine Ising-type models and a model with continuous O(3) symmetry, and demonstrate that the natural emergence of phase transitions, criticality, spontaneous symmetry breaking and previously unidentified universality classes is evident. The framework introduced here holds particular relevance for monolayer spintronics research, where the ultimate goal is to achieve a strong ferromagnetic order at room temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the energy-momentum tensor of the O(N) linear sigma model explicitly in the large N limit using the exact renormalization group (ERG) formalism. The energy-momentum tensor is obtained as a cutoff dependent functional of N scalar field variables. Our guiding principles behind the construction are twofold: first the energy-momentum tensor must satisfy the Ward identity for translation and rotation invariance, and second the energy-momentum tensor must satisfy a variant of the exact renormalization group equation. In the limit that the momentum cutoff goes to zero, our energy-momentum tensor gives the one-particle irreducible (1PI) effective action with the insertion of a single energy-momentum tensor operator. We verify that the energy-momentum tensor constructed satisfies the expected trace formula, and that the trace vanishes at the Wilson-Fisher critical point.</description>

      <title>The 11D pure spinor ghost number zero vertex operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 11D pure spinor worldline has been proved to successfully describe the physical states of 11D supergravity in a manifestly super-Poincar\'e covariant fashion. Within this framework, the computation of scattering amplitudes requires the existence of vertex operators carrying different ghost numbers. A recent no-go theorem demonstrated the impossibility of constructing a ghost number zero vertex operator consistent with 11D supergravity in the minimal pure spinor formalism. In this letter, we overcome this obstruction by working in the non-minimal formulation of the 11D pure spinor superparticle. We construct, for the first time, a ghost number zero vertex operator with a remarkably compact structure when expressed in terms of physical operators. We further verify that it satisfies the expected descent relation with the ghost number one vertex operator, and that its commutator with the ghost number three single-particle vertex reproduces the two-particle superfield recently introduced in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We uncover a surprising universal soft behaviour (USB) of a de Sitter (dS) S-matrix for \textit{all} exceptional effective field theories (EFTs) in dS space, stemming from the recently proposed generalised energy conservation (GEC) condition. At leading order in the soft limit, the dS S-matrices for all exceptional EFTs in four spacetime dimensions exhibit no scaling with the soft momentum, i.e. $\lim_{k\rightarrow 0}\mathcal{A}(k)\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$, a feature we term USB. We specifically show that USB fixes the four-point amplitudes in Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) theory and Special Galileon, and six-point amplitude in $SU(N)$ Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM) given the minimal derivative count. We then conjecture USB fixes the interactions of all exceptional EFTs to all orders, thereby providing a unification criterion for them. Our result further underpins the idea that $\Delta\geq 4$ exceptional theories in dS are characterised by the spectrum and stability requirement alone, resonating with the low energy theory of gravity--General Relativity.</description>

We also identify the correct light-cone definitions of the symmetry generators and their dynamical forms in terms of the fields and take the $c\rightarrow0$ limit. It is observed that these generators produce the known kinematic Carrollian conformal algebraic commutation relations.</description>

Abstract: We compute the ladder operators for static tidal perturbations to higher-dimensional black holes. These operators map between solutions of the relevant equation of motion at different multipole orders. We focus on spin 0, 1 and 2 perturbations to the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole and on spin 0 perturbations to the 5D Myers-Perry black hole. The ladder structure, used in conjunction with the existence of special ground state solutions, explains why the Love numbers of these higher-dimensional black holes vanish for specific combinations of the multipole moment and number of spacetime dimensions. This generalizes previous work on a ladder symmetry explanation for the vanishing of 4D black hole static Love numbers to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>The algebraic structure of the gradient expansion in linearised classical hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically treat the ambiguities that generically arise in the gradient expansion of any hydrodynamic theory. While these ambiguities do not affect the physical content of the equations, they induce two types of transformations in the space of transport coefficients. The first type is known as the 'frame' transformations, and amounts to field redefinitions. The second type, which we introduce and formalise here, we term the 'on-shell' transformations. This identifies equivalence classes of hydrodynamic theories that provide an equally valid low-energy description of the underlying microscopic theory. We show that in any (classical) theory of hydrodynamics (at arbitrary order in derivatives), the action of such transformations on the dispersion relations and two-point correlation functions is universal. We explicitly construct invariants which can then be matched to a microscopic theory. Among them are, expectedly, the low-momentum expansions of the hydrodynamic modes. The (unphysical) gapped modes can, however, be added or removed at will. Finally, we show that such transformations assign a nilpotent Lie group to every hydrodynamic theory, and discuss the related algebraic properties underlying classical hydrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the microscopic origin of de Sitter entropy using a Lorentzian path-integral approach. We construct a Hilbert space whose states are associated with configurations of thin shells or end-of-the-world branes, with state overlaps defined by the gravitational path integral. By considering states which are indistinguishable to an observer, we find that the variance of microstate overlaps is dominated by Lorentzian wormhole topologies with conical singularities. Evaluating these overlaps, we recover the expected area law for the entropy, relating the dimension of the de Sitter Hilbert space to the area of the cosmological horizon. Extending this analysis to Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime, we show that both the cosmological and black hole horizons contribute to the total entropy. Along the way, we present an explicit construction of the shell and brane configurations and examine their compatibility with relevant consistency conditions, including the null energy condition.</description>

      <title>QFT Realization of Non-Unitary $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ WRT Invariants and Their Galois Conjugations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a field theoretic realization of the non-unitary $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev Topological Quantum Field Theory(WRT TQFT). The WRT TQFT at the principal root of unity is unitary. It is known to be realized by $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ Chern-Simons theory. However, the WRT TQFT at a non-principal root of unity is non-unitary. Its field theoretic realization has remained unclear. We propose that such a non-unitary TQFT arises from the topological twist of the 3-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-0 theory constructed by joining multiple $T[\mathrm{SU}(2)]$ theories. We construct its modular matrices and identify them with those of the WRT TQFT, establishing a concrete relation between the parameters, up to a decoupled unitary TQFT.</description>

      <title>Gauging Open EFTs from the top down</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present explicit top-down calculations of Open EFTs for gauged degrees of freedom with a focus on the effects of gauge fixing. Starting from the in-in contour with two copies of the action, we integrate out the charged matter in various $U(1)$ gauge theories to obtain the Feynman-Vernon influence functional for the photon, or, in the case of symmetry breaking, for the photon and St\"uckelberg fields. The influence functional is defined through a quantum path integral, which -- as is always the case when quantizing gauge degrees of freedom -- contains redundancies that must be eliminated via a gauge-fixing procedure. We implement the BRST formalism in this setting. The in-in boundary conditions break the two copies of BRST symmetry down to a single diagonal copy. Nevertheless the single diagonal BRST is sufficient to ensure that the influence functional is itself gauge invariant under two copies of gauge symmetries, retarded and advanced, regardless of the choice of state or symmetry-breaking phase. We clarify how this is consistent with the decoupling limit where the global advanced symmetry is generically broken by the state. We illustrate our results with several examples: a gauge field theory analogue of the Caldeira-Leggett model, spinor QED with fermions integrated out, scalar QED in a thermal state, the Abelian Higgs-Kibble model in the spontaneously broken state with the Higgs integrated out, and Abelian Higgs-Kibble model coupled to a charged bath in a symmetry-broken phase. The latter serves as an example of an open system for St\"uckelberg/Goldstone fields.</description>

      <title>Approximating Feynman Integrals Using Complete Monotonicity and Stieltjes Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce two novel numerical approaches for computing Feynman integrals based on their complete monotonicity (CM) and Stieltjes properties. The first method uses that scalar Feynman integrals are CM, meaning that all their derivatives have a fixed sign, in the Euclidean kinematic region. This imposes strong constraints on the function space. Simultaneously, these integrals obey systems of linear differential equations with respect to kinematic parameters. By imposing that the solutions to these differential equations satisfy complete monotonicity across the Euclidean region, we develop an efficient and highly constraining numerical bootstrap method. We provide a proof of principle of the power of our approach by applying it to a class of multi-loop Feynman integrals with internal masses. The second method is based on a refinement of CM. We prove that Feynman integrals, within a certain range of parameters, such as dimension and propagator exponents, are not only CM but in fact Stieltjes functions. The latter can be described efficiently by Pad\'e approximants that are known to converge in the cut complex plane. This means that these representations are valid also in analytically continued kinematics, such as physical scattering regions. These insights allow us to obtain rational approximations to Feynman integrals from minimal information, such as a Taylor expansion about a soft limit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by applying it to a 20-loop banana-type Feynman integral. Finally, we comment on a number of extensions of these novel avenues for computing Feynman integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Are duality transformations symmetries of string theory? For AdS space-time the answer is no for generic asymptotic values of the moduli, since the duality symmetry is broken explicitly in the dual conformal field theory. In contrast, in string theory in flat space-time, monodromy around codimension two exotic branes show that duality transformations are spontaneously broken discrete gauge symmetries with observable consequences, provided macroscopic loops of these branes are not hidden behind an event horizon. We discuss how this can be achieved and how the situation in flat space-time differs from that in AdS space-time. We also discuss observability of codimension two non-BPS branes and codimension one BPS and non-BPS branes.</description>

      <title>Twisted Cherednik systems and non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider eigenfunctions of many-body system Hamiltonians associated with generalized (a-twisted) Cherednik operators used in construction of other Hamiltonians: those arising from commutative subalgebras of the Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) algebra. The simplest example of these eigenfunctions is provided by non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials, while generally they are constructed basing on the ground state eigenfunction coinciding with the twisted Baker-Akhiezer function being a peculiar (symmetric) eigenfunction of the DIM Hamiltonians. Moreover, the eigenfunctions admit an expansion with universal coefficients so that the dependence on the twist $a$ is hidden only in these ground state eigenfunctions, and we suggest a general formula that allows one to construct these eigenfunctions from non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials. This gives a new twist in theory of integrable systems, which usually puts an accent on symmetric polynomials, and provides a new dimension to the {\it triad} made from the symmetric Macdonald polynomials, untwisted Baker-Akhiezer functions and Noumi-Shiraishi series.</description>

      <title>More About the Spontaneous Breaking of Time Reversal in de Sitter Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is widely thought that the quantum theory of de Sitter space requires the existence of a physical observer in the static patch. What exactly is meant by an observer is unclear; it could be anything from a few photons with energy just above the Gibbons-Hawking temperature to a gravitationally bound cluster of galaxies. In a recent note I explained that the need for observers can arise from the spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry. This longer paper expands on the subject, filling in conceptual arguments that were implicit but not explicitly stated in the earlier paper.</description>

      <title>Massive $U(1)$ gauge field and their accompanying scalars in brane world</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In brane-world scenarios, the effective action of a massless bulk \(U(1)\) gauge field preserves gauge invariance via couplings between massive vector Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes and scalar KK modes. In this work, we extend this framework by introducing a term \((\nabla^M X_M)^2\) into the massless bulk \(U(1)\) gauge action. This modification explicitly breaks the full gauge redundancy while preserving a residual gauge symmetry both in the bulk and on the brane. In this setup, the scalar KK modes can acquire masses from the background geometry. Notably, we find that on the 5D brane, these scalar KK modes are lighter than the vector KK modes. In contrast, on the 6D brane, two types of scalar modes emerge; the mixed interactions between them give rise to oscillations among these scalar modes.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the large $N$ limit of a complex action unitary matrix model with Fisher-Hartwig singularities, motivated by QCD-inspired models with complexified potentials. We show that the model exhibits multiple ungapped phases and a single gapped phase. The phases are characterized by Fisher-Hartwig singularities in the complex plane. We show that the phase transitions are third order, with transitions between ungapped phases forbidden. We also briefly discuss the implications for the QCD phase diagram at the end.</description>

      <title>The point insertion technique and open $r$-spin theories I: moduli and orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13185v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The papers [3,1,4,10] constructed an intersection theory on the moduli space of $r$-spin disks, and proved it satisfies mirror symmetry and relations with integrable hierarchies. That theory considered only disks with a single boundary state. In this work, we initiate the study of more general $r$-spin surfaces. We define graded $r$-spin surfaces with multiple internal and boundary states, together with their moduli spaces.
  In genus zero, the disk case, we define the associated open Witten bundle and prove that it is canonically oriented relative to the moduli space. We also describe a gluing construction for moduli spaces along boundaries, show that it lifts to the Witten bundle and relative cotangent line bundles, and that the result remains canonically relatively oriented.
  We then study the genus-one cylinder case. Here foundational difficulties arise because the Witten "bundle" is no longer an orbifold vector bundle. We resolve this by removing strata with incorrect fibre dimension, obtaining an orbibundle on the complement. The gluing method extends to genus one, and we prove that the Witten bundle again admits a canonical relative orientation.
  In the sequel [20], we construct a family of $\lfloor r/2\rfloor$ intersection theories in genus-zero indexed by $\mathfrak h\in\{0,\ldots,\lfloor r/2\rfloor-1\}$, where the $\mathfrak h$-th theory has $\mathfrak h+1$ boundary states, and compute their intersection numbers. The case $\mathfrak h=0$ recovers the theory of [3,1].
  In the sequel [21], restricting to the $\mathfrak h=0$ case, we construct an intersection theory on the moduli space of $r$-spin cylinders and show that its potential yields, after a change of variables, the genus-one part of the $r$th Gelfand-Dikii wave function, proving the genus-one case of the main conjecture of [4].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11698v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Gopakumar-Vafa (GV) theory of local curves, namely, the total spaces of rank two vector bundles with canonical determinant on smooth projective curves. Under a certain genericity condition on the rank two bundles, we propose a general mechanism to compute the degree two GV invariants of local curves. In particular, we determine all the degree two GV invariants when the base curve has genus two. Combined with previous work by Bryan and Pandharipande, we obtain the GV/GW correspondence in this case. When the base curve has genus greater than two, we calculate GV invariants for some extremal genera, providing evidence for the GV/GW conjecture for curves of higher genus.</description>

      <title>Violation of non-Abelian Bianchi identity and QCD topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13434v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When Abelian monopoles due to violation of the non-Abelian Bianchi identity J{\mu}(x) condense in the vacuum, color confinement of QCD is realized by the Abelian dual Meissner effect. Moreover VNABI affects also topological features of QCD. Firstly, self-dual instantons can not be a classical solution of QCD. Secondly, the topological charge density is not expressed by a total derivative of the Chern-Simons density K{\mu}(x), but has an additional term L(x)=2Tr(J{\mu}(x)A{\mu}(x)). Thirdly, the axial U(1) anomaly is similarly modified, while keeping the Atiyah-Singer index theorem unchanged. However, if the integrated additional term $\chi=(g^2/16\pi^2)\int d^4xL(x) $ is not zero, it is not integer nor gauge invariant, so that VNABI would not be allowed in QCD. Using the Wu-Yang arguments, it is however proved that $\chi$ becomes vanishing. $\chi$ is evaluated also in the framework of Monte-Carlo simulations on SU(2) lattices in details with partial gauge fixings such as the Maximal Center gauge (MCG). When the gradient flow method is used, the term $\chi$ tends to vanish after small gradient flow time ($\tau$). The bosonic definition of the topological charge $Q_t$ and its Abelian counterpart $Q_a\equiv (g^2/16\pi^2)\int d^4x \Tr(f_{\mu\nu}f_{\mu\nu}^*)$ written by Abelian field strengths are measured also on the lattices. When $\chi$ is zero, $Q_a$=3$Q_t$ is expected theoretically.</description>

      <title>Rigorous results for timelike Liouville field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02348v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liouville field theory has long been a cornerstone of two-dimensional quantum field theory and quantum gravity, which has attracted much recent attention in the mathematics literature. Timelike Liouville field theory is a version of Liouville field theory where the kinetic term in the action appears with a negative sign, which makes it closer to a theory of quantum gravity than ordinary (spacelike) Liouville field theory. Making sense of this `wrong sign' requires a theory of Gaussian random variables with negative variance. Such a theory is developed in this paper, and is used to prove the timelike DOZZ formula for the $3$-point correlation function when the parameters satisfy the so-called `charge neutrality condition'. Expressions are derived also for the $k$-point correlation functions for all $k\ge 3$, and it is shown that these functions approach the correct semiclassical limits as the coupling constant is sent to zero</description>

      <title>Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit for static and axisymmetric spacetimes: local curvature, matter fields, and quasinormal modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07906v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the deflection of photons in the strong deflection limit within static and axisymmetric spacetimes possessing reflection symmetry. As the impact parameter approaches its critical value, the deflection angle exhibits a logarithmic divergence. This divergence is characterized by a logarithmic coefficient and a constant offset, which we express in terms of the coordinate-invariant curvature quantities evaluated at the unstable circular photon orbit. The curvature contribution is encoded in the electric part of the Weyl tensor, reflecting tidal effects, and the matter contribution is encoded in the Einstein tensor, capturing the influence of local energy and pressure. We also express these coefficients using the Newman--Penrose scalars. By exploiting the relationship between the strong deflection limit and the quasinormal modes, we derive a new expression for the quasinormal mode frequency in the eikonal limit in terms of the curvature scalars. Our results provide a unified and coordinate-invariant framework that connects observable lensing features and quasinormal modes to the local geometry and matter distribution near compact objects.</description>

      <title>Corrections of the GR eikonal limit by a class of renormalizable gravity models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, the scattering between a light scalar particle $\phi$ and a heavy scalar $\sigma$ in the eikonal limit is considered, for gravity scenarios containing higher order derivatives, such as the ones studied in \cite{stelle1}-\cite{modesto4}. It is suggested that if one of the new gravity scales introduced in the higher order action is smaller than the Planck mass, for instance of the order of $M_{GUT}\sim 10^{15}$ GeV, the functional form of the GR eikonal formulas appears changed by a factor. However, in this situation, the conditions for the eikonal approximation to hold has to be revised, this issue is analyzed in the text. The statements of the present work should be taken with a grain of salt, as the Schwarzschild radius for these polynomials theories is not yet established. The results presented here, in our opinion, are in agreement with the suppression of corrections to GR pointed out in \cite{brandhuber}, \cite{fradkin} and \cite{deser} for the Stelle gravity. The next to leading order approximation and part of the seagull diagrams are estimated. Different to the GR case, this order generically is non vanishing. An explicit regularization scheme is presented, based on Riesz and Hadamard procedures. The need of a regularization is partially expected, as the inclusion of small energy fluctuations may spoil the eikonal approximation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Equilibrium with Steady Flow and Relativistic Local Thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A relativistic self-gravitating equilibrium system with steady flow as well as spherical symmetry is discovered. The energy-momentum tensor contains the contribution of a current related to the flow and the metric tensor does an off-diagonal component to balance with the flow momentum. The presence of the off-diagonal component of the metric implies the radial motion of the reference frame, which gives rise to a problem how the relativistic effect is included in thermodynamic observables for such a general relativistic system. This problem is solved by taking an instantaneously rest frame in which geometric thermodynamic observables read as previously and giving them the special relativistic effect emerged from the inverse transformation to the original frame pointwise. The solution of the thermodynamic observables in accord with the laws of thermodynamics and the theory of relativity is presented. Finally the relativistic structure equations for the equilibrium are derived, from which the general relativistic Poisson equation as well as the heat conduction one are developed exactly.</description>

      <title>Lattice points in polytope boundaries and formal geometric quantization of singular Calabi Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the number of lattice points in the boundary of a positive integer dilate of a Delzant integral polytope is a polynomial in the dilation parameter, analogous to the Ehrhart polynomial giving the number of lattice points in a lattice polytope. We give an explicit formula for this polynomial, analogous to the formula of Khovanskii-Pukhlikov for the Ehrhart polynomial. These counting polynomials satisfy a lacunarity principle, the vanishing of alternate coefficients, quite unlike the Ehrhart polynomial. We show that formal geometric quantization of singular Calabi Yau hypersurfaces in smooth toric varieties gives this polynomial, in analogy with the relation of the Khovanskii-Pukhlikov formula to the geometric quantization of toric varieties. The Atiyah-Singer theorem for the index of the Dirac operator gives a moral argument for the lacunarity of the counting polynomial. We conjecture that similar formulas should hold for arbitrary simple integral polytope boundaries.</description>

      <title>The Dark Matter Diffused Supernova Neutrino Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider neutrinos scattering off Milky Way dark matter and the impact of this scattering on supernovae neutrinos. This can take the form of attenuation on the initial flux of neutrinos and a time-delayed flux of scattered neutrinos. Considering dark matter masses above 100 MeV and past Milky Way supernovae, we find this time-delayed flux is nearly constant in time. We call this flux the Dark Matter Diffused Supernova Neutrino Background (DMDSNB), and use Super-K limits on the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) flux to set limits on the dark matter-neutrino scattering cross section. We find $\sigma_{\rm DM-\nu}/m_{\rm DM} \lesssim 2.4 \times 10^{-24} \mathrm{cm^2}$/GeV for $m_{\rm DM} \gtrsim 1$ GeV, which is the strongest bound to date on dark matter-neutrino scatterings at MeV energies, and stronger than bounds set from SN1987A neutrino attenuation by an order of magnitude. We end by discussing how the DMDSNB could be distinguished from the DSNB.</description>

      <title>Scalar-induced gravitational waves from coherent initial states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of statistical inhomogeneity and anisotropy in primordial scalar perturbations on the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW). Assuming inflationary quantum fluctuations originate from a coherent state, the resulting primordial scalar perturbations acquire a non-zero space-dependent mean, violating statistical homogeneity, statistical isotropy, and parity. As a consequence of statistical inhomogeneities, SIGW acquires distinct scale-dependent features in its correlation function. Statistical anisotropies further lead to possible parity violation and correlation between different polarization modes in the tensor perturbations. Therefore, detection of these signatures in the stochastic gravitational wave background would offer probes to the statistical nature of primordial scalar perturbations beyond the scales accessible to CMB observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06697v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monopoles have been a subject of much theoretical and experimental research since they were proposed to symmetrize Maxwell's equations. However, no experimental signature of their existence has been detected. Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain this lack of success. In here we generalize QED to a two photon theory where the extraordinary photon and the monopole belong to the dark sector, and the ordinary photon and the electron to the non-dark sector. A mixing interaction transforms both electron and monopole into dyons generating experimental consequences for indirect and direct monopole detection which we analyze.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from $\textit{Type-I}$ Strings in a Neutrino Mass Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel realization of $\textit{type-I}$ cosmic strings arising from the spontaneous breaking of an extended gauge symmetry $SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}$ in the context of a low-scale split seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass generation. We demonstrate that the split seesaw framework, which explains the smallness of neutrino masses, naturally motivates a small scalar self-coupling $\lambda$. This intrinsically links the neutrino mass generation mechanism to the formation of $\textit{type-I}$ cosmic strings, where the gauge coupling dominates over the scalar self-coupling ($\beta\equiv\lambda/2g^2&lt;1$). We explore the cosmological implications of these strings, including their gravitational wave signatures that are testable in current and future experiments. Our findings establish a compelling and testable connection between neutrino mass generation and cosmic string phenomenology in an underexplored region of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Exotic compact objects in Einstein-scalar-Maxwell theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In k-essence theories within general relativity, where the matter Lagrangian depends on a real scalar field $\phi$ and its kinetic term $X$, static and spherically symmetric compact objects with a positive-definite energy density cannot exist without introducing ghosts. We show that this no-go theorem can be evaded when the k-essence Lagrangian is extended to include a dependence on the field strength $F$ of a $U(1)$ gauge field, taking the general form ${\cal L}(\phi, X, F)$. In Einstein-scalar-Maxwell theories with a scalar-vector coupling $\mu(\phi) F$, we demonstrate the existence of asymptotically flat, charged compact stars whose energy density and pressure vanish at the center. With an appropriate choice of the coupling function $\mu(\phi)$, we construct both electric and magnetic compact objects and derive their metric functions and scalar- and vector-field profiles analytically. We compute their masses and radii, showing that the compactness lies in the range ${\cal O}(0.01)&lt;{\cal C}&lt;{\cal O}(0.1)$. A linear perturbation analysis reveals that electric compact objects are free of strong coupling, ghost, and Laplacian instabilities at all radii for $\mu(\phi)&gt;0$, while magnetic compact objects suffer from strong coupling near the center.</description>

      <title>Quasitopological gravity and double-copy formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to the quasitopological theory of gravity based on a modified classical double--copy construction. Focusing on static, spherically symmetric configurations, we show that all vacuum solutions of $D$--dimensional quasitopological gravity can be obtained from an auxiliary non--linear electrodynamics defined in a flat $(D+1)$--dimensional spacetime. The gravitational field equations reduce to an algebraic relation between a primary curvature invariant and the electric field strength, while the remaining dynamics is governed by a Gauss--law constraint for a point--like charge in the auxiliary space. This correspondence provides a transparent interpretation of higher--curvature gravitational interactions in terms of non--linear gauge dynamics and explains the absence of higher--derivative terms in the reduced equations. As illustrative examples, we apply the formalism to Born--Infeld and Hayward--type models, obtaining higher--dimensional regular black--hole solutions with a de~Sitter--like core. Our results extend the scope of the double--copy paradigm beyond Einstein gravity and suggest a unifying framework for a broad class of higher--curvature theories.</description>

      <title>Geometric phase of exceptional point as quantum resonance in complex scaling method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian operators and exceptional points (EPs) are now routinely realized in few-mode systems such as optical resonators and superconducting qubits. However, their foundations in genuine scattering problems with unbounded Hamiltonians remain much less clear. In this work, we address how the geometric phase associated with encircling an EP should be formulated when the underlying eigenstates are quantum resonances within a one-dimensional scattering model. To do this, we employ the complex scaling method, where resonance poles of the S-matrix are realized as discrete eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian dilated Hamiltonian, to construct situations in which resonant and scattering states coalesce into an EP in the complex energy plane, that is, the resonance pole is embedded into the continuum spectrum. We analyze the self-orthogonality in the vicinity of an EP, the Berry phase, and the Chern characteristic. Our results provide a bridge between non-Hermitian spectral theory and the traditional theory of quantum resonances.</description>
