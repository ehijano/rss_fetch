      <title>Suppression of Coherent Synchrotron Radiation-Induced Emittance Growth in a Multi-Bend Deflection Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05585</link>

Abstract: Preserving beam quality during the transportation of high-brightness electron beams is a significant and widespread challenge in the design of modern accelerators. The importance of this issue stems from the fact that the quality of the beam at the accelerator's output is crucial for various applications, including particle colliders, free-electron lasers, and synchrotron radiation sources. The coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) effect can degrade beam quality when a bunch is deflected. Therefore, developing a structure that effectively suppresses the CSR effect, especially for the short bunches is critically important. This involves protecting both the transverse emittance and the longitudinal profile to ensure the production of a high-quality beam. In this study, an optimization based on the reverse lattice of the beamline is proposed. This method can simplify the optimization process. Based on this approach, the Quadruple Bend Achromat (QBA) deflection structure has been designed and optimized. Then we have derived a general solution to completely suppress the impact of steady-state CSR on the transverse plane for different topologies of QBA. Furthermore, a general condition is proposed for suppressing displacements caused by CSR in sequence drifts for isochronous structures. Simultaneously, QBA has proven to be the simplest structure that can simultaneously suppress both types of CSR effects. Simulation results for bunches with a peak current of up to $3000A$ show almost no change in transverse emittance for a large angle deflection.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of McMillan mappings I. McMillan multipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider two dynamical systems: the McMillan sextupole and octupole integrable mappings, originally proposed by Edwin McMillan. Both represent the simplest symmetric McMillan maps, characterized by a single intrinsic parameter. While these systems find numerous applications across various domains of mathematics and physics, some of their dynamical properties remain unexplored. We aim to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive description of all stable trajectories, including the parametrization of invariant curves, Poincar\'e rotation numbers, and canonical action-angle variables.
  In the second part, we establish connections between these maps and general chaotic maps in standard form. Our investigation reveals that the McMillan sextupole and octupole serve as first-order approximations of the dynamics around the fixed point, akin to the linear map and quadratic invariant (known as the Courant-Snyder invariant in accelerator physics), which represents zeroth-order approximations (referred to as linearization). Furthermore, we propose a novel formalism for nonlinear Twiss parameters, which accounts for the dependence of rotation number on amplitude. This stands in contrast to conventional betatron phase advance used in accelerator physics, which remains independent of amplitude. Notably, in the context of accelerator physics, this new formalism demonstrates its capability in predicting dynamical aperture around low-order resonances for flat beams, a critical aspect in beam injection/extraction scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of McMillan mappings II. Axially symmetric map</title>

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the transverse dynamics of a single particle in a model integrable accelerator lattice, based on a McMillan axially-symmetric electron lens. Although the McMillan e-lens has been considered as a device potentially capable of mitigating collective space charge forces, some of its fundamental properties have not been described yet. The main goal of our work is to close this gap and understand the limitations and potentials of this device. It is worth mentioning that the McMillan axially symmetric map provides the first-order approximations of dynamics for a general linear lattice plus an arbitrary thin lens with motion separable in polar coordinates. Therefore, advancements in its understanding should give us a better picture of more generic and not necessarily integrable round beams. In the first part of the article, we classify all possible regimes with stable trajectories and find the canonical action-angle variables. This provides an evaluation of the dynamical aperture, Poincar\'e rotation numbers as functions of amplitudes, and thus determines the spread in nonlinear tunes. Also, we provide a parameterization of invariant curves, allowing for the immediate determination of the map image forward and backward in time. The second part investigates the particle dynamics as a function of system parameters. We show that there are three fundamentally different configurations of the accelerator optics causing different regimes of nonlinear oscillations. Each regime is considered in great detail, including the limiting cases of large and small amplitudes. In addition, we analyze the dynamics in Cartesian coordinates and provide a description of observable variables and corresponding spectra.</description>
