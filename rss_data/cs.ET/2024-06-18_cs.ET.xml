      <title>Beyond Diagonal RIS for 6G Non-Terrestrial Networks: Potentials and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising technology in both terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) due to its ability to manipulate wireless environments for better connectivity. Significant studies have been focused on conventional RIS with diagonal phase response matrices. This simple RIS architecture, though less expensive, has limited flexibility in engineering the wireless channels. As the latest member of RIS technology, beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has recently been proposed in terrestrial setups. Due to the interconnected phase response elements, BD-RIS significantly enhances the control over the wireless environment. This work proposes the potential and challenges of BD-RIS in NTNs. We begin with the motivation and recent advances in BD-RIS. Subsequently, we discuss the fundamentals of BD-RIS and NTNs. We then outline the application of BD-RIS in NTNs, followed by a case study on BD-RIS enabled non-orthogonal multiple access low earth orbit satellite communication. Finally, we highlight challenges and research directions with concluding remarks.</description>

      <title>Mycorrhizal Fungi and Plant Symbiosis for Energy Harvesting in the Internet of Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological entities in nature have developed sophisticated communication methods over millennia to facilitate cooperation. Among these entities, plants are some of the most intricate communicators. They interact with each other through various communication modalities, creating networks that enable the exchange of information and nutrients. In this paper, we explore this collective behavior and its components. We then introduce the concept of agent plants, outlining their architecture and detailing the tasks of each unit. Additionally, we investigate the mycorrhizal fungi-plant symbiosis to extract glucose for energy harvesting. We propose an architecture that converts the chemical energy stored in these glucose molecules into electrical energy. We conduct comprehensive analyses of the proposed architecture to validate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Towards augmented data quality management: Automation of Data Quality Rule Definition in Data Warehouses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the contemporary data-driven landscape, ensuring data quality (DQ) is crucial for deriving actionable insights from vast data repositories. The objective of this study is to explore the potential for automating data quality management within data warehouses as data repository commonly used by large organizations. By conducting a systematic review of existing DQ tools available in the market and academic literature, the study assesses their capability to automatically detect and enforce data quality rules. The review encompassed 151 tools from various sources, revealing that most current tools focus on data cleansing and fixing in domain-specific databases rather than data warehouses. Only a limited number of tools, specifically ten, demonstrated the capability to detect DQ rules, not to mention implementing this in data warehouses. The findings underscore a significant gap in the market and academic research regarding AI-augmented DQ rule detection in data warehouses. This paper advocates for further development in this area to enhance the efficiency of DQ management processes, reduce human workload, and lower costs. The study highlights the necessity of advanced tools for automated DQ rule detection, paving the way for improved practices in data quality management tailored to data warehouse environments. The study can guide organizations in selecting data quality tool that would meet their requirements most.</description>

      <title>Simon's algorithm in the NISQ cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simon's algorithm was one of the first problems to demonstrate a genuine quantum advantage. The algorithm, however, assumes access to noise-free qubits. In our work we use Simon's algorithm to benchmark the error rates of devices currently available in the "quantum cloud." As a main result we obtain an objective comparison between the different physical platforms made available by IBM and IonQ. Our study highlights the importance of understanding the device architectures and chip topologies when transpiling quantum algorithms onto hardware. For instance, we demonstrate that two-qubit operations on spatially separated qubits on superconducting chips should be avoided.</description>

      <title>L0-regularized compressed sensing with Mean-field Coherent Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent Ising Machine (CIM) is a network of optical parametric oscillators that solves combinatorial optimization problems by finding the ground state of an Ising Hamiltonian. As a practical application of CIM, Aonishi et al. proposed a quantum-classical hybrid system to solve optimization problems of L0-regularization-based compressed sensing (L0RBCS). Gunathilaka et al. has further enhanced the accuracy of the system. However, the computationally expensive CIM's stochastic differential equations (SDEs) limit the use of digital hardware implementations. As an alternative to Gunathilaka et al.'s CIM SDEs used previously, we propose using the mean-field CIM (MF-CIM) model, which is a physics-inspired heuristic solver without quantum noise. MF-CIM surmounts the high computational cost due to the simple nature of the differential equations (DEs). Furthermore, our results indicate that the proposed model has similar performance to physically accurate SDEs in both artificial and magnetic resonance imaging data, paving the way for implementing CIM-based L0RBCS on digital hardware such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).</description>
