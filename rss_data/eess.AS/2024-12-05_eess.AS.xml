      <title>Analytic Study of Text-Free Speech Synthesis for Raw Audio using a Self-Supervised Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the text-free speech representations of raw audio obtained from a self-supervised learning (SSL) model by analyzing the synthesized speech using the SSL representations instead of conventional text representations. Since raw audio does not have paired speech representations as transcribed texts do, obtaining speech representations from unpaired speech is crucial for augmenting available datasets for speech synthesis. Specifically, the proposed speech synthesis is conducted using discrete symbol representations from the SSL model in comparison with text representations, and analytical examinations of the synthesized speech have been carried out. The results empirically show that using text representations is advantageous for preserving semantic information, while using discrete symbol representations is superior for preserving acoustic content, including prosodic and intonational information.</description>

      <title>ASR-EC Benchmark: Evaluating Large Language Models on Chinese ASR Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic speech Recognition (ASR) is a fundamental and important task in the field of speech and natural language processing. It is an inherent building block in many applications such as voice assistant, speech translation, etc. Despite the advancement of ASR technologies in recent years, it is still inevitable for modern ASR systems to have a substantial number of erroneous recognition due to environmental noise, ambiguity, etc. Therefore, the error correction in ASR is crucial.
  Motivated by this, this paper studies ASR error correction in the Chinese language, which is one of the most popular languages and enjoys a large number of users in the world. We first create a benchmark dataset named \emph{ASR-EC} that contains a wide spectrum of ASR errors generated by industry-grade ASR systems. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first Chinese ASR error correction benchmark. Then, inspired by the recent advances in \emph{large language models (LLMs)}, we investigate how to harness the power of LLMs to correct ASR errors. We apply LLMs to ASR error correction in three paradigms. The first paradigm is prompting, which is further categorized as zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-step. The second paradigm is finetuning, which finetunes LLMs with ASR error correction data. The third paradigm is multi-modal augmentation, which collectively utilizes the audio and ASR transcripts for error correction. Extensive experiments reveal that prompting is not effective for ASR error correction. Finetuning is effective only for a portion of LLMs. Multi-modal augmentation is the most effective method for error correction and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Detecting abnormal heart sound using mobile phones and on-device IConNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the global prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, there is a pressing need for easily accessible early screening methods. Typically, this requires medical practitioners to investigate heart auscultations for irregular sounds, followed by echocardiography and electrocardiography tests. To democratize early diagnosis, we present a user-friendly solution for abnormal heart sound detection, utilizing mobile phones and a lightweight neural network optimized for on-device inference. Unlike previous approaches reliant on specialized stethoscopes, our method directly analyzes audio recordings, facilitated by a novel architecture known as IConNet. IConNet, an Interpretable Convolutional Neural Network, harnesses insights from audio signal processing, enhancing efficiency and providing transparency in neural pattern extraction from raw waveform signals. This is a significant step towards trustworthy AI in healthcare, aiding in remote health monitoring efforts.</description>

      <title>Exploring trends in audio mixes and masters: Insights from a dataset analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of a dataset of audio metrics and aesthetic considerations about mixes and masters provided by the web platform MixCheck studio. The platform is designed for educational purposes, primarily targeting amateur music producers, and aimed at analysing their recordings prior to them being released. The analysis focuses on the following data points: integrated loudness, mono compatibility, presence of clipping and phase issues, compression and tonal profile across 30 user-specified genres. Both mixed (mixes) and mastered audio (masters) are included in the analysis, where mixes refer to the initial combination and balance of individual tracks, and masters refer to the final refined version optimized for distribution. Results show that loudness-related issues along with dynamics issues are the most prevalent, particularly in mastered audio. However mastered audio presents better results in compression than just mixed audio. Additionally, results show that mastered audio has a lower percentage of stereo field and phase issues.</description>

      <title>DiffStyleTTS: Diffusion-based Hierarchical Prosody Modeling for Text-to-Speech with Diverse and Controllable Styles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human speech exhibits rich and flexible prosodic variations. To address the one-to-many mapping problem from text to prosody in a reasonable and flexible manner, we propose DiffStyleTTS, a multi-speaker acoustic model based on a conditional diffusion module and an improved classifier-free guidance, which hierarchically models speech prosodic features, and controls different prosodic styles to guide prosody prediction. Experiments show that our method outperforms all baselines in naturalness and achieves superior synthesis speed compared to three diffusion-based baselines. Additionally, by adjusting the guiding scale, DiffStyleTTS effectively controls the guidance intensity of the synthetic prosody.</description>

      <title>EMOVOME: A Dataset for Emotion Recognition in Spontaneous Real-Life Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous datasets for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) are scarce and frequently derived from laboratory environments or staged scenarios, such as TV shows, limiting their application in real-world contexts. We developed and publicly released the Emotional Voice Messages (EMOVOME) dataset, including 999 voice messages from real conversations of 100 Spanish speakers on a messaging app, labeled in continuous and discrete emotions by expert and non-expert annotators. We evaluated speaker-independent SER models using acoustic features as baseline and transformer-based models. We compared the results with reference datasets including acted and elicited speech, and analyzed the influence of annotators and gender fairness. The pre-trained UniSpeech-SAT-Large model achieved the highest results, 61.64% and 55.57% Unweighted Accuracy (UA) for 3-class valence and arousal prediction respectively on EMOVOME, a 10% improvement over baseline models. For the emotion categories, 42.58% UA was obtained. EMOVOME performed lower than the acted RAVDESS dataset. The elicited IEMOCAP dataset also outperformed EMOVOME in predicting emotion categories, while similar results were obtained in valence and arousal. EMOVOME outcomes varied with annotator labels, showing better results and fairness when combining expert and non-expert annotations. This study highlights the gap between controlled and real-life scenarios, supporting further advancements in recognizing genuine emotions.</description>

      <title>Debatts: Zero-Shot Debating Text-to-Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In debating, rebuttal is one of the most critical stages, where a speaker addresses the arguments presented by the opposing side. During this process, the speaker synthesizes their own persuasive articulation given the context from the opposing side. This work proposes a novel zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis system for rebuttal, namely Debatts. Debatts takes two speech prompts, one from the opposing side (i.e. opponent) and one from the speaker. The prompt from the opponent is supposed to provide debating style prosody, and the prompt from the speaker provides identity information. In particular, we pretrain the Debatts system from in-the-wild dataset, and integrate an additional reference encoder to take debating prompt for style. In addition, we also create a debating dataset to develop Debatts. In this setting, Debatts can generate a debating-style speech in rebuttal for any voices. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system in comparison with the classic zero-shot TTS systems.</description>

      <title>Resource-Efficient Reference-Free Evaluation of Audio Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To establish the trustworthiness of systems that automatically generate text captions for audio, images and video, existing reference-free metrics rely on large pretrained models which are impractical to accommodate in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose some metrics to elicit the model's confidence in its own generation. To assess how well these metrics replace correctness measures that leverage reference captions, we test their calibration with correctness measures. We discuss why some of these confidence metrics align better with certain correctness measures. Further, we provide insight into why temperature scaling of confidence metrics is effective. Our main contribution is a suite of well-calibrated lightweight confidence metrics for reference-free evaluation of captions in resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>Dialectal Coverage And Generalization in Arabic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for Arabic, a language characterized by its rich dialectal diversity and often considered a low-resource language in speech technology, demands effective strategies to manage its complexity. This study explores three critical factors influencing ASR performance: the role of dialectal coverage in pre-training, the effectiveness of dialect-specific fine-tuning compared to a multi-dialectal approach, and the ability to generalize to unseen dialects. Through extensive experiments across different dialect combinations, our findings offer key insights towards advancing the development of ASR systems for pluricentric languages like Arabic.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of LLM-based ASR and Whisper in Low Resource and Code Switching Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased exceptional performance across diverse NLP tasks, and their integration with speech encoder is rapidly emerging as a dominant trend in the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) field. Previous works mainly concentrated on leveraging LLMs for speech recognition in English and Chinese. However, their potential for addressing speech recognition challenges in low resource settings remains underexplored. Hence, in this work, we aim to explore the capability of LLMs in low resource ASR and Mandarin-English code switching ASR. We also evaluate and compare the recognition performance of LLM-based ASR systems against Whisper model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLM-based ASR yields a relative gain of 12.8\% over the Whisper model in low resource ASR while Whisper performs better in Mandarin-English code switching ASR. We hope that this study could shed light on ASR for low resource scenarios.</description>
