      <title>Tracking and Distinguishing Slime Mold Solutions to the Traveling Salesman Problem through Synchronized Amplification in the Non-Equilibrium Steady State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The plasmodium of the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum serves as a platform to study information processing in non-equilibrium active matter, showing complex oscillations and computation despite its simple morphology. Past experiments used Physarum's shape changes and photoavoidance in a stellate chip to find approximate solutions to the traveling salesman problem (TSP) for up to eight cities in linear time. To solve the $N$-city TSP, the organism elongated and withdrew its $N^2$ branches within the chip lanes, where an optical feedback loop controlled by a modified Hopfield neural network selectively illuminated certain lanes to trigger retraction of $N(N-1)$ branches. When the modified Hopfield network stabilizes the illumination pattern, the organism reaches a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS), where $N$ extended branches form a valid TSP solution. The illumination pattern induces a clear split between two distinct lane groups. Fourier and power spectral density analyses reveal that in NESS, the solution lanes exhibit lower frequency, larger-amplitude oscillations, an enhancement of these signals compared to the higher-frequency, smaller-amplitude fluctuations in the non-solution lanes. This frequency downconversion and amplification in power density is a hallmark of a Fr\"ohlich condensate. Synchronization indices for Physarum-selected solution lanes in the NESS exhibit maximum $S\sim1$, while non-solution lanes reach minimum $S$-a consistent trend across problem sizes and tour lengths. Amoeba-inspired algorithms that leverage noise to accelerate TSP convergence make trade-offs between solution quality and speed, showing up to $\sqrt N$ scaling in iterations, akin to quantum algorithms like Grover's search. By tuning power density, frequency shifts, and synchronization, it may be possible to improve the quality and efficiency of TSP solutions from Physarum-based biocomputers.</description>

      <title>Thermal Lensing Effects in Two-Photon Light-Sheet Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM), the axial resolution is governed by the illumination beam profile, motivating the development of advanced beam-shaping techniques to enhance imaging performance. Two-photon LSFM (2P-LSFM), in particular, improves the signal-to-background ratio by reducing laser scattering and distortion in biological specimens. However, we report a potentially detrimental thermal effect in 2P-LSFM: the high laser powers required for two-photon excitation induce localized heating, which alters the refractive index of the medium and effectively forms a divergent thermal lens in water. At 500 mW the light-sheet waist broadens by 25% and shifts by 300 $\mu$m before stabilizing several seconds after the laser shutter is opened. Both experiments and simulations reveal that this thermal lensing effect scales with laser power and the path length the beam travels through water. The resulting degradation in resolution and signal-to-noise ratio may compromise imaging applications that require high laser powers for rapid volumetric imaging of large specimens or functional brain imaging. This limitation is particularly critical in dynamic sample environments, such as during stepwise repositioning or flow-based delivery of chemical or hydrodynamic sensory stimuli, where changes occur on timescales comparable to the thermal settling time.</description>

      <title>The strain-stiffening critical exponents in polymer networks and their universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered athermal biopolymer materials, such as collagen networks that constitute a major component in extracellular matrices and various connective tissues, are initially soft and compliant but stiffen dramatically under strain. Such network materials are topologically sub-isostatic and feature strong rigidity scale separation between the bending and stretching response of the constituent polymer fibers. Recently, a comprehensive scaling theory of the athermal strain-stiffening phase transition has been developed, providing predictions for all critical exponents characterising the transition in terms of the distance to the critical strain and of the small rigidity scales ratio. Here, we employ large-scale computer simulations, at and away from criticality, to test the analytic predictions. We find that all numerical critical exponents are in quantitative agreement with the analytically-predicted ones. Moreover, we find that all predicted exponents remain valid whether the driving strain is shear, i.e., volume-preserving, or dilation, and independent of the degree of the network's sub-isostaticity, thus establishing the universality of the strain-stiffening phase transition with respect to the symmetry of the driving strain and the network's topology.</description>

      <title>Behavior of the scaling correlation functions under severe subsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scale-invariance is a ubiquitous observation in the dynamics of large distributed complex systems. The computation of its scaling exponents, which provide clues on its origin, is often hampered by the limited available sampling data, making an appropriate mathematical description a challenge. This work investigates the behavior of correlation functions in fractal systems under conditions of severe subsampling. Analytical and numerical results reveal a striking robustness: the correlation functions continue to capture the expected scaling exponents despite substantial data reduction. This behavior is demonstrated numerically for the random 2-D Cantor set and the Sierpinski gasket, both consistent with exact analytical predictions. Similar robustness is observed in 1-D time series both synthetic and experimental, as well as in high-resolution images of a neuronal structure. Overall, these findings are broadly relevant for the structural characterization of biological systems under realistic sampling constraints.</description>

      <title>Transfer of active motion from medium to probe via the induced friction and noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can activity be transmitted from smaller to larger scales? We report on such a transfer from a homogeneous active medium to a Newtonian spherical probe. The active medium consists of faster and dilute self-propelled particles, modeled as run-and-tumble particles in 1D or as active Brownian particles in 2D. We derive the reduced fluctuating dynamics of the probe valid for arbitrary probe velocity, characterized by a nonlinear friction and a velocity-dependent noise. There appear several distinct regimes: a standard regime where the probe exhibits passive Brownian motion, and peculiar active regimes where the probe becomes self-propelled with high persistence, and its velocity distribution begets peaks at nonzero values. The resulting propulsion speeds and their persistence are quantitatively obtained and are confirmed by numerical simulations of the joint probe-medium system. The emergence of active regimes depends not only on the far-from-equilibrium nature of the medium but also on the probe-medium coupling. In 1D, a soft coupling is necessary, whereas in 2D, more realistic interactions, such as Lennard-Jones, suffice. Our findings thus reveal how, solely via the induced friction and noise, persistence can cross different scales to transfer active motion.</description>

      <title>Topological defects in polar active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polar active matter - including animal herds, aggregates of motile cells and active colloids - often forms coordinated migration patterns, such as flocking. This orderly motion can be disrupted by full-integer topological defects representing localized disturbances where polar alignment is lost. Such polar defects can serve as key organizing centers across scales, sustaining collective behavior, such as swirling motion and other large-scale coherent states. While significant progress in understanding active matter principles have been made in recent years, a quantitative understanding of how topological defects influence active polar matter is needed. We present a brief overview of recent experimental observations in synthetic active colloids and various biological systems. We describe how polar defects mediate dynamical transitions and contribute to the spontaneous emergence of large-scale coherent states. We also discuss theoretical advancements in physical modeling of coupled processes involving polar defects and collective behavior in active polar matter.</description>

      <title>Self-organized homogenization of flow networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the vasculature of animals to the porous media making up batteries, the core task of flow networks is to transport solutes and perfuse all cells or media equally with resources. Yet, living flow networks have a key advantage over porous media: they are adaptive and self-organize their geometry for homogeneous perfusion throughout the network. Here, we show that also artificial flow networks can self-organize toward homogeneous perfusion by the versatile adaption of controlled erosion. Flowing a pulse of cleaving enzyme through a network patterned into an erodible hydrogel, with initial channels disparate in width, we observe a homogenization in channel resistances. Experimental observations are matched with numerical simulations of the diffusion-advection-sorption dynamics of an eroding enzyme within a network. Analyzing transport dynamics theoretically, we show that homogenization only occurs if the pulse of the eroding enzyme lasts longer than the time it takes any channel to equilibrate to the pulse concentration. The equilibration time scale derived analytically is in agreement with simulations. Lastly, we show both numerically and experimentally that erosion leads to the homogenization of complex networks containing loops. Erosion being an omnipresent reaction, our results pave the way for a very versatile self-organized increase in the performance of porous media.</description>

      <title>Modelling floral and arthropod electrostatics using a two-domain AAA-least squares algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relationships between plants and insects vitally underpin the health of global ecosystems and food production. Through co-evolution, insects have acquired a variety of senses in response to the emergence of floral cues such as scent, colour and shape. Therefore, the recent discovery of electroreception among terrestrial arthropods motivates the investigation of floral electrics as part of their wider sensory ecology. We examine how a flower's morphology and material properties produce and propagate detectable, ecologically relevant electrical signals in several biologically inspired scenarios. As the electrical field both interior and exterior to the flower must be solved for, we develop an extension of the two-dimensional AAA-least squares algorithm for solving such two-domain electrostatics problems. It is found that the electrical signals produced by the plant can reveal information to the insect about the flower shape, available pollen and the presence of other nearby arthropods. These results show good qualitative agreement with an equivalent three-dimensional scenario, computed using finite element methods. The extension of the AAA-least squares algorithm to two-domain problems provides a fast and accurate method for modelling electrostatic problems, with possible further application in fluid dynamics and magnetostatics. Biologically, our results highlight the significant role floral electrics may play in plant-pollinator and predator-prey relationships, unveiling previously unstudied facets of these key relationships.</description>

      <title>Enzyme as Maxwell's Demon: Steady-state Deviation from Chemical Equilibrium by Enhanced Enzyme Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhanced enzyme diffusion (EED), in which the diffusion coefficient of an enzyme transiently increases during catalysis, has been extensively reported experimentally. We numerically and analytically demonstrate that such enzymes can act as Maxwell's demons. They use their enhanced diffusion as a memory of the previous catalytic reaction, to gain information and drive steady-state chemical concentrations away from chemical equilibrium. Our theoretical analysis identifies the conditions for this process, highlighting the functional role of EED and its relevance to cellular systems.</description>

      <title>Phase Separation on Deformable Membranes: interplay of mechanical coupling and dynamic surface geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The self-organization of proteins into enriched compartments and the formation of complex patterns are crucial processes for life on the cellular level. Liquid-liquid phase separation is one mechanism for forming such enriched compartments. When phase-separating proteins are membrane-bound and locally disturb it, the mechanical response of the membrane mediates interactions between these proteins. How these membrane-mediated interactions influence the steady state of the protein density distribution is thus an important question to investigate in order to understand the rich diversity of protein and membrane-shape patterns present at the cellular level. This work starts with a widely used model for membrane-bound phase-separating proteins. We numerically solve our system to map out its phase space and perform a careful, systematic expansion of the model equations to characterize the phase transitions through linear stability analysis and free energy arguments. We observe that the membrane-mediated interactions, due to their long-range nature, are capable of qualitatively altering the equilibrium state of the proteins. This leads to arrested coarsening and length-scale selection instead of simple demixing and complete coarsening. In this study, we unambiguously show that long-range membrane-mediated interactions lead to pattern formation in a system that otherwise would not do so. This work provides a basis for further systematic study of membrane-bound pattern-forming systems.</description>
