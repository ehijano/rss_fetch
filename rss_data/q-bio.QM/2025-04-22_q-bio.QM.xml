      <title>Association between nutritional factors, inflammatory biomarkers and cancer types: an analysis of NHANES data using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background. Diet and inflammation are critical factors influencing cancer risk. However, the combined impact of nutritional status and inflammatory biomarkers on cancer status and type, using machine learning (ML), remains underexplored.
  Objectives. This study investigates the association between nutritional factors, inflammatory biomarkers, and cancer status, and whether these relationships differ across cancer types using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data.
  Methods. We analyzed 24 macro- and micronutrients, C-reactive protein (CRP), and the advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI) in 26,409 NHANES participants (2,120 with cancer). Multivariable logistic regression assessed associations with cancer prevalence. We also examined whether these features differed across the five most common cancer types. To evaluate predictive value, we applied three ML models - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost - on the full feature set.
  Results. The cohort's mean age was 49.1 years; 34.7% were obese. Comorbidities such as anemia and liver conditions, along with nutritional factors like protein and several vitamins, were key predictors of cancer status. Among the models, Random Forest performed best, achieving an accuracy of 0.72.
  Conclusions. Higher-quality nutritional intake and lower levels of inflammation may offer protective effects against cancer. These findings highlight the potential of combining nutritional and inflammatory markers with ML to inform cancer prevention strategies.</description>

      <title>Simulating biochemical reactions: The Linear Noise Approximation can capture non-linear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a plethora of highly stochastic non-linear dynamical systems in fields such as molecular biology, chemistry, epidemiology, and ecology. Yet, none of the currently available stochastic models are both accurate and computationally efficient for long-term predictions of large systems. The Linear Noise Approximation (LNA) model for biochemical reaction networks is analytically tractable, which makes it computationally efficient for simulation, analysis, and inference. However, it is only accurate for linear systems and short-time transitions. Other methods can achieve greater accuracy across a wider range of systems, including non-linear ones, but lack analytical tractability. This paper seeks to challenge the prevailing view by demonstrating that the Linear Noise Approximation can indeed capture non-linear dynamics after certain modifications. We introduce a new framework that utilises centre manifold theory allowing us to identify simple interventions to the LNA that do not significantly compromise its computational efficiency. We develop specific algorithms for systems that exhibit oscillations or bi-stability and demonstrate their accuracy and computational efficiency across multiple examples.</description>

      <title>VoxLogicA UI: Supporting Declarative Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Master's Thesis in Computer Science dives into the design and creation of a user-friendly interface for VoxLogicA, an image analysis tool using spatial model checking with a focus on neuroimaging. The research tackles the problem of existing tools being too complex, which makes them hard for medical professionals and researchers to use. By using spatial logic, the goal is to make these powerful analytical tools more practical and accessible in real-world clinical settings. The main objectives are to design a modern web interface that's easy to use, build it with the latest web technologies (e.g. Svelte and Niivue), and test its effectiveness through user studies and real-world case analyses.</description>

      <title>Transforming hyperspectral images into chemical maps: A new deep learning based approach to hyperspectral image processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current approaches to chemical map generation from hyperspectral images are based on models such as partial least squares (PLS) regression, generating pixel-wise predictions that do not consider spatial context and suffer from a high degree of noise. This study proposes an end-to-end deep learning approach using a modified version of U-Net and a custom loss function to directly obtain chemical maps from hyperspectral images, skipping all intermediate steps required for traditional pixel-wise analysis. We compare the U-Net with the traditional PLS regression on a real dataset of pork belly samples with associated mean fat reference values. The U-Net obtains a test set root mean squared error of between 9% and 13% lower than that of PLS regression on the task of mean fat prediction. At the same time, U-Net generates fine detail chemical maps where 99.91% of the variance is spatially correlated. Conversely, only 2.53% of the variance in the PLS-generated chemical maps is spatially correlated, indicating that each pixel-wise prediction is largely independent of neighboring pixels. Additionally, while the PLS-generated chemical maps contain predictions far beyond the physically possible range of 0-100%, U-Net learns to stay inside this range. Thus, the findings of this study indicate that U-Net is superior to PLS for chemical map generation.</description>

      <title>Integrating Single-Cell Foundation Models with Graph Neural Networks for Drug Response Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose an innovative methodology for predicting Cancer Drug Response (CDR) through the integration of the scGPT foundation model within the DeepCDR model. Our approach utilizes scGPT to generate embeddings from gene expression data, which are then used as gene expression input data for DeepCDR. The experimental findings demonstrate the efficacy of this scGPT-based method in outperforming previous related works, including the original DeepCDR model and the scFoundation-based model. This study highlights the potential of scGPT embeddings to enhance the accuracy of CDR predictions and offers a promising alternative to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>ChronoRoot 2.0: An Open AI-Powered Platform for 2D Temporal Plant Phenotyping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of plant developmental plasticity, including root system architecture, is fundamental to understanding plant adaptability and development, particularly in the context of climate change and agricultural sustainability. While significant advances have been made in plant phenotyping technologies, comprehensive temporal analysis of root development remains challenging, with most existing solutions providing either limited throughput or restricted structural analysis capabilities. Here, we present ChronoRoot 2.0, an integrated open-source platform that combines affordable hardware with advanced artificial intelligence to enable sophisticated temporal plant phenotyping. The system introduces several major advances, offering an integral perspective of seedling development: (i) simultaneous multi-organ tracking of six distinct plant structures, (ii) quality control through real-time validation, (iii) comprehensive architectural measurements including novel gravitropic response parameters, and (iv) dual specialized user interfaces for both architectural analysis and high-throughput screening. We demonstrate the system's capabilities through three use cases for Arabidopsis thaliana: characterization of circadian growth patterns under different light conditions, detailed analysis of gravitropic responses in transgenic plants, and high-throughput screening of etiolation responses across multiple genotypes. ChronoRoot 2.0 maintains its predecessor's advantages of low cost and modularity while significantly expanding its capabilities, making sophisticated temporal phenotyping more accessible to the broader plant science community. The system's open-source nature, combined with extensive documentation and containerized deployment options, ensures reproducibility and enables community-driven development of new analytical capabilities.</description>

      <title>Automated detection of gibbon calls from passive acoustic monitoring data using convolutional neural networks in the "torch for R" ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated detection of acoustic signals is crucial for effective monitoring of sound-producing animals and their habitats across ecologically relevant spatial and temporal scales. Recent advances in deep learning have made these approaches more accessible. However, few deep learning approaches can be implemented natively in the R programming environment; approaches that run natively in R may be more accessible for ecologists. The "torch for R" ecosystem has made deep learning with convolutional neural networks accessible for R users. Here, we evaluate a workflow for the automated detection and classification of acoustic signals from passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data. Our specific goals include: 1) present a method for automated detection of gibbon calls from PAM data using the "torch for R" ecosystem; 2) conduct a series of benchmarking experiments and compare the results of six CNN architectures; and 3) investigate how well the different architectures perform on datasets of the female calls from two different gibbon species: the northern grey gibbon (Hylobates funereus) and the southern yellow-cheeked crested gibbon (Nomascus gabriellae). We found that the highest-performing architecture depended on the species and test dataset. We successfully deployed the top-performing model for each gibbon species to investigate spatial variation in gibbon calling behavior across two grids of autonomous recording units in Danum Valley Conservation Area, Malaysia and Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary, Cambodia. The fields of deep learning and automated detection are rapidly evolving, and we provide the methods and datasets as benchmarks for future work.</description>

      <title>Modelling the effect of antibody depletion on dose-response behavior for common immunostaining protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antibody binding properties for immunostaining applications are often characterized by dose-response curves, which describe the amount of bound antibodies as a function of the antibody concentration applied at the beginning of the experiment. A common model for the dose-response curve is the Langmuir isotherm, which assumes an equilibrium between the binding and unbinding of antibodies. However, for common immunostaining protocols, the equilibrium assumption is violated, and the dose-response behavior is governed by an accumulation of permanently bound antibodies. Assuming a constant antibody concentration, the resulting accumulation model can easily be solved analytically. However, in many experimental setups the overall amount of antibodies is fixed, such that antibody binding reduces the concentration of free antibodies. Solving the corresponding depletion accumulation model is more difficult and seems to be impossible for heterogeneous epitope landscapes. In this paper, we first solve the depletion-free accumulation model analytically for a homogeneous epitope landscape. From the obtained solution, we derive inequalities between the depletion-free accumulation model, the depletion accumulation model, and the Langmuir isotherm. This allows us to characterize the depletion effect for homogeneous epitope landscapes. Next, we generalize the problem to heterogeneous epitope landscapes, where we prove the existence and uniqueness of a solution that behaves as expected from the experimental setting. These natural properties define bounds for the depletion accumulation model. We conclude this paper by applying the bounds to characterize the depletion effect for heterogeneous epitope landscapes.</description>

      <title>Beyond Sequence: Impact of Geometric Context for RNA Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of RNA properties, such as stability and interactions, is crucial for advancing our understanding of biological processes and developing RNA-based therapeutics. RNA structures can be represented as 1D sequences, 2D topological graphs, or 3D all-atom models, each offering different insights into its function. Existing works predominantly focus on 1D sequence-based models, which overlook the geometric context provided by 2D and 3D geometries. This study presents the first systematic evaluation of incorporating explicit 2D and 3D geometric information into RNA property prediction, considering not only performance but also real-world challenges such as limited data availability, partial labeling, sequencing noise, and computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce a newly curated set of RNA datasets with enhanced 2D and 3D structural annotations, providing a resource for model evaluation on RNA data. Our findings reveal that models with explicit geometry encoding generally outperform sequence-based models, with an average prediction RMSE reduction of around 12% across all various RNA tasks and excelling in low-data and partial labeling regimes, underscoring the value of explicitly incorporating geometric context. On the other hand, geometry-unaware sequence-based models are more robust under sequencing noise but often require around $2-5\times$ training data to match the performance of geometry-aware models. Our study offers further insights into the trade-offs between different RNA representations in practical applications and addresses a significant gap in evaluating deep learning models for RNA tasks.</description>

      <title>A compact model of Escherichia coli core and biosynthetic metabolism</title>

Abstract: Metabolic models condense biochemical knowledge about organisms in a structured and standardised way. As large-scale network reconstructions are readily available for many organisms, genome-scale models are being widely used among modellers and engineers. However, these large models can be difficult to analyse and visualise and occasionally generate predictions that are hard to interpret or even biologically unrealistic. Of the thousands of enzymatic reactions in a typical bacterial metabolism, only a few hundred form the metabolic pathways essential to produce energy carriers and biosynthetic precursors. These pathways carry relatively high flux, are central to maintaining and reproducing the cell, and provide precursors and energy to engineered metabolic pathways. Focusing on these central metabolic subsystems, we present iCH360, a manually curated medium-scale model of energy and biosynthesis metabolism for the well-studied bacterium Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655. The model is a sub-network of the most recent genome-scale reconstruction, iML1515, and comes with an updated layer of database annotations and with a range of metabolic maps for visualisation. We enriched the stoichiometric network with extensive biological information and quantitative data, enhancing the scope and applicability of the model. In addition, we assess the properties of this model in comparison to its genome-scale parent and demonstrate the use of the network and supporting data in various scenarios, including enzyme-constrained flux balance analysis, elementary flux mode analysis, and thermodynamic analysis. Overall, we believe this model holds the potential to become a reference medium-scale metabolic model for E. coli.</description>

      <title>Impact of Optic Nerve Tortuosity, Globe Proptosis, and Size on Retinal Ganglion Cell Thickness Across General, Glaucoma, and Myopic Populations: Insights from the UK Biobank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To investigate the impact of optic nerve tortuosity (ONT), and the interaction of globe proptosis and globe size on retinal ganglion cell (RGC) thickness, using Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) thickness, across general, glaucoma, and myopic populations.
  Methods: We analyzed 17,940 eyes from the UKBiobank cohort (ID 76442), including 72 glaucoma and 2475 myopic eyes. AI models segmented structures from 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans and magnetic resonance images (MRI). RNFL thickness was derived from OCT scans and corrected for ocular magnification, was derived from OCT. From MRIs, we extracted: ONT, globe proptosis, axial length, and a novel interzygomatic line-to-posterior pole (ILPP) distance, a composite marker of globe proptosis and size. GEE models assessed associations between orbital and retinal features across all populations.
  Results: Segmentation models achieved Dice coefficients over 0.94 for both MRI and OCT. RNFL thickness was positively correlated with both ONT and ILPP distance (r = 0.065, p &lt; 0.001, and r = 0.206, p &lt; 0.001 respectively). The same was true for glaucoma (r = 0.040, p = 0.74, and r = 0.224, p = 0.059), and for myopia (r = 0.069, p &lt; 0.001, and r = 0.100, p &lt; 0.0001). GEE models revealed straighter optic nerves and shorter ILPP distance as predictive of thinner RNFL in all populations.
  Conclusions: This study emphasizes the impact of ONT, globe size, and proptosis on retinal health, suggesting RNFL thinning may arise from biomechanical stress due to straighter optic nerves or reduced ILPP distance, particularly in glaucoma or myopia. The novel ILPP metric, integrating globe size and position, shows potential as a biomarker for axonal health. These findings highlight the role of orbit structures in RGC axonal health and warrant further exploration of the biomechanical relationship between the orbit and optic nerve.</description>
