      <title>Reaction rates with temperature-dependent cross sections: A quantum dynamical microscopic model for the neutron capture reaction on the $^{188}$Os target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutron capture process plays a vital role in creating the heavy elements in the universe. The environments involved in these processes are, in general, high in temperature and are characterized by two distinct reaction mechanisms: the slow and rapid neutron capture processes. In this work, the slow neutron capture process is described with the time-dependent coupled channels wave-packet (TDCCWP) method that uses both a many-body nuclear potential and an initial temperature-dependent state to account for the thermal environment. To evaluate the role of a mixed and entangled initial state in the temperature-dependent neutron capture cross section, TDCCWP calculations are compared with those from the coupled-channels density matrix (CCDM) method based on the Lindblad equation. The importance of the temperature of the environment is then explored in the n+$^{188}$Os reaction with a decrease of cross section with increasing temperature, along with a decrease of $10\%$ in reaction rates for the highest incident energies studied, which are important in the rapid neutron capture process.</description>

      <title>A weak entanglement approximation for nuclear structure: review and recent developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear shell model is a useful and widely used tool for nuclear structure, but it can be hampered by the exponential growth of the basis. Drawing inspiration from quantum information theory, one can show that the proton and neutron components are typically weakly entangled. This has led to the Proton And Neutron Approximate Shell-model (PANASh). I review the underlying ideas and present recent developments. In particular I show how PANASh can accelerate beyond-mean-field methods such as the generator coordinate method.</description>

      <title>Investigation of ground state properties and shape evolution in Hf isotopes using the CDFT approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ground-state properties and shape evolution of even-even hafnium isotopes ranging from $N=80$ to the neutron dripline are thoroughly examined using Covariant Density Functional Theory (CDFT) with density-dependent effective interactions, specifically the parameter sets DD-ME1, DD-ME2, DD-PC1, and DD-PCX. Key nuclear properties, including binding energies, two-neutron separation energies ($S_{2n}$), two-neutron shell gaps ($\delta S_{2n}$), neutron pairing energies ($E_{pair,n}$), quadrupole deformation parameters ($\beta_2$), root-mean-square (RMS) charge and matter radii, and neutron skin thickness ($\Delta r_{np}$), are systematically computed and compared with available experimental results and predictions from various theoretical models. These include the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) framework employing the Skyrme SLy4 interaction, the Finite Range Droplet Model (FRDM), the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) using the PC-PK1 functional, and the relativistic mean-field (RMF) approach with NL3 parameterization. Shell closures at $N=82$ and $N=126$, subshell effects at $N=108$ and $N=152$, and shape transitions with coexistence in $^{192}$Hf and $^{222-236}$Hf are observed. Neutron skin thickness increases with neutron excess, and potential energy surfaces show consistent trends, validating CDFT's reliability for nuclear structure predictions.</description>

      <title>Hyperons in Neutron Stars across the observed mass range: Insights from realistic $\Lambda$-N and $\Lambda$-$\Lambda$ interactions within a Microscopic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the equation of state (EOS) and macroscopic properties of neutron stars (NSs) and hyperonic stars within the framework of the lowest order constrained variational (LOCV) method, extended to include interacting $\Lambda$ hyperons. The nucleon-nucleon interaction is modeled using the AV18 potential supplemented by Urbana three-body forces, while $\Lambda N$ and $\Lambda \Lambda$ interactions are described by realistic spin- and parity-dependent potentials fitted to hypernuclear data. Cold, charge-neutral, and $\beta$-equilibrated matter composed of neutrons, protons, electrons, muons, and $\Lambda$ hyperons is considered. We compute particle fractions, chemical potentials, the EOS, speed of sound, tidal deformability, and stellar structure by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, and compare our results with recent NICER and gravitational-wave observations. The inclusion of $\Lambda$ hyperons leads to EOS softening, reducing the maximum NS mass from $2.34M_\odot$ to $2.07M_\odot$, while keeping it consistent with the $2M_\odot$ mass constraint. At $1.4M_\odot$, the model satisfies observational limits on radius and tidal deformability, with the $\Lambda$ onset occurring below this mass. Comparison with other microscopic and relativistic mean-field models shows that our EOS remains consistent with the allowed pressure-energy density range, while also permitting even canonical-mass NSs of about $1.4M_{\odot}$ to accommodate hyperons. These results suggest that hyperons can appear in NSs across the observed mass range without violating current astrophysical constraints, and that the extended LOCV method provides a consistent, microscopic approach to modeling dense hypernuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the Equations of State (EoSs) of Compact Stars using machine and deep learning regression techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This dissertation focuses on the reconstruction of Equations of State (EoSs) describing the interior of compact stars, using modern machine learning and deep learning methods. The pipeline is based on data from mass-radius (M-R) curves, obtained by numerically solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for a wide range of admissible EoSs. The manuscript is divided into a Theoretical Part (Chs. 1-4) and a Computational Part (Chs. 5-7). The theoretical chapters analyze the properties of neutron and quark stars, the physical constraints of viable EoS models, and introduce regression algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) and neural networks with normalization and dropout techniques. The computational part presents the generation of artificial EoSs for hadronic and quark stars (MIT bag, CFL), the numerical solution of the TOV equations, data preparation, and hyperparameter tuning. Results include training and evaluation of models using MSE/MSLE metrics, learning curves for neural networks, and reconstruction of 21 hadronic and 20 quark star EoSs. Source code and tools for reproducibility and future research are provided. The work aims to establish a reusable and scalable framework, strengthening the connection between theoretical astrophysics and computational science.</description>

      <title>Radial Oscillations of Viscous Neutron Stars: Zero Diffusion Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectrum of radial oscillations of neutron stars is systematically studied within two frameworks of viscous relativistic hydrodynamics: the relativistic Navier-Stokes and Israel-Stewart theories. A correspondence is established between the discrete stellar eigenmodes and the continuous dispersion relation of perturbations around a homogeneous fluid, providing a basis for interpreting our numerical results. We analyze the Newtonian limit and assess the impact of relativistic corrections, such as the gravitational redshifting of microscopic relaxation timescales. We show that bulk viscosity can significantly affect the behavior of both hydrodynamic and nonhydrodynamic fundamental modes, and that, depending on the magnitude of the viscous effects, it is the nonhydrodynamic mode that becomes unstable beyond the turning point in a sequence of equilibrium configurations. These results provide a useful step toward systematic studies of neutron star quasinormal modes in the presence of viscosity.</description>

      <title>Coupled-channel analysis for vector charmonia and their nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision $e^+e^-\to c\bar{c}$ data (20 final states) from the BESIII and Belle in $\sqrt{s}=3.75-4.7$ GeV are analyzed with a semi three-body unitary coupled-channel model. Vector charmonium poles are extracted from the amplitudes obtained from the fit. We find well-known $\psi$ states listed in the PDG, and also several states near open-charm thresholds. The compositeness of the near-threshold poles suggests that $\psi(4040)$ could mainly consist of a $D^*\bar{D}^*$-molecule component, rather than a conventionally accepted quark-model $\psi(3S)$ state. Also, $\psi(4230)$ and $\psi(4360)$ might be substantial mixtures of $D_1(2420)\bar{D}$, $D_1(2420)\bar{D}^*$, $D_s^*\bar{D}_s^*$, and $c\bar{c}$ components.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Suppression in Diffractive Vector Meson Production within the Color Glass Condensate Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend a recent global Bayesian analysis of diffractive $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ production in $\gamma+p$ and $\gamma+\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions within the color glass condensate (CGC) framework to investigate potential modifications of the nucleon structure inside nuclei. To this end, we perform fits that allow the effective nucleon structure parameters in Pb nuclei to differ from those of free protons. This approach directly addresses the question of whether the proton's spatial gluon distribution at intermediate to large $x$ is modified in the nuclear environment. We compare results obtained with shared and independent nucleon structure parameters and assess the impact on the simultaneous description of $\gamma+p$ data from HERA and the LHC, as well as $\gamma+\mathrm{Pb}$ data from the LHC. Our findings show that there is no hint of difference in the nucleon structure beyond those already present in the CGC when embedding nucleons inside a nuclear environment.</description>

      <title>Rotating neutron stars within the macroscopic effective-surface approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic model for a neutron star (NS) as a perfect liquid drop at the equilibrium is extended to rotating systems with a small frequency $\omega$ within the effective-surface (ES) approach. The NS angular momentum $I$ and moment of inertia (MI) for a slow stationary azimuthal rotation around the symmetry axis is calculated by using the Kerr metric approach in the Boyer-Lindquist and Hogan forms for the perfect liquid-drop model of NSs. The gradient surface terms of the NS energy density $\mathcal{E}(\rho)$ [Equation of State] are taken into account along with the volume ones at the leading order of the leptodermic parameter $a/R \ll 1$, where $a$ is the ES crust thickness and $R$ is the mean NS radius. The macroscopic NS angular momentum $I$ at small frequencies $\omega$, up to quadratic terms, can be specified for calculations of the adiabatic MI, $\Theta=d I/d \omega$, by using Hogan's inner gravitational metric, $r\le R$. The NS MI, $\Theta=\tilde{\Theta}/(1-\mathcal{G}_{t\varphi})$, was obtained in terms of the statistically averaged MI, $\tilde{\Theta}$, and its time and azimuthal angle correlation, $\mathcal{G}_{t\varphi}$, as sumes of the volume and surface components. The MI $\Theta$ depends dramatically on its effective radius $R$ because of a strong gravitation. We found the significant shift of the Schwarzschild radius $R_{\rm S}$ to a much smaller position due to the time and azimuthal correlation term $\mathcal{G}_{t\varphi}$. The adiabaticity condition is carried out for several neutron stars in a strong gravitation case.</description>

      <title>New Skyrme parametrizations to describe finite nuclei and neutron star matter with realistic effective masses. II. Adjusting the spin-dependent terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many common Skyrme functionals present ferromagnetic instabilities or unrealistic density dependence of the spin-dependent Landau parameters. To solve these problems, we consider the Skyrme interaction as a density-functional rather than a density-dependent two-body force. This allows us to adjust the spin-dependent terms of the new extended Skyrme functionals of our previous paper [M. Duan and M. Urban, Phys. Rev. C 110, 065806 (2024)] independently without altering the properties of spin saturated matter. The parameters of the spin-dependent terms are determined by fitting the Landau parameters $G_0$ and $G'_0$ in neutron matter and symmetric nuclear matter and the effective-mass splitting of up and down particles in spin polarized matter to the results of microscopic calculations. Using the new parametrizations, called Sky3s and Sky4s, the spin-related properties of nuclear matter are in good agreement with the microscopic results. As an application, we compute response functions and neutrino scattering rates of neutron-star matter with the new functionals having realistic effective masses and Landau parameters.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal flow decorrelations in light ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a detailed analysis of longitudinal flow decorrelations in light ion collisions at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider(LHC) energies for the first time. We compare different theoretical models of the oxygen structure and find that certain observables, such as the flow vector correlator, can distinguish between them, particularly highlighting differences between the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) structure and other models, such as Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory (NLEFT) and the Projected Generator Coordinate Method (PGCM), which behave similarly. We further examine flow decorrelations across different systems, including d+Au and O+O collisions at 200 GeV, as well as Ne+Ne and O+O collisions at 6.37 TeV, indicating a hierarchy in decorrelations that underscores the complexity of these interactions. Our findings emphasize that the role of asymmetry in d+Au collisions and its impact on flow correlations is mitigated using a modified flow correlation defined as a ratio of two flow vector covariances derived from different pairs of pseudorapidity bins. Additionally, our analysis of flow angle decorrelations shows diverse distributions across various systems, finding distinct patterns in d+Au collisions compared to other collision systems.</description>

      <title>Conformal prediction for uncertainties in nucleon-nucleon scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a distribution-free and model-agnostic uncertainty-quantification method that provides finite-sample prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage. In this work, for the first time, we apply conformal-prediction to generate uncertainty bands for physical observables in nuclear physics, such as the total cross section and nucleon-nucleon phase shifts. We demonstrate the method's flexibility by considering three scenarios: (i) a pointwise model, where expansion coefficients in chiral effective field theory are treated as random variables; (ii) a Gaussian-Process model for the coefficients; and (iii) phase shifts at various energies and partial waves calculated using local interactions from chiral effective field theory. In each case, conformal-prediction intervals are constructed and validated empirically. Our results show that conformal prediction provides reliable and adaptive uncertainty bands even in the presence of non-Gaussian behavior, such as skewness and heavy tails. These findings highlight conformal prediction as a robust and practical framework for quantifying theoretical uncertainties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to probe light-quark dipole interactions at lepton colliders using the azimuthal asymmetry of a collinear dihadron pair $(h_1h_2)$ produced in association with another hadron $h'$. This asymmetry, arising from quantum interference in the quark spin space, is exclusively sensitive to dipole interactions at the leading power of the new physics scale and simultaneously probes both the real and imaginary components of the dipole couplings. By combining all possible channels of $h'$, this method allows for disentangling the up and down quark dipole moments and has the potential to significantly strengthen current constraints by one to two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04053v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After more than half a century after the first predictions of the so-called "island of stability of superheavy nuclei", exploring the limits of nuclear stability at highest atomic numbers is still one of the most prominent challenges in low-energy nuclear physics. These exotic nuclear species reveal their character and details of some of their properties by their induced or spontaneous disintegration. The achievements in the field superheavy nuclei (SHN) research have been reported in a number of review papers throughout the decades. This review is an attempt to summarize the progress that has been made in recent years by employing the versatile tool park of Decay Spectroscopy After Separation (DSAS) for the heaviest isotopes from Z=99 (einsteinium) to Z=118 (oganesson). In addition, references to earlier reviews and the relevant papers, together with the major decay properties of all these isotopes are given.</description>

      <title>Precision DIS thrust predictions for HERA and EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present predictions for the DIS 1-jettiness event shape $\tau_1^b$, or DIS thrust, using the framework of Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) for factorization, resummation of large logarithms, and rigorous treatment of nonperturbative power corrections, matched to fixed-order QCD away from the resummation region. Our predictions reach next-to-next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (N$^3$LL) accuracy in resummed perturbation theory, matched to $O(\alpha_s^2)$ fixed-order QCD calculations obtained using the program NLOJet++. We include a rigorous treatment of hadronization corrections, which are universal across different event shapes and kinematic variables $x$ and $Q$ at leading power, and supplement them with a systematic scheme to remove $O(\Lambda_\textrm{QCD})$ renormalon ambiguities in their definition. The framework of SCET allows us to connect smoothly the nonperturbative, resummation, and fixed-order regions, whose relative importance varies with $x$ and $Q$, and to rigorously estimate theoretical uncertainties, across a broad range of $x$ and $Q$ covering existing experimental results from HERA as well as expected new measurements from the upcoming Electron-Ion-Collider (EIC). Our predictions will serve as an important benchmark for the EIC program, enabling the precise determination of the QCD strong coupling $\alpha_s$ and the universal nonperturbative first moment parameter $\Omega_1$.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariance and color charge fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of confinement is connected with color charge. Unfortunately, the color charge densities in QCD, the Noether charge densities associated with the global color invariance, are not invariant under local color rotations. This implies that the expectation values of the net color charge in any region of any physical state in QCD, states that satisfy the color Gauss law, are automatically zero for all components of color. In this paper it is shown that the expectation value of the square of the net color charge in a region, a measure of the color charge fluctuations, is necessarily nonzero when evaluated in physical states and the result, while depending on the scheme and scale by which the theory is regulated, is gauge invariant. This holds despite the formal lack of gauge invariance of the operator. Moreover, there is a particular combination of the color charge fluctuations for the vacuum and for a system describable by a non-trivial density matrix that is independent that has a well-defined continuum limit</description>

      <title>Nucleon mass: trace anomaly and $\sigma$-terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a pedagogical introduction to the origin of the mass of the nucleon. We first review the trace anomaly of the energy-momentum tensor, which generates most of the nucleon mass via the gluon fields and thus contributes even in the case of vanishing quark masses. We then discuss the contributions to the nucleon mass that do originate from the Higgs mechanism via the quark masses, reviewing the current status of nucleon $\sigma$-terms that encode the corresponding matrix elements.</description>

      <title>Chiral and deconfinement transitions in spin-polarized quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of spin polarization in strongly interacting matter by introducing a finite spin potential, $\mu_\Sigma$, which effectively controls the spin density of the system without requiring rotation or specific boundary conditions. Inspired by recent lattice QCD simulations that incorporated such a potential, we implement this approach within an effective QCD framework. Our results show that increasing spin polarization leads to a simultaneous decrease in both the chiral and deconfinement restoration temperatures. The resulting phase structure is qualitatively consistent with lattice findings, and notably, we observe the emergence of a first-order chiral phase transition at low temperature. These results suggest that spin-polarized environments can significantly impact the QCD phase diagram and offer a controlled route for studying spin effects in hot and dense matter.</description>

      <title>Novel insight into centre-vortex geometry in four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Centre-vortex surfaces are mapped out in four dimensions within the framework of SU(3) lattice gauge theory to understand the role of secondary loops that develop in three-dimensional visualisations of centre-vortex structure, appearing separate from the percolating cluster. Loops that initially appear disconnected in three-dimensional slices can originate from the same connected surface in four dimensions depending on the surface's curvature. For the first time, these secondary loops are identified as "connected" or "disconnected" with respect to the vortex sheet, allowing new insight into the evolution of centre-vortex geometry through the finite-temperature phase transition. At low temperatures, we find that secondary loops of any length primarily lie in the same sheet percolating the four-dimensional volume. Only a handful of small secondary sheets disconnected from the percolating sheet are identified. Above the phase transition, the vortex structure is still found to be dominated by a single large sheet but one that has aligned with the temporal dimension. With the near absence of any curvature orthogonal to the temporal dimension, connected secondary loops become vanishingly rare. Other novel quantities, such as the four-dimensional density of secondary sheets and the sheet sizes themselves, are analysed to build a complete picture of centre-vortex geometry in four dimensions.</description>
