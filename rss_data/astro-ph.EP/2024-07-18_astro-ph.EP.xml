      <title>New insights into the internal structure of GJ 1214 b informed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations of the sub-Neptune GJ 1214 b suggest that it hosts a high-metallicity (&gt;100x solar), hazy atmosphere. Emission spectra of the planet show molecular absorption features, most likely due to atmospheric H2O. In light of this new information, we conduct a thorough reevaluation of the planet's internal structure. We consider interior models with mixed H/He/H2O envelopes of varying composition, informed by atmospheric constraints from the JWST phase curve, in order to determine possible bulk compositions and internal structures. Self-consistent atmospheric models consistent with the JWST observations are used to set boundary conditions for the interior. We find that a total envelope mass fraction of at least 8.1% is required to explain the planet's mass and radius. Regardless of H2O content, the maximum H/He mass fraction of the planet is 5.8%. We find that a 1:1 ice-to-rock ratio along with 3.4-4.8% H/He is also a permissible solution. In addition, we consider a pure H2O (steam) envelope and find that such a scenario is possible, albeit with a high ice-to-rock ratio of at least 3.76:1, which may be unrealistic from a planet formation standpoint. We discuss possible formation pathways for the different internal structures that are consistent with observations. Since our results depend strongly on the atmospheric composition and haze properties, more precise observations of the planet's atmosphere would allow for further constraints on its internal structure. This type of analysis can be applied to any sub-Neptune with atmospheric constraints to better understand its interior.</description>

      <title>Estimate of water and hydroxyl abundance on asteroid (16) Psyche from JWST data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of Solar System evolution is closely tied to interpretations of asteroid composition, particularly the M-class asteroids. These asteroids were initially thought to be the exposed cores of differentiated planetesimals, a hypothesis based on their spectral similarity to iron meteorites. However, recent astronomical observations have revealed hydration on their surface through the detection of 3-$\mu$m absorption features associated with OH and potentially H2O. We present evidence of hydration due mainly to OH on asteroid (16) Psyche, the largest M-class asteroid, using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) spanning 1.1 - 6.63 $\mu$m. Our observations include two detections of the full 3-$\mu$m feature associated with OH and H2O resembling those found in CY-, CH-, and CB-type carbonaceous chondrites, and no 6-$\mu$m feature uniquely associated with H2O across two observations. We observe 3-$\mu$m depths of between 4.3 and 6% across two observations, values consistent with hydrogen abundance estimates on other airless bodies of 250 - 400 ppm. We place an upper limit of 39 ppm on the water abundance from the standard deviation around the 6-$\mu$m feature region. The presence of hydrated minerals suggests a complex history for Psyche. Exogenous sources of OH-bearing minerals could come from hydrated impactors. Endogenous OH-bearing minerals would indicate a composition more similar to E-or P-class asteroids. If the hydration is endogenous, it supports the theory that Psyche originated beyond the snow line and later migrated to the outer main belt.</description>

      <title>A question of personalities: evolution of viscous and wind-driven protoplanetary discs in the presence of dead zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether the angular momentum of protoplanetary discs is redistributed by viscosity or extracted by magnetised winds is a long-standing question. Demographic indicators, such as gas disc sizes and stellar accretion rates, have been proposed as ways of distinguishing between these two mechanisms. In this paper, we implement one-dimensional gas simulations to study the evolution of "hybrid" protoplanetary discs simultaneously driven by viscosity and magnetised winds, with dead zones present. We explore how the variations of disc properties, including initial disc sizes, dead zone sizes and angular momentum transport efficiency, affect stellar accretion rates, disc surface density profiles, disc sizes, disc lifetimes, and cumulative mass loss by different processes. Our models show that the expansion of the gas disc size can be sustained when the majority of angular momentum is removed by the magnetised wind for individual protoplanetary discs. However, when we can only observe discs via demographic screenshots, the variation of disc sizes with time is possibly diminished by the disc "personalities", by which we mean the variations of initial disc properties among different discs. Our "hybrid" models re-assess association of the two demographic indicators with mechanisms responsible for angular momentum transport and suggest additional diagnostics are required to assist the differentiation.</description>

      <title>Westward hotspot offset explained by subcritical dynamo action in an ultra-hot Jupiter atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters are tidally-locked Jupiter-sized planets close to their host star. They have equilibrium temperatures above about 1000 K. Photometric observations find that the hotspot, the hottest location in the atmosphere, is shifted with respect to the substellar point. Some observations show eastward and some show westward hotspot offsets, while hydrodynamic simulations show an eastward offset due to advection by the characteristic eastward mean flow. In particular for ultra-hot Jupiters with equilibrium temperatures above 2000 Kelvin, electromagnetic effects must be considered since the ionization-driven significant electrical conductivity and the subsequent induction of magnetic fields likely result in substantial Lorentz forces. We here provide the first magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulation of an ultra-hot Jupiter atmosphere at an equilibrium temperature of about 2400 K that fully captures non-linear electromagnetic induction effects. We find a new turbulent flow regime, hitherto unknown for hot Jupiters. Its main characteristic is a break-down of the well-known laminar mean flows. This break-down is triggered by strong local magnetic fields. These fields are maintained by a subcritical dynamo process. It is initiated by a sufficiently strong background field from an assumed deep dynamo region at a realistic amplitude around 2.5 G. Our results show a zero or westward hotspot offset for the dynamo case, depending on atmospheric properties, while the hydrodynamic case has the usual eastward offset. Since our simulation has an eastward mean flow at the equator, radial flows must be important for producing the zero or westward hotspot offset. A subcritical dynamo offers a new scenario for explaining the diversity of observed hotspot offsets. In this scenario, the dynamo has been initiated by sufficiently strong fields at some time in the past only for a part of the population.</description>

      <title>Seasonal Changes in the Atmosphere of HD 80606b Observed with JWST's NIRSpec/G395H</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-eccentricity gas giant planets serve as unique laboratories for studying the thermal and chemical properties of H/He-dominated atmospheres. One of the most extreme cases is HD 80606b -- a hot Jupiter orbiting a sun-like star with an eccentricity of $0.93$ -- which experiences an increase in incident flux of nearly three orders of magnitude as the star-planet separation decreases from $0.88\,{\rm au}$ at apoastron to $0.03\,{\rm au}$ at periastron. We observed the planet's periastron passage using \emph{JWST}'s NIRSpec/G395H instrument ($2.8-5.2\,{\rm \mu m}$) during a $21\,{\rm hr}$ window centered on the eclipse. We find that, as the planet passes through periastron, its emission spectrum transitions from a featureless blackbody to one in which CO and CH$_4$ absorption features are visible. We obtain significant detections of CH$_4$ during post-periapse phases at $3.7-4.8\sigma$ depending on the phase. Following periapse, CO and H$_2$O are also detected at $3.4\sigma$ and $3.1\sigma$, respectively. Furthermore, we rule out the presence of a strong temperature inversion near the IR photosphere -- predicted by GCMs to form temporarily during periapse passage -- based on the lack of obvious emission features throughout the observing window. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of studying hot Jupiter atmospheres using partial phase curves obtained with NIRSpec/G395H.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Consequence of Shadows Cast to the Outer Protoplanetary Disks: I. Two-dimensional Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been increasing evidence of shadows from scattered light observations of outer protoplanetary disks (PPDs) cast from the (unresolved) disk inner region, while in the meantime these disks present substructures of various kinds in the submillimeter. As stellar irradiation is the primary heating source for the outer PPDs, the presence of such shadows thus suggest inhomogeneous heating of the outer disk in azimuth, leading to a "thermal forcing" with dynamical consequences. We conduct a suite of idealized 2D disk simulations of the outer disk with azimuthally-varying cooling prescription to mimic the effect of shadows, generally assuming the shadow is static or slowly-rotating. The linear response to such shadows is two-armed spirals with the same pattern speed as the shadow. Towards the nonlinear regime, we find that shadows can potentially lead to the formation of a variety of types of substructures including rings, spirals and crescents, depending on viscosity, cooling time, etc. We have conducted systematic and statistical characterization of the simulation suite, and as thermal forcing from the shadow strengthens, the dominant form of shadow-induced disk substructures change from spirals to rings, and eventually to crescents/vortices. Our results highlight the importance of properly modeling the dynamical impact of inhomogeneous stellar irradiation, while call for more detailed modeling incorporating more realistic disk physics.</description>

      <title>Unlocking planetesimal magnetic field histories: a refined, versatile model for thermal evolution and dynamo generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal and magnetic histories of planetesimals provide unique insights into the formation and evolution of Earth's building blocks. These histories can be gleaned from meteorites by using numerical models to translate measured properties into planetesimal behaviour. In this paper, we present a new 1D planetesimal thermal evolution and dynamo generation model. This magnetic field generation model is the first of a differentiated, mantled planetesimal that includes both mantle convection and non-eutectic core solidification. We have improved fundamental aspects of mantle heat transport by including a more detailed viscosity model and stagnant lid convection parametrisations consistent with internal heating. We have also added radiogenic heating from $^{60}Fe$ in the metallic Fe-FeS core. Additionally, we implement a combined thermal and compositional buoyancy flux, as well as the latest magnetic field scaling laws to predict magnetic field strengths during the planetesimal's thermal evolution until core solidification is complete. We illustrate the consequences of our model changes with an example run for a 500 km radius planetesimal. These effects include more rapid erosion of core thermal stratification and longer duration of mantle convection compared to previous studies. The additional buoyancy from core solidification has a marginal effect on dynamo strength, but for some initial core sulfur contents it can prevent cessation of the dynamo when mantle convection ends. Our model can be used to investigate the effects of individual parameters on dynamo generation and constrain properties of specific meteorite parent bodies. Combined, these updates mean this model can predict the most reliable and complete magnetic field history for a planetesimal to date, so is a valuable tool for deciphering planetesimal behaviour from meteorite properties.</description>

      <title>"Halfway to Rayleigh" and other Insights to the Rossby Wave Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rossby wave instability (RWI) is the fundamental non-axisymmetric radial shear instability in disks. The RWI can facilitate disk accretion, set the shape of planetary gaps and produce large vortices. It arises from density and/or temperature features, such as radial gaps, bumps or steps. A general, sufficient condition to trigger the RWI is lacking, which we address by studying the linear RWI in a suite of simplified models, including incompressible and compressible shearing sheets and global, cylindrical disks. We focus on enthalpy amplitude and width as the fundamental properties of disk features with various shapes. We find analytic results for the RWI boundary and growth rates across a wide parameter space, in some cases with exact derivations and in others as a description of numerical results. Features wider than a scale-height generally become unstable about halfway to Rayleigh instability, i.e.\ when the squared epicyclic frequency is about half the Keplerian value, reinforcing our previous finding. RWI growth rates approximately scale as enthalpy amplitude to the 1/3 power, with a weak dependence on width, across much of parameter space. Global disk curvature affects wide planetary gaps, making the outer gap edge more susceptible to the RWI. Our simplified models are barotropic and height-integrated, but the main results should carry over to more complex and realistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Young asteroid families as the primary source of meteorites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the origin of bright shooting stars and their meteorite samples is among the most ancient astronomy-related questions that at larger scales has human consequences [1-3]. As of today, only ${\sim}\,6\%$ of meteorite falls have been firmly linked to their sources (Moon, Mars, and asteroid (4) Vesta [4-6]). Here, we show that ${\sim}\,70\%$ of meteorites originate from three recent breakups of $D &gt; 30\,{\rm km}$ asteroids that occurred 5.8, 7.5 and less than ${\sim}\,40$ million years ago. These breakups, including the well-known Karin family [7], took place in the prominent yet old Koronis and Massalia families and are at the origin of the dominance of H and L ordinary chondrites among meteorite falls. These young families distinguish themselves amidst all main belt asteroids by having a uniquely high abundance of small fragments. Their size-frequency distribution remains steep for a few tens of millions of years, exceeding temporarily the production of metre-sized fragments by the largest old asteroid families (e.g., Flora, Vesta). Supporting evidence includes the existence of associated dust bands [8-10], the cosmic-ray exposure ages of H-chondrite meteorites [11,12], or the distribution of pre-atmospheric orbits of meteorites [13-15].</description>

      <title>Four-of-a-kind? Comprehensive atmospheric characterisation of the HR 8799 planets with VLTI/GRAVITY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With four companions at separations from 16 to 71 au, HR 8799 is a unique target for direct imaging, presenting an opportunity for the comparative study of exoplanets with a shared formation history. Combining new VLTI/GRAVITY observations obtained within the ExoGRAVITY program with archival data, we perform a systematic atmospheric characterisation of all four planets. We explore different levels of model flexibility to understand the temperature structure, chemistry and clouds of each planet using both petitRADTRANS atmospheric retrievals and fits to self-consistent radiative-convective equilibrium models. Using Bayesian Model Averaging to combine multiple retrievals, we find that the HR 8799 planets are highly enriched in metals, with [M/H] $\gtrsim$1, and have stellar to super-stellar C/O ratios. The C/O ratio increases with increasing separation from $0.55^{+0.12}_{-0.10}$ for d to $0.78^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ for b, with the exception of the innermost planet which has a C/O ratio of $0.87\pm0.03$. By retrieving a quench pressure and using a disequilibrium chemistry model we derive vertical mixing strengths compatible with predictions for high-metallicity, self-luminous atmospheres. Bayesian evidence comparisons strongly favour the presence of HCN in HR 8799 c and e, as well as CH$_{4}$ in HR 8799 c, with detections at $&gt;5\sigma$ confidence. All of the planets are cloudy, with no evidence for patchiness. The clouds of c, d and e are best fit by silicate clouds lying above a deep iron cloud layer, while the clouds of the cooler HR 8799 b are more likely composed of Na$_{2}$S. With well defined atmospheric properties, future exploration of this system is well positioned to unveil further detail in these planets, extending our understanding of the composition, structure, and formation history of these siblings.</description>

      <title>Early and elongated epochs of planetesimal dynamo generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accreting in the first few million years (Ma) of the Solar System, planetesimals record conditions in the protoplanetary disc and are the remnants of planetary formation processes. The meteorite paleomagnetic record carries key insights into the thermal history of planetesimals and their extent of differentiation. The current paradigm splits the meteorite paleomagnetic record into three magnetic field generation epochs: an early nebula field ($\lesssim$5 Ma after CAI formation), followed by thermal dynamos ($\sim$5-34 Ma after CAI formation), then a gap in dynamo generation, before the onset of core solidification and compositional dynamos. These epochs have been defined using current thermal evolution and dynamo generation models of planetesimals. Here, we demonstrate these epochs are not as distinct as previously thought based on refined thermal evolution models that include more realistic parametrisations for mantle convection, non-eutectic core solidification, and radiogenic $^{60}Fe$ in the core. We find thermal dynamos can start earlier and last longer. Inclusion of appreciable $^{60}Fe$ in the core brings forward the onset of dynamo generation to $\sim$1-2 Ma after CAI formation, which overlaps with the existence of the nebula field. The second epoch of dynamo generation begins prior to the onset of core solidification, suggesting this epoch is not purely compositionally driven. Planetesimal radius is the dominant control on the strength and duration of dynamo generation, and the choice of reference viscosity can widen the gap between epochs of dynamo generation from 0-200 Ma. Overall, variations in planetesimal properties lead to more variable timings of different planetesimal magnetic field generation mechanisms than previously thought. This alters the information we can glean from the meteorite paleomagnetic record about the early Solar System.</description>

      <title>Source regions of carbonaceous meteorites and NEOs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work aims to determine the source regions of carbonaceous chondrites (CM, CI, CO, CV, CK, CR, CH, CB, or C-ungrouped). We studied 38 individual asteroid families, including young and old ones, and determined their contributions to the NEO populations at metre and kilometre sizes using collisional and orbital models. Our models are in agreement with spectroscopic observations of NEOs, cosmic-ray exposure ages of meteorites, statistics of bolides, infrared emission from dust bands, composition of interplanetary dust particles (IDPs), or abundance of extraterrestrial helium-3. We identified the Veritas, Polana and Eos families as the primary sources of CM/CR, CI and CO/CV/CK chondrites, respectively. Substantial contributions are also expected from CM-like K\"onig and CI-like Clarissa, Misa and Hoffmeister families. The source regions of kilometre-sized bodies are generally different. The Adeona family is by far the main source of CM-like NEOs, whereas the Polana (low-i) and Euphrosyne (high-i) families are at the origin of most CI-like NEOs. The Polana family is the likely source of both Ryugu and Bennu. We were able to link spectroscopically and dynamically several NEOs to the Baptistina family. Finally, it appears that the pre-atmospheric flux of carbonaceous chondrites at metre sizes is about the same as that of ordinary chondrites. Given the difference in fall statistics between the two groups (80\% versus 4.4\%), this implies either substantial atmospheric fragmentation of carbonaceous bodies at the level of ${\sim}0.5\,{\rm MPa}$, or destruction by thermal cracking and water desorption. The source regions of most meteorites and kilometre-sized NEOs have now been determined; including some minor classes like enstatite chondrites and achondrites (Nysa, Hungaria), acapulcoites/lodranites (Iannini).</description>

      <title>Irregular Fixation II: The orbits of irregular satellites</title>

Abstract: Irregular satellites (IS) are believed to have been captured during the Solar system's dynamical history and provide clues for the Solar system's formation and evolution. IS occupy a large fraction of the Hill sphere of their host planet and their orbits are highly perturbed by the Sun. We use a novel formalism developed in paper I to characterise their orbits in terms of an effective secular Hamiltonian (the Brown Hamiltonian) that accounts for their large orbital separations. We find that prograde satellites generally follow the Brown Hamiltonian, while retrograde satellites (which extend further) deviate more significantly. Nevertheless, the phase portrait is much better described by the Brown Hamiltonian for all satellites. We construct a semi-analytic criterion that predicts the librating orbit based on the effective energy due to the Brown Hamiltonian. We also check our results with highly accurate N-body integrations of satellite orbits, where initial conditions are loaded directly from the updated ephemeris from the NASA Horizons database. Although the retrograde librating orbits occupy more area in the parameter space, the vast majority of librating IS are prograde. Using our method we find $13$ librating satellites, $8$ of them previously known to librate, and the rest shown to librate for the first time. Further observations of existing and new satellites could shed more light on the dynamical history of the Solar system and satellite formation and test our results.</description>

      <title>Using A One-Class SVM To Optimize Transit Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As machine learning algorithms become increasingly accessible, a growing number of organizations and researchers are using these technologies to automate the process of exoplanet detection. These mainly utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect periodic dips in lightcurve data. While having approximately 5% lower accuracy than CNNs, the results of this study show that One-Class Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be fitted to data up to 84 times faster than simple CNNs and make predictions over 3 times faster on the same datasets using the same hardware. In addition, One-Class SVMs can be run smoothly on unspecialized hardware, removing the need for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) usage. In cases where time and processing power are valuable resources, One-Class SVMs are able to minimize time spent on transit detection tasks while maximizing performance and efficiency.</description>
