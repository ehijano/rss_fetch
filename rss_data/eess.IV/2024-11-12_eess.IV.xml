      <title>Navigating Distribution Shifts in Medical Image Analysis: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical Image Analysis (MedIA) has become indispensable in modern healthcare, enhancing clinical diagnostics and personalized treatment. Despite the remarkable advancements supported by deep learning (DL) technologies, their practical deployment faces challenges due to distribution shifts, where models trained on specific datasets underperform across others from varying hospitals, regions, or patient populations. To navigate this issue, researchers have been actively developing strategies to increase the adaptability and robustness of DL models, enabling their effective use in unfamiliar and diverse environments. This paper systematically reviews approaches that apply DL techniques to MedIA systems affected by distribution shifts. Unlike traditional categorizations based on technical specifications, our approach is grounded in the real-world operational constraints faced by healthcare institutions. Specifically, we categorize the existing body of work into Joint Training, Federated Learning, Fine-tuning, and Domain Generalization, with each method tailored to distinct scenarios caused by Data Accessibility, Privacy Concerns, and Collaborative Protocols. This perspective equips researchers with a nuanced understanding of how DL can be strategically deployed to address distribution shifts in MedIA, ensuring diverse and robust medical applications. By delving deeper into these topics, we highlight potential pathways for future research that not only address existing limitations but also push the boundaries of deployable MedIA technologies.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Feasibility of Affordable Sonar Technology: Object Detection in Underwater Environments Using the Ping 360</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of the Ping 360 sonar device, primarily used for navigation, in detecting complex underwater obstacles. The key motivation behind this research is the device's affordability and open-source nature, offering a cost-effective alternative to more expensive imaging sonar systems. The investigation focuses on understanding the behaviour of the Ping 360 in controlled environments and assessing its suitability for object detection, particularly in scenarios where human operators are unavailable for inspecting offshore structures in shallow waters. Through a series of carefully designed experiments, we examined the effects of surface reflections and object shadows in shallow underwater environments. Additionally, we developed a manually annotated sonar image dataset to train a U-Net segmentation model. Our findings indicate that while the Ping 360 sonar demonstrates potential in simpler settings, its performance is limited in more cluttered or reflective environments unless extensive data pre-processing and annotation are applied. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the Ping 360's capabilities for complex object detection. By investigating the feasibility of low-cost sonar devices, this research provides valuable insights into their limitations and potential for future AI-based interpretation, marking a unique contribution to the field.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking 3D multi-coil NC-PDNet MRI reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has shown great promise for MRI reconstruction from undersampled data, yet there is a lack of research on validating its performance in 3D parallel imaging acquisitions with non-Cartesian undersampling. In addition, the artifacts and the resulting image quality depend on the under-sampling pattern. To address this uncharted territory, we extend the Non-Cartesian Primal-Dual Network (NC-PDNet), a state-of-the-art unrolled neural network, to a 3D multi-coil setting. We evaluated the impact of channel-specific versus channel-agnostic training configurations and examined the effect of coil compression. Finally, we benchmark four distinct non-Cartesian undersampling patterns, with an acceleration factor of six, using the publicly available Calgary-Campinas dataset. Our results show that NC-PDNet trained on compressed data with varying input channel numbers achieves an average PSNR of 42.98 dB for 1 mm isotropic 32 channel whole-brain 3D reconstruction. With an inference time of 4.95sec and a GPU memory usage of 5.49 GB, our approach demonstrates significant potential for clinical research application.</description>

      <title>Untrained Perceptual Loss for image denoising of line-like structures in MR images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the acquisition of Magnetic Resonance (MR) images shorter scan times lead to higher image noise. Therefore, automatic image denoising using deep learning methods is of high interest. MR images containing line-like structures such as roots or vessels yield special characteristics as they display connected structures and yield sparse information. For this kind of data, it is important to consider voxel neighborhoods when training a denoising network. In this paper, we translate the Perceptual Loss to 3D data by comparing feature maps of untrained networks in the loss function as done previously for 2D data. We tested the performance of untrained Perceptual Loss (uPL) on 3D image denoising of MR images displaying brain vessels (MR angiograms - MRA) and images of plant roots in soil. We investigate the impact of various uPL characteristics such as weight initialization, network depth, kernel size, and pooling operations on the results. We tested the performance of the uPL loss on four Rician noise levels using evaluation metrics such as the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM). We observe, that our uPL outperforms conventional loss functions such as the L1 loss or a loss based on the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM). The uPL network's initialization is not important, while network depth and pooling operations impact denoising performance. E.g. for both datasets a network with five convolutional layers led to the best performance while a network with more layers led to a performance drop. We also find that small uPL networks led to better or comparable results than using large networks such as VGG. We observe superior performance of our loss for both datasets, all noise levels, and three network architectures. In conclusion, for images containing line-like structures, uPL is an alternative to other loss functions for 3D image denoising.</description>

      <title>Alternative Learning Paradigms for Image Quality Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image Quality Transfer (IQT) aims to enhance the contrast and resolution of low-quality medical images, e.g. obtained from low-power devices, with rich information learned from higher quality images. In contrast to existing IQT methods which adopt supervised learning frameworks, in this work, we propose two novel formulations of the IQT problem. The first approach uses an unsupervised learning framework, whereas the second is a combination of both supervised and unsupervised learning. The unsupervised learning approach considers a sparse representation (SRep) and dictionary learning model, which we call IQT-SRep, whereas the combination of supervised and unsupervised learning approach is based on deep dictionary learning (DDL), which we call IQT-DDL. The IQT-SRep approach trains two dictionaries using a SRep model using pairs of low- and high-quality volumes. Subsequently, the SRep of a low-quality block, in terms of the low-quality dictionary, can be directly used to recover the corresponding high-quality block using the high-quality dictionary. On the other hand, the IQT-DDL approach explicitly learns a high-resolution dictionary to upscale the input volume, while the entire network, including high dictionary generator, is simultaneously optimised to take full advantage of deep learning methods. The two models are evaluated using a low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) application aiming to recover high-quality images akin to those obtained from high-field scanners. Experiments comparing the proposed approaches against state-of-the-art supervised deep learning IQT method (IQT-DL) identify that the two novel formulations of the IQT problem can avoid bias associated with supervised methods when tested using out-of-distribution data that differs from the distribution of the data the model was trained on. This highlights the potential benefit of these novel paradigms for IQT.</description>

      <title>UnDIVE: Generalized Underwater Video Enhancement Using Generative Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of marine exploration, underwater imaging has gained significant attention as a research topic. Underwater video enhancement has become crucial for real-time computer vision tasks in marine exploration. However, most existing methods focus on enhancing individual frames and neglect video temporal dynamics, leading to visually poor enhancements. Furthermore, the lack of ground-truth references limits the use of abundant available underwater video data in many applications. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage framework for enhancing underwater videos. The first stage uses a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to learn a generative prior from unlabeled data, capturing robust and descriptive feature representations. In the second stage, this prior is incorporated into a physics-based image formulation for spatial enhancement, while also enforcing temporal consistency between video frames. Our method enables real-time and computationally-efficient processing of high-resolution underwater videos at lower resolutions, and offers efficient enhancement in the presence of diverse water-types. Extensive experiments on four datasets show that our approach generalizes well and outperforms existing enhancement methods. Our code is available at github.com/suhas-srinath/undive.</description>

      <title>Efficient Self-Supervised Barlow Twins from Limited Tissue Slide Cohorts for Colonic Pathology Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the few cancers that have an established dysplasia-carcinoma sequence that benefits from screening. Everyone over 50 years of age in Canada is eligible for CRC screening. About 20\% of those people will undergo a biopsy for a pre-neoplastic polyp and, in many cases, multiple polyps. As such, these polyp biopsies make up the bulk of a pathologist's workload. Developing an efficient computational model to help screen these polyp biopsies can improve the pathologist's workflow and help guide their attention to critical areas on the slide. DL models face significant challenges in computational pathology (CPath) because of the gigapixel image size of whole-slide images and the scarcity of detailed annotated datasets. It is, therefore, crucial to leverage self-supervised learning (SSL) methods to alleviate the burden and cost of data annotation. However, current research lacks methods to apply SSL frameworks to analyze pathology data effectively. This paper aims to propose an optimized Barlow Twins framework for colorectal polyps screening. We adapt its hyperparameters, augmentation strategy and encoder to the specificity of the pathology data to enhance performance. Additionally, we investigate the best Field of View (FoV) for colorectal polyps screening and propose a new benchmark dataset for CRC screening, made of four types of colorectal polyps and normal tissue, by performing downstream tasking on MHIST and NCT-CRC-7K datasets. Furthermore, we show that the SSL representations are more meaningful and qualitative than the supervised ones and that Barlow Twins benefits from the Swin Transformer when applied to pathology data.

      <title>Assessing Foundational Medical 'Segment Anything' (Med-SAM1, Med-SAM2) Deep Learning Models for Left Atrial Segmentation in 3D LGE MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia, is associated with heart failure and stroke. Accurate segmentation of the left atrium (LA) in 3D late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) MRI is helpful for evaluating AF, as fibrotic remodeling in the LA myocardium contributes to arrhythmia and serves as a key determinant of therapeutic strategies. However, manual LA segmentation is labor-intensive and challenging. Recent foundational deep learning models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pre-trained on diverse datasets, have demonstrated promise in generic segmentation tasks. MedSAM, a fine-tuned version of SAM for medical applications, enables efficient, zero-shot segmentation without domain-specific training. Despite the potential of MedSAM model, it has not yet been evaluated for the complex task of LA segmentation in 3D LGE-MRI. This study aims to (1) evaluate the performance of MedSAM in automating LA segmentation, (2) compare the performance of the MedSAM2 model, which uses a single prompt with automated tracking, with the MedSAM1 model, which requires separate prompt for each slice, and (3) analyze the performance of MedSAM1 in terms of Dice score(i.e., segmentation accuracy) by varying the size and location of the box prompt.</description>

      <title>Epi-NAF: Enhancing Neural Attenuation Fields for Limited-Angle CT with Epipolar Consistency Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural field methods, initially successful in the inverse rendering domain, have recently been extended to CT reconstruction, marking a paradigm shift from traditional techniques. While these approaches deliver state-of-the-art results in sparse-view CT reconstruction, they struggle in limited-angle settings, where input projections are captured over a restricted angle range. We present a novel loss term based on consistency conditions between corresponding epipolar lines in X-ray projection images, aimed at regularizing neural attenuation field optimization. By enforcing these consistency conditions, our approach, Epi-NAF, propagates supervision from input views within the limited-angle range to predicted projections over the full cone-beam CT range. This loss results in both qualitative and quantitative improvements in reconstruction compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Alleviating Hyperparameter-Tuning Burden in SVM Classifiers for Pulmonary Nodules Diagnosis with Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of non-invasive medical imaging, radiomic features are utilized to measure tumor characteristics. However, these features can be affected by the techniques used to discretize the images, ultimately impacting the accuracy of diagnosis. To investigate the influence of various image discretization methods on diagnosis, it is common practice to evaluate multiple discretization strategies individually. This approach often leads to redundant and time-consuming tasks such as training predictive models and fine-tuning hyperparameters separately. This study examines the feasibility of employing multi-task Bayesian optimization to accelerate the hyperparameters search for classifying benign and malignant pulmonary nodules using RBF SVM. Our findings suggest that multi-task Bayesian optimization significantly accelerates the search for hyperparameters in comparison to a single-task approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation to utilize multi-task Bayesian optimization in a critical medical context.</description>

      <title>Exploring Out-of-distribution Detection for Sparse-view Computed Tomography with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works demonstrate the effectiveness of diffusion models as unsupervised solvers for inverse imaging problems. Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) has greatly benefited from these advancements, achieving improved generalization without reliance on measurement parameters. However, this comes at the cost of potential hallucinations, especially when handling out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To ensure reliability, it is essential to study OOD detection for CT reconstruction across both clinical and industrial applications. This need further extends to enabling the OOD detector to function effectively as an anomaly inspection tool. In this paper, we explore the use of a diffusion model, trained to capture the target distribution for CT reconstruction, as an in-distribution prior. Building on recent research, we employ the model to reconstruct partially diffused input images and assess OOD-ness through multiple reconstruction errors. Adapting this approach for sparse-view CT requires redefining the notions of "input" and "reconstruction error". Here, we use filtered backprojection (FBP) reconstructions as input and investigate various definitions of reconstruction error. Our proof-of-concept experiments on the MNIST dataset highlight both successes and failures, demonstrating the potential and limitations of integrating such an OOD detector into a CT reconstruction system. Our findings suggest that effective OOD detection can be achieved by comparing measurements with forward-projected reconstructions, provided that reconstructions from noisy FBP inputs are conditioned on the measurements. However, conditioning can sometimes lead the OOD detector to inadvertently reconstruct OOD images well. To counter this, we introduce a weighting approach that improves robustness against highly informative OOD measurements, albeit with a trade-off in performance in certain cases.</description>

      <title>A Diffuse Light Field Imaging Model for Forward-Scattering Photon-Coded Signal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering imaging is often hindered by extremely low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) due to the prevalence of scattering noise. Light field imaging has been shown to be effective in suppressing noise and collect more ballistic photons as signals. However, to overcome the SNR limit in super-strong scattering environments, even with light field framework, only rare ballistic signals are insufficient. Inspired by radiative transfer theory, we propose a diffuse light field imaging model (DLIM) that leverages light field imaging to retrieve forward-scattered photons as signals to overcome the challenges of low-SNR imaging caused by super-strong scattering environments. This model aims to recover the ballistic photon signal as a source term from forward-scattered photons based on diffusion equations. The DLIM consists of two main processes: radiance modeling and diffusion light-field approximation. Radiate modeling analyzes the radiance distribution in scattering light field images using a proposed three-plane parameterization, which solves a 4-D radiate kernel describing the impulse function of scattering light field. Then, the scattering light field images synthesize a diffuse source satisfying the diffusion equation governing forward scattering photons, solved under Neumann boundary conditions in imaging space. This is the first physically-aware scattering light field imaging model, extending the conventional light field imaging framework from free space into diffuse space. The extensive experiments confirm that the DLIM can reconstruct the target objects even when scattering light field images are reduced as random noise at extremely low SNRs.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Approach for COVID-19 Detection: Combining Wasserstein GAN with Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: COVID-19 is extremely contagious and its rapid growth has drawn attention towards its early diagnosis. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 enables healthcare professionals and government authorities to break the chain of transition and flatten the epidemic curve. With the number of cases accelerating across the developed world, COVID-19 induced Viral Pneumonia cases is a big challenge. Overlapping of COVID-19 cases with Viral Pneumonia and other lung infections with limited dataset and long training hours is a serious problem to cater. Limited amount of data often results in over-fitting models and due to this reason, model does not predict generalized results. To fill this gap, we proposed GAN-based approach to synthesize images which later fed into the deep learning models to classify images of COVID-19, Normal, and Viral Pneumonia. Specifically, customized Wasserstein GAN is proposed to generate 19% more Chest X-ray images as compare to the real images. This expanded dataset is then used to train four proposed deep learning models: VGG-16, ResNet-50, GoogLeNet and MNAST. The result showed that expanded dataset utilized deep learning models to deliver high classification accuracies. In particular, VGG-16 achieved highest accuracy of 99.17% among all four proposed schemes. Rest of the models like ResNet-50, GoogLeNet and MNAST delivered 93.9%, 94.49% and 97.75% testing accuracies respectively. Later, the efficiency of these models is compared with the state of art models on the basis of accuracy. Further, our proposed models can be applied to address the issue of scant datasets for any problem of image analysis.</description>

      <title>PRISM: Privacy-preserving Inter-Site MRI Harmonization via Disentangled Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-site MRI studies often suffer from site-specific variations arising from differences in methodology, hardware, and acquisition protocols, thereby compromising accuracy and reliability in clinical AI/ML tasks. We present PRISM (Privacy-preserving Inter-Site MRI Harmonization), a novel Deep Learning framework for harmonizing structural brain MRI across multiple sites while preserving data privacy. PRISM employs a dual-branch autoencoder with contrastive learning and variational inference to disentangle anatomical features from style and site-specific variations, enabling unpaired image translation without traveling subjects or multiple MRI modalities. Our modular design allows harmonization to any target site and seamless integration of new sites without the need for retraining or fine-tuning. Using multi-site structural MRI data, we demonstrate PRISM's effectiveness in downstream tasks such as brain tissue segmentation and validate its harmonization performance through multiple experiments. Our framework addresses key challenges in medical AI/ML, including data privacy, distribution shifts, model generalizability and interpretability.

      <title>CASC: Condition-Aware Semantic Communication with Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based semantic communication methods have shown significant advantages in image transmission by harnessing the generative power of diffusion models. However, they still face challenges, including generation randomness that leads to distorted reconstructions and high computational costs. To address these issues, we propose CASC, a condition-aware semantic communication framework that incorporates a latent diffusion model (LDM)-based denoiser. The LDM denoiser at the receiver utilizes the received noisy latent codes as the conditioning signal to reconstruct the latent codes, enabling the decoder to accurately recover the source image. By operating in the latent space, the LDM reduces computational complexity compared to traditional diffusion models (DMs). Additionally, we introduce a condition-aware neural network (CAN) that dynamically adjusts the weights in the hidden layers of the LDM based on the conditioning signal. This enables finer control over the generation process, significantly improving the perceptual quality of the reconstructed images. Experimental results show that CASC significantly outperforms DeepJSCC in both perceptual quality and visual effect. Moreover, CASC reduces inference time by 51.7% compared to existing DM-based semantic communication systems, while maintaining comparable perceptual performance. The ablation studies also validate the effectiveness of the CAN module in improving the image reconstruction quality.</description>

      <title>Enhancing frozen histological section images using permanent-section-guided deep learning with nuclei attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In histological pathology, frozen sections are often used for rapid diagnosis during surgeries, as they can be produced within minutes. However, they suffer from artifacts and often lack crucial diagnostic details, particularly within the cell nuclei region. Permanent sections, on the other hand, contain more diagnostic detail but require a time-intensive preparation process. Here, we present a generative deep learning approach to enhance frozen section images by leveraging guidance from permanent sections. Our method places a strong emphasis on the nuclei region, which contains critical information in both frozen and permanent sections. Importantly, our approach avoids generating artificial data in blank regions, ensuring that the network only enhances existing features without introducing potentially unreliable information. We achieve this through a segmented attention network, incorporating nuclei-segmented images during training and adding an additional loss function to refine the nuclei details in the generated permanent images. We validated our method across various tissues, including kidney, breast, and colon. This approach significantly improves histological efficiency and diagnostic accuracy, enhancing frozen section images within seconds, and seamlessly integrating into existing laboratory workflows.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose to improve image decomposition algorithms in the case of noisy images. In \cite{gilles1,aujoluvw}, the authors propose to separate structures, textures and noise from an image. Unfortunately, the use of separable wavelets shows some artefacts. In this paper, we propose to replace the wavelet transform by the contourlet transform which better approximate geometry in images. For that, we define contourlet spaces and their associated norms. Then, we get an iterative algorithm which we test on two noisy textured images.</description>

      <title>DiffSR: Learning Radar Reflectivity Synthesis via Diffusion Model from Satellite Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weather radar data synthesis can fill in data for areas where ground observations are missing. Existing methods often employ reconstruction-based approaches with MSE loss to reconstruct radar data from satellite observation. However, such methods lead to over-smoothing, which hinders the generation of high-frequency details or high-value observation areas associated with convective weather. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage diffusion-based method called DiffSR. We first pre-train a reconstruction model on global-scale data to obtain radar estimation and then synthesize radar reflectivity by combining radar estimation results with satellite data as conditions for the diffusion model. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, demonstrating the ability to generate high-frequency details and high-value areas.</description>

      <title>360-Degree Video Super Resolution and Quality Enhancement Challenge: Methods and Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Omnidirectional (360-degree) video is rapidly gaining popularity due to advancements in immersive technologies like virtual reality (VR) and extended reality (XR). However, real-time streaming of such videos, especially in live mobile scenarios like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), is challenged by limited bandwidth and strict latency constraints. Traditional methods, such as compression and adaptive resolution, help but often compromise video quality and introduce artifacts that degrade the viewer experience. Additionally, the unique spherical geometry of 360-degree video presents challenges not encountered in traditional 2D video. To address these issues, we initiated the 360-degree Video Super Resolution and Quality Enhancement Challenge. This competition encourages participants to develop efficient machine learning solutions to enhance the quality of low-bitrate compressed 360-degree videos, with two tracks focusing on 2x and 4x super-resolution (SR). In this paper, we outline the challenge framework, detailing the two competition tracks and highlighting the SR solutions proposed by the top-performing models. We assess these models within a unified framework, considering quality enhancement, bitrate gain, and computational efficiency. This challenge aims to drive innovation in real-time 360-degree video streaming, improving the quality and accessibility of immersive visual experiences.</description>

      <title>SynStitch: a Self-Supervised Learning Network for Ultrasound Image Stitching Using Synthetic Training Pairs and Indirect Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound (US) image stitching can expand the field-of-view (FOV) by combining multiple US images from varied probe positions. However, registering US images with only partially overlapping anatomical contents is a challenging task. In this work, we introduce SynStitch, a self-supervised framework designed for 2DUS stitching. SynStitch consists of a synthetic stitching pair generation module (SSPGM) and an image stitching module (ISM). SSPGM utilizes a patch-conditioned ControlNet to generate realistic 2DUS stitching pairs with known affine matrix from a single input image. ISM then utilizes this synthetic paired data to learn 2DUS stitching in a supervised manner. Our framework was evaluated against multiple leading methods on a kidney ultrasound dataset, demonstrating superior 2DUS stitching performance through both qualitative and quantitative analyses. The code will be made public upon acceptance of the paper.</description>

      <title>Maximizing domain generalization in fetal brain tissue segmentation: the role of synthetic data generation, intensity clustering and real image fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fetal brain tissue segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial tool that supports the understanding of neurodevelopment, yet it faces challenges due to the heterogeneity of data coming from different scanners and settings, and due to data scarcity. Recent approaches based on domain randomization, like SynthSeg, have shown a great potential for single source domain generalization, by simulating images with randomized contrast and image resolution from the label maps. In this work, we investigate how to maximize the out-of-domain (OOD) generalization potential of SynthSeg-based methods in fetal brain MRI. Specifically, when studying data generation, we demonstrate that the simple Gaussian mixture models used in SynthSeg enable more robust OOD generalization than physics-informed generation methods. We also investigate how intensity clustering can help create more faithful synthetic images, and observe that it is key to achieving a non-trivial OOD generalization capability when few label classes are available. Finally, by combining for the first time SynthSeg with modern fine-tuning approaches based on weight averaging, we show that fine-tuning a model pre-trained on synthetic data on a few real image-segmentation pairs in a new domain can lead to improvements in the target domain, but also in other domains. We summarize our findings as five key recommendations that we believe can guide practitioners who would like to develop SynthSeg-based approaches in other organs or modalities.</description>

      <title>A Hyperspectral Imaging Dataset and Methodology for Intraoperative Pixel-Wise Classification of Metastatic Colon Cancer in the Liver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) holds significant potential for transforming the field of computational pathology. However, there is currently a shortage of pixel-wise annotated HSI data necessary for training deep learning (DL) models. Additionally, the number of HSI-based research studies remains limited, and in many cases, the advantages of HSI over traditional RGB imaging have not been conclusively demonstrated, particularly for specimens collected intraoperatively. To address these challenges we present a database consisted of 27 HSIs of hematoxylin-eosin stained frozen sections, collected from 14 patients with colon adenocarcinoma metastasized to the liver. It is aimed to validate pixel-wise classification for intraoperative tumor resection. The HSIs were acquired in the spectral range of 450 to 800 nm, with a resolution of 1 nm, resulting in images of 1384x1035 pixels. Pixel-wise annotations were performed by three pathologists. To overcome challenges such as experimental variability and the lack of annotated data, we combined label-propagation-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) with spectral-spatial features extracted by: the multiscale principle of relevant information (MPRI) method and tensor singular spectrum analysis method. Using only 1% of labeled pixels per class the SSL-MPRI method achieved a micro balanced accuracy (BACC) of 0.9313 and a micro F1-score of 0.9235 on the HSI dataset. The performance on corresponding RGB images was lower, with a micro BACC of 0.8809 and a micro F1-score of 0.8688. These improvements are statistically significant. The SSL-MPRI approach outperformed six DL architectures trained with 63% of labeled pixels. Data and code are available at: https://github.com/ikopriva/ColonCancerHSI.</description>

      <title>Beyond Correlation: Evaluating Multimedia Quality Models with the Constrained Concordance Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the evaluation of multimedia quality models, focusing on the inherent uncertainties in subjective Mean Opinion Score (MOS) ratings due to factors like rater inconsistency and bias. Traditional statistical measures such as Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (PCC), Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRCC), and Kendall's Tau (KTAU) often fail to account for these uncertainties, leading to inaccuracies in model performance assessment. We introduce the Constrained Concordance Index (CCI), a novel metric designed to overcome the limitations of existing metrics by considering the statistical significance of MOS differences and excluding comparisons where MOS confidence intervals overlap. Through comprehensive experiments across various domains including speech and image quality assessment, we demonstrate that CCI provides a more robust and accurate evaluation of instrumental quality models, especially in scenarios of low sample sizes, rater group variability, and restriction of range. Our findings suggest that incorporating rater subjectivity and focusing on statistically significant pairs can significantly enhance the evaluation framework for multimedia quality prediction models. This work not only sheds light on the overlooked aspects of subjective rating uncertainties but also proposes a methodological advancement for more reliable and accurate quality model evaluation.</description>

      <title>Utilisation of Vision Systems and Digital Twin for Maintaining Cleanliness in Public Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, the increasing demand for maintaining high cleanliness standards in public spaces results in the search for innovative solutions. The deployment of CCTV systems equipped with modern cameras and software enables not only real-time monitoring of the cleanliness status but also automatic detection of impurities and optimisation of cleaning schedules. The Digital Twin technology allows for the creation of a virtual model of the space, facilitating the simulation, training, and testing of cleanliness management strategies before implementation in the real world. In this paper, we present the utilisation of advanced vision surveillance systems and the Digital Twin technology in cleanliness management, using a railway station as an example. The Digital Twin was created based on an actual 3D model in the Nvidia Omniverse Isaac Sim simulator. A litter detector, bin occupancy level detector, stain segmentation, and a human detector (including the cleaning crew) along with their movement analysis were implemented. A preliminary assessment was conducted, and potential modifications for further enhancement and future development of the system were identified.</description>

      <title>Deep Nonparametric Conditional Independence Tests for Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional independence tests (CITs) test for conditional dependence between random variables. As existing CITs are limited in their applicability to complex, high-dimensional variables such as images, we introduce deep nonparametric CITs (DNCITs). The DNCITs combine embedding maps, which extract feature representations of high-dimensional variables, with nonparametric CITs applicable to these feature representations. For the embedding maps, we derive general properties on their parameter estimators to obtain valid DNCITs and show that these properties include embedding maps learned through (conditional) unsupervised or transfer learning. For the nonparametric CITs, appropriate tests are selected and adapted to be applicable to feature representations. Through simulations, we investigate the performance of the DNCITs for different embedding maps and nonparametric CITs under varying confounder dimensions and confounder relationships. We apply the DNCITs to brain MRI scans and behavioral traits, given confounders, of healthy individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB), confirming null results from a number of ambiguous personality neuroscience studies with a larger data set and with our more powerful tests. In addition, in a confounder control study, we apply the DNCITs to brain MRI scans and a confounder set to test for sufficient confounder control, leading to a potential reduction in the confounder dimension under improved confounder control compared to existing state-of-the-art confounder control studies for the UKB. Finally, we provide an R package implementing the DNCITs.</description>

      <title>SamRobNODDI: Q-Space Sampling-Augmented Continuous Representation Learning for Robust and Generalized NODDI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) microstructure estimation from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is of great significance for the discovery and treatment of various neurological diseases. Current deep learning-based methods accelerate the speed of NODDI parameter estimation and improve the accuracy. However, most methods require the number and coordinates of gradient directions during testing and training to remain strictly consistent, significantly limiting the generalization and robustness of these models in NODDI parameter estimation. In this paper, we propose a q-space sampling augmentation-based continuous representation learning framework (SamRobNODDI) to achieve robust and generalized NODDI. Specifically, a continuous representation learning method based on q-space sampling augmentation is introduced to fully explore the information between different gradient directions in q-space. Furthermore, we design a sampling consistency loss to constrain the outputs of different sampling schemes, ensuring that the outputs remain as consistent as possible, thereby further enhancing performance and robustness to varying q-space sampling schemes. SamRobNODDI is also a flexible framework that can be applied to different backbone networks. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compared it with 7 state-of-the-art methods across 18 different q-space sampling schemes, demonstrating that the proposed SamRobNODDI has better performance, robustness, generalization, and flexibility.</description>

      <title>Improved Video VAE for Latent Video Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational Autoencoder (VAE) aims to compress pixel data into low-dimensional latent space, playing an important role in OpenAI's Sora and other latent video diffusion generation models. While most of existing video VAEs inflate a pretrained image VAE into the 3D causal structure for temporal-spatial compression, this paper presents two astonishing findings: (1) The initialization from a well-trained image VAE with the same latent dimensions suppresses the improvement of subsequent temporal compression capabilities. (2) The adoption of causal reasoning leads to unequal information interactions and unbalanced performance between frames. To alleviate these problems, we propose a keyframe-based temporal compression (KTC) architecture and a group causal convolution (GCConv) module to further improve video VAE (IV-VAE). Specifically, the KTC architecture divides the latent space into two branches, in which one half completely inherits the compression prior of keyframes from a lower-dimension image VAE while the other half involves temporal compression through 3D group causal convolution, reducing temporal-spatial conflicts and accelerating the convergence speed of video VAE. The GCConv in above 3D half uses standard convolution within each frame group to ensure inter-frame equivalence, and employs causal logical padding between groups to maintain flexibility in processing variable frame video. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate the SOTA video reconstruction and generation capabilities of the proposed IV-VAE (https://wpy1999.github.io/IV-VAE/).</description>

      <title>High-Frequency Enhanced Hybrid Neural Representation for Video Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV) have simplified the video codec process and achieved swift decoding speeds by encoding video content into a neural network, presenting a promising solution for video compression. However, existing work overlooks the crucial issue that videos reconstructed by these methods lack high-frequency details. To address this problem, this paper introduces a High-Frequency Enhanced Hybrid Neural Representation Network. Our method focuses on leveraging high-frequency information to improve the synthesis of fine details by the network. Specifically, we design a wavelet high-frequency encoder that incorporates Wavelet Frequency Decomposer (WFD) blocks to generate high-frequency feature embeddings. Next, we design the High-Frequency Feature Modulation (HFM) block, which leverages the extracted high-frequency embeddings to enhance the fitting process of the decoder. Finally, with the refined Harmonic decoder block and a Dynamic Weighted Frequency Loss, we further reduce the potential loss of high-frequency information. Experiments on the Bunny and UVG datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other methods, showing notable improvements in detail preservation and compression performance.</description>

      <title>Effect sizes as a statistical feature-selector-based learning to detect breast cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breast cancer detection is still an open research field, despite a tremendous effort devoted to work in this area. Effect size is a statistical concept that measures the strength of the relationship between two variables on a numeric scale. Feature selection is widely used to reduce the dimensionality of data by selecting only a subset of predictor variables to improve a learning model. In this work, an algorithm and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of developing a statistical feature-selector-based learning tool capable of reducing the data dimensionality using parametric effect size measures from features extracted from cell nuclei images. The SVM classifier with a linear kernel as a learning tool achieved an accuracy of over 90%. These excellent results suggest that the effect size is within the standards of the feature-selector methods</description>

      <title>Classification of residential and non-residential buildings based on satellite data using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate classification of buildings into residential and non-residential categories is crucial for urban planning, infrastructure development, population estimation and resource allocation. It is a complex job to carry out automatic classification of residential and nonresidential buildings manually using satellite data. In this paper, we are proposing a novel deep learning approach that combines high-resolution satellite data (50 cm resolution Image + 1m grid interval DEM) and vector data to achieve high-performance building classification. Our architecture leverages LeakyReLU and ReLU activations to capture nonlinearities in the data and employs feature-engineering techniques to eliminate highly correlated features, resulting in improved computational efficiency. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving an impressive overall F1 -score of 0.9936. The proposed approach offers a scalable and accurate solution for building classification, enabling informed decision-making in urban planning and resource allocation. This research contributes to the field of urban analysis by providing a valuable tool for understanding the built environment and optimizing resource utilization.</description>

      <title>Data-driven discovery of mechanical models directly from MRI spectral data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding interpretable biomechanical models can provide insight into the functionality of organs with regard to physiology and disease. However, identifying broadly applicable dynamical models for in vivo tissue remains challenging. In this proof of concept study we propose a reconstruction framework for data-driven discovery of dynamical models from experimentally obtained undersampled MRI spectral data. The method makes use of the previously developed spectro-dynamic framework which allows for reconstruction of displacement fields at high spatial and temporal resolution required for model identification. The proposed framework combines this method with data-driven discovery of interpretable models using Sparse Identification of Non-linear Dynamics (SINDy). The design of the reconstruction algorithm is such that a symbiotic relation between the reconstruction of the displacement fields and the model identification is created. Our method does not rely on periodicity of the motion. It is successfully validated using spectral data of a dynamic phantom gathered on a clinical MRI scanner. The dynamic phantom is programmed to perform motion adhering to 5 different (non-linear) ordinary differential equations. The proposed framework performed better than a 2-step approach where the displacement fields were first reconstructed from the undersampled data without any information on the model, followed by data-driven discovery of the model using the reconstructed displacement fields. This study serves as a first step in the direction of data-driven discovery of in vivo models.</description>

Abstract: Current deep learning-based approaches to lesion segmentation in neuroimaging often depend on high-resolution images and extensive annotated data, limiting clinical applicability. This paper introduces a novel synthetic data framework tailored for stroke lesion segmentation, expanding the SynthSeg methodology to incorporate lesion-specific augmentations that simulate diverse pathological features. Using a modified nnUNet architecture, our approach trains models with label maps from healthy and stroke datasets, facilitating segmentation across both normal and pathological tissue without reliance on specific sequence-based training. Evaluation across in-domain and out-of-domain (OOD) datasets reveals that our method matches state-of-the-art performance within the training domain and significantly outperforms existing methods on OOD data. By minimizing dependence on large annotated datasets and allowing for cross-sequence applicability, our framework holds potential to improve clinical neuroimaging workflows, particularly in stroke pathology.

Abstract: The abundance of information present in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) renders them an essential tool for survival analysis. Several Multiple Instance Learning frameworks proposed for this task utilize a ResNet50 backbone pre-trained on natural images. By leveraging recenetly released histopathological foundation models such as UNI and Hibou, the predictive prowess of existing MIL networks can be enhanced. Furthermore, deploying an ensemble of digital pathology foundation models yields higher baseline accuracy, although the benefits appear to diminish with more complex MIL architectures. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Precision Mapping and Component-Specific Feature Enhancement for Breast Cancer Segmentation and Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02844v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and demands the critical need for early and accurate diagnostic tools. Ultrasound imaging is a widely used modality for breast cancer screening, yet the precise segmentation and classification of tumors in these images are challenging due to variations in tumor morphology and image quality. To address these challenges, we propose novel deep learning (DL) frameworks leveraging a precision mapping mechanism (PMM) along with a component-specific feature enhancement module (CSFEM) to improve breast cancer lesion segmentation and identification. Our PPM ensures that the segmentation accurately reflects the true shape and extent of the tumor by meticulously delineating their boundaries. The CSFEM focuses on extracting and amplifying features unique to different tumor types, enabling the model to effectively distinguish between benign, malignant, and normal tissues. Integrating PMM and CSFEM into our segmentation model yielded an accuracy of 98.1%, an IoU of 96.9%, and a Dice Coefficient of 97.2%. Similarly, our classification model achieved an accuracy of 99.2%, with F1-score, precision, and recall values of 99.1%, 99.3%, and 99.1%, respectively. Our results indicate significant improvement in evaluation metrics in comparison to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrating the effectiveness of precision mapping and component-specific feature enhancement in advancing breast cancer lesion analysis.</description>

      <title>MSA$^2$Net: Multi-scale Adaptive Attention-guided Network for Medical Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation involves identifying and separating object instances in a medical image to delineate various tissues and structures, a task complicated by the significant variations in size, shape, and density of these features. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have traditionally been used for this task but have limitations in capturing long-range dependencies. Transformers, equipped with self-attention mechanisms, aim to address this problem. However, in medical image segmentation it is beneficial to merge both local and global features to effectively integrate feature maps across various scales, capturing both detailed features and broader semantic elements for dealing with variations in structures. In this paper, we introduce MSA$^2$Net, a new deep segmentation framework featuring an expedient design of skip-connections. These connections facilitate feature fusion by dynamically weighting and combining coarse-grained encoder features with fine-grained decoder feature maps. Specifically, we propose a Multi-Scale Adaptive Spatial Attention Gate (MASAG), which dynamically adjusts the receptive field (Local and Global contextual information) to ensure that spatially relevant features are selectively highlighted while minimizing background distractions. Extensive evaluations involving dermatology, and radiological datasets demonstrate that our MSA$^2$Net outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) works or matches their performance.

      <title>COSMIC: Compress Satellite Images Efficiently via Diffusion Compensation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapidly increasing number of satellites in space and their enhanced capabilities, the amount of earth observation images collected by satellites is exceeding the transmission limits of satellite-to-ground links. Although existing learned image compression solutions achieve remarkable performance by using a sophisticated encoder to extract fruitful features as compression and using a decoder to reconstruct, it is still hard to directly deploy those complex encoders on current satellites' embedded GPUs with limited computing capability and power supply to compress images in orbit. In this paper, we propose COSMIC, a simple yet effective learned compression solution to transmit satellite images. We first design a lightweight encoder (i.e. reducing FLOPs by 2.6~5x) on satellite to achieve a high image compression ratio to save satellite-to-ground links. Then, for reconstructions on the ground, to deal with the feature extraction ability degradation due to simplifying encoders, we propose a diffusion-based model to compensate image details when decoding. Our insight is that satellite's earth observation photos are not just images but indeed multi-modal data with a nature of Text-to-Image pairing since they are collected with rich sensor data (e.g. coordinates, timestamp, etc.) that can be used as the condition for diffusion generation. Extensive experiments show that COSMIC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both perceptual and distortion metrics.</description>

      <title>Multi-Stage Airway Segmentation in Lung CT Based on Multi-scale Nested Residual UNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and complete segmentation of airways in chest CT images is essential for the quantitative assessment of lung diseases and the facilitation of pulmonary interventional procedures. Although deep learning has led to significant advancements in medical image segmentation, maintaining airway continuity remains particularly challenging. This difficulty arises primarily from the small and dispersed nature of airway structures, as well as class imbalance in CT scans. To address these challenges, we designed a Multi-scale Nested Residual U-Net (MNR-UNet), incorporating multi-scale inputs and Residual Multi-scale Modules (RMM) into a nested residual framework to enhance information flow, effectively capturing the intricate details of small airways and mitigating gradient vanishing. Building on this, we developed a three-stage segmentation pipeline to optimize the training of the MNR-UNet. The first two stages prioritize high accuracy and sensitivity, while the third stage focuses on repairing airway breakages to balance topological completeness and correctness. To further address class imbalance, we introduced a weighted Breakage-Aware Loss (wBAL) to heighten focus on challenging samples, penalizing breakages and thereby extending the length of the airway tree. Additionally, we proposed a hierarchical evaluation framework to offer more clinically meaningful analysis. Validation on both in-house and public datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves superior performance in detecting more accurate airway voxels and identifying additional branches, significantly improving airway topological completeness. The code will be released publicly following the publication of the paper.</description>

Abstract: This study employed over 100 hours of high-altitude drone video data from eight intersections in Hohhot to generate a unique and extensive dataset encompassing high-density urban road intersections in China. This research has enhanced the YOLOUAV model to enable precise target recognition on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) datasets. An automated calibration algorithm is presented to create a functional dataset in high-density traffic flows, which saves human and material resources. This algorithm can capture up to 200 vehicles per frame while accurately tracking over 1 million road users, including cars, buses, and trucks. Moreover, the dataset has recorded over 50,000 complete lane changes. It is the largest publicly available road user trajectories in high-density urban intersections. Furthermore, this paper updates speed and acceleration algorithms based on UAV elevation and implements a UAV offset correction algorithm. A case study demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed methods, showing essential parameters to evaluate intersections and traffic conditions in traffic engineering. The model can track more than 200 vehicles of different types simultaneously in highly dense traffic on an urban intersection in Hohhot, generating heatmaps based on spatial-temporal traffic flow data and locating traffic conflicts by conducting lane change analysis and surrogate measures. With the diverse data and high accuracy of results, this study aims to advance research and development of UAVs in transportation significantly.

Abstract: In breast cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) provides a standard treatment option for patients who have locally advanced cancer and some large operable tumors. A patient will have better prognosis when he has achieved a pathological complete response (pCR) with the treatment of NAC. There has been a trend to directly predict pCR to NAC from histological images based on deep learning (DL). However, the DL-based predictive models numerically have better performances in internal validation than in external validation. In this paper, we aim to alleviate this situation with an intrinsic approach. We propose an experts' cognition-driven ensemble deep learning (ECDEDL) approach. Taking the cognition of both pathology and artificial intelligence experts into consideration to improve the generalization of the predictive model to the external validation, ECDEDL can intrinsically approximate the working paradigm of a human being which will refer to his various working experiences to make decisions. ECDEDL was validated with 695 WSIs collected from the same center as the primary dataset to develop the predictive model and perform the internal validation, and was also validated with 340 WSIs collected from other three centers as the external dataset to perform the external validation. In external validation, ECDEDL improves the AUCs of pCR prediction from 61.52(59.80-63.26) to 67.75(66.74-68.80) and the Accuracies of pCR prediction from 56.09(49.39-62.79) to 71.01(69.44-72.58). ECDEDL was quite effective for external validation of predicting pCR to NAC from histological images in breast cancer, numerically approximating the internal validation.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot Plug-and-Play Methods for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The utilisation of Plug-and-Play (PnP) priors in inverse problems has become increasingly prominent in recent years. This preference is based on the mathematical equivalence between the general proximal operator and the regularised denoiser, facilitating the adaptation of various off-the-shelf denoiser priors to a wide range of inverse problems. However, existing PnP models predominantly rely on pre-trained denoisers using large datasets. In this work, we introduce Single-Shot PnP methods (SS-PnP), shifting the focus to solving inverse problems with minimal data. First, we integrate Single-Shot proximal denoisers into iterative methods, enabling training with single instances. Second, we propose implicit neural priors based on a novel function that preserves relevant frequencies to capture fine details while avoiding the issue of vanishing gradients. We demonstrate, through extensive numerical and visual experiments, that our method leads to better approximations.</description>

      <title>Event-horizon-scale Imaging of M87* under Different Assumptions via Deep Generative Image Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02785</link>

Abstract: Reconstructing images from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87, depends on a prior to impose desired image statistics. However, given the impossibility of directly observing black holes, there is no clear choice for a prior. We present a framework for flexibly designing a range of priors, each bringing different biases to the image reconstruction. These priors can be weak (e.g., impose only basic natural-image statistics) or strong (e.g., impose assumptions of black-hole structure). Our framework uses Bayesian inference with score-based priors, which are data-driven priors arising from a deep generative model that can learn complicated image distributions. Using our Bayesian imaging approach with sophisticated data-driven priors, we can assess how visual features and uncertainty of reconstructed images change depending on the prior. In addition to simulated data, we image the real EHT M87* data and discuss how recovered features are influenced by the choice of prior.</description>

      <title>RSNet: A Light Framework for The Detection of Multi-scale Remote Sensing Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23073</link>

Abstract: Recent advancements in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ship detection using deep learning have significantly improved accuracy and speed, yet effectively detecting small objects in complex backgrounds with fewer parameters remains a challenge. This letter introduces RSNet, a lightweight framework constructed to enhance ship detection in SAR imagery. To ensure accuracy with fewer parameters, we proposed Waveletpool-ContextGuided (WCG) as its backbone, guiding global context understanding through multi-scale wavelet features for effective detection in complex scenes. Additionally, Waveletpool-StarFusion (WSF) is introduced as the neck, employing a residual wavelet element-wise multiplication structure to achieve higher dimensional nonlinear features without increasing network width. The Lightweight-Shared (LS) module is designed as detect components to achieve efficient detection through lightweight shared convolutional structure and multi-format compatibility. Experiments on the SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) and High-Resolution SAR Image Dataset (HRSID) demonstrate that RSNet achieves a strong balance between lightweight design and detection performance, surpassing many state-of-the-art detectors, reaching 72.5\% and 67.6\% in \textbf{\(\mathbf{mAP_{.50:.95}}\) }respectively with 1.49M parameters. Our code will be released soon.</description>
