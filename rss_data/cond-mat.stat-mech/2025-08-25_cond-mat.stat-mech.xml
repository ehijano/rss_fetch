      <title>Interpretability of linear regression models of glassy dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven models can accurately describe and predict the dynamical properties of glass-forming liquids from structural data. Accurate predictions, however, do not guarantee an understanding of the underlying physical phenomena and the key factors that control them. In this paper, we illustrate the merits and limitations of linear regression models of glassy dynamics built on high-dimensional structural descriptors. By analyzing data for a two-dimensional glass model, we show that several descriptors commonly used in glass-transition studies display multicollinearity, which hinders the interpretability of linear models. Ridge regression suppresses some of the shortcomings of multicollinearity, but its solutions are not succinct enough to be physically interpretable. Only by using dimensional reduction techniques we eventually obtain linear models that strike a balance between prediction accuracy and interpretability. Our analysis points to a key role of local packing and composition fluctuations in the glass model under study.</description>

      <title>Universal Fluctuations in the Tail Probability for d=2 Random Walks in Space-Time Random Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many diffusive systems involve correlated random walkers due to a shared environment. Such systems can be modeled as random walks in random environments (RWRE). These models differ from classical diffusion in the behavior of the extremes -- the walkers that move the fastest or farthest. In spatial dimension $d=1$ RWRE models have been well studied numerically and analytically and exhibit universal behavior in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. Here, we study discrete lattice RWRE models in $d=2$. We find that the tail probability exhibits a different universal scaling form, which is nevertheless characterized by the same coefficient, $\lambda_\mathrm{ext}$, as in the $d=1$ case. We observe a critical scaling regime for fluctuations in the tail probability at positions that scale linearly in time.</description>

      <title>Power-law correction in the probability density function of the critical Ising magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the critical point, the probability density function of the Ising magnetization is believed to decay like $\exp{(-x^{\delta+1})}$, where $\delta$ is the Ising critical exponent that controls the decay to zero of the magnetization in a vanishing external field. In this paper, we discuss the presence of a power-law correction $x^{\frac{\delta-1}{2}}$, which has been debated in the physics literature. We argue that whether such a correction is present or not is related to the asymptotic behavior of a function that measures the extent to which the average magnetization of a finite system with an external field is influenced by the boundary conditions. Our discussion is informed by a mixture of heuristic calculations and rigorous results. Along the way, we review some recent results on the critical Ising model and prove properties of the average magnetization in two dimensions which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Quantifying time in Monte Carlo simulations: application to relaxation processes and AC susceptibilities of magnetic nanoparticles assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the response of magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) assemblies to an external alternating magnetic field is of great interest for applications such as hyperthermia. The key quantity here is the complex susceptibility and its behavior in terms of temperature and frequency. From a theoretical point of view it can be obtained by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation with the time quantified Monte Carlo (TQMC) method if a physical time is associated with the MC step. Here we revisit this method by showing that the time unit can be derived from the MC stochastic process of the isolated particle. We first obtain a MC unit of time from the relaxation of the system at fixed temperature. Then this unit of time is used to compute complex susceptibilities. We show that it is now possible to match the TQMC results with actual experimental results regarding frequency dependent in phase susceptibilities and quantify the unit of time in seconds. Finally we show that the time unit obtained for the isolated particle remains valid when considering interacting particles such as the Heisenberg coupling or dipole dipole interactions.</description>

      <title>Correlation thresholds in the steady states of particle systems and spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing body of theoretical and empirical evidence shows that the global steady-state distributions of many equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems approximately satisfy an analogue of the Boltzmann distribution, with a local dynamical property of states playing the role of energy. The correlation between the effective potential of the steady-state distribution and the logarithm of the exit rates determines the quality of this approximation. We demonstrate and explain this phenomenon in a simple one-dimensional particle system and in random dynamics of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass by providing the first explicit estimates of this correlation. We find that, as parameters of the dynamics vary, each system exhibits a threshold above and below which the correlation dramatically differs. We explain how these thresholds arise from underlying transitions in the relationship between the local and global "parts" of the effective potential.</description>

      <title>Exploring null-entropy events: What do we learn when nothing happens?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16528v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuation theorems establish that thermodynamic processes at the microscale can occasionally result in negative entropy production. At the microscale, another distinct possibility becomes more likely: processes where no entropy is produced overall. In this work, we explore the constraints imposed by such null-entropy events on the fluctuations of thermodynamic currents. By incorporating the probability of null-entropy events, we obtain tighter bounds on finite-time thermodynamic uncertainty relations derived from fluctuation theorems. We validate this framework using an example of a qudit SWAP engine.</description>

      <title>Breaking global symmetries with locality-preserving operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the general framework of quantum resource theories, one typically only distinguishes between operations that can or cannot generate the resource of interest. In many-body settings, one can further characterize quantum operations based on underlying geometrical constraints, and a natural question is to understand the power of resource-generating operations that preserve locality. In this work, we address this question within the resource theory of asymmetry, which has recently found applications in the study of many-body symmetry-breaking and symmetry-restoration phenomena. We consider symmetries corresponding to both abelian and non-abelian compact groups with a homogeneous action on the space of $N$ qubits, focusing on the prototypical examples of $U(1)$ and $SU(2)$. We study the so-called $G$-asymmetry $\Delta S^{G}_N$, and present two main results. First, we derive a general bound on the asymmetry that can be generated by locality-preserving operations acting on product states. We prove that, in any spatial dimension, $\Delta S^{G}_N\leq (1/2)\Delta S^{G, \rm max}_N[1+o(1)]$, where $\Delta S^{G, \rm max}_N$ is the maximum value of the $G$-asymmetry in the full many-body Hilbert space. Second, we show that locality-preserving operations can generate maximal asymmetry, $\Delta S^{G}_N\sim\Delta S^{G, \rm max}_N$, when applied to symmetric states featuring long-range entanglement. Our results provide a unified perspective on recent studies of asymmetry in many-body physics, highlighting a non-trivial interplay between asymmetry, locality, and entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noise threads every scale of the natural world. Once dismissed as mere background hiss, it is now recognized as both a currency of information and a source of order in systems driven far from equilibrium. From nanometer-scale motor proteins to meter-scale bird flocks, active collectives harness noise to break symmetry, explore decision landscapes, and poise themselves at the cusp where sensitivity and robustness coexist. We review the physics that underpins this paradox: how energy-consuming feedback rectifies stochastic fluctuations, how multiplicative noise seeds patterns and state transitions, and how living ensembles average the residual errors. Bridging single-molecule calorimetry, critical flocking, and robophysical swarms, we propose a unified view in which noise is not background blur but a tunable resource for adaptation and emergent order in biology and engineered active matter.</description>

      <title>Modular Properties of $\mathcal{W}_3$ Generalised Gibbs Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we make a proposal for the solution to a long-standing problem - the asymptotic expansions of the modular $S$-transform of a generalised Gibbs ensemble (GGE) in a theory with $\mathcal{W}_3$ symmetry where the GGE includes the first non-trivial charge. Equivalently, we give a proposal for the modular $S$-transform of traces of arbitrary powers of the zero mode $W_0$. We provide evidence in the form of exact results using Zhu's recursion, results obtained using conjectured results for Verma modules, and exact results for the particular value $c=-2$. We expect these have generalisations to other symmetry algebras/hierarchies such as the Virasoro algebra/KdV charges, and to GGEs with arbitrary finite sets of charges.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Approximation of Dynamics on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world phenomena can be modelled as dynamical processes on networks, a prominent example being the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Mean-field approximations are a widely used tool to analyse such dynamical processes on networks, but these are typically derived using plausible probabilistic reasoning, introducing uncontrolled errors that may lead to invalid mathematical conclusions. In this paper we present a rigorous approach to derive mean-field approximations from the exact description of Markov chain dynamics on networks through a process of averaging called approximate lumping. We consider a general class of Markov chain dynamics on networks in which each vertex can adopt a finite number of ``vertex-states'' (e.g. susceptible, infected, recovered etc.), and transition rates depend on the number of neighbours of each type. Our approximate lumping is based on counting the number of each type of vertex-state in subsets of vertices, and this results in a density dependent population process. In the large graph limit, this reduces to a low dimensional system of ordinary differential equations, special cases of which are well known mean-field approximations. Our approach provides a general framework for the derivation of mean-field approximations of dynamics on networks that unifies previously disconnected approaches and highlights the sources of error.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher information as a witness of non-Markovianity and criticality in the spin-boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum Fisher information, the quantum analogue of the classical Fisher information, is a central quantity in quantum metrology and quantum sensing because of its connection to parameter estimation and fidelity susceptibility. Using numerically exact methods applied to a paradigmatic open quantum system, the spin-boson model, we calculate both static and dynamical quantum Fisher information matrix elements with respect to spin-bath couplings and magnetic field strengths. As the spin-bath interaction increases, we first show that the coupling-coupling matrix elements relative to the ground state of the Hamiltonian serve as a genuine witness of bipartite entanglement and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition through their non-monotonic behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the time-dependent matrix elements can reveal non-Markovian effects as well as the transition from the coherent to incoherent regime at the Toulouse point. In the paradigmatic spin-boson model, the non-monotonic features of the quantum Fisher information matrix signal changes in quantum resources such as entanglement and coherence, quantify non-Markovian behavior, and enable criticality-enhanced quantum sensing, thereby shedding light on key features of open quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: We characterize monitored quantum dynamics in a solvable model exhibiting a phase transition between a measurement apparatus and a scrambler. We show that approximate decoherent histories emerge in both phases with respect to a coarse-grained extensive observable. However, the apparatus phase, where quantum Darwinism emerges, is distinguished by the non-ergodicity of the histories and their correlation with the measured qubit, which selects an ensemble of preferred pointer states. Our results demonstrate a clear distinction between two notion of classicality, decoherent histories and environment-induced decoherence.</description>

      <title>ML-PWS: Estimating the Mutual Information Between Experimental Time Series Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to quantify information transmission is crucial for the analysis and design of natural and engineered systems. The information transmission rate is the fundamental measure for systems with time-varying signals, yet computing it is extremely challenging. In particular, the rate cannot be obtained directly from experimental time-series data without approximations, because of the high dimensionality of the signal trajectory space. Path Weight Sampling (PWS) is a computational technique that makes it possible to obtain the information rate exactly for any stochastic system. However, it requires a mathematical model of the system of interest, be it described by a master equation or a set of differential equations. Here, we present a technique that employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop a generative model from experimental time-series data, which is then combined with PWS to obtain the information rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of this technique, called ML-PWS, by comparing its results on synthetic time-series data generated from a non-linear model against ground-truth results obtained by applying PWS directly to the same model. We illustrate the utility of ML-PWS by applying it to neuronal time-series data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have enjoyed substantial progress in capturing properties of complex quantum systems by means of random tensor networks (RTNs), which form ensembles of quantum states that depend only on the tensor network geometry and bond dimensions. Of particular interest are RTNs on hyperbolic geometries, with local tensors typically chosen from the unitary Haar measure, that model critical boundary states of holographic bulk-boundary dualities. In this work, we elevate static pictures of ensemble averages to a dynamical one, to show that RTN states exhibit equilibration of time-averaged operator expectation values under a highly generic class of Hamiltonians with non-degenerate spectra. We prove that RTN states generally equilibrate at large bond dimension and also in the scaling limit for three classes of geometries: Those of matrix product states, regular hyperbolic tilings, and single "black hole" tensors. Furthermore, we prove a hierarchy of equilibration between finite-dimensional instances of these classes for bulk and boundary states with small entanglement. This suggests an equivalent hierarchy between corresponding many-body phases, and reproduces a holographic degree-of-freedom counting for the effective dimension of each system. These results demonstrate that RTN techniques can probe aspects of late-time dynamics of quantum many-body phases and suggest a new approach to describing aspects of holographic dualities using techniques from statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Critical Motility-Induced Phase Separation in Three Dimensions is Consistent with Ising Universality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying the universality class of critical active phase transitions has been the subject of recent interest and controversy. Resolving these controversies will require robust numerical investigations to determine whether active critical exponents point to novel universality classes or are consistent with established ones. Here, we conduct large-scale computer simulations and a finite-size scaling analysis of motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) in three dimensions (3D), finding that the static and dynamic critical exponents all closely match those of the 3D Ising universality class with a conserved scalar order parameter. This finding is corroborated by a fluctuating hydrodynamic description of the critical dynamics of the order parameter field which flows to the Wilson-Fisher fixed point in three dimensions. Our work suggests that 3D MIPS and likely the entire phase diagram of active Brownian spheres is similar to that of molecular passive fluids despite the absence of Boltzmann statistics.</description>

      <title>Liquid-Gas Criticality of Hyperuniform Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In statistical physics, it is well established that the liquid-gas (LG) phase transition with divergent critical fluctuations belongs to the Ising universality class. Whether non-equilibrium effects can alter this universal behavior remains a fundamental open question. Here, we theoretically investigate LG criticality in a hyperuniform (HU) fluid of active spinners, where phase separation is driven by dissipative collisions. Strikingly, at the critical point the HU fluid displays normal Gaussian density fluctuations rather than the expected divergence, while the compressibility still diverges. The system is thus calm yet highly susceptible, in fundamental violation of the conventional fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Consistently, we observe anomalous zero-range correlation functions coexisting with quasi-long-range response functions. Based on a generalized model B and renormalization-group analysis, we show that hyperuniformity reduces the upper critical dimension from $d_c = 4$ to $d_c = 2$, and the system exhibits anomalous finite-size scaling in density fluctuations, energy fluctuations, and the Binder cumulant. Furthermore, the HU fluid undergoes non-classical spinodal decomposition, where the decomposition time diverges but the characteristic length scale remains finite as criticality is approached. The origin of these anomalies lies in the center-of-mass-conserving dynamics of the spinners, which endows the system with a scale-dependent effective temperature, $T_{\rm eff} \propto q^2$, underlying a generalized fluctuation-dissipation relationship. These findings establish a striking exception to classical paradigms of critical phenomena and illustrate how non-equilibrium forces can fundamentally reshape universality classes.</description>

      <title>Description using equilibrium temperature in the canonical ensemble within the framework of the Tsallis statistics with the conventional expectation value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied the thermodynamic quantities and the probability distribution, expressing the probability distribution as a function of the energy, in the canonical ensemble within the framework of the Tsallis statistics, which is characterized by the entropic parameter $q$, with the conventional expectation value. We treat the power-law-like distribution. The equilibrium temperature, which is often called the physical temperature, is employed to describe the probability distribution. The Tsallis statistics represented by the equilibrium temperature was applied to $N$ harmonic oscillators, where $N$ is the number of the oscillators. The expressions of the energy, the Tsallis entropy, and the heat capacity were obtained. The expressions of these quantities and the expression of the probability distribution were obtained when the differences between adjacent energy levels are the same. These quantities and the distributions were numerically calculated. The $q$ dependences of the energy, the R\'enyi entropy, and the heat capacity are weak. In contrast, the Tsallis entropy depends on $q$. The probability distribution as a function of the energy depends on $N$ and $q$.</description>

      <title>Analytical Theory of Chiral Active Particle Transport in a Fluctuating Density Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a closed-form analytical theory for the transport of a chiral active Brownian particle (cABP) in three dimensions, moving through a fluctuating local density field that coarse-grains steric and dynamical interactions in a dense active medium. The density field is modeled as an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process with finite correlation time $\tau$ and fluctuation strength $\sigma_\rho^2$, capturing both spatial variations and temporal memory. Within this framework, we derive exact expressions for the mean-squared displacement (MSD) and time-dependent diffusivity, showing how chirality and density coupling renormalize orientational persistence and generate dynamical crossovers. The theory predicts: (i) anomalously high initial diffusivity in denser regions, arising from a transient drift driven by local swim-pressure gradients; (ii) a finite crossover time $t_c$ for homogenizing density inhomogeneities, with steady-state diffusivity retaining memory of the initial environment; (iii) a non-monotonic $t_c(\Omega)$ with a global minimum at intermediate chirality, and a three-regime suppression of $D_\infty(\Omega)$ consistent with clustered phases in simulations; and (iv) a resonance-like peak in early-time oscillatory transport at an optimal chirality $\Omega^*$. The framework reproduces known scaling of $D_\infty$ with activity and chirality, while uncovering new memory effects and chirality-controlled optimal transport, offering predictive insight for biological circle swimmers and active metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Quantum stochastic thermodynamics in the mesoscopic-leads formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a numerical method to sample the distributions of charge, heat, and entropy production in open quantum systems coupled strongly to macroscopic reservoirs, with both temporal and energy resolution and beyond the linear-response regime. Our method exploits the mesoscopic-leads formulation, where macroscopic reservoirs are modeled by a finite collection of modes that are continuously damped toward thermal equilibrium by an appropriate Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation. Focussing on non-interacting fermionic systems, we access the time-resolved full counting statistics through a trajectory unraveling of the master equation. We show that the integral fluctuation theorems for the total entropy production, as well as the martingale and uncertainty entropy production, hold. Furthermore, we investigate the fluctuations of the dissipated heat in finite-time information erasure. Conceptually, our approach extends the continuous-time trajectory description of quantum stochastic thermodynamics beyond the regime of weak system-environment coupling.</description>

      <title>Symmetry classification correspondence between quadratic Lindbladians and their steady states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry classification is crucial in understanding universal properties of quantum matter. Recently, the scope of symmetry classification has been extended to open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation. However, the classification of Lindbladians and steady states remains largely separate. Because the former requires the non-Hermitian classification framework, while the latter relies on the classification scheme for Hermitian matrices. In this paper we build connections between symmetry classes of quadratic Lindbladian and its steady state, despite their different classification frameworks. We classify the full matrix representation of generic quadratic Lindbladians with particle conservation, showing they fall into 27 non-Hermitian symmetry classes. Among these, 22 classes lead to an infinite-temperature steady state. The remaining five classes have one-to-one correspondence with five steady-state Hermitian symmetry classes. Numerical simulations of random Lindbladian dynamics confirm the convergence to the correct steady-state symmetry classes at long time.</description>

      <title>Fixation and extinction in time-fluctuating spatially structured metapopulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bacteria evolve in volatile environments and complex spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations and environmental variability therefore have a significant impact on the evolution of microbial populations. Here, we consider a class of spatially explicit metapopulation models arranged as regular (circulation) graphs where wild-type and mutant cells compete in a time-fluctuating environment where demes (subpopulations) are connected by slow cell migration. The carrying capacity is the same at each deme and endlessly switches between two values associated to harsh and mild environmental conditions. It is known that environmental variability can lead to population bottlenecks, following which the population is prone to fluctuation-induced extinction. Here, we analyse how slow migration, spatial structure, and fluctuations affect the phenomena of fixation and extinction on clique, cycle, and square lattice metapopulations. When the carrying capacity remains large, bottlenecks are weak and deme extinction can be ignored. The dynamics is thus captured by a coarse-grained description within which the probability and mean time of fixation are obtained analytically. This allows us to show that, in contrast to static environments, the mutant fixation probability depends on the rate of migration. We also show that the fixation probability and mean fixation time can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the switching rate. When the carrying capacity is small under harsh conditions, bottlenecks are strong, and the metapopulation evolution is shaped by the coupling of deme extinction and strain competition. This yields rich dynamical scenarios, among which we identify the best conditions to eradicate mutants without dooming the metapopulation to extinction. We offer an interpretation of these findings in the context of an idealised treatment strategy and discuss possible generalisations of our models.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of effective actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17851v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the same quantum field theory distinct effective actions can be obtained by coupling sources to different choices of field variables. This is the same as considering effective actions for theories related by a change of variables and thus differ only by the values of so called inessential couplings. The effective actions will appear quite different since they generate correlation functions of different operators. Here we show that the effective actions are related by an implicit change of variables of the mean field, i.e. the argument of the effective action. Conversely, one can go the other way: by making a change of variables of the mean variable we obtain a new effective action which generates correlation functions of an implicitly defined composite field. The existence of the implicit transformations in both cases rests on the existence of solutions to initial value problems where the ``time'' parameter is an inessential coupling. Non-perturbatively the solutions may only exist for some non-zero amount of this time. However, at each order in perturbation theory one obtains linear equations which implies that unique solutions exist. We then show that scattering amplitudes are independent of inessential couplings without use of perturbation theory. For gauge theories we expect our correspondence to extend to effective actions which differ by a choice of gauge.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits for the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm</title>

Abstract: Szegedy's quantization of a reversible Markov chain provides a quantum walk whose mixing time is quadratically smaller than that of the classical walk. Quantum computers are therefore expected to provide a speedup of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) simulations. Existing generic methods to implement the quantum walk require coherently computing the acceptance probabilities of the underlying Markov kernel. However, reversible computing methods require a number of qubits that scales with the complexity of the computation. This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, does not require further reversible computing methods, and uses a constant-sized ancilla register. Since each step of the quantum walk uses a constant number of proposition and acceptance steps, we expect the end-to-end quadratic speedup to hold for MH Markov Chain Monte-Carlo simulations.</description>

Abstract: We adapt the Edwards-Muthukumar theoretical framework for a single polymer chain to investigate the interplay between proton binding and counterion condensation for poly-acids. We find that changes to pH enable non-monotonic transitions between anti- and conventional polyelectrolyte behaviors. In the former, the net charge and the overall dimensions increase with increasing salt concentration, while the converse is true for conventional polyelectrolytes. The polymeric nature and local solvent polarization drive significant pKa shifts when compared to the values of reference monoacids. These pKa shifts are enhanced in semi-flexible chains.</description>
