      <title>Local topology for periodic Hamiltonians and fuzzy tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of local index formulas is constructed for quantum Hamiltonians with periodic boundary conditions. All dimensions of physical space as well as many symmetry constraints are covered, notably one-dimensional systems in Class DIII as well as two- and three-dimensional systems in Class AII. The constructions are based on several periodic variations of the spectral localizer and are rooted in the existence of underlying fuzzy tori. For these latter, a general invariant theory is developed.</description>

      <title>Transfer matrix analysis of non-hermitian Hamiltonians: asymptotic spectra and topological eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer matrix techniques are used to {provide} a new proof of Widom's results on the asymptotic spectral theory of finite block Toeplitz matrices. Furthermore, a rigorous treatment of {the} skin effect, spectral outliers, the generalized Brillouin zone and the bulk-boundary correspondence in such systems is given. This covers chiral Hamiltonians with topological eigenvalues close to zero, but no line-gap.</description>

      <title>Probing Causation Dynamics in Quantum Chains near Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distinguishing causation from correlation is crucial and requires careful consideration. In this study, we utilize a recent quantum extension of Liang information to investigate causation in quantum chains across their phase diagram. Our analysis encompasses two distinct scenarios: (i) the Aubry-Andr$\'e$-Harper model, characterized by a spectrum-wide phase transition, and (ii) the Anisotropic Transverse Field Ising (ANNNI) model, which demonstrates a ground state transition. We discern a notable shift in causation behavior across the critical point with each case exhibiting distinct hallmarks, different from correlation measures. Especially, in the latter case, we observe maximum causation in the ordered phase just preceding the critical point.</description>

      <title>Experimental determination of effective light transport properties in fully anisotropic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structurally anisotropic materials are ubiquitous in several application fields, yet their accurate optical characterization remains challenging due to the lack of general models linking their scattering coefficients to the macroscopic transport observables, and the need to combine multiple measurements to retrieve their direction-dependent values. Here, we present an improved method for the experimental determination of light transport tensor coefficients from the diffusive rates measured along all three directions, based on transient transmittance measurements and a generalized Monte Carlo model. We apply our method to the characterization of light transport properties in two common anisotropic materials - polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tape and paper - highlighting the magnitude of systematic deviations that are typically incurred when neglecting anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Gilbert damping in two-dimensional metallic anti-ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A finite spin life-time of conduction electrons may dominate Gilbert damping of two-dimensional metallic anti-ferromagnets or anti-ferromagnet/metal heterostructures. We investigate the Gilbert damping tensor for a typical low-energy model of a metallic anti-ferromagnet system with honeycomb magnetic lattice and Rashba spin-orbit coupling for conduction electrons. We distinguish three regimes of spin relaxation: exchange-dominated relaxation for weak spin-orbit coupling strength, Elliot-Yafet relaxation for moderate spin-orbit coupling, and Dyakonov-Perel relaxation for strong spin-orbit coupling. We show, however, that the latter regime takes place only for the in-plane Gilbert damping component. We also show that anisotropy of Gilbert damping persists for any finite spin-orbit interaction strength provided we consider no spatial variation of the N\'eel vector. Isotropic Gilbert damping is restored only if the electron spin-orbit length is larger than the magnon wavelength. Our theory applies to MnPS3 monolayer on Pt or to similar systems.</description>

      <title>Evidence that the AT transition disappears below six dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the key predictions of Parisi's broken replica symmetry theory of spin glasses is the existence of a phase transition in an applied field to a state with broken replica symmetry. This transition takes place at the de Almeida-Thouless (AT) line in the $h-T$ plane. We have studied this line in the power-law diluted Heisenberg spin glass in which the probability that two spins separated by a distance $r$ interact with each other falls as $1/r^{2\sigma}$. In the presence of a random vector-field of variance $h_r^2$ the phase transition is in the universality class of the Ising spin glass in a field. Tuning $\sigma$ is equivalent to changing the dimension $d$ of the short-range system, with the relation being $d =2/(2\sigma -1)$ for $\sigma &lt; 2/3$. We have found by numerical simulations that $h_{\text{AT}}^2 \sim (2/3 -\sigma)$ implying that the AT line does not exist below $6$ dimensions and that the Parisi scheme is not appropriate for spin glasses in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Learning protocols for the fast and efficient control of active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to learn protocols that effect fast and efficient state-to-state transformations in simulation models of active particles. By encoding the protocol in the form of a neural network we use evolutionary methods to identify protocols that take active particles from one steady state to another, as quickly as possible or with as little energy expended as possible. Our results show that protocols identified by a flexible neural-network ansatz, which allows the optimization of multiple control parameters and the emergence of sharp features, are more efficient than protocols derived recently by constrained analytical methods. Our learning scheme is straightforward to use in experiment, suggesting a way of designing protocols for the efficient manipulation of active matter in the laboratory.</description>
