      <title>Generalized functions with infinitesimals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a survey of the use of infinitesimals within mathematical analysis to rigorously deal with the delta-function from physics, and more generally, with distributions in the sense of L. Schwartz. We use the framework of nonstandard analysis as introduced by A. Robinson to rigorously deal with infinitesimals. Our exposition tries to be elementary, except for familiarity with nonstandard analysis, and takes as a starting point one of the basic questions in PDE for which distribution theory was developed. No knowledge of distribution theory is required.</description>

      <title>Higher traces of linear maps on finite-dimensional normed spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a unified trace-average formula for the $k$-th higher trace $\lambda_k(A)=\operatorname{tr}(\Lambda^k A)$ of a linear operator $A$ on a finite-dimensional normed space. The formula averages the matrix coefficient $w\mapsto\langle(\Lambda^kA)w, w^*\rangle$ over the unit sphere of $\Lambda^kX$ against a probability measure $\eta$; it holds for \emph{all} $A$ if and only if the operator-valued average $T_\eta=\binom{N}{k}\int w\otimes w^*\operatorname{d}\eta$ equals the identity. Two natural choices of $\eta$ satisfy this isotropy: (i) the hypersurface measure when a finite isometry group acts as an orthogonal $2$-design on $\Lambda^k\mathbb{R}^N$; and (ii) the cone probability measure (no symmetry needed). We also identify a first-order obstruction for hypersurface averages at $k=1$: only degree-$2$ spherical harmonics of the support function contribute.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Lee's conjecture on the sum of absolute values of matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\|\!\cdot\!\|_p$ denote the Schatten $p$-norm of matrices and $\|\!\cdot\!\|_F$ the Frobenius norm. For a square matrix $X$, let $|X|$ denote its absolute value. In 2010, Eun-Young Lee posed the problem of determining the smallest constant $c_p$ such that $\|A+B\|_p \le c_p\|\,|A|+|B|\,\|_p$ for all complex matrices $A,B$. The Frobenius case $(p=2)$ conjectured by Lee was proved by Lin and Zhang (2022) and re-proved by Zhang (2025). In this paper, we extend Lee's conjecture to arbitrary numbers of summands and determine the sharp inequality $$
  \left\|\sum_{k=1}^{m} A_k\right\|_F
  \le \sqrt{\frac{1+\sqrt{m}}{2}}\;
  \left\|\sum_{k=1}^{m}|A_k|\right\|_F , $$ with equality attained by an equiangular rank-one family. We further generalize Lee's problem by seeking the smallest constant $c_p(m)$ such that $
  \|\sum_{k=1}^{m} A_k\|_p
  \le c_p(m)\,
  \|\sum_{k=1}^{m}|A_k|\|_p $. It is shown that $c_p(m)\le (\sqrt{m})^{1-1/p}$, and we conjecture a closed-form expression for the optimal value of $c_p(m)$ that recovers all known cases $p=1,2,\infty$.</description>

      <title>Existence and Enumeration of Polynomially Transformed Matrices under Spectral and Nilpotent Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix functions extend scalar function concepts to linear operators, offering a unified framework with broad applications in mathematics, science, and engineering. Classical definitions--via power series, spectral calculus, or Jordan form--capture both diagonalizable and defective matrices, revealing insights into dynamics, stability, and modal interactions. Building on this foundation, this study examines how matrix functions behave under nilpotency and diagonalizability constraints, inspired by the Jordan decomposition into spectral and nilpotent parts. The spectral part encodes eigenstructure, while the nilpotent part reflects deviations from diagonalizability. Two main problems are addressed: (1) identifying when a polynomial-transformed matrix becomes nilpotent, and (2) determining when it becomes diagonalizable. The analysis considers two scenarios--matrices with one distinct eigenvalue and those with multiple distinct eigenvalues--each posing unique algebraic and combinatorial challenges. Depending on whether the polynomial transform is sparse or dense, distinct tools are applied: combinatorial root-counting techniques such as Descartes' rule and Sturm's theorem for sparse cases, and analytic or algebraic methods like the argument principle, Rouche's theorem, and square-free factorization for dense ones. Together, these methods establish a systematic framework for studying the existence and classification of matrices with specific structural properties under polynomial transformations. The findings deepen understanding of spectral transformations and provide new perspectives for operator theory, dynamical systems, and computational linear algebra.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of weighted composition operators. Part XII. Kamowitz - Scheinberg theorem revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known Kamowitz - Scheinberg theorem states that if $U$ is an automorphism of a commutative semi-simple Banach algebra and $U^n \neq I, n \in \mathds{N}$, then the spectrum of $U$ contains the unit circle. In this paper we present some results about the spectrum of weighted automorphisms of unital commutative semi-simple Banach algebras that considerably strengthen the statement of the Kamowitz - Scheinberg theorem.</description>

      <title>Mean transforms of unbounded weighted composition operator pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first characterize the polar decomposition of unbounded weighted composition operator pairs $\textbf{C}_{\phi,\omega}$ in an $L^2$-space. Based on this characterization, we introduce the $\lambda$-spherical mean transform $\mathcal{M}_\lambda(\textbf{C}_{\phi,\omega})$ for $\lambda\in[0,1]$. We then investigate the dense definiteness of $\mathcal{M}_\lambda(\textbf{C}_{\phi,\omega})$. As an application, we provide an example of a $p$-hyponormal operator whose Aluthge transform is densely defined, while its $\lambda$-mean transform has a trivial domain. Furthermore, we establish the relationship between the dense definiteness of $\textbf{C}_{\phi,\omega}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{\lambda}(\textbf{C}_{\phi,\omega})$, based on the notion of powers for operator pairs in the sense of M{\"u}ller and Soltysiak. We also give a characterization of spherically quasinormal weighted composition operator pairs via the $\lambda$-spherical mean transform, revealing some properties that differ from the single operator case. Finally, we characterize a class of spherically $p$-hyponormal weighted composition operators on discrete measure spaces. As a corollary, we present corresponding results on the spherical $p$-hyponormality of unbounded $2$-variable weighted shifts and theirs $\lambda$-spherical mean transforms.</description>

      <title>Structure of closed subideals of $\mathcal L(X)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The closed subalgebra $\mathcal J$ of the Banach algebra $\mathcal L(X)$ of bounded linear operators on the Banach space $X$ is a non-trivial closed $\mathcal I$-subideal of $\mathcal L(X)$ if $\mathcal I$ is a closed ideal of $\mathcal L(X)$ and $\mathcal J$ is an ideal of $\mathcal I$, but $\mathcal J$ is not an ideal of $\mathcal L(X)$. We obtain a variety of examples of non-trivial closed subideals of $\mathcal L(X)$ for different spaces $X$, which highlight further significant differences compared to the class of closed ideals. We study the concept of a closed $n$-subideal of $\mathcal L(X)$ for $n \ge 3$, which is a natural generalization of that of a closed subideal. In particular, we find explicit spaces $X$ for which $\mathcal L(X)$ contains a decreasing sequence $(\mathcal M_n)_{n\in \mathbb N}$ of closed subalgebras, where for all $n\in\mathbb N$ the subalgebra $\mathcal M_n$ is an $(n+1)$-subideal of $\mathcal L(X)$ but not an $n$-subideal. Moreover, we construct closed $n$-subideals contained in the compact operators $\mathcal K(X)$ for certain Banach spaces $X$ which fail the approximation property.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Stability in Discrete Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates several aspects related to quantitative stability in optimal transport, as well as uniqueness of the dual transport problem. Our main contributions are as follows. Chapter 1: Observations regarding the quantitative stability of optimal transport plans with respect to Wasserstein distance on the product space. Chapter 2: Extention of strong convexity inequalities for the Kantorovich functional to a larger class of source measures, using glueing arguments recently used for the quantitative stability of optimal transport maps. Chapters 3/4: A qualitative description of the behaviour of the fully discrete transport problem under perturbation of the support positions, as well as quantitative stability under uniqueness assumptions. Chapter 5: Extention of known uniqueness criteria for the dual transport problem. We show that when one marginal measure has Lipschitz-path connected support and the other has bounded support, the values of dual optimisers are unique up to a constant for a large family of costs, including $p$-costs for all $p&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Square closed pointed vector lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an Archimedean vector lattice $E$, we present one elementary property of $E$ which is equivalent to the entire traditional list of axioms which makes $E$ a $\Phi$-algebra. We call a vector lattice with this property ``square closed". More generally, we then introduce the notion of a pseudo square closed vector lattice and prove that an Archimedean vector lattice is a semiprime $f$-algebra if and only if it is pseudo square closed. This theory serves as an efficient tool for determining whether or not an Archimedean vector lattice is a $\Phi$-algebra (or a semiprime $f$-algebra). To illustrate this point, we generalize a well-known result for uniformly complete Archimedean vector lattices with a strong order unit by proving that every functionally complete Archimedean vector lattice with a strong order unit is a $\Phi$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Fitting an Escalier to a Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the problem of fitting a fonction en escalier or multi-step function to a curve in L^2 Hilbert space. We propose a two-stage optimization approach whereby the step positions are initially fixed, corresponding to a classic linear least-squares problem with closed-form solution, and then are allowed to vary, leading to first-order conditions that can be solved recursively. We find that, subject to regularity conditions, the speed of convergence is linear as the number of steps $n$ goes to infinity, and we develop a simple algorithm to recover the global optimum fit. Our numerical results based on a sweep search implementation show promising performance in terms of speed and accuracy.</description>

      <title>The impact of Schur multipliers in harmonic analysis and operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schur multipliers are basic linear maps on matrix algebras. Their close albeit still intriguing connection with Fourier multipliers establishes a powerful bridge between harmonic analysis and operator algebras. In this paper, we survey their growing impact over the past 15 years. Particular attention will be drawn to recent bounds on Schatten $p$-classes, with far-reaching applications in harmonic analysis on group von Neumann algebras and operator rigidity phenomena for higher-rank Lie groups and lattices. Key novelties arise from new insights into nonToeplitz Schur multipliers and unprecedented connections with highly singular operators from Euclidean harmonic analysis.</description>

      <title>Spectral Synthesis on Varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17438v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his classical paper, Laurent Schwartz proved that on the real line, in every linear translation invariant space of continuous complex valued functions, which is closed under compact convergence the exponential monomials span a dense subspace. He studied so-called local ideals in the space of Fourier transforms, and his proof based on the observation that, on the one hand, these local ideals are completely determined by the exponential monomials in the space, and, on the other hand, these local ideals completely determine the space itself. On the other hand, Dimitri Gurevich gave counterexamples for Schwartz's theorem in higher dimension. In this paper we show that the ideas of localisation can be extended to general locally compact Abelian groups using abstract derivations on the Fourier algebra of compactly supported measures. Based on this method we present necessary and sufficient conditions for spectral synthesis for varieties on locally compact Abelian groups. Using localisation, in \cite{MR4789359} we proved that spectral synthesis holds on a locally compact Abelian group $G$ if and only if it holds on $G/B$, where $B$ is the closed subgroup of compact elements. This may lead to a complete characterisation of locally compact Abelian groups having spectral synthesis.</description>

Abstract: We introduce new vanishing subspaces of the homogeneous H\"{o}lder space $\dot{C}^{0,\omega}(X,Y)$ in the generality of a doubling modulus $\omega$ and normed spaces $X$ and $Y.$ For many couples $X,Y,$ we show these vanishing subspaces to completely characterize those H\"older functions that admit approximations, in the H\"{o}lder seminorm, by smooth, Lipschitz and boundedly supported functions. We present connections to bi-parameter harmonic analysis on the Euclidean space by providing applications to the compactness of the bi-commutator of two Calder\'on-Zygmund operators</description>

Abstract: We prove that operators of the form $A=-a(x)^2\Delta^{2}$, with suitable growth conditions on the coefficient $a(x)$, generate analytic semigroups in $L^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$. In particular, we deduce generation results for the operator $A :=- (1+|x|^2)^{\alpha} \Delta^{2}$, $0\leq\alpha\leq2$. Moreover, we characterise the maximal domain of $A$ in $L^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain Szeg\H{o}-type limit theorems for Toeplitz operators on the weighted Bergman spaces $A^{2}_{\alpha}(\mathbb{D})$, and on $L^{2}(G)$ where $G$ is a compact Abelian group. We also derive several abstract Szeg\H{o} limit theorems which include many related classical Szeg\H{o} limit theorems as a special case.</description>

      <title>Strong and weak sharp bounds for Neural Network Operators in Sobolev-Orlicz spaces and their quantitative extensions to Orlicz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish sharp bounds for a family of Kantorovich-type neural network operators within the general frameworks of Sobolev-Orlicz and Orlicz spaces. We establish both strong (in terms of the Luxemburg norm) and weak (in terms of the modular functional) estimates, using different approaches. The strong estimates are derived for spaces generated by $\varphi$-functions that are $N$-functions or satisfy the $\Delta^\prime$-condition. Such estimates also lead to convergence results with respect to the Luxemburg norm in several instances of Orlicz spaces, including the exponential case. Meanwhile, the weak estimates are achieved under less restrictive assumptions on the involved $\varphi$-function. To obtain these results, we introduce some new tools and techniques in Orlicz spaces. Central to our approach is the Orlicz Minkowski inequality, which allows us to obtain unified strong estimates for the operators. We also present a weak (modular) version of this inequality holding under weaker conditions. Additionally, we introduce a novel notion of discrete absolute $\varphi$-moments of the hybrid type, and we employ the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator within Orlicz spaces for the asymptotic analysis. Furthermore, we introduce the new space $\mathcal{W}^{1,\varphi}(I)$, which is embedded in the Sobolev-Orlicz space $W^{1,\varphi}(I)$ and modularly dense in $L^\varphi(I)$. This allows to achieve asymptotic estimates for a wider class of $\varphi$-functions, including those that do not meet the $\Delta_2$-condition. For the extension to the whole Orlicz-setting, we generalize a Sobolev-Orlicz density result given by H. Musielak using Steklov functions, providing a modular counterpart.</description>

      <title>Determination of (unbounded) convex functions via Crandall-Pazy directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been recently discovered that a convex function can be determined by its slopes and its infimum value, provided this latter is finite. The result was extended to nonconvex functions by replacing the infimum value by the set of all critical and asymptotically critical values. In all these results boundedness from below plays a crucial role and is generally admitted to be a paramount assumption. Nonetheless, this work develops a new technique that allows to also determine a large class of unbounded from below convex functions, by means of a Neumann-type condition related to the Crandall-Pazy direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the classical Lebesgue and Fubini differentiation theorems to functions of several variables, using the notions of joint derivative and joint monotonicity. Our first main result shows that for a function $f$ of bounded variation, the joint derivative exists almost everywhere, its $L^1$ norm is bounded by the total variation of $f$, and equality in this bound characterizes absolute continuity. Our second main result shows that, for a convergent series of jointly monotone increasing functions, the joint derivative of the sum equals the sum of the joint derivatives almost everywhere.</description>

      <title>The Strong Law of Large Numbers for random semigroups on uniformly smooth Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider random linear continuous operators $\Omega \to \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{X})$ on a Banach space $\mathcal{X}$. For example, such random operators may be random quantum channels. The Law of Large Numbers is known when $\mathcal{X}$ is a Hilbert space, in the form of the usual Law of Large Numbers for random operators, and in some other particular cases. Instead of the sum of i.i.d. variables, there may be considered the composition of random semigroups $e^{A_it/n}$. We obtain the Strong Law of Large Numbers in Strong Operator Topology for random semigroups of bounded linear operators on a uniformly smooth Banach space. We also develop another approach giving the SLLN in Weak Operator Topology for all Banach spaces.</description>

Abstract: This work investigates continuous embeddings for quantum Sobolev spaces $\mathfrak{H}_\gamma^{s,p}(G,H)$ into Schatten--von Neumann classes $S_r(H)$. We try to extend the results of Lakmon and Mensah to the case where the operators belong to Schatten classes $S_p(H)$ for $p \neq 2$. We establish that these quantum Sobolev spaces are Banach spaces and, by employing a duality argument, we define spaces for $p&gt;2$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, for $\alpha\in(0,\infty)\setminus\{1\}$, $p&gt;0$ and positive semidefinite matrices $A$ and $B$, we consider the quasi-extension $\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p}(A,B):=\mathcal{M}_\alpha(A^p,B^p)^{1/p}$ of several $\alpha$-weighted geometric type matrix means $\mathcal{M}_\alpha(A,B)$ such as the $\alpha$-weighted geometric mean in Kubo--Ando's sense, the R\'enyi mean, etc. The log-majorization $\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p}(A,B)\prec_{\log}\mathcal{N}_{\alpha,q}(A,B)$ is examined for pairs $(\mathcal{M},\mathcal{N})$ of those $\alpha$-weighted geometric type means. The joint concavity/convexity of the trace functions $\mathrm{Tr}\,\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p}$ is also discussed based on theory of quantum divergences.</description>

The assignment of a functional calculus will be applied to self-adjoint operators. We will address both the bounded and unbounded cases, examine the advantage of the underlying function space compared to larger spaces, prove the spectral mapping theorem, and explore one application of this functional calculus in abstract differential equations.</description>

      <title>Three radii associated to Schur functions on the polydisk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article examines three radii associated to bounded analytic functions on the polydisk: the well-known Bohr radius, the Bohr-Agler radius, and the Schur-Agler radius. We prove explicit upper and lower bounds for the Bohr-Agler radius, an explicit lower bound for the Schur-Agler radius, and an asymptotic upper bound for the Schur-Agler radius. The Bohr-Agler radius obeys the same (known) asymptotic as the Bohr radius while we show the Schur-Agler radius is roughly of the same growth as the Bohr radius. As a corollary, we bound the Bohr radius on the bidisk below by 0.3006. Finally, we improve some estimates of P.G. Dixon on Agler norms of homogeneous polynomials using some modern inequalities.</description>

      <title>The Wehrl-type entropy conjecture for symmetric $SU(N)$ coherent states: cases of equality and stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10940v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lieb and Solovej proved that, for the symmetric $SU(N)$ representations, the corresponding Wehrl-type entropy is minimized by symmetric coherent states. However, the uniqueness of the minimizers remained an open problem when $N\geq 3$. In this note, we complete the proof of the Wehrl entropy conjecture for such representations by showing that symmetric coherent states are, in fact, the only minimizers. We also provide an application to the maximum concentration of holomorphic polynomials and deduce a corresponding Faber-Krahn inequality. A sharp quantitative form of the bound by Lieb and Solovej is also proved.</description>

      <title>Learning Cocoercive Conservative Denoisers via Helmholtz Decomposition for Poisson Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plug-and-play (PnP) methods with deep denoisers have shown impressive results in imaging problems. They typically require strong convexity or smoothness of the fidelity term and a (residual) non-expansive denoiser for convergence. These assumptions, however, are violated in Poisson inverse problems, and non-expansiveness can hinder denoising performance. To address these challenges, we propose a cocoercive conservative (CoCo) denoiser, which may be (residual) expansive, leading to improved denoising. By leveraging the generalized Helmholtz decomposition, we introduce a novel training strategy that combines Hamiltonian regularization to promote conservativeness and spectral regularization to ensure cocoerciveness. We prove that CoCo denoiser is a proximal operator of a weakly convex function, enabling a restoration model with an implicit weakly convex prior. The global convergence of PnP methods to a stationary point of this restoration model is established. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms closely related methods in both visual quality and quantitative metrics.</description>

      <title>A fast algorithm for solving the lasso problem exactly without homotopy using differential inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove in this work that the well-known lasso problem can be solved exactly without homotopy using novel differential inclusions techniques. Specifically, we show that a selection principle from the theory of differential inclusions transforms the dual lasso problem into the problem of calculating the trajectory of a projected dynamical system that we prove is integrable. Our analysis yields an exact algorithm for the lasso problem, numerically up to machine precision, that is amenable to computing regularization paths and is very fast. Moreover, we show the continuation of solutions to the integrable projected dynamical system in terms of the hyperparameter naturally yields a rigorous homotopy algorithm. Numerical experiments confirm that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in both efficiency and accuracy. Beyond this work, we expect our results and analysis can be adapted to compute exact or approximate solutions to a broader class of polyhedral-constrained optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Approximating the operator norm of local Hamiltonians via few quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a Hermitian operator $A$ acting on a complex Hilbert space of dimension $2^n$. We show that when $A$ has small degree in the Pauli expansion, or in other words, $A$ is a local $n$-qubit Hamiltonian, its operator norm can be approximated independently of $n$ by maximizing $|\braket{\psi|A|\psi}|$ over a small collection $\mathbf{X}_n$ of product states $\ket{\psi}\in (\mathbf{C}^{2})^{\otimes n}$. More precisely, we show that whenever $A$ is $d$-local, \textit{i.e.,} $\deg(A)\le d$, we have the following discretization-type inequality:
  \[ \|A\|\le C(d)\max_{\psi\in \mathbf{X}_n}|\braket{\psi|A|\psi}|.
  \] The constant $C(d)$ depends only on $d$. This collection $\mathbf{X}_n$ of $\psi$'s, termed a \emph{quantum norm design}, is independent of $A$, and consists of product states, and can have
  cardinality as small as $(1+\eps)^n$, which is essentially tight. Previously, norm designs were known only for homogeneous $d$-localHamiltonians $A$ \cite{L,BGKT,ACKK}, and for non-homogeneous $2$-local traceless $A$ \cite{BGKT}.
  Several other results, such as boundedness of Rademacher projections for all levels and estimates of operator norms of random Hamiltonians, are also given.</description>

      <title>Optimal Frames for Phase Retrieval from Edge Vectors of Optimal Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to characterize the optimal frame for phase retrieval, defined as the frame whose condition number for phase retrieval attains its minimal value. In the context of the two-dimensional real case, we reveal the connection between optimal frames for phase retrieval and the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem, originally proposed by Reinhardt in 1922. Our work establishes that every optimal solution to the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem inherently leads to an optimal frame in ${\mathbb R}^2$. By recasting the optimal polygons problem as one concerning the discrepancy of roots of unity, we characterize all optimal polygons. Building upon this connection, we then characterize all optimal frames with $m$ vectors in ${\mathbb R}^2$ for phase retrieval when $m \geq 3$ has an odd factor. As a key corollary, we show that the harmonic frame $E_m$ is {\em not} optimal for any even integer $m \geq 4$. This finding disproves a conjecture proposed by Xia, Xu, and Xu (Math. Comp., 94(356): 2931-2960). Previous work has established that the harmonic frame $E_m \subset {\mathbb R}^2$ is indeed optimal when $m$ is an odd integer.
  Exploring the connection between phase retrieval and discrete geometry, this paper aims to illuminate advancements in phase retrieval and offer new perspectives on the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem.</description>
