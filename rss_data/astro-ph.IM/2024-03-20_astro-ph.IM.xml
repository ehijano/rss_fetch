      <title>Light Curve Classification with DistClassiPy: a new distance-based classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of synoptic sky surveys has ushered in an era of big data in time-domain astronomy, making data science and machine learning essential tools for studying celestial objects. Tree-based (e.g. Random Forests) and deep learning models represent the current standard in the field. We explore the use of different distance metrics to aid in the classification of objects. For this, we developed a new distance metric based classifier called DistClassiPy. The direct use of distance metrics is an approach that has not been explored in time-domain astronomy, but distance-based methods can aid in increasing the interpretability of the classification result and decrease the computational costs. In particular, we classify light curves of variable stars by comparing the distances between objects of different classes. Using 18 distance metrics applied to a catalog of 6,000 variable stars in 10 classes, we demonstrate classification and dimensionality reduction. We show that this classifier meets state-of-the-art performance but has lower computational requirements and improved interpretability. We have made DistClassiPy open-source and accessible at https://pypi.org/project/distclassipy/ with the goal of broadening its applications to other classification scenarios within and beyond astronomy.</description>

      <title>SOLARNET Metadata Recommendations for Simulated Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Until the advent of the SOLARNET recommendations, metadata sharing of simulated data within the Solar Physics community has been mostly on a "private communication" basis, with the description of the data format and content conveyed in an ad hoc manner. This document aims to amend this situation by establishing recommendations for representing such data and the associated metadata, based on the SOLARNET Metadata Recommendations for Solar Observations (arXiv:2011.12139)</description>

      <title>Attention-Based Neural Network Emulators for Multi-Probe Data Vectors Part II: Assessing Tension Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of cosmological surveys is expected to generate unprecedented high-quality data, consequently increasing the already substantial computational costs of Bayesian statistical methods. This will pose a significant challenge to analyzing theoretical models of cosmology. Additionally, new mitigation techniques of baryonic effects, intrinsic alignment, and other systematic effects will inevitably introduce more parameters, slowing down the convergence of Bayesian analyses. In this scenario, machine-learning-based accelerators are a promising solution, capable of reducing the computational costs and execution time of such tools by order of thousands. Yet, they have not been able to provide accurate predictions over the wide prior ranges in parameter space adopted by Stage III/IV collaborations in studies employing real-space two-point correlation functions. This paper offers a leap in this direction by carefully investigating the modern transformer-based neural network (NN) architectures in realistic simulated Rubin Observatory year one cosmic shear $\Lambda$CDM inferences. Building on the framework introduced in Part I, we generalize the transformer block and incorporate additional layer types to develop a more versatile architecture. We present a scalable method to efficiently generate an extensive training dataset that significantly exceeds the scope of prior volumes considered in Part I, while still meeting strict accuracy standards. Through our meticulous architecture comparison and comprehensive hyperparameter optimization, we establish that the attention-based architecture performs an order of magnitude better in accuracy than widely adopted NN designs. Finally, we test and apply our emulators to calibrate tension metrics.</description>

      <title>Investigating Millimeter-Wave Thin-film Superconducting Resonators: A Study Using Tunnel Junction Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigations into the propagation characteristics, specifically loss and wave velocity, of superconducting coplanar waveguides and microstrip lines were conducted at a 2 mm wavelength. This was achieved through the measurement of on-chip half-wavelength resonators, employing superconductor-insulator-superconductor tunnel junctions as detectors. A continuous wave millimeter wave probe signal was introduced to the chip via a silicon membrane-based orthomode transducer. This setup not only facilitated the injection of the probe signal but also provided a reference path essential for differential measurements. The observed resonance frequencies aligned closely with theoretical predictions, exhibiting a discrepancy of only several percent. However, the measured losses significantly exceeded those anticipated from quasi-particle loss mechanisms, suggesting the presence of additional loss factors. Notably, the measurement results revealed that the tangential loss attributable to the dielectric layer, specifically silicon dioxide, was approximately $\rm{7\pm 2 \times 10^{-3}}$. This factor emerged as the dominant contributor to overall loss at temperatures around 4 K.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work shows details of an evaluation of an observational system comprising a CMOS detector, 60-cm telescope, and filter complement. The system's photometric precision and differential photometric precision, and extinction coefficients were assessed through observations of Supersky flat fields, open clusters, standard stars, and exoplanets. Photometry was precision achieved at the 0.02 mag level, while differential photometry of 0.004 mag precision. Extinction was found to be agreed with previous studies conducted at Xinglong Observatory. Ultimately, the results demonstrate this observing system is capable of precision scientific observations with CCD across the optical wavelengths.</description>

      <title>The environment around young eruptive stars. SPHERE/IRDIS polarimetric imaging of 7 protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eruptive stars are a class of young stellar objects that show an abrupt increase in their luminosity. These burst-like episodes are thought to dominate the stellar accretion process during the class 0/class I stage. We present an overview of a survey of seven episodically accreting protostars aimed at studying their potentially complex circumstellar surroundings. The observations were performed with the instrument SPHERE, mounted at the VLT. We observed the eruptive stars in $H$-band with the near-infrared imager IRDIS and used the polarimeter to extract the polarized light scattered from the stars' surroundings. We produced polarized light images for three FUor objects, Z CMa, V960 Mon, and FU Ori, and four EXor objects, XZ Tau, UZ Tau, NY Ori, and EX Lup. We calculated the intrinsic polarization fraction for all the observed stars. In all systems we registered scattered light from around the primary star. FU Ori and V960 Mon are surrounded by complex structures including spiral-like features. In Z CMa, we detected a point source 0.7 arcsec to the northeast of the primary. Based on the astrometric measurements from archival Keck/NIRC2 data, we find this source to be a third member of the system. Further, Z CMa displays an outflow extending thousands of au. Unlike the other EXor objects in our sample, XZ Tau shows bright, extended scattered light structures, also associated with an outflow on a scale of hundreds of au. The other EXors show relatively faint disk-like structures in the immediate vicinity of the coronagraph. Asymmetric arms were only found around FUor objects, while faint disks seem to predominantly occur around EXors. Importantly, for Z CMa the detection of the faint extended structure questions previous interpretations of the system's dynamic state. The streamer which was associated with a fly-by object turned out to be part of a huge outflow extending 6000 au.</description>

      <title>High-precision astrometry with VVV -- II. A near-infrared extension of Gaia into the Galactic plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. We use near-infrared, ground-based data from the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey to indirectly extend the astrometry provided by the Gaia catalog to objects in heavily-extincted regions towards the Galactic bulge and plane that are beyond Gaia's reach. Methods. We make use of the state-of-the-art techniques developed for high-precision astrometry and photometry with the Hubble Space Telescope to process the VVV data. We employ empirical, spatially-variable, effective point-spread functions and local transformations to mitigate the effects of systematic errors, like residual geometric distortion and image motion, and to improve measurements in crowded fields and for faint stars. We also anchor our astrometry to the absolute reference frame of the Gaia Data Release 3. Results. We measure between 20 and 60 times more sources than Gaia in the region surrounding the Galactic center, obtaining an single-exposure precision of about 12 mas and a proper-motion precision of better than 1 mas yr$^{-1}$ for bright, unsaturated sources. Our astrometry provides an extension of Gaia into the Galactic center. We publicly release the astro-photometric catalogs of the two VVV fields considered in this work, which contain a total of $\sim$ 3.5 million sources. Our catalogs cover $\sim$ 3 sq. degrees, about 0.5% of the entire VVV survey area.</description>

      <title>Extension of the characterization method for non-Gaussianity in gravitational wave detector with statistical hypothesis test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In gravitational wave astronomy, non-Gaussian noise, such as scattered light noise disturbs stable interferometer operation, limiting the interferometer's sensitivity, and reducing the reliability of the analyses. In scattered light noise, the non-Gaussian noise dominates the sensitivity in a low frequency range of less than a few hundred Hz, which is sensitive to gravitational waves from compact binary coalescence. This non-Gaussian noise prevents reliable parameter estimation, since several analysis methods are optimized only for Gaussian noise. Therefore, identifying data contaminated by non-Gaussian noise is important. In this work, we extended the conventional method to evaluate non-Gaussian noise, Rayleigh statistic, by using a statistical hypothesis test to determine a threshold for non-Gaussian noise. First, we estimated the distribution of the Rayleigh statistic against Gaussian noise, called the background distribution, and validated that our extension serves as the hypothetical test. Moreover, we investigated the detection efficiency by assuming two non-Gaussian noise models. For example, for the model with strong scattered light noise, the true positive rate was always above 0.7 when the significance level was 0.05. The results showed that our extension can contribute to an initial detection of non-Gaussian noise and lead to further investigation of the origin of the non-Gaussian noise.</description>

      <title>Ring nebulae around Wolf-Rayet stars in M33 as seen by SITELLE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have conducted an analysis of nebulae around Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in M33 using data collected by the imaging Fourier transform spectrometer SITELLE at the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope as part of the SIGNALS Large Program. Of the 211 known Wolf-Rayet stars in M33, 178 are located in the fields observed in this study. We present the results of this analysis in the form of a comprehensive summary of all nebulae found around the observed WR stars. Based on three criteria we find to be the most effective for their detection, we detect a clear association with a circumstellar bubble around 33 of them (19\%). Our results show that the presence of bubbles does not correlate with the spectral type of the central star. The mean diameter of the WR nebulae we have found is 21 parsecs.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a hot post-AGB star in Galactic globular cluster E3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a new hot-PAGB star identified in the Galactic GC E3, which is one of the first to show a binary signature among the identified PAGB stars of GCs. We present a detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis to study the evolutionary status of the newly identified hot-PAGB star. We use Gaia EDR3 proper motion (PM) and parallax measurements to confirm the cluster membership. We supplement the photometric observations with radial velocities (RVs) from multi-epoch high resolution (R$\sim$28000) spectroscopic observations. We fitted the spectral energy distribution of 30 photometric fluxes of the PAGB star from ultraviolet to infra-red passbands with the TLUSTY BSTAR2006 stellar atmosphere model to derive its physical parameters, \Teff, $\log g$, \Lbol, and R. We derive the chemical abundances of nine elements (He, C, N, O, Ne, Al, Si, S, and Fe) using spectroscopic measurements. The derived chemical abundances, kinematic information, and stellar parameters are used to study the evolution history of the star. The PM and parallax of the identified PAGB star match well with cluster parameters, which confirms its cluster membership. We find that the RVs vary over $\sim$6 \kms\ between the two epochs. This is an indication of the star being in a binary orbit. A simulation of possible binary systems with the observed RVs suggests a binary period of either 39.12 days or 17.83 days with mass ratio, q$\geq$1.0. The [Fe/H] derived using the high-resolution spectra is $\sim -$0.7 dex matches well with the cluster metallicity. Various PAGB evolutionary tracks on the H-R diagram suggest a current mass of the identified PAGB star in the range 0.51$-$0.55 \Msun. The star is enriched with C and O abundances, showing similar CNO abundances compared to the other PAGB stars of GCs with the evidence of 3rd dredge-up on the AGB phase.</description>

      <title>Optical system for extremely large spectroscopic survey telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04697v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents research work on a spectroscopic survey telescope. Our idea is as follows: for such a telescope, a pure reflecting optical system is designed, which should have an aperture and a field of view (FOV) both as large as possible and excellent image quality, and then a strip lensm (lens-prism) atmospheric dispersion corrector (S-ADC) is added, only for correcting the atmospheric dispersion. Given the fund limitation and the simplicity of scaling up, some 12-m telescopes are designed as examples. Su, Korsch, and Meinel put forward the four-mirror Nasmyth systems I and II, which are used in this paper. FOVs of 1.5{\deg}, 2{\deg}, and 2.5{\deg} are selected. For all systems, the image qualities are excellent. Because the S-ADC relaxes the optical glass size restriction, this 12-m telescope with a FOV of 2.5{\deg} can be magnified in proportion to a 16-m telescope. Its etendue (from French \'etendue) and focal surface will now be the largest in the world. In such a telescope, a pure reflecting optical system can also be obtained. A subsequent coud\'e system is designed with excellent image quality.</description>

      <title>Generation of photoionized plasmas in the laboratory of relevance to accretion-powered x-ray sources using keV line radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe laboratory experiments to generate X-ray photoionized plasmas of relevance to accretion-powered X-ray sources such as neutron star binaries and quasars, with significant improvements over previous work. A key quantity is referenced, namely the photoionization parameter. This is normally meaningful in an astrophysical steady-state context, but is also commonly used in the literature as a figure of merit for laboratory experiments that are, of necessity, time-dependent. We demonstrate emission-weighted values of {\xi} &gt; 50 ergcm/s using laser-plasma X-ray sources, with higher results at the centre of the plasma which are in the regime of interest for several astrophysical scenarios. Comparisons of laboratory experiments with astrophysical codes are always limited, principally by the many orders of magnitude differences in time and spatial scales, but also other plasma parameters. However useful checks on performance can often be made for a limited range of parameters. For example, we show that our use of a keV line source, rather than the quasi-blackbody radiation fields normally employed in such experiments, has allowed the generation of the ratio of inner-shell to outer-shell photoionization expected from a blackbody source with ~keV spectral temperature. We compare calculations from our in-house plasma modelling code with those from Cloudy and find moderately good agreement for the time evolution of both electron temperature and average ionisation. However, a comparison of code predictions for a K-beta argon X-ray spectrum with experimental data reveals that our Cloudy simulation overestimates the intensities of more highly ionised argon species. This is not totally surprising as the Cloudy model was generated for a single set of plasma conditions, while the experimental data are spatially integrated.</description>
