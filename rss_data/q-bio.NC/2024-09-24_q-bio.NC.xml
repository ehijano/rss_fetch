      <title>The Computational Mechanisms of Detached Mindfulness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the computational mechanisms underlying a type of metacognitive monitoring known as detached mindfulness, a particularly effective therapeutic technique within cognitive psychology. While research strongly supports the capacity of detached mindfulness to reduce depression and anxiety, its cognitive and computational underpinnings remain largely unexplained. We employ a computational model of metacognitive skill to articulate the mechanisms through which a detached perception of affect reduces emotional reactivity.</description>

      <title>Sex Differences in Hierarchical and Modular Organization of Functional Brain Networks: Insights from Hierarchical Entropy and Modularity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing studies have demonstrated significant sex differences in the neural mechanisms of daily life and neuropsychiatric disorders. The hierarchical organization of the functional brain network is a critical feature for assessing these neural mechanisms. But sex differences on the hierarchical organization is not fully investigated. Here, we explore whether hierarchical structure of brain network differs between females and males. At the group level, we measure the hierarchical entropy and the maximum modularity of each individual, and identify a significant negative correlation between the complexity of hierarchy and modularity in brain networks. On average, female brain networks have stronger connectivity within the module, whereas male brain networks demonstrate more complex hierarchy. At the consensus level, we use co-classification matrix to investigate the detailed differences in the hierarchical organization between sexes and observe that females and males exhibit different interaction patterns of brain regions in the dorsal attention network (DAN) and visual network (VIN). Our finding suggests that females and males employ different network topology to achieve brain functions. In addition, the negative correlation between hierarchy and modularity implies a need to balance the complexity in hierarchical organization of the brain network, which shed light on future studies of brain functions.</description>

      <title>Grounded Computation &amp; Consciousness: A Framework for Exploring Consciousness in Machines &amp; Other Organisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational modeling is a critical tool for understanding consciousness, but is it enough on its own? This paper discusses the necessity for an ontological basis of consciousness, and introduces a formal framework for grounding computational descriptions into an ontological substrate. Utilizing this technique, a method is demonstrated for estimating the difference in qualitative experience between two systems. This framework has wide applicability to computational theories of consciousness.</description>

      <title>Auricular Bioelectronic Devices for Health, Medicine, and Human-Computer Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in manufacturing of flexible and conformable microelectronics have opened opportunities for health monitoring and disease treatment. Other material engineering advances, such as the development of conductive, skin-like hydrogels, liquid metals, electric textiles, and piezoelectric films provide safe and comfortable means of interfacing with the human body. Together, these advances have enabled the design and engineering of bioelectronic devices with integrated multimodal sensing and stimulation capabilities to be worn nearly anywhere on the body. Of particular interest here, the external ear (auricle) offers a unique opportunity to design scalable bioelectronic devices with a high degree of usability and familiarity given the broad use of headphones. This perspective article discusses recent design and engineering advances in the development of auricular bioelectronic devices capable of physiological and biochemical sensing, cognitive monitoring, targeted neuromodulation, and control for human-computer interactions. Stemming from this scalable foundation, there will be increased growth and competition in research and engineering to advance auricular bioelectronics. This activity will lead to increased adoption of these smart headphone-style devices by patients and consumers for tracking health, treating medical conditions, and enhancing human-computer interactions.</description>

      <title>Artificial Human Intelligence: The role of Humans in the Development of Next Generation AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human intelligence, the most evident and accessible form of source of reasoning, hosted by biological hardware, has evolved and been refined over thousands of years, positioning itself today to create new artificial forms and preparing to self--design their evolutionary path forward. Beginning with the advent of foundation models, the rate at which human and artificial intelligence interact with each other has surpassed any anticipated quantitative figures. The close engagement led to both bits of intelligence to be impacted in various ways, which naturally resulted in complex confluences that warrant close scrutiny. In the sequel, we shall explore the interplay between human and machine intelligence, focusing on the crucial role humans play in developing ethical, responsible, and robust intelligent systems. We slightly delve into interesting aspects of implementation inspired by the mechanisms underlying neuroscience and human cognition. Additionally, we propose future perspectives, capitalizing on the advantages of symbiotic designs to suggest a human-centered direction for next-generation AI development. We finalize this evolving document with a few thoughts and open questions yet to be addressed by the broader community.</description>

      <title>Prosody of speech production in latent post-stroke aphasia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores prosodic production in latent aphasia, a mild form of aphasia associated with left-hemisphere brain damage (e.g. stroke). Unlike prior research on moderate to severe aphasia, we investigated latent aphasia, which can seem to have very similar speech production with neurotypical speech. We analysed the f0, intensity and duration of utterance-initial and utterance-final words of ten speakers with latent aphasia and ten matching controls. Regression models were fitted to improve our understanding of this understudied type of very mild aphasia. The results highlighted varying degrees of differences in all three prosodic measures between groups. We also investigated the diagnostic classification of latent aphasia versus neurotypical control using random forest, aiming to build a fast and reliable tool to assist with the identification of latent aphasia. The random forest analysis also reinforced the significance of prosodic features in distinguishing latent aphasia.</description>

      <title>Interpretable statistical representations of neural population dynamics and geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03376v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of neuron populations commonly evolve on low-dimensional manifolds. Thus, we need methods that learn the dynamical processes over neural manifolds to infer interpretable and consistent latent representations. We introduce a representation learning method, MARBLE, that decomposes on-manifold dynamics into local flow fields and maps them into a common latent space using unsupervised geometric deep learning. In simulated non-linear dynamical systems, recurrent neural networks, and experimental single-neuron recordings from primates and rodents, we discover emergent low-dimensional latent representations that parametrise high-dimensional neural dynamics during gain modulation, decision-making, and changes in the internal state. These representations are consistent across neural networks and animals, enabling the robust comparison of cognitive computations. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates state-of-the-art within- and across-animal decoding accuracy of MARBLE compared with current representation learning approaches, with minimal user input. Our results suggest that manifold structure provides a powerful inductive bias to develop powerful decoding algorithms and assimilate data across experiments.</description>
