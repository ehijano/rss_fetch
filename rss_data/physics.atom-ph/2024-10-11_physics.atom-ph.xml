      <title>Influence of optical aberrations on the accuracy of an atomic gravimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present numerical simulations of the impact of laser beam wavefront aberrations in cold atom interferometers. We demonstrate that to reach accuracy at the mrad level, simulations cannot be based on a description of the retroreflection optics only with low-order Zernike polynomials, as the results will then depend on the decomposition order and the decomposition technique chosen. Moreover, simulations with high-order Zernike polynomials or equivalently high spatial frequency components require the propagation of aberrations to be taken into account, rather than adding them to the ideally propagated beam. Finally, we examine the impact of the parameters of the atomic source and show that the use of delta-kicked atomic cloud would efficiently mitigate the impact of this systematic effect.</description>

      <title>Quantum logic control of a transition metal ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending quantum control to increasingly complex systems is crucial for both advancing quantum technologies and fundamental physics. In trapped ion systems, quantum logic techniques that combine a well-controlled logic species with a more complex spectroscopy species have proven to be a powerful tool for extending the range of accessible species. Here, we demonstrate that a quantum system as complex as $^{48}$Ti$^+$ with its many metastable states can be controlled employing a combination of intrinsic thermalization due to collisions with background gas and quantum-logic techniques using a far-detuned Raman laser. The preparation of pure quantum states allows coherent manipulation and high resolution measurements of the Zeeman structure in $^{48}$Ti$^+$. The presented techniques are applicable to a wide range of ionic species giving access to a larger variety of systems for fundamental physics and constitute the first step for quantum-controlled spectroscopy of transition metals, relevant, e.g., for the interpretation of astrophysical spectra.</description>

      <title>Toward hybrid quantum simulations with qubits and qumodes on trapped-ion platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the feasibility of hybrid quantum computing using both discrete (qubit) and continuous (qumode) variables on trapped-ion platforms. Trapped-ion systems have demonstrated record one- and two-qubit gate fidelities and long qubit coherence times while qumodes, which can be represented by the collective vibrational modes of the ion chain, have remained relatively unexplored for their use in computing. Using numerical simulations, we show that high-fidelity hybrid gates and measurement operations can be achieved for existing trapped-ion quantum platforms. As an exemplary application, we consider quantum simulations of the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model, which is given by a one-dimensional chain of interacting spin and boson degrees of freedom. Using classical simulations, we study its real-time evolution and we develop a suitable variational quantum algorithm for the ground state preparation. Our results motivate further studies of hybrid quantum computing in this context, which may lead to direct applications in condensed matter and fundamental particle and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Effect of polarization on spectroscopic characterization of laser produced aluminium plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a well-established technique widely used in fundamental research and diverse practical fields. Polarization-resolved LIBS, a variant of this technique, aims to improve the sensitivity, which is a critical aspect in numerous scientific domains. In our recent work we demonstrated that the degree of polarization (DOP) in the emission depends on the spatial location and time in a nano second laser generated aluminium plasma1. Present study investigates the effect of polarized emission on the estimation of plasma parameters. The plasma parameters are estimated using the conventional spectroscopic methods such as Boltzmann plot and line intensity ratio for the estimation of electron temperature and Stark broadening for estimating the electron density. The estimated plasma temperature using Boltzmann plot method shows large errors in electron temperature for the locations where DOP is higher. However, the electron density estimated using the Stark width does not show such variation. The observed ambiguity in temperature estimation using the Boltzmann plot method appears to be a consequence of deviation from expected Maxwell Boltzmann distribution of population of the involved energy levels. These findings highlight the need of assessing the DOP of the plasma before selecting the polarization for PRLIBS or temperature estimation using Boltzmann plots in elemental analysis.</description>

      <title>Can the THz-TDS detect trace gases?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The THz-TDS is a versatile technique and can be used to probe gas phase molecules. We are pushing the technique to its limit to try and detect trace gases at the sub-ppm levels. The experiments served as a reference for a quantitative approach that permits to extract the concentration of a probed gas. The single-parameter quantification model can be considered as the basis for a wider multispecies detection scheme.</description>

      <title>Beyond the semiclassical approximation in atom interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a quantum perturbative approach to evaluating the phase shift of an atom interferometer in a weakly anharmonic trap. This provides a simple way to evaluate quantum corrections to the standard semi-classical approximation. The calculation benefits from the use of generalized coherent states for a basis. We find that the form of the semi-classical approximation remains valid to first order in the anharmonic perturbation, but that phase differences arise because the trajectory of a quantum wave packet will generally deviate from that of a classical particle. In general, the quantum correction to the phase is a factor $a^2/A^2$ smaller than the semi-classical perturbation itself, where $a$ is the quantum harmonic oscillator length scale and $A$ is the classical amplitude of the motion.</description>

      <title>A universal speed limit for spreading of quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from the speed of light to the Lieb-Robinson bound for information propagation, are conceptual breakthroughs that often challenge our understanding of the underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during formation of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the inter-atomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions, and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, where the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our experiments provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium and invite similar measurements in other quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Relativistic and electron-correlation effects in static dipole polarizabilities for group 11 elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The static dipole polarizabilities of group 11 elements (Cu, Ag, and Au) are computed using the relativistic coupled-cluster method with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations. Three types of relativistic effects on dipole polarizabilities are investigated: scalar-relativistic, spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and fully relativistic Dirac-Coulomb contributions. The final recommended values, including uncertainties, are $46.91 \pm 1.30$ for Cu, $50.97 \pm 1.88$ for Ag, and $36.68 \pm 0.62$ for Au. Our results show close agreement with the values recommended in the 2018 table of static dipole polarizabilities for neutral elements [Mol. Phys. $\textbf{117}$, 1200 (2019)], with reduced uncertainties for Ag and Au. The analysis indicates that scalar-relativistic effects are the dominant relativistic contribution for these elements, while SOC effects are negligible. The influence of electron correlation across all relativistic regimes is also evaluated, demonstrating its significant role in the accurate calculation of dipole polarizabilities.</description>

      <title>Room temperature buffer gas beam of metastable state titanium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We produce beams of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in their metastable $3d^{3}(^4F){4}s$ $a^5F_5$ state by laser ablation into He, N$_2$, and Ar buffer gases. The high temperatures realized in the ablation process populate the $a^5F_5$ level without the need for optical pumping. Remarkably, we observe that Ti atoms in the $a^5F_5$ state survive $1000$'s of collisions with He and Ar buffer gas atoms without being quenched to lower-energy states. We study the yield of Ti atoms when ablated into buffer gases of varying species and pressure, quantify quenching rates and diffusion cross sections based on simple models, and provide insight into optimal design parameters for an ablation cell. Using a $3.3\,$cm ablation cell with interchangeable exit apertures, we produce metastable atom beams and quantify their brilliance and velocity distributions as functions of buffer gas pressure.</description>

      <title>Towards simultaneous imaging of ultrafast nuclear and electronic dynamics in small molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a chemical bond is broken, the molecular structure undergoes a transformation. An ideal experiment should probe the change in the electronic and nuclear structure simultaneously. Here, we present a method for the simultaneous time-resolved imaging of nuclear and electron dynamics by combining Coulomb explosion imaging with strong-field photoelectron momentum imaging. The simplest chemical reaction, H$_2^+$ $\rightarrow$ H$^+ +$ H, is probed experimentally for the delay-dependent kinetic energy release, and numerically for the transient change in the photoelectron spectra during the dissociation process. The three-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation is solved in the fixed-nuclei approximation numerically and the results are compared to those from a simple imaging model. The numerical results reflect the evolution in the electron density in the molecular ion as its bond is first stretched and then brakes apart. Our work shows how simple gas-phase chemical dynamics can be captured in complete molecular movies.</description>

      <title>Search for high-frequency gravitational waves with Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose high-frequency gravitational wave (GW) detectors with Rydberg atoms. Rydberg atoms are ultra-sensitive detectors of electric fields. By setting up a constant magnetic field, a weak electric field is generated upon the arrival of GWs. The weak electric field signal is then detected by an electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in the system of the Rydberg atoms. Recently, the minimum detectable electric field with the Rydberg atoms is further improved by employing superheterodyne detection method. Hence, even the weak signal generated by GWs turns out to be detectable. We calculate the amplitude of Rabi frequency of the Rydberg atoms induced by the GWs and show that the sensitivity of the Rydberg atoms becomes maximum when the size of the Rydberg atoms is close to the wavelength of GWs. We evaluate the minimum detectable amplitude of GWs with Rubidium Rydberg atoms and find that the detector can probe GWs with a frequency $f=4.2$ GHz and an amplitude around $10^{-20}$.</description>
