      <title>Empowering Credit Scoring Systems with Quantum-Enhanced Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Kernels are projected to provide early-stage usefulness for quantum machine learning. However, highly sophisticated classical models are hard to surpass without losing interpretability, particularly when vast datasets can be exploited. Nonetheless, classical models struggle once data is scarce and skewed. Quantum feature spaces are projected to find better links between data features and the target class to be predicted even in such challenging scenarios and most importantly, enhanced generalization capabilities. In this work, we propose a novel approach called Systemic Quantum Score (SQS) and provide preliminary results indicating potential advantage over purely classical models in a production grade use case for the Finance sector. SQS shows in our specific study an increased capacity to extract patterns out of fewer data points as well as improved performance over data-hungry algorithms such as XGBoost, providing advantage in a competitive market as it is the FinTech and Neobank regime.</description>

      <title>Stress index strategy enhanced with financial news sentiment analysis for the equity markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new risk-on risk-off strategy for the stock market, which combines a financial stress indicator with a sentiment analysis done by ChatGPT reading and interpreting Bloomberg daily market summaries. Forecasts of market stress derived from volatility and credit spreads are enhanced when combined with the financial news sentiment derived from GPT-4. As a result, the strategy shows improved performance, evidenced by higher Sharpe ratio and reduced maximum drawdowns. The improved performance is consistent across the NASDAQ, the S&amp;P 500 and the six major equity markets, indicating that the method generalises across equities markets.</description>
