      <title>Diff4Steer: Steerable Diffusion Prior for Generative Music Retrieval with Semantic Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern music retrieval systems often rely on fixed representations of user preferences, limiting their ability to capture users' diverse and uncertain retrieval needs. To address this limitation, we introduce Diff4Steer, a novel generative retrieval framework that employs lightweight diffusion models to synthesize diverse seed embeddings from user queries that represent potential directions for music exploration. Unlike deterministic methods that map user query to a single point in embedding space, Diff4Steer provides a statistical prior on the target modality (audio) for retrieval, effectively capturing the uncertainty and multi-faceted nature of user preferences. Furthermore, Diff4Steer can be steered by image or text inputs, enabling more flexible and controllable music discovery combined with nearest neighbor search. Our framework outperforms deterministic regression methods and LLM-based generative retrieval baseline in terms of retrieval and ranking metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing user preferences, leading to more diverse and relevant recommendations.

      <title>SMIC: Semantic Multi-Item Compression based on CLIP dictionary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic compression, a compression scheme where the distortion metric, typically MSE, is replaced with semantic fidelity metrics, tends to become more and more popular. Most recent semantic compression schemes rely on the foundation model CLIP. In this work, we extend such a scheme to image collection compression, where inter-item redundancy is taken into account during the coding phase. For that purpose, we first show that CLIP's latent space allows for easy semantic additions and subtractions. From this property, we define a dictionary-based multi-item codec that outperforms state-of-the-art generative codec in terms of compression rate, around $10^{-5}$ BPP per image, while not sacrificing semantic fidelity. We also show that the learned dictionary is of a semantic nature and works as a semantic projector for the semantic content of images.</description>

      <title>LinVT: Empower Your Image-level Large Language Model to Understand Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used in various tasks, motivating us to develop an LLM-based assistant for videos. Instead of training from scratch, we propose a module to transform arbitrary well-trained image-based LLMs into video-LLMs (after being trained on video data). To better adapt image-LLMs for processing videos, we introduce two design principles: linear transformation to preserve the original visual-language alignment and representative information condensation from redundant video content. Guided by these principles, we propose a plug-and-play Linear Video Tokenizer(LinVT), which enables existing image-LLMs to understand videos. We benchmark LinVT with six recent visual LLMs: Aquila, Blip-3, InternVL2, Mipha, Molmo and Qwen2-VL, showcasing the high compatibility of LinVT. LinVT-based LLMs achieve state-of-the-art performance across various video benchmarks, illustrating the effectiveness of LinVT in multi-modal video understanding.</description>

      <title>TopoCode: Topologically Informed Error Detection and Correction in Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional error detection and correction codes focus on bit-level fidelity, which is insufficient for emerging technologies like eXtended Reality (XR) and holographic communications requiring high-data-rate, low-latency systems. Bit-level metrics cannot comprehensively evaluate Quality-of-Service (QoS) in these scenarios. This letter proposes TopoCode which leverages Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and persistent homology to encode topological information for message-level error detection and correction. It introduces minimal redundancy while enabling effective data reconstruction, especially in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions. TopoCode offers a promising approach to meet the demands of next-generation communication systems prioritizing semantic accuracy and message-level integrity.</description>

      <title>Compression of Higher Order Ambisonics with Multichannel RVQGAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A multichannel extension to the RVQGAN neural coding method is proposed, and realized for data-driven compression of third-order Ambisonics audio. The input- and output layers of the generator and discriminator models are modified to accept multiple (16) channels without increasing the model bitrate. We also propose a loss function for accounting for spatial perception in immersive reproduction, and transfer learning from single-channel models. Listening test results with 7.1.4 immersive playback show that the proposed extension is suitable for coding scene-based, 16-channel Ambisonics content with good quality at 16 kbps.</description>

      <title>LongVALE: Vision-Audio-Language-Event Benchmark Towards Time-Aware Omni-Modal Perception of Long Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite impressive advancements in video understanding, most efforts remain limited to coarse-grained or visual-only video tasks. However, real-world videos encompass omni-modal information (vision, audio, and speech) with a series of events forming a cohesive storyline. The lack of multi-modal video data with fine-grained event annotations and the high cost of manual labeling are major obstacles to comprehensive omni-modality video perception. To address this gap, we propose an automatic pipeline consisting of high-quality multi-modal video filtering, semantically coherent omni-modal event boundary detection, and cross-modal correlation-aware event captioning. In this way, we present LongVALE, the first-ever Vision-Audio-Language Event understanding benchmark comprising 105K omni-modal events with precise temporal boundaries and detailed relation-aware captions within 8.4K high-quality long videos. Further, we build a baseline that leverages LongVALE to enable video large language models (LLMs) for omni-modality fine-grained temporal video understanding for the first time. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and great potential of LongVALE in advancing comprehensive multi-modal video understanding.</description>
