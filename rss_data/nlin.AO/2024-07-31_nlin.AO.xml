      <title>Chimera states and information transfer in interacting populations of map-based neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the synchronization behavior and the emergence of chimera states in a system of two interacting populations of maps possessing chaotic neural-like dynamics. We characterize four collective states on the space of coupling parameters of the system: complete synchronization, generalized synchronization, chimera states, and incoherence. We quantify the information exchange between the two neuron populations in chimera states. We have found a well-defined direction of the flow of information in chimera states, from the desynchronized population to the synchronized one. The incoherent population functions as a driver of the coherent neuron population in a chimera state. This feature is independent of the population sizes or population partitions. Our results yield insight into the communication mechanisms arising in brain processes such as unihemispheric sleep and epileptic seizures that have been associated to chimera states.</description>

      <title>Canard cascading in networks with adaptive mean-field coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Canard cascading (CC) is observed in dynamical networks with global adaptive coupling. It is a fast-slow phenomenon characterized by a recurrent sequence of fast transitions between distinct and slowly evolving quasi-stationary states. In this letter, we uncover the dynamical mechanisms behind CC, using an illustrative example of globally and adaptively coupled semiconductor lasers, where CC represents sequential switching on and off the lasers. Firstly, we show that CC is a robust and truly adaptive network effect that is scalable with network size and does not occur without adaptation. Secondly, we uncover multiple saddle slow manifolds (unstable quasi-stationary states) linked by heteroclinic orbits (fast transitions) in the phase space of the system. This allows us to identify CC with a novel heteroclinic canard orbit that organises different unstable quasi-stationary states into an intricate fast-slow limit cycle. Although individual quasi-stationary states are unstable (saddles), the CC cycle as a whole is attractive and robust to parameter changes.</description>

      <title>From chimeras to extensive chaos in networks of heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks of coupled oscillators can exhibit a wide range of complex dynamical behavior, from complete synchronization to chimera and chaotic states. Here we analyze the dynamics of networks of populations of heterogeneous mean-field coupled Kuramoto-Sakaguchi oscillators and show that the instability that leads to chimera states in a simple two-population model also leads to extensive chaos in large networks of coupled populations. Formally, the system consists of a complex network of interacting oscillator populations whose mesoscopic behavior evolves according to the Ott-Antonsen equations. By considering identical parameters across populations, the system contains a manifold of homogeneous solutions where all populations behave identically. Stability analysis of these homogeneous states provided by the Master Stability Function shows that non-trivial dynamics might emerge on a wide region of the parameter space for arbitrary network topologies. As examples, we first revisit the two-population case, and provide a complete bifurcation diagram. Then, we investigate the emergent dynamics in large ring and Erd\"os-R\'enyi networks. In both cases, transverse instabilities lead to extensive space-time chaos, i.e., irregular regimes whose complexity scales linearly with the system size. In summary, our work provides a unified analytical framework to understand the emergent dynamics of networks of Kuramoto populations, from chimera states to robust high-dimensional chaos.</description>

      <title>Memristive Linear Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of memristive devices offers a promising avenue for efficient and scalable analog computing, particularly for linear algebra operations essential in various scientific and engineering applications. This paper investigates the potential of memristive crossbars in implementing matrix inversion algorithms. We explore both static and dynamic approaches, emphasizing the advantages of analog and in-memory computing for matrix operations beyond multiplication. Our results demonstrate that memristive arrays can significantly reduce computational complexity and power consumption compared to traditional digital methods for certain matrix tasks. Furthermore, we address the challenges of device variability, precision, and scalability, providing insights into the practical implementation of these algorithms.</description>

      <title>Non-linear inhibitory responses enhance performance in collective decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise modulation of activity through inhibitory signals ensures that both insect colonies and neural circuits operate efficiently and adaptively, highlighting the fundamental importance of inhibition in biological systems. Modulatory signals are produced in various contexts and are known for subtly shifting the probability of receiver behaviors based on response thresholds. Here we propose a non-linear function to introduce inhibitory responsiveness in collective decision-making inspired by honeybee house-hunting. We show that, compared with usual linear functions, non-linear responses enhance final consensus and reduce deliberation time. This improvement comes at the cost of reduced accuracy in identifying the best option. Nonetheless, for value-based tasks, the benefits of faster consensus and enhanced decision-making might outweigh this drawback.</description>

      <title>Breakthrough-Induced Loop Formation in Evolving Transport Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08878v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transport networks, such as vasculature or river networks, provide key functions in organisms and the environment. They usually contain loops whose significance for the stability and robustness of the network is well documented. However, the dynamics of their formation is usually not considered. Such structures often grow in response to the gradient of an external field. During evolution, extending branches compete for the available flux of the field, which leads to effective repulsion between them and screening of the shorter ones. Yet, in remarkably diverse processes, from unstable fluid flows to the canal system of jellyfish, loops suddenly form near the breakthrough when the longest branch reaches the boundary of the system. We provide a physical explanation for this universal behavior. Using a 1D model, we explain that the appearance of effective attractive forces results from the field drop inside the leading finger as it approaches the outlet. Furthermore, we numerically study the interactions between two fingers, including screening in the system and its disappearance near the breakthrough. Finally, we perform simulations of the temporal evolution of the fingers to show how revival and attraction to the longest finger leads to dynamic loop formation. We compare the simulations to the experiments and find that the dynamics of the shorter finger are well reproduced. Our results demonstrate that reconnection is a prevalent phenomenon in systems driven by diffusive fluxes, occurring both when the ratio of the mobility inside the growing structure to the mobility outside is low and near the breakthrough.</description>
