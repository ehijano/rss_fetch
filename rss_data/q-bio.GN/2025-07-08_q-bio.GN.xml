      <title>AuraGenome: An LLM-Powered Framework for On-the-Fly Reusable and Scalable Circular Genome Visualizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular genome visualizations are essential for exploring structural variants and gene regulation. However, existing tools often require complex scripting and manual configuration, making the process time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to learn. To address these challenges, we introduce AuraGenome, an LLM-powered framework for rapid, reusable, and scalable generation of multi-layered circular genome visualizations. AuraGenome combines a semantic-driven multi-agent workflow with an interactive visual analytics system. The workflow employs seven specialized LLM-driven agents, each assigned distinct roles such as intent recognition, layout planning, and code generation, to transform raw genomic data into tailored visualizations. The system supports multiple coordinated views tailored for genomic data, offering ring, radial, and chord-based layouts to represent multi-layered circular genome visualizations. In addition to enabling interactions and configuration reuse, the system supports real-time refinement and high-quality report export. We validate its effectiveness through two case studies and a comprehensive user study. AuraGenome is available at: https://github.com/Darius18/AuraGenome.</description>

      <title>Modeling Gene Expression Distributional Shifts for Unseen Genetic Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We train a neural network to predict distributional responses in gene expression following genetic perturbations. This is an essential task in early-stage drug discovery, where such responses can offer insights into gene function and inform target identification. Existing methods only predict changes in the mean expression, overlooking stochasticity inherent in single-cell data. In contrast, we offer a more realistic view of cellular responses by modeling expression distributions. Our model predicts gene-level histograms conditioned on perturbations and outperforms baselines in capturing higher-order statistics, such as variance, skewness, and kurtosis, at a fraction of the training cost. To generalize to unseen perturbations, we incorporate prior knowledge via gene embeddings from large language models (LLMs). While modeling a richer output space, the method remains competitive in predicting mean expression changes. This work offers a practical step towards more expressive and biologically informative models of perturbation effects.</description>

      <title>Finding easy regions for short-read variant calling from pangenome data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: While benchmarks on short-read variant calling suggest low error rate below 0.5%, they are only applicable to predefined confident regions. For a human sample without such regions, the error rate could be 10 times higher. Although multiple sets of easy regions have been identified to alleviate the issue, they fail to consider non-reference samples or are biased towards existing short-read data or aligners.
  Results: Here, using hundreds of high-quality human assemblies, we derived a set of sample-agnostic easy regions where short-read variant calling reaches high accuracy. These regions cover 87.9% of GRCh38, 92.7% of coding regions and 96.4% of ClinVar pathogenic variants. They achieve a good balance between coverage and easiness and can be generated for other human assemblies or species with multiple well assembled genomes.
  Conclusion: This resource provides a convient and powerful way to filter spurious variant calls for clinical or research human samples.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks as a Substitute for Transformers in Single-Cell Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers share significant similarities in their encoding strategies for interacting with features from nodes of interest, where Transformers use query-key scores and GNNs use edges. Compared to GNNs, which are unable to encode relative positions, Transformers leverage dynamic attention capabilities to better represent relative relationships, thereby becoming the standard backbones in large-scale sequential pre-training. However, the subtle difference prompts us to consider: if positions are no longer crucial, could we substitute Transformers with Graph Neural Networks in some fields such as Single-Cell Transcriptomics? In this paper, we first explore the similarities and differences between GNNs and Transformers, specifically in terms of relative positions. Additionally, we design a synthetic example to illustrate their equivalence where there are no relative positions between tokens in the sample. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a large-scale position-agnostic dataset-single-cell transcriptomics-finding that GNNs achieve competitive performance compared to Transformers while consuming fewer computation resources. These findings provide novel insights for researchers in the field of single-cell transcriptomics, challenging the prevailing notion that the Transformer is always the optimum choice.</description>

      <title>Classification of autoimmune diseases from Peripheral blood TCR repertoires by multimodal multi-instance learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires encode critical immunological signatures for autoimmune diseases, yet their clinical application remains limited by sequence sparsity and low witness rates. We developed EAMil, a multi-instance deep learning framework that leverages TCR sequencing data to diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with exceptional accuracy. By integrating PrimeSeq feature extraction with ESMonehot encoding and enhanced gate attention mechanisms, our model achieved state-of-the-art performance with AUCs of 98.95% for SLE and 97.76% for RA. EAMil successfully identified disease-associated genes with over 90% concordance with established differential analyses and effectively distinguished disease-specific TCR genes. The model demonstrated robustness in classifying multiple disease categories, utilizing the SLEDAI score to stratify SLE patients by disease severity as well as to diagnose the site of damage in SLE patients, and effectively controlling for confounding factors such as age and gender. This interpretable framework for immune receptor analysis provides new insights for autoimmune disease detection and classification with broad potential clinical applications across immune-mediated conditions.</description>

      <title>JanusDNA: A Powerful Bi-directional Hybrid DNA Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing and are increasingly applied to other sequential data types, including genetic sequences. However, adapting LLMs to genomics presents significant challenges. Capturing complex genomic interactions requires modeling long-range dependencies within DNA sequences, where interactions often span over 10,000 base pairs, even within a single gene, posing substantial computational burdens under conventional model architectures and training paradigms. Moreover, standard LLM training approaches are suboptimal for DNA: autoregressive training, while efficient, supports only unidirectional understanding. However, DNA is inherently bidirectional, e.g., bidirectional promoters regulate transcription in both directions and account for nearly 11% of human gene expression. Masked language models (MLMs) allow bidirectional understanding but are inefficient, as only masked tokens contribute to the loss per step. To address these limitations, we introduce JanusDNA, the first bidirectional DNA foundation model built upon a novel pretraining paradigm that combines the optimization efficiency of autoregressive modeling with the bidirectional comprehension of masked modeling. JanusDNA adopts a hybrid Mamba, Attention and Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, combining long-range modeling of Attention with efficient sequential learning of Mamba. MoE layers further scale model capacity via sparse activation while keeping computational cost low. Notably, JanusDNA processes up to 1 million base pairs at single nucleotide resolution on a single 80GB GPU. Extensive experiments and ablations show JanusDNA achieves new SOTA results on three genomic representation benchmarks, outperforming models with 250x more activated parameters.

      <title>Predicting function of evolutionarily implausible DNA sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) show potential for generating novel, functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology, but doing so requires them to learn not just evolutionary plausibility, but also sequence-to-function relationships. We introduce a set of prediction tasks called Nullsettes, which assesses a model's ability to predict loss-of-function mutations created by translocating key control elements in synthetic expression cassettes. Across 12 state-of-the-art models, we find that mutation effect prediction performance strongly correlates with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant. Furthermore, the range of likelihood values predictive of strong model performance is highly dependent on sequence length. Our work highlights the importance of considering both sequence likelihood and sequence length when using gLMs for mutation effect prediction.</description>
