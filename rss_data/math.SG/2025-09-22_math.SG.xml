      <title>Packing stability and the subleading asymptotics of symplectic Weyl laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that symplectic ball packing stability holds for every compact, connected symplectic $4$-manifold with smooth boundary. This follows from a stronger result: the full volume of any such manifold can be filled by a single symplectic ellipsoid. As an application, we obtain estimates - with sharp exponents - for the error terms in the symplectic Weyl laws for embedded contact homology capacities, periodic Floer homology spectral invariants, and link spectral invariants. We also construct an example of a star-shaped domain in $\mathbb{R}^4$, arbitrarily $C^1$ close to the unit ball and with boundary of regularity just below $C^2$ and smooth away from a single point, for which packing stability fails. Our proofs reveal a close connection between symplectic packing stability in the presence of smooth boundary and the algebraic structure of Hamiltonian diffeomorphism groups, particularly Banyaga's simplicity results.</description>

      <title>Atoms meet symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for constructing invariants in $G$-equivariant birational geometry by unifying two recent approaches: the \emph{theory of atoms} recently developed by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, Pantev, and Yu, and the theory of \emph{modular symbols} due to Kontsevich, Tschinkel, and Pestun.
  We initiate the theory of Chen-Ruan atoms. Assuming the blowup formula for the quantum Chen-Ruan cohomology, we outline how to extend the theory of atoms to global quotient orbifolds and present some striking applications.
  In addition, we develop a separate class of purely geometric invariants for $\mathbb{Z}/2$- and $\mathbb{Z}/3$-actions on surfaces and threefolds.
  We provide many examples of non-$G$-linearizable $G$-actions on projective varieties treated with these new techniques.</description>

      <title>Universal families of twisted cotangent bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a complex algebraic group $G$ and complex $G$-variety $X$, one can study the affine Hamiltonian Lagrangian (AHL) $G$-bundles over $X$. Lisiecki indexes the isomorphism classes of such bundles in the case of a homogeneous $G$-variety $X=G/H$; the indexing set is the set of $H$-fixed points $(\mathfrak{h}^*)^H\subset\mathfrak{h}^*$, where $\mathfrak{h}$ is the Lie algebra of $H$. In very rough terms, one may regard $\psi\in(\mathfrak{h}^*)^H$ as labeling the isomorphism class of a $\psi$-twisted cotangent bundle of $G/H$. These twisted cotangent bundles feature prominently in geometric representation theory and symplectic geometry.
  We introduce and examine the notion of a universal family of AHL $G$-bundles over a $G$-variety $X$, as part of a broader program on Lie-theoretic and incidence-theoretic constructions of regular Poisson varieties. This family is defined to be a flat family $\pi:\mathcal{U}\longrightarrow Y$, in which $\mathcal{U}$ is a Poisson variety, the fibers of $\pi$ form a complete list of representatives of the isomorphism classes of AHL $G$-bundles over $X$, and other pertinent properties are satisfied. Our first main result is the construction of a universal family of AHL $G$-bundles over a homogeneous base $X=G/H$, for connected $H$. In our second main result, we take $X$ to be a conjugacy class $\mathcal{C}$ of self-normalizing closed subgroups of $G$. We associate to $\mathcal{C}$ a regular Poisson variety $\mathcal{U}_{\mathcal{C}}$, defined in incidence-theoretic terms. Attention is paid to the case of conjugacy classes of normalizers of symmetric subgroups. In the case of a connected semisimple group $G$ and conjugacy class $\mathcal{C}$ of parabolic subgroups, our third main result relates $\mathcal{U}_{\mathcal{C}}$ to the partial Grothendieck-Springer resolution for $\mathcal{C}$.</description>

      <title>Computations in equivariant Gromov-Witten theory of GKM spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study equivariant Gromov-Witten invariants and quantum cohomology in GKM theory. Building on the localization formula, we prove that the resulting expression is independent of the choice of compatible connection, and provide an equivalent formulation without auxiliary choices. Motivated by this theoretical refinement, we develop a software package, $\mathtt{GKMtools . jl}$, that implements the computation of equivariant GW invariants and quantum products directly from the GKM graph. We apply our framework to several geometric settings: Calabi-Yau rank two vector bundles on the projective line, where we obtain a new proof for a recent connection to Donaldson-Thomas theory of Kronecker quivers; twisted flag manifolds, which give symplectic but non-algebraic examples of GKM spaces; realizability questions for abstract GKM graphs; and classical enumerative problems involving curves in hyperplanes. These results demonstrate both the theoretical flexibility of GKM methods and the effectiveness of computational tools in exploring new phenomena.</description>
