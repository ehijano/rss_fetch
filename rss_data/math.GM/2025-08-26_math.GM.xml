      <title>Polynomial-Time Exact Algorithm for Non-preemptive Single-Machine Scheduling with Heterogeneous Release and Processing Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the non-preemptive single-machine scheduling problem with heterogeneous release and processing times, where minimizing total waiting time is NP-hard. We introduce a novel waiting-time formula that preserves global information, which derive a specific structural condition that transforms the problem into a tractable form. Leveraging this formula, we develop a structure-driven analytical framework that uses inductive reasoning to characterize the feasible solution space. This space enables the identification of key job movements that theoretically minimize total waiting time, followed by working backward from the optimality conditions to schedule the remaining jobs. Based on this framework, we design a provably exact algorithm with $\mathcal{O}(n^9)$ time complexity. Numerical experiments validate both the optimality and computational efficiency of our method, demonstrating substantial performance gains over Gurobi. These results highlight the algorithm's potential as a powerful tool for solving a class of otherwise intractable scheduling problems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Strategies to Catch Randomly Walking Cat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal strategies to catch a randomly walking cat in various environments are presented. All games have a player that opens a box at step $i$. If the cat is in this box the player wins, if not, the cat moves randomly to an adjacent box, or in case the box is open to the outside, the cat may escape. If the cat is not escaping, the next step of the game is played. In case the cat has doors to escape, the optimal strategy is determined that minimizes the escape chances of the cat. If there are no doors to the outside, the strategies are calculated that minimize the game duration. The environments are 1) a one-dimensional array of up to 9 boxes in a line 2) this line is connected to a ring and 3) a $2 \times m$ grid (with $2\le m\le 4$) of boxes. In cases 1) and 3) the boxes may or may not have exits to the outside. Numerical proofs for the optimality of the presented strategies are outlined. Also a formula is presented for the average number of steps it takes a randomly walking cat to exit a $2\times m$ grid when no player is involved. This formula is only based on Fibonacci numbers if $m$ is even and Lucas numbers if $m$ is odd.</description>

      <title>Mathematics of Gozinta Boxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometric aspects of the magic trick called Gozinta Boxes. We generalize Gozinta Boxes to other dimensions, and we show that in three and higher dimensions, the maximum number of boxes is 3, and in two dimensions, the maximum is 4. We discuss other properties of Gozinta Boxes and provide a plethora of examples.</description>

      <title>Bent functions using Maiorana-McFarland secondary construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19676v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bent functions are balanced by restricting their domains to vectors with either even or odd Hamming weights, which ensures an equal number of pre-images for both, 0 and 1. Using the previous fact, we can construct bent functions on two affine spaces. Additionally, we employ the Maiorana-McFarland secondary construction to obtain bent functions. Furthermore, the functions produced are balanced when we restrict their domain to vectors with even Hamming weights. We also conduct specific comparisons of the Walsh-Hadamard transform in relation to both the original bent functions and the newly generated ones. With all the necessary tools, we present an algorithm that leverages the Maiorana-McFarland secondary construction approach repeatedly to generate bent functions of any dimension.</description>

      <title>The new Fermat-type factorization algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let n be any odd natural number other than a perfect square, in this article it is demonstrated that this new factorization algorithm is much more efficient than the implementation technique [2,3 p.1470], described in this article, of the Fermat's factorization algorithm [1 p.6,3 p.1470], implementation technique which I call the Fermat's factorization method (like the title, translated into English, of the reference document [2] published in Italian) and which is, among the implementation techniques [1 pp.6-8,2,3 pp.1470-1471] of the Fermat's factorization algorithm, the one with which a smaller iterations number occurs to identify the factors, trivial or non-trivial, of n (except for the circumstance in which two factors, trivial or non-trivial, of n are so close to each other that they are identified at the 1st iteration with each of the implementation techniques of the Fermat's factorization algorithm). In fact, through the way in which the Euler's function [4] is applied to the Fermat's factorization method, we arrive at this new factorization algorithm with which we obtain the certain reduction in the iterations number (except for the cases in which two factors of n are so close to each other that they are identified at the 1st iteration with the Fermat's factorization method) compared to the iterations number that occurs with the Fermat's factorization method. Furthermore, in this article I represent the hypotheses field according to which it will eventually be possible to further reduce the iterations number. Finally and always in relation to this new factorization algorithm, in this article I represent in detail the limit iterations number, which is smaller than the iterations number that occurs to reach the condition x - y = 1 which characterizes the pair of trivial factors of n, beyond which it is no longer possible for pairs of non-trivial factors of n to occur.</description>

      <title>Patterns Within the Markov Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An analysis of the Markov tree is presented. Markov triplets, {x,R,z}, are the positive integer solutions to the Diophantine equation x2 + R2 + z2 = 3xRz. Inspired by patterns of the Fibonacci and Pell triplets in Region 1 and Region 2 of the tree, an investigation of interior regions of the Markov tree finds generating functions and sequence functions for all triplets of all regions. These sequence functions lead to the discovery of a Pell equation for the Markov region numbers along the edges of all regions. Analysis of this Pell equation leads to the resolution of the Uniqueness Conjecture. Further analysis using these sequence functions finds palindromic repeat cycles of the last digits of region numbers along the edges of all regions. Then, since all Markov numbers are the sum of the squares of two integers and again inspired by the patterns of the two unique squares which sum to form the region numbers of certain Fibonacci triplets in Region 1, an investigation of interior regions of the Markov tree finds generating functions and sequence functions for the two special square terms which sum to form the region numbers of the triplets along the edges of all regions. Further analysis using these sequence functions finds palindromic repeat cycles of the last digits of these two special square terms for all regions.</description>
