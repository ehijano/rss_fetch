      <title>Multi-centre normative brain mapping of intracranial EEG lifespan patterns in the human brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Understanding healthy human brain function is crucial to identify and map pathological tissue within it. Whilst previous studies have mapped intracranial EEG (icEEG) from non-epileptogenic brain regions, these maps do not consider the effects of age and sex. Further, most existing work on icEEG has often suffered from a small sample size due to this modality's invasive nature. Here, we substantially increase the subject sample size compared to existing literature, to create a multi-centre, normative map of brain activity which additionally considers the effects of age, sex and recording site.
  Methods: Using interictal icEEG recordings from n = 513 subjects originating from 15 centres, we constructed a normative map of non-pathological brain activity by regressing age and sex on relative band power in five frequency bands, whilst accounting for the site effect.
  Results: Recording site significantly impacted normative icEEG maps in all frequency bands, and age was a more influential predictor of band power than sex. The age effect varied by frequency band, but no spatial patterns were observed at the region-specific level. Certainty about regression coefficients was also frequency band specific and moderately impacted by sample size.
  Conclusion: The concept of a normative map is well-established in neuroscience research and particularly relevant to the icEEG modality, which does not allow healthy control baselines. Our key results regarding the site and age effect guide future work utilising normative maps in icEEG.</description>

      <title>A symbolic information approach applied to human intracranial data to characterize and distinguish different congnitive processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How the human brain processes information during different cognitive tasks is one of the greatest questions in contemporary neuroscience. Understanding the statistical properties of brain signals during specific activities is one promising way to address this question. Here we analyze freely available data from implanted electrocorticography (ECoG) in five human subjects during two different cognitive tasks in the light of information theory quantifiers ideas. We employ a symbolic information approach to determine the probability distribution function associated with the time series from different cortical areas. Then we utilize these probabilities to calculate the associated Shannon entropy and a statistical complexity measure based on the disequilibrium between the actual time series and one with a uniform probability distribution function. We show that an Euclidian distance in the complexity-entropy plane and an asymmetry index for complexity are useful for comparing the two conditions. We show that our method can distinguish visual search epochs from blank screen intervals in different electrodes and patients. By using a multi-scale approach and embedding time delays to downsample the data, we find important time scales in which the relevant information is being processed. We also determine cortical regions and time intervals along the 2-second-long trials that present more pronounced differences between the two cognitive tasks. Finally, we show that the method is useful to distinguish cognitive processes using brain activity on a trial-by-trial basis.</description>

      <title>Diversity in the radiation-induced transcriptomic temporal response of mouse brain tissue regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of studies have indicated a potential association between prenatal exposure to radiation and late mental disabilities. This is believed to be due to long-term developmental changes and functional impairment of the central nervous system following radiation exposure during gestation. This study conducted a bioinformatics analysis on transcriptomic profiles from mouse brain tissue prenatally exposed to increasing doses of X-radiation. Gene expression levels were assessed in different brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum) and collected at different time points (at 1 and 6 months after birth) for C57BL mice exposed at embryonic day E11 to varying doses of radiation (0, 0.1 and 1 Gy). This study aimed to elucidate the differences in response to radiation between different brain regions at different intervals after birth (1 and 6 months). The data was visualised using a two-dimensional Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) projection, and the influence of the factors was investigated using analysis of variance (ANOVA). It was observed that gene expression was influenced by each factor (tissue, time, and dose), although to varying degrees. The gene expression trend within doses was compared for each tissue, as well as the significant pathways between tissues at different time intervals. Furthermore, in addition to radiation-responsive pathways, Cytoscape's functional and network analyses revealed changes in various pathways related to cognition, which is consistent with previously published data [1] [2] [3], indicating late behavioural changes in animals prenatally exposed to radiation.</description>

      <title>Resource-rational reinforcement learning and sensorimotor causal states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new computational-level objective function for theoretical biology and theoretical neuroscience that combines: reinforcement learning, the study of learning with feedback via rewards; rate-distortion theory, a branch of information theory that deals with compressing signals to retain relevant information; and computational mechanics, the study of minimal sufficient statistics of prediction also known as causal states. We highlight why this proposal is likely only an approximation, but is likely to be an interesting one, and propose a new algorithm for evaluating it to obtain the newly-coined "reward-rate manifold". The performance of real and artificial agents in partially observable environments can be newly benchmarked using these reward-rate manifolds. Finally, we describe experiments that can probe whether or not biological organisms are resource-rational reinforcement learners.</description>

      <title>Quantized Context Based LIF Neurons for Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks in 45nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose the first hardware implementation of a context-based recurrent spiking neural network (RSNN) emphasizing on integrating dual information streams within the neocortical pyramidal neurons specifically Context- Dependent Leaky Integrate and Fire (CLIF) neuron models, essential element in RSNN. We present a quantized version of the CLIF neuron (qCLIF), developed through a hardware-software codesign approach utilizing the sparse activity of RSNN. Implemented in a 45nm technology node, the qCLIF is compact (900um^2) and achieves a high accuracy of 90% despite 8 bit quantization on DVS gesture classification dataset. Our analysis spans a network configuration from 10 to 200 qCLIF neurons, supporting up to 82k synapses within a 1.86 mm^2 footprint, demonstrating scalability and efficiency</description>

      <title>fMRI Exploration of Visual Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant strides in visual quality assessment, the neural mechanisms underlying visual quality perception remain insufficiently explored. This study employed fMRI to examine brain activity during image quality assessment and identify differences in human processing of images with varying quality. Fourteen healthy participants underwent tasks assessing both image quality and content classification while undergoing functional MRI scans. The collected behavioral data was statistically analyzed, and univariate and functional connectivity analyses were conducted on the imaging data. The findings revealed that quality assessment is a more complex task than content classification, involving enhanced activation in high-level cognitive brain regions for fine-grained visual analysis. Moreover, the research showed the brain's adaptability to different visual inputs, adopting different strategies depending on the input's quality. In response to high-quality images, the brain primarily uses specialized visual areas for precise analysis, whereas with low-quality images, it recruits additional resources including higher-order visual cortices and related cognitive and attentional networks to decode and recognize complex, ambiguous signals effectively. This study pioneers the intersection of neuroscience and image quality research, providing empirical evidence through fMRI linking image quality to neural processing. It contributes novel insights into the human visual system's response to diverse image qualities, thereby paving the way for advancements in objective image quality assessment algorithms.</description>

      <title>Brain memory working. Optimal control behavior for improved Hopfield-like models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several authors have recently highlighted the need for a new dynamical paradigm in the modelling of brain working and evolution. In particular, the models should include the possibility of non constant and non symmetric synaptic weights $T_{ij}$ in the neuron-neuron interaction matrix, radically overcoming the classical Hopfield setting. Krotov and Hopfield have proposed a non constant, still symmetric model, leading to a vector field describing a gradient type dynamics then including a Lyapunov-like energy function. In this note, we first will detail the general condition to produce a Hopfield like vector field of gradient type obtaining, as a particular case, the Krotov-Hopfield condition. Secondly, we abandon the symmetry because of two relevant physiological facts: (1) the actual neural connections have a marked directional character and (2) the gradient structure deriving from the symmetry forces the dynamics always towards stationary points, prescribing every pattern to be recognized. We propose a novel model including a set of limited but varying controls $|\xi_{ij}|\leq K$ used for correcting a starting constant interaction matrix, $T_{ij}=A_{ij}+\xi_{ij}$. Besides, we introduce a reasonable controlled variational functional to be optimized. This allows us to reproduce the following three possible outcomes when submitting a pattern to the learning system. If (1) the dynamics leads to an already existing stationary point without activating the controls, the system has \emph{recognized} an existing pattern. If (2) a new stationary point is reached by the activation of controls, then the system has \emph{learned} a new pattern. If (3) the dynamics is \emph{wandering} without reaching neither existing or new stationary points, then the system is unable to recognize or learn the pattern submitted. A further feature (4), appears to model \emph{forgetting and restoring} memory.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model of the visual MacKay effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the intricate connection between visual perception and the mathematical modelling of neural activity in the primary visual cortex (V1). The focus is on modelling the visual MacKay effect [Mackay, Nature 1957]. While bifurcation theory has been a prominent mathematical approach for addressing issues in neuroscience, especially in describing spontaneous pattern formations in V1 due to parameter changes, it faces challenges in scenarios with localized sensory inputs. This is evident, for instance, in Mackay's psychophysical experiments, where the redundancy of visual stimuli information results in irregular shapes, making bifurcation theory and multi-scale analysis less effective. To address this, we follow a mathematical viewpoint based on the input-output controllability of an Amari-type neural fields model. In this framework, we consider sensory input as a control function, a cortical representation via the retino-cortical map of the visual stimulus that captures its distinct features. This includes highly localized information in the center of MacKay's funnel pattern "MacKay rays". From a control theory point of view, the Amari-type equation's exact controllability property is discussed for linear and nonlinear response functions. For the visual MacKay effect modelling, we adjust the parameter representing intra-neuron connectivity to ensure that cortical activity exponentially stabilizes to the stationary state in the absence of sensory input. Then, we perform quantitative and qualitative studies to demonstrate that they capture all the essential features of the induced after-image reported by MacKay.</description>
