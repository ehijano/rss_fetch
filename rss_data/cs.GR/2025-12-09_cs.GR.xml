      <title>Inverse Discrete Elastic Rod</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse design of slender elastic structures underlies a wide range of applications in computer graphics, flexible electronics, biomedical devices, and soft robotics. Traditional optimization-based approaches, however, are often orders of magnitude slower than forward dynamic simulations and typically impose restrictive boundary conditions. In this work, we present an inverse discrete elastic rods (inverse-DER) method that enables efficient and accurate inverse design under general loading and boundary conditions. By reformulating the inverse problem as a static equilibrium in the reference configuration, our method attains computational efficiency comparable to forward simulations while preserving high fidelity. This framework allows rapid determination of undeformed geometries for elastic fabrication structures that naturally deform into desired target shapes upon actuation or loading. We validate the approach through both physical prototypes and forward simulations, demonstrating its accuracy, robustness, and potential for real-world design applications.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Humanoid Imitation Learning with Motion Difficulty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-based motion imitation is central to humanoid control, yet current evaluation metrics (e.g., joint position error) only measure how well a policy imitates but not how difficult the motion itself is. This conflates policy performance with motion difficulty, obscuring whether failures stem from poor learning or inherently challenging motions. In this work, we address this gap with Motion Difficulty Score (MDS), a novel metric that defines and quantifies imitation difficulty independent of policy performance. Grounded in rigid-body dynamics, MDS interprets difficulty as the torque variation induced by small pose perturbations: larger torque-to-pose variation yields flatter reward landscapes and thus higher learning difficulty. MDS captures this through three properties of the perturbation-induced torque space: volume, variance, and temporal variability. We also use it to construct MD-AMASS, a difficulty-aware repartitioning of the AMASS dataset. Empirically, we rigorously validate MDS by demonstrating its explanatory power on the performance of state-of-the-art motion imitation policies. We further demonstrate the utility of MDS through two new MDS-based metrics: Maximum Imitable Difficulty (MID) and Difficulty-Stratified Joint Error (DSJE), providing fresh insights into imitation learning.</description>

      <title>Human Geometry Distribution for 3D Animation Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating realistic human geometry animations remains a challenging task, as it requires modeling natural clothing dynamics with fine-grained geometric details under limited data. To address these challenges, we propose two novel designs. First, we propose a compact distribution-based latent representation that enables efficient and high-quality geometry generation. We improve upon previous work by establishing a more uniform mapping between SMPL and avatar geometries. Second, we introduce a generative animation model that fully exploits the diversity of limited motion data. We focus on short-term transitions while maintaining long-term consistency through an identity-conditioned design. These two designs formulate our method as a two-stage framework: the first stage learns a latent space, while the second learns to generate animations within this latent space. We conducted experiments on both our latent space and animation model. We demonstrate that our latent space produces high-fidelity human geometry surpassing previous methods ($90\%$ lower Chamfer Dist.). The animation model synthesizes diverse animations with detailed and natural dynamics ($2.2 \times$ higher user study score), achieving the best results across all evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>COIVis: Eye tracking-based Visual Exploration of Concept Learning in MOOC Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) make high-quality instruction accessible. However, the lack of face-to-face interaction makes it difficult for instructors to obtain feedback on learners' performance and provide more effective instructional guidance. Traditional analytical approaches, such as clickstream logs or quiz scores, capture only coarse-grained learning outcomes and offer limited insight into learners' moment-to-moment cognitive states. In this study, we propose COIVis, an eye tracking-based visual analytics system that supports concept-level exploration of learning processes in MOOC videos. COIVis first extracts course concepts from multimodal video content and aligns them with the temporal structure and screen space of the lecture, defining Concepts of Interest (COIs), which anchor abstract concepts to specific spatiotemporal regions. Learners' gaze trajectories are transformed into COI sequences, and five interpretable learner-state features -- Attention, Cognitive Load, Interest, Preference, and Synchronicity -- are computed at the COI level based on eye tracking metrics. Building on these representations, COIVis provides a narrative, multi-view visualization enabling instructors to move from cohort-level overviews to individual learning paths, quickly locate problematic concepts, and compare diverse learning strategies. We evaluate COIVis through two case studies and in-depth user-feedback interviews. The results demonstrate that COIVis effectively provides instructors with valuable insights into the consistency and anomalies of learners' learning patterns, thereby supporting timely and personalized interventions for learners and optimizing instructional design.</description>

      <title>Multi-Rigid-Body Approximation of Human Hands with Application to Digital Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human hand simulation plays a critical role in digital twin applications, requiring models that balance anatomical fidelity with computational efficiency. We present a complete pipeline for constructing multi-rigid-body approximations of human hands that preserve realistic appearance while enabling real-time physics simulation. Starting from optical motion capture of a specific human hand, we construct a personalized MANO (Multi-Abstracted hand model with Neural Operations) model and convert it to a URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) representation with anatomically consistent joint axes. The key technical challenge is projecting MANO's unconstrained SO(3) joint rotations onto the kinematically constrained joints of the rigid-body model. We derive closed-form solutions for single degree-of-freedom joints and introduce a Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH)-corrected iterative method for two degree-of-freedom joints that properly handles the non-commutativity of rotations. We validate our approach through digital twin experiments where reinforcement learning policies control the multi-rigid-body hand to replay captured human demonstrations. Quantitative evaluation shows sub-centimeter reconstruction error and successful grasp execution across diverse manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>From Orbit to Ground: Generative City Photogrammetry from Extreme Off-Nadir Satellite Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: City-scale 3D reconstruction from satellite imagery presents the challenge of extreme viewpoint extrapolation, where our goal is to synthesize ground-level novel views from sparse orbital images with minimal parallax. This requires inferring nearly $90^\circ$ viewpoint gaps from image sources with severely foreshortened facades and flawed textures, causing state-of-the-art reconstruction engines such as NeRF and 3DGS to fail.
  To address this problem, we propose two design choices tailored for city structures and satellite inputs. First, we model city geometry as a 2.5D height map, implemented as a Z-monotonic signed distance field (SDF) that matches urban building layouts from top-down viewpoints. This stabilizes geometry optimization under sparse, off-nadir satellite views and yields a watertight mesh with crisp roofs and clean, vertically extruded facades. Second, we paint the mesh appearance from satellite images via differentiable rendering techniques. While the satellite inputs may contain long-range, blurry captures, we further train a generative texture restoration network to enhance the appearance, recovering high-frequency, plausible texture details from degraded inputs.
  Our method's scalability and robustness are demonstrated through extensive experiments on large-scale urban reconstruction. For example, in our teaser figure, we reconstruct a $4\,\mathrm{km}^2$ real-world region from only a few satellite images, achieving state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing photorealistic ground views. The resulting models are not only visually compelling but also serve as high-fidelity, application-ready assets for downstream tasks like urban planning and simulation.</description>

      <title>Lang3D-XL: Language Embedded 3D Gaussians for Large-scale Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embedding a language field in a 3D representation enables richer semantic understanding of spatial environments by linking geometry with descriptive meaning. This allows for a more intuitive human-computer interaction, enabling querying or editing scenes using natural language, and could potentially improve tasks like scene retrieval, navigation, and multimodal reasoning. While such capabilities could be transformative, in particular for large-scale scenes, we find that recent feature distillation approaches cannot effectively learn over massive Internet data due to challenges in semantic feature misalignment and inefficiency in memory and runtime. To this end, we propose a novel approach to address these challenges. First, we introduce extremely low-dimensional semantic bottleneck features as part of the underlying 3D Gaussian representation. These are processed by rendering and passing them through a multi-resolution, feature-based, hash encoder. This significantly improves efficiency both in runtime and GPU memory. Second, we introduce an Attenuated Downsampler module and propose several regularizations addressing the semantic misalignment of ground truth 2D features. We evaluate our method on the in-the-wild HolyScenes dataset and demonstrate that it surpasses existing approaches in both performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Localized Evaluation for Constructing Discrete Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04769v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological abstractions offer a method to summarize the behavior of vector fields but computing them robustly can be challenging due to numerical precision issues. One alternative is to represent the vector field using a discrete approach, which constructs a collection of pairs of simplices in the input mesh that satisfies criteria introduced by Forman's discrete Morse theory. While numerous approaches exist to compute pairs in the restricted case of the gradient of a scalar field, state-of-the-art algorithms for the general case of vector fields require expensive optimization procedures. This paper introduces a fast, novel approach for pairing simplices of two-dimensional, triangulated vector fields that do not vary in time. The key insight of our approach is that we can employ a local evaluation, inspired by the approach used to construct a discrete gradient field, where every simplex in a mesh is considered by no more than one of its vertices. Specifically, we observe that for any edge in the input mesh, we can uniquely assign an outward direction of flow. We can further expand this consistent notion of outward flow at each vertex, which corresponds to the concept of a downhill flow in the case of scalar fields. Working with outward flow enables a linear-time algorithm that processes the (outward) neighborhoods of each vertex one-by-one, similar to the approach used for scalar fields. We couple our approach to constructing discrete vector fields with a method to extract, simplify, and visualize topological features. Empirical results on analytic and simulation data demonstrate drastic improvements in running time, produce features similar to the current state-of-the-art, and show the application of simplification to large, complex flows.</description>

      <title>HodgeFormer: Transformers for Learnable Operators on Triangular Meshes through Data-Driven Hodge Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01839v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Currently, prominent Transformer architectures applied on graphs and meshes for shape analysis tasks employ traditional attention layers that heavily utilize spectral features requiring costly eigenvalue decomposition-based methods. To encode the mesh structure, these methods derive positional embeddings, that heavily rely on eigenvalue decomposition based operations, e.g. on the Laplacian matrix, or on heat-kernel signatures, which are then concatenated to the input features. This paper proposes a novel approach inspired by the explicit construction of the Hodge Laplacian operator in Discrete Exterior Calculus as a product of discrete Hodge operators and exterior derivatives, i.e. $(L := \star_0^{-1} d_0^T \star_1 d_0)$. We adjust the Transformer architecture in a novel deep learning layer that utilizes the multi-head attention mechanism to approximate Hodge matrices $\star_0$, $\star_1$ and $\star_2$ and learn families of discrete operators $L$ that act on mesh vertices, edges and faces. Our approach results in a computationally-efficient architecture that achieves comparable performance in mesh segmentation and classification tasks, through a direct learning framework, while eliminating the need for costly eigenvalue decomposition operations or complex preprocessing operations.</description>

      <title>Learning Conjugate Direction Fields for Planar Quadrilateral Mesh Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planar quadrilateral (PQ) mesh generation is a key process in computer-aided design, particularly for architectural applications where the goal is to discretize a freeform surface using planar quad faces. The conjugate direction field (CDF) defined on the freeform surface plays a significant role in generating a PQ mesh, as it largely determines the PQ mesh layout. Conventionally, a CDF is obtained by solving a complex non-linear optimization problem that incorporates user preferences, i.e., aligning the CDF with user-specified strokes on the surface. This often requires a large number of iterations that are computationally expensive, preventing the interactive CDF design process for a desirable PQ mesh. To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven approach based on neural networks for controlled CDF generation. Our approach can effectively learn and fuse features from the freeform surface and the user strokes, and efficiently generate quality CDF respecting user guidance. To enable training and testing, we also present a dataset composed of 50000+ freeform surfaces with ground-truth CDFs, as well as a set of metrics for quantitative evaluation. The effectiveness and efficiency of our work are demonstrated by extensive experiments using testing data, architectural surfaces, and general 3D shapes.</description>

      <title>A General Approach to Visualizing Uncertainty in Statistical Graphics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general approach to visualizing uncertainty in static 2-D statistical graphics. If we treat a visualization as a function of its underlying quantities, uncertainty in those quantities induces a distribution over images. We show how to aggregate these images into a single visualization that represents the uncertainty. The approach can be viewed as a generalization of sample-based approaches that use overlay. Notably, standard representations, such as confidence intervals and bands, emerge with their usual coverage guarantees without being explicitly quantified or visualized. As a proof of concept, we implement our approach in the IID setting using resampling, provided as an open-source Python library. Because the approach operates directly on images, the user needs only to supply the data and the code for visualizing the quantities of interest without uncertainty. Through several examples, we show how both familiar and novel forms of uncertainty visualization can be created. The implementation is not only a practical validation of the underlying theory but also an immediately usable tool that can complement existing uncertainty-visualization libraries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-driven 3D scene generation holds promise for a wide range of applications, from virtual prototyping to AR/VR and simulation. However, existing methods are often constrained to single-object generation, require domain-specific training, or lack support for full 360-degree viewability. In this work, we present a training-free approach to 3D scene synthesis by repurposing general-purpose text-to-3D object diffusion models as modular tile generators. We reformulate scene generation as a multi-tile denoising problem, where overlapping 3D regions are independently generated and seamlessly blended via weighted averaging. This enables scalable synthesis of large, coherent scenes while preserving local semantic control. Our method eliminates the need for scene-level datasets or retraining, relies on minimal heuristics, and inherits the generalization capabilities of object-level priors. We demonstrate that our approach supports diverse scene layouts, efficient generation, and flexible editing, establishing a simple yet powerful foundation for general-purpose, language-driven 3D scene construction.</description>

      <title>FACT-GS: Frequency-Aligned Complexity-Aware Texture Reparameterization for 2D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realistic scene appearance modeling has advanced rapidly with Gaussian Splatting, which enables real-time, high-quality rendering. Recent advances introduced per-primitive textures that incorporate spatial color variations within each Gaussian, improving their expressiveness. However, texture-based Gaussians parameterize appearance with a uniform per-Gaussian sampling grid, allocating equal sampling density regardless of local visual complexity. This leads to inefficient texture space utilization, where high-frequency regions are under-sampled and smooth regions waste capacity, causing blurred appearance and loss of fine structural detail. We introduce FACT-GS, a Frequency-Aligned Complexity-aware Texture Gaussian Splatting framework that allocates texture sampling density according to local visual frequency. Grounded in adaptive sampling theory, FACT-GS reformulates texture parameterization as a differentiable sampling-density allocation problem, replacing the uniform textures with a learnable frequency-aware allocation strategy implemented via a deformation field whose Jacobian modulates local sampling density. Built on 2D Gaussian Splatting, FACT-GS performs non-uniform sampling on fixed-resolution texture grids, preserving real-time performance while recovering sharper high-frequency details under the same parameter budget.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Swaying: Surface-Based Framework for Aerodynamic Simulation with 3D Gaussians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Branches swaying in the breeze, flags rippling in the wind, and boats rocking on the water all show how aerodynamics shape natural motion -- an effect crucial for realism in vision and graphics. In this paper, we present Gaussian Swaying, a surface-based framework for aerodynamic simulation using 3D Gaussians. Unlike mesh-based methods that require costly meshing, or particle-based approaches that rely on discrete positional data, Gaussian Swaying models surfaces continuously with 3D Gaussians, enabling efficient and fine-grained aerodynamic interaction. Our framework unifies simulation and rendering on the same representation: Gaussian patches, which support force computation for dynamics while simultaneously providing normals for lightweight shading. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets across multiple metrics demonstrate that Gaussian Swaying achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency, offering a scalable approach for realistic aerodynamic scene simulation.</description>

      <title>NeuralRemaster: Phase-Preserving Diffusion for Structure-Aligned Generation</title>

Abstract: Standard diffusion corrupts data using Gaussian noise whose Fourier coefficients have random magnitudes and random phases. While effective for unconditional or text-to-image generation, corrupting phase components destroys spatial structure, making it ill-suited for tasks requiring geometric consistency, such as re-rendering, simulation enhancement, and image-to-image translation. We introduce Phase-Preserving Diffusion {\phi}-PD, a model-agnostic reformulation of the diffusion process that preserves input phase while randomizing magnitude, enabling structure-aligned generation without architectural changes or additional parameters. We further propose Frequency-Selective Structured (FSS) noise, which provides continuous control over structural rigidity via a single frequency-cutoff parameter. {\phi}-PD adds no inference-time cost and is compatible with any diffusion model for images or videos. Across photorealistic and stylized re-rendering, as well as sim-to-real enhancement for driving planners, {\phi}-PD produces controllable, spatially aligned results. When applied to the CARLA simulator, {\phi}-PD improves CARLA-to-Waymo planner performance by 50\%. The method is complementary to existing conditioning approaches and broadly applicable to image-to-image and video-to-video generation. Videos, additional examples, and code are available on our \href{https://yuzeng-at-tri.github.io/ppd-page/}{project page}.</description>
