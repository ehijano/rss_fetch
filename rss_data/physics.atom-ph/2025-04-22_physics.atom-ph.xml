      <title>Two- and three-body dispersion coefficients for interaction of Cu and Ag atoms with {Group} I, II, and XII elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mounting interest in conducting thorough analyses and studies of long-range interactions stems from their wide-ranging applications in cold atomic physics, making it a compelling area for research. In this work, we have evaluated long range van der Waals dispersion (vdW) interactions of Cu and Ag atoms with atoms of group I (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, and Fr), II (Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, and {Ba}), XII (Zn, Cd, and Hg) {as well as} singly charged ions of group II (Be$^+$, Mg$^+$, Ca$^+$, Sr$^+$, and {Ba$^+$}) and XII (Zn$^+$, Cd$^+$, and Hg$^+$) by calculating $C_6$(two-body) and $C_9$ (three-body) vdW dispersion coefficients. In order to obtain these $C_6$ and $C_9$ coefficients, we have evaluated the dynamic dipole polarizability of the considered atoms using appropriate relativistic methods and the sum-over-states approach. To ascertain the accuracy of our results, we have compared the evaluated static dipole polarizabilities of Cu and Ag atoms and their oscillator strengths for dominant transitions {with} available literature. The calculated values of $C_6$ dispersion coefficients have also been compared with the previously reported results.</description>

      <title>Investigating the $4D_{3/2}|3,\pm2\rangle$--$4D_{5/2}|3,\pm2\rangle$ transition in Nb$^{4+}$ for a THz atomic clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the $4D_{3/2}|3,\pm2\rangle \rightarrow 4D_{5/2}|3,\pm2\rangle$ transition in the Nb$^{4+}$ ion is identified as a promising candidate for a terahertz (THz) atomic clock, with the transition frequency occurring at 56.0224 THz. This transition is primarily driven by the magnetic dipole decay channel, which can easily be accessed by a laser. We focus on the stable $^{93}$Nb isotope, which has 100\% natural abundance and a nuclear spin of $I=9/2$ for experimental advantage. Our data analysis allows us to estimate potential systematic shifts in the proposed clock system, including those due to blackbody radiation, electric quadrupole, second-order Zeeman, and second-order Doppler {shifts}. {The scheme presented in this study can help suppress the AC Stark and electric quadrupole shifts in the clock frequency measurement.} {All these analyses} suggest that the proposed THz atomic clock using Nb$^{4+}$ could be valuable in both quantum thermometry and frequency metrology.</description>

      <title>Two-step laser resonant ionization spectroscopy of chromium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At TRIUMF's off-line laser ion source test stand, stepwise resonant laser ionization spectroscopy of chromium (Cr) was carried out, to find an efficient ionization scheme suitable for titanium sapphire (Ti:Sa) laser systems. With three different first-excitation transitions, 357.971 nm, 359.451 nm, and 360.636 nm, automated continuous laser-frequency scans using a frequency-doubled, grating-tuned Ti:Sa laser were performed. Rydberg series as well as autoionizing(AI) states were observed. From these results, the ionization potential (IP) of Cr was determined as 54575.49(2)$_\text{stat}$(2)$_\text{sys}$ cm$^{-1}$, which is one order of magnitude more precise than the previously reported 54575.6(3) cm$^{-1}$ in NIST database. The ionization scheme using the observed AI resonance, with 357.971 nm as the first step and 373.935 nm as the second step was subsequently deployed to the online delivery of radioactive Cr isotope beams for precision mass measurements. The online yields of $^{50-59}$Cr have been measured at TRIUMF-ISAC.</description>

      <title>Magnetic recoil interferometer in a uniform gravitational field. Comment on Observation of the quantum equivalence principle for matter-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The calculation of the phase shift of a matter-wave interferometer looks different for different coordinate choices or the addition of a uniform gravitational field, but the final result of the observable phase shift does not depend on the coordinate choices or the uniform gravitational field. We find that the phase shift observed in ``Observation of the quantum equivalence principle for matter-waves'' is a magnetic recoil phase shift, similar to the recoil phase shift in light-pulse interferometers. Recoil phase shifts are inversely proportional to the inertial mass and do not depend on the gravitational mass. Our analysis highlights the difference between magnetic and gravitational acceleration in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Bosonic quantum many-body simulation with waveguide photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical networks composed of interconnected waveguides are a versatile platform to simulate bosonic physical phenomena. Significant work in the non-interacting regime has demonstrated the capabilities of this platform to simulate many exotic effects such as photon transport in the presence of gauge fields, dynamics of quantum walks, and topological transition and dissipation phenomena. However, the extension of these concepts to simulating interacting quantum many-body phenomena such as the Bose-Hubbard and the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) physics has remained elusive. In this work, we address this problem and demonstrate a framework for quantum many-body simulation as well as drive and dissipation in photonic waveguides. Specifically, we show that for waveguide photons, a tunable on-site interaction can be simulated using a photon-number-selective phase gate. We propose an implementation of such a phase gate based on a three-level-atom-mediated photon subtraction and addition. We apply this approach to bosonic lattice models and propose circuits that can accurately simulate the Bose-Hubbard and FQH Hamiltonian as benchmarking examples. Moreover, we show how to simulate the Lindbladian evolution with engineered dissipators such that the steady state of the Lindbadlian corresponds to the ground state of desired Hamiltonians. Our scheme extends the waveguide photonic simulation platform to the strongly interacting quantum many-body regime while retaining all of its crucial advantages, such as single-site addressability, Hamiltonian parameter controllability, and hardware efficiency.</description>

      <title>Attractive and repulsive angulons in superfluid environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the in- and out-of-equilibrium phenomena of a rotational impurity -- specifically, a linear molecule -- coupled to a nonconventional environment, a helium nanodroplet. By employing a Lee-Low-Pines-like transformation combined with a multireference configuration approach, we self-consistently account for the molecule's backaction on the superfluid bath and accurately capture the complex entanglement between the molecule's rotational degrees of freedom and the bath excitations. Our findings reveal that, in the ground state, the impurity induces a density defect in the superfluid bath, giving rise to two novel types of excited states: (a) attractive angulon states, analogous to bound states in photonic crystals and Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states in superconductors, localized within the density defect region; and (b) long-lived repulsive angulon states in dilute environments. Rotational spectroscopy demonstrates a crossover from repulsive to attractive angulon states as the bath density increases. This work paves the way for exploring novel nonequilibrium phenomena of quantum impurities in interacting environments.</description>

      <title>Search for Axionlike Dark Matter Using Liquid-State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for dark matter in the form of axionlike particles (ALPs) in the mass range $5.576741 \,\mathrm{neV/c^2}$ - $5.577733\,\mathrm{neV/c^2}$ by probing their possible coupling to fermion spins through the ALP field gradient. This is achieved by performing proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy on a sample of methanol as a technical demonstration of the Cosmic Axion Spin Precession Experiment Gradient (CASPEr-Gradient) Low-Field apparatus. Searching for spin-coupled ALP dark matter in this mass range with associated Compton frequencies in a 240 Hz window centered at 1.348570 MHz resulted in a sensitivity to the ALP-proton coupling constant of $g_{\mathrm{ap}} \approx 3 \times 10^{-2}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$. This narrow-bandwidth search serves as a proof-of-principle and a commissioning measurement, validating our methodology and demonstrating the experiment's capabilities. It opens the door to probing large swaths of hitherto unexplored mass-coupling parameter space in the future by using hyperpolarized samples.</description>

      <title>A Radio-Frequency Emitter Design for the Low-Frequency Regime in Atomic Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) control is a key technique in cold atom experiments. We present a compact and efficient RF circuit based on a capacitive transformer, where a low-frequency coil operating up to 30 MHz serves as both inductor and power-sharing element. The design enables high current and flexible matching bandwidth, and integrates broadband and narrowband RF manipulation within a unified configuration, overcoming the distance constraints imposed by metallic chambers. In evaporative cooling, the broadband circuit reduces RF input power from 14.7 dBW to -3.5 dBW due to its low-pass behavior, effectively cooling the Bose-Fermi mixture to below 10{\mu}K. In a Landau-Zener protocol, the narrowband circuit transfers 80% of rubidium atoms from |F=2, mF=2&gt; to |2, -2&gt; in 1 millisecond, yielding a Rabi frequency of about 7.6 kHz under an input power of 0.1 dBW. The concise design ensures robust impedance matching and stable performance across a wide frequency range, with behavior closely consistent with lumped-element simulations.</description>

      <title>Coherent control of photonic spin Hall effect in cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the manipulation of the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) using a four-level closed coherent control coupling scheme in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). The atomic system is configured to function as a combined Tripod and Lambda (CTL), Lambda $\Lambda$, and $N$ level model by properly adjusting the control field strengths and their relative phases. The system demonstrates multiple transparency windows in the CTL configuration, allowing the tunable PSHE to be used over a wider range of probe field detuning. At probe field resonance, the $\Lambda$-type system exhibits PSHE similar to the CTL system, showing enhanced PSHE due to zero absorption and dispersion. Control field strengths and atomic density do not influence PSHE at resonance for both atomic configurations. Our findings reveal that atomic density and strength of control fields significantly influence PSHE in the $N$-type model at resonance, offering additional control parameters for tuning PSHE. The results are equally valid and applicable to direct $\Lambda$-type and N-type atomic systems, making the findings broadly relevant in cavity QED. The demonstrated tunability via probe field detuning, control fields, and atomic density paves the way for advanced optical control and enhanced precision in cavity QED devices.</description>

      <title>An entanglement protocol to measure atomic parity violation at sub 0.1% precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a scheme to measure atomic parity violation (APV) in barium ions at &lt;0.1% precision. The scheme is based on using multi-ion entangled states to common-mode reject parity-conserving systematic shifts and selectively detect a parity-violating vector light shift. This measurement protocol eliminates the need to suppress a leading systematic by 11 orders of magnitude, as is required in the single-ion measurement scheme [N. Fortson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 2383 (1993)]. Furthermore, the protocol can be combined with the use of integrated photonic waveguides in an architecture that is scalable to large ion numbers, with a proportional increase in measurement precision.</description>

      <title>Collective Superradiance: Estimating the Peak Emission Rate and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator, a process with computational costs scaling exponentially with $N$. We present compact, analytic formulas for evaluating the peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, valid for any geometric configuration and emitter type. These formulas rely solely on the variance of the eigenvalues of a real symmetric $N \times N$ matrix, which describes collective dissipation. We demonstrate the versatility of these results across various environments, including free space, solid-state, and waveguide reservoirs. For large $N$ the formulas simplify further to depend on just two parameters: average nearest-neighbor spacing and emitter number. Finally, we present scaling laws and bounds on the spatial size of emitter ensembles, such that superradiance is maintained, independent of emitter number or density.</description>
