      <title>CMATH: Cross-Modality Augmented Transformer with Hierarchical Variational Distillation for Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (MER) aims to accurately identify emotions in conversational utterances by integrating multimodal information. Previous methods usually treat multimodal information as equal quality and employ symmetric architectures to conduct multimodal fusion. However, in reality, the quality of different modalities usually varies considerably, and utilizing a symmetric architecture is difficult to accurately recognize conversational emotions when dealing with uneven modal information. Furthermore, fusing multi-modality information in a single granularity may fail to adequately integrate modal information, exacerbating the inaccuracy in emotion recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Modality Augmented Transformer with Hierarchical Variational Distillation, called CMATH, which consists of two major components, i.e., Multimodal Interaction Fusion and Hierarchical Variational Distillation. The former is comprised of two submodules, including Modality Reconstruction and Cross-Modality Augmented Transformer (CMA-Transformer), where Modality Reconstruction focuses on obtaining high-quality compressed representation of each modality, and CMA-Transformer adopts an asymmetric fusion strategy which treats one modality as the central modality and takes others as auxiliary modalities. The latter first designs a variational fusion network to fuse the fine-grained representations learned by CMA- Transformer into a coarse-grained representations. Then, it introduces a hierarchical distillation framework to maintain the consistency between modality representations with different granularities. Experiments on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines.

      <title>GGAvatar: Reconstructing Garment-Separated 3D Gaussian Splatting Avatars from Monocular Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Avatar modelling has broad applications in human animation and virtual try-ons. Recent advancements in this field have focused on high-quality and comprehensive human reconstruction but often overlook the separation of clothing from the body. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces GGAvatar (Garment-separated 3D Gaussian Splatting Avatar), which relies on monocular videos. Through advanced parameterized templates and unique phased training, this model effectively achieves decoupled, editable, and realistic reconstruction of clothed humans. Comparative evaluations with other costly models confirm GGAvatar's superior quality and efficiency in modelling both clothed humans and separable garments. The paper also showcases applications in clothing editing, as illustrated in Figure 1, highlighting the model's benefits and the advantages of effective disentanglement. The code is available at https://github.com/J-X-Chen/GGAvatar/.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal learning has transformed digital content creation and manipulation. Traditional visual editing tools require significant expertise, limiting accessibility. Recent strides in instruction-based editing have enabled intuitive interaction with visual content, using natural language as a bridge between user intent and complex editing operations. This survey provides an overview of these techniques, focusing on how LLMs and multimodal models empower users to achieve precise visual modifications without deep technical knowledge. By synthesizing over 100 publications, we explore methods from generative adversarial networks to diffusion models, examining multimodal integration for fine-grained content control. We discuss practical applications across domains such as fashion, 3D scene manipulation, and video synthesis, highlighting increased accessibility and alignment with human intuition. Our survey compares existing literature, emphasizing LLM-empowered editing, and identifies key challenges to stimulate further research. We aim to democratize powerful visual editing across various industries, from entertainment to education.

      <title>EveGuard: Defeating Vibration-based Side-Channel Eavesdropping with Audio Adversarial Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vibrometry-based side channels pose a significant privacy risk, exploiting sensors like mmWave radars, light sensors, and accelerometers to detect vibrations from sound sources or proximate objects, enabling speech eavesdropping. Despite various proposed defenses, these involve costly hardware solutions with inherent physical limitations. This paper presents EveGuard, a software-driven defense framework that creates adversarial audio, protecting voice privacy from side channels without compromising human perception. We leverage the distinct sensing capabilities of side channels and traditional microphones where side channels capture vibrations and microphones record changes in air pressure, resulting in different frequency responses. EveGuard first proposes a perturbation generator model (PGM) that effectively suppresses sensor-based eavesdropping while maintaining high audio quality. Second, to enable end-to-end training of PGM, we introduce a new domain translation task called Eve-GAN for inferring an eavesdropped signal from a given audio. We further apply few-shot learning to mitigate the data collection overhead for Eve-GAN training. Our extensive experiments show that EveGuard achieves a protection rate of more than 97 percent from audio classifiers and significantly hinders eavesdropped audio reconstruction. We further validate the performance of EveGuard across three adaptive attack mechanisms. We have conducted a user study to verify the perceptual quality of our perturbed audio.</description>

      <title>A Low-Resolution Image is Worth 1x1 Words: Enabling Fine Image Super-Resolution with Transformers and TaylorShift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based Super-Resolution (SR) models have recently advanced image reconstruction quality, yet challenges remain due to computational complexity and an over-reliance on large patch sizes, which constrain fine-grained detail enhancement. In this work, we propose TaylorIR to address these limitations by utilizing a patch size of 1x1, enabling pixel-level processing in any transformer-based SR model. To address the significant computational demands under the traditional self-attention mechanism, we employ the TaylorShift attention mechanism, a memory-efficient alternative based on Taylor series expansion, achieving full token-to-token interactions with linear complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art SR performance while reducing memory consumption by up to 60% compared to traditional self-attention-based transformers.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Model via Hallucination-targeted Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are known to hallucinate, which limits their practical applications. Recent works have attempted to apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enhance the performance of MLLMs, but have shown inconsistent improvements in mitigating hallucinations. To address this issue more effectively, we introduce Hallucination-targeted Direct Preference Optimization (HDPO) to reduce hallucinations in MLLMs. Unlike previous approaches, our method tackles hallucinations from their diverse forms and causes. Specifically, we develop three types of preference pair data targeting the following causes of MLLM hallucinations: (1) insufficient visual capabilities, (2) long context generation, and (3) multimodal conflicts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple hallucination evaluation datasets, surpassing most state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and highlighting the potential of our approach. Ablation studies and in-depth analyses further confirm the effectiveness of our method and suggest the potential for further improvements through scaling up.</description>

      <title>SaMoye: Zero-shot Singing Voice Conversion Model Based on Feature Disentanglement and Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07728v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singing voice conversion (SVC) aims to convert a singer's voice to another singer's from a reference audio while keeping the original semantics. However, existing SVC methods can hardly perform zero-shot due to incomplete feature disentanglement or dependence on the speaker look-up table. We propose the first open-source high-quality zero-shot SVC model SaMoye that can convert singing to human and non-human timbre. SaMoye disentangles the singing voice's features into content, timbre, and pitch features, where we combine multiple ASR models and compress the content features to reduce timbre leaks. Besides, we enhance the timbre features by unfreezing the speaker encoder and mixing the speaker embedding with top-3 similar speakers. We also establish an unparalleled large-scale dataset to guarantee zero-shot performance, which comprises more than 1,815 hours of pure singing voice and 6,367 speakers. We conduct objective and subjective experiments to find that SaMoye outperforms other models in zero-shot SVC tasks even under extreme conditions like converting singing to animals' timbre. The code and weight of SaMoye are available on https://github.com/CarlWangChina/SaMoye-SVC. The weights, code, dataset, and documents of SaMoye are publicly available on \url{https://github.com/CarlWangChina/SaMoye-SVC}.</description>

      <title>A Simple but Strong Baseline for Sounding Video Generation: Effective Adaptation of Audio and Video Diffusion Models for Joint Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we build a simple but strong baseline for sounding video generation. Given base diffusion models for audio and video, we integrate them with additional modules into a single model and train it to make the model jointly generate audio and video. To enhance alignment between audio-video pairs, we introduce two novel mechanisms in our model. The first one is timestep adjustment, which provides different timestep information to each base model. It is designed to align how samples are generated along with timesteps across modalities. The second one is a new design of the additional modules, termed Cross-Modal Conditioning as Positional Encoding (CMC-PE). In CMC-PE, cross-modal information is embedded as if it represents temporal position information, and the embeddings are fed into the model like positional encoding. Compared with the popular cross-attention mechanism, CMC-PE provides a better inductive bias for temporal alignment in the generated data. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the two newly introduced mechanisms and also demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.</description>
