      <title>Prototype-Guided Diffusion for Digital Pathology: Achieving Foundation Model Performance with Minimal Clinical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models in digital pathology use massive datasets to learn useful compact feature representations of complex histology images. However, there is limited transparency into what drives the correlation between dataset size and performance, raising the question of whether simply adding more data to increase performance is always necessary. In this study, we propose a prototype-guided diffusion model to generate high-fidelity synthetic pathology data at scale, enabling large-scale self-supervised learning and reducing reliance on real patient samples while preserving downstream performance. Using guidance from histological prototypes during sampling, our approach ensures biologically and diagnostically meaningful variations in the generated data. We demonstrate that self-supervised features trained on our synthetic dataset achieve competitive performance despite using ~60x-760x less data than models trained on large real-world datasets. Notably, models trained using our synthetic data showed statistically comparable or better performance across multiple evaluation metrics and tasks, even when compared to models trained on orders of magnitude larger datasets. Our hybrid approach, combining synthetic and real data, further enhanced performance, achieving top results in several evaluations. These findings underscore the potential of generative AI to create compelling training data for digital pathology, significantly reducing the reliance on extensive clinical datasets and highlighting the efficiency of our approach.</description>

      <title>One Model to Rig Them All: Diverse Skeleton Rigging with UniRig</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of 3D content creation, encompassing both AI-powered methods and traditional workflows, is driving an unprecedented demand for automated rigging solutions that can keep pace with the increasing complexity and diversity of 3D models. We introduce UniRig, a novel, unified framework for automatic skeletal rigging that leverages the power of large autoregressive models and a bone-point cross-attention mechanism to generate both high-quality skeletons and skinning weights. Unlike previous methods that struggle with complex or non-standard topologies, UniRig accurately predicts topologically valid skeleton structures thanks to a new Skeleton Tree Tokenization method that efficiently encodes hierarchical relationships within the skeleton. To train and evaluate UniRig, we present Rig-XL, a new large-scale dataset of over 14,000 rigged 3D models spanning a wide range of categories. UniRig significantly outperforms state-of-the-art academic and commercial methods, achieving a 215% improvement in rigging accuracy and a 194% improvement in motion accuracy on challenging datasets. Our method works seamlessly across diverse object categories, from detailed anime characters to complex organic and inorganic structures, demonstrating its versatility and robustness. By automating the tedious and time-consuming rigging process, UniRig has the potential to speed up animation pipelines with unprecedented ease and efficiency.

      <title>UniPhys: Unified Planner and Controller with Diffusion for Flexible Physics-Based Character Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating natural and physically plausible character motion remains challenging, particularly for long-horizon control with diverse guidance signals. While prior work combines high-level diffusion-based motion planners with low-level physics controllers, these systems suffer from domain gaps that degrade motion quality and require task-specific fine-tuning. To tackle this problem, we introduce UniPhys, a diffusion-based behavior cloning framework that unifies motion planning and control into a single model. UniPhys enables flexible, expressive character motion conditioned on multi-modal inputs such as text, trajectories, and goals. To address accumulated prediction errors over long sequences, UniPhys is trained with the Diffusion Forcing paradigm, learning to denoise noisy motion histories and handle discrepancies introduced by the physics simulator. This design allows UniPhys to robustly generate physically plausible, long-horizon motions. Through guided sampling, UniPhys generalizes to a wide range of control signals, including unseen ones, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Experiments show that UniPhys outperforms prior methods in motion naturalness, generalization, and robustness across diverse control tasks.</description>

      <title>SOPHY: Generating Simulation-Ready Objects with Physical Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SOPHY, a generative model for 3D physics-aware shape synthesis. Unlike existing 3D generative models that focus solely on static geometry or 4D models that produce physics-agnostic animations, our approach jointly synthesizes shape, texture, and material properties related to physics-grounded dynamics, making the generated objects ready for simulations and interactive, dynamic environments. To train our model, we introduce a dataset of 3D objects annotated with detailed physical material attributes, along with an annotation pipeline for efficient material annotation. Our method enables applications such as text-driven generation of interactive, physics-aware 3D objects and single-image reconstruction of physically plausible shapes. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that jointly modeling shape and material properties enhances the realism and fidelity of generated shapes, improving performance on generative geometry evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>StorySets: Ordering Curves and Dimensions for Visualizing Uncertain Sets and Multi-Dimensional Discrete Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for visualizing uncertain set systems, which differs from previous set visualization approaches that are based on certainty (an element either belongs to a set or not). Our method is inspired by storyline visualizations and parallel coordinate plots: (a) each element is represented by a vertical glyph, subdivided into bins that represent different levels of uncertainty; (b) each set is represented by an x-monotone curve that traverses element glyphs through the bins representing the level of uncertainty of their membership. Our implementation also includes optimizations to reduce visual complexity captured by the number of turns for the set curves and the number of crossings. Although several of the natural underlying optimization problems are NP-hard in theory (e.g., optimal element order, optimal set order), in practice, we can compute near-optimal solutions with respect to curve crossings with the help of a new exact algorithm for optimally ordering set curves within each element's bins. With these optimizations, the proposed method makes it easy to see set containment (the smaller set's curve is strictly below the larger set's curve). A brief design-space exploration using uncertain set-membership data, as well as multi-dimensional discrete data, shows the flexibility of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>ARAP-GS: Drag-driven As-Rigid-As-Possible 3D Gaussian Splatting Editing with Diffusion Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drag-driven editing has become popular among designers for its ability to modify complex geometric structures through simple and intuitive manipulation, allowing users to adjust and reshape content with minimal technical skill. This drag operation has been incorporated into numerous methods to facilitate the editing of 2D images and 3D meshes in design. However, few studies have explored drag-driven editing for the widely-used 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, as deforming 3DGS while preserving shape coherence and visual continuity remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce ARAP-GS, a drag-driven 3DGS editing framework based on As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP) deformation. Unlike previous 3DGS editing methods, we are the first to apply ARAP deformation directly to 3D Gaussians, enabling flexible, drag-driven geometric transformations. To preserve scene appearance after deformation, we incorporate an advanced diffusion prior for image super-resolution within our iterative optimization process. This approach enhances visual quality while maintaining multi-view consistency in the edited results. Experiments show that ARAP-GS outperforms current methods across diverse 3D scenes, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority for drag-driven 3DGS editing. Additionally, our method is highly efficient, requiring only 10 to 20 minutes to edit a scene on a single RTX 3090 GPU.</description>

      <title>CAGE-GS: High-fidelity Cage Based 3D Gaussian Splatting Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) gains popularity as a 3D representation of real scenes, enabling user-friendly deformation to create novel scenes while preserving fine details from the original 3DGS has attracted significant research attention. We introduce CAGE-GS, a cage-based 3DGS deformation method that seamlessly aligns a source 3DGS scene with a user-defined target shape. Our approach learns a deformation cage from the target, which guides the geometric transformation of the source scene. While the cages effectively control structural alignment, preserving the textural appearance of 3DGS remains challenging due to the complexity of covariance parameters. To address this, we employ a Jacobian matrix-based strategy to update the covariance parameters of each Gaussian, ensuring texture fidelity post-deformation. Our method is highly flexible, accommodating various target shape representations, including texts, images, point clouds, meshes and 3DGS models. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on both public datasets and newly proposed scenes demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing techniques in both efficiency and deformation quality.</description>

      <title>AAA-Gaussians: Anti-Aliased and Artifact-Free 3D Gaussian Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D reconstruction, it still faces challenges such as aliasing, projection artifacts, and view inconsistencies, primarily due to the simplification of treating splats as 2D entities. We argue that incorporating full 3D evaluation of Gaussians throughout the 3DGS pipeline can effectively address these issues while preserving rasterization efficiency. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive 3D smoothing filter to mitigate aliasing and present a stable view-space bounding method that eliminates popping artifacts when Gaussians extend beyond the view frustum. Furthermore, we promote tile-based culling to 3D with screen-space planes, accelerating rendering and reducing sorting costs for hierarchical rasterization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art quality on in-distribution evaluation sets and significantly outperforms other approaches for out-of-distribution views. Our qualitative evaluations further demonstrate the effective removal of aliasing, distortions, and popping artifacts, ensuring real-time, artifact-free rendering.</description>

      <title>3D-PNAS: 3D Industrial Surface Anomaly Synthesis with Perlin Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large pretrained vision foundation models have shown significant potential in various vision tasks. However, for industrial anomaly detection, the scarcity of real defect samples poses a critical challenge in leveraging these models. While 2D anomaly generation has significantly advanced with established generative models, the adoption of 3D sensors in industrial manufacturing has made leveraging 3D data for surface quality inspection an emerging trend. In contrast to 2D techniques, 3D anomaly generation remains largely unexplored, limiting the potential of 3D data in industrial quality inspection. To address this gap, we propose a novel yet simple 3D anomaly generation method, 3D-PNAS, based on Perlin noise and surface parameterization. Our method generates realistic 3D surface anomalies by projecting the point cloud onto a 2D plane, sampling multi-scale noise values from a Perlin noise field, and perturbing the point cloud along its normal direction. Through comprehensive visualization experiments, we demonstrate how key parameters - including noise scale, perturbation strength, and octaves, provide fine-grained control over the generated anomalies, enabling the creation of diverse defect patterns from pronounced deformations to subtle surface variations. Additionally, our cross-category experiments show that the method produces consistent yet geometrically plausible anomalies across different object types, adapting to their specific surface characteristics. We also provide a comprehensive codebase and visualization toolkit to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Real-time High-fidelity Gaussian Human Avatars with Position-based Interpolation of Spatially Distributed MLPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many works have succeeded in reconstructing Gaussian human avatars from multi-view videos. However, they either struggle to capture pose-dependent appearance details with a single MLP, or rely on a computationally intensive neural network to reconstruct high-fidelity appearance but with rendering performance degraded to non-real-time. We propose a novel Gaussian human avatar representation that can reconstruct high-fidelity pose-dependence appearance with details and meanwhile can be rendered in real time. Our Gaussian avatar is empowered by spatially distributed MLPs which are explicitly located on different positions on human body. The parameters stored in each Gaussian are obtained by interpolating from the outputs of its nearby MLPs based on their distances. To avoid undesired smooth Gaussian property changing during interpolation, for each Gaussian we define a set of Gaussian offset basis, and a linear combination of basis represents the Gaussian property offsets relative to the neutral properties. Then we propose to let the MLPs output a set of coefficients corresponding to the basis. In this way, although Gaussian coefficients are derived from interpolation and change smoothly, the Gaussian offset basis is learned freely without constraints. The smoothly varying coefficients combined with freely learned basis can still produce distinctly different Gaussian property offsets, allowing the ability to learn high-frequency spatial signals. We further use control points to constrain the Gaussians distributed on a surface layer rather than allowing them to be irregularly distributed inside the body, to help the human avatar generalize better when animated under novel poses. Compared to the state-of-the-art method, our method achieves better appearance quality with finer details while the rendering speed is significantly faster under novel views and novel poses.</description>

      <title>GSAC: Leveraging Gaussian Splatting for Photorealistic Avatar Creation with Unity Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photorealistic avatars have become essential for immersive applications in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), enabling lifelike interactions in areas such as training simulations, telemedicine, and virtual collaboration. These avatars bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds, improving the user experience through realistic human representation. However, existing avatar creation techniques face significant challenges, including high costs, long creation times, and limited utility in virtual applications. Manual methods, such as MetaHuman, require extensive time and expertise, while automatic approaches, such as NeRF-based pipelines often lack efficiency, detailed facial expression fidelity, and are unable to be rendered at a speed sufficent for real-time applications. By involving several cutting-edge modern techniques, we introduce an end-to-end 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) avatar creation pipeline that leverages monocular video input to create a scalable and efficient photorealistic avatar directly compatible with the Unity game engine. Our pipeline incorporates a novel Gaussian splatting technique with customized preprocessing that enables the user of "in the wild" monocular video capture, detailed facial expression reconstruction and embedding within a fully rigged avatar model. Additionally, we present a Unity-integrated Gaussian Splatting Avatar Editor, offering a user-friendly environment for VR/AR application development. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our preprocessing pipeline in standardizing custom data for 3DGS training and demonstrate the versatility of Gaussian avatars in Unity, highlighting the scalability and practicality of our approach.</description>

      <title>CompGS++: Compressed Gaussian Splatting for Static and Dynamic Scene Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian splatting demonstrates proficiency for 3D scene modeling but suffers from substantial data volume due to inherent primitive redundancy. To enable future photorealistic 3D immersive visual communication applications, significant compression is essential for transmission over the existing Internet infrastructure. Hence, we propose Compressed Gaussian Splatting (CompGS++), a novel framework that leverages compact Gaussian primitives to achieve accurate 3D modeling with substantial size reduction for both static and dynamic scenes. Our design is based on the principle of eliminating redundancy both between and within primitives. Specifically, we develop a comprehensive prediction paradigm to address inter-primitive redundancy through spatial and temporal primitive prediction modules. The spatial primitive prediction module establishes predictive relationships for scene primitives and enables most primitives to be encoded as compact residuals, substantially reducing the spatial redundancy. We further devise a temporal primitive prediction module to handle dynamic scenes, which exploits primitive correlations across timestamps to effectively reduce temporal redundancy. Moreover, we devise a rate-constrained optimization module that jointly minimizes reconstruction error and rate consumption. This module effectively eliminates parameter redundancy within primitives and enhances the overall compactness of scene representations. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CompGS++ significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior compression performance while preserving accurate scene modeling. Our implementation will be made publicly available on GitHub to facilitate further research.</description>

      <title>HiScene: Creating Hierarchical 3D Scenes with Isometric View Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scene-level 3D generation represents a critical frontier in multimedia and computer graphics, yet existing approaches either suffer from limited object categories or lack editing flexibility for interactive applications. In this paper, we present HiScene, a novel hierarchical framework that bridges the gap between 2D image generation and 3D object generation and delivers high-fidelity scenes with compositional identities and aesthetic scene content. Our key insight is treating scenes as hierarchical "objects" under isometric views, where a room functions as a complex object that can be further decomposed into manipulatable items. This hierarchical approach enables us to generate 3D content that aligns with 2D representations while maintaining compositional structure. To ensure completeness and spatial alignment of each decomposed instance, we develop a video-diffusion-based amodal completion technique that effectively handles occlusions and shadows between objects, and introduce shape prior injection to ensure spatial coherence within the scene. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces more natural object arrangements and complete object instances suitable for interactive applications, while maintaining physical plausibility and alignment with user inputs.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation techniques have significantly improved zero-shot talking-head avatar generation, enhancing the naturalness of both head motion and facial expressions. However, existing methods suffer from poor controllability, making them less applicable to real-world scenarios such as filmmaking and live streaming for e-commerce. To address this limitation, we propose FLAP, a novel approach that integrates explicit 3D intermediate parameters (head poses and facial expressions) into the diffusion model for end-to-end generation of realistic portrait videos. The proposed architecture allows the model to generate vivid portrait videos from audio while simultaneously incorporating additional control signals, such as head rotation angles and eye-blinking frequency. Furthermore, the decoupling of head pose and facial expression allows for independent control of each, offering precise manipulation of both the avatar's pose and facial expressions. We also demonstrate its flexibility in integrating with existing 3D head generation methods, bridging the gap between 3D model-based approaches and end-to-end diffusion techniques. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms recent audio-driven portrait video models in both naturalness and controllability.</description>

      <title>StrokeFusion: Vector Sketch Generation via Joint Stroke-UDF Encoding and Latent Sequence Diffusion</title>

Abstract: In the field of sketch generation, raster-format trained models often produce non-stroke artifacts, while vector-format trained models typically lack a holistic understanding of sketches, leading to compromised recognizability. Moreover, existing methods struggle to extract common features from similar elements (e.g., eyes of animals) appearing at varying positions across sketches. To address these challenges, we propose StrokeFusion, a two-stage framework for vector sketch generation. It contains a dual-modal sketch feature learning network that maps strokes into a high-quality latent space. This network decomposes sketches into normalized strokes and jointly encodes stroke sequences with Unsigned Distance Function (UDF) maps, representing sketches as sets of stroke feature vectors. Building upon this representation, our framework exploits a stroke-level latent diffusion model that simultaneously adjusts stroke position, scale, and trajectory during generation. This enables high-fidelity sketch generation while supporting stroke interpolation editing. Extensive experiments on the QuickDraw dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, validating its effectiveness in preserving structural integrity and semantic features. Code and models will be made publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Few-Shot Image Fusion: Granular Ball Priors Enable General-Purpose Deep Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08937</link>

Abstract: In image fusion tasks, the absence of real fused images as priors presents a fundamental challenge. Most deep learning-based fusion methods rely on large-scale paired datasets to extract global weighting features from raw images, thereby generating fused outputs that approximate real fused images. In contrast to previous studies, this paper explores few-shot training of neural networks under the condition of having prior knowledge. We propose a novel fusion framework named GBFF, and a Granular Ball Significant Extraction algorithm specifically designed for the few-shot prior setting. All pixel pairs involved in the fusion process are initially modeled as a Coarse-Grained Granular Ball. At the local level, Fine-Grained Granular Balls are used to slide through the brightness space to extract Non-Salient Pixel Pairs, and perform splitting operations to obtain Salient Pixel Pairs. Pixel-wise weights are then computed to generate a pseudo-supervised image. At the global level, pixel pairs with significant contributions to the fusion process are categorized into the Positive Region, while those whose contributions cannot be accurately determined are assigned to the Boundary Region. The Granular Ball performs modality-aware adaptation based on the proportion of the positive region, thereby adjusting the neural network's loss function and enabling it to complement the information of the boundary region. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed algorithm and the underlying theory. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our approach shows strong competitiveness in terms of both fusion time and image expressiveness. Our code is publicly available at:</description>
