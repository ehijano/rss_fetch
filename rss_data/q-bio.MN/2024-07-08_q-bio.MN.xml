      <title>Hypergraph Animals</title>

Abstract: Here we introduce simple structures for the analysis of complex hypergraphs, hypergraph animals. These structures are designed to describe the local node neighbourhoods of nodes in hypergraphs. We establish their relationships to lattice animals and network motifs, and we develop their combinatorial properties for sparse and uncorrelated hypergraphs. We make use of the tight link of hypergraph animals to partition numbers, which opens up a vast mathematical framework for the analysis of hypergraph animals. We then study their abundances in random hypergraphs. Two transferable insights result from this analysis: (i) it establishes the importance of high-cardinality edges in ensembles of random hypergraphs that are inspired by the classical Erd\"os-Reny\'i random graphs; and (ii) there is a close connection between degree and hyperedge cardinality in random hypergraphs that shapes animal abundances and spectra profoundly. Both findings imply that hypergraph animals can have the potential to affect information flow and processing in complex systems. Our analysis of also suggests that we need to spend more effort on investigating and developing suitable conditional ensembles of random hypergraphs that can capture real-world structures and their complex dependency structures.</description>

      <title>PhosNetVis: a web-based tool for fast kinase-substrate enrichment analysis and interactive 2D/3D network visualizations of phosphoproteomics data</title>

Abstract: Protein phosphorylation involves the reversible modification of a protein (substrate) residue by another protein (kinase). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry studies are rapidly generating massive protein phosphorylation datasets across multiple conditions. Researchers then must infer kinases responsible for changes in phosphosites of each substrate. However, tools that infer kinase-substrate interactions (KSIs) are not optimized to interactively explore the resulting large and complex networks, significant phosphosites, and states. There is thus an unmet need for a tool that facilitates user-friendly analysis, interactive exploration, visualization, and communication of phosphoproteomics datasets. We present PhosNetVis, a web-based tool for researchers of all computational skill levels to easily infer, generate and interactively explore KSI networks in 2D or 3D by streamlining phosphoproteomics data analysis steps within a single tool. PhostNetVis lowers barriers for researchers in rapidly generating high-quality visualizations to gain biological insights from their phosphoproteomics datasets.
