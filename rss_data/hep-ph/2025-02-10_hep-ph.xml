      <title>Establishing the vector-meson-exchange dominance for the short range interactions of light quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I give a brief comment on a recent study revealing the vector meson exchange (VME) dominant for the short range interactions between u/d quarks in the $NN$, $D_{03}$, and $D_{30}$ systems. The finding echoes nicely with an earlier study of hadron spectroscopy using a quark model with hidden local symmetry which also favors the VME dominant for the short range interactions of light quarks. The VME dominance for the short range interactions of light quarks gives a natural explanation of the empiric VME dominance for the interactions between hadrons containing light quarks.</description>

      <title>Searching for coupled, hyperlight scalars across cosmic history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological scalar fields coupled to the Standard Model drive temporal variations in the fundamental constants that grow with redshift, positioning the early Universe as a powerful tool to study such models. We investigate the dynamics and phenomenology of coupled scalars from the early Universe to the present to consistently leverage the myriad searches for time-varying constants and the cosmological signatures of scalars' gravitational effects. We compute the in-medium contribution from Standard Model particles to the scalar's dynamics and identify only a limited range of couplings for which the scalar has an observable impact on the fundamental constants without either evolving before recombination or gravitating nonnegligibly. We then extend existing laboratory and astrophysical bounds to the hyperlight scalar regime. We present joint limits from the early and late Universe, specializing to hyperlight, quadratically coupled scalars that modulate the mass of the electron or the strength of electromagnetism and make up a subcomponent of the dark matter today. Our dedicated analysis of observations of the cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations, and type Ia supernovae provides the most stringent constraints on quadratically coupled scalars with masses from $10^{-28.5}$ to $\sim 10^{-31}~\mathrm{eV}$, below which quasar absorption spectra yield stronger bounds. These results jointly limit hyperlight scalars that comprise a few percent of the current dark matter density to near- or subgravitational couplings to electrons or photons.</description>

      <title>Higgs-Induced Gravitational Waves: the Interplay of Non-Minimal Couplings, Kination and Top Quark Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a minimal scenario where the sole Standard-Model Higgs is responsible for reheating the Universe after inflation, produces a significant background of gravitational waves and maintains the full classical stability of the electroweak vacuum. As the Higgs self-coupling runs toward negative values at high energy scales, a non-minimal interaction with curvature during a stiff background expansion era drives the Higgs fluctuations closer to the instability scale. This curvature-induced tachyonic instability leads to an intense production of Higgs particles, accompanied by a stochastic gravitational-wave background. The characteristic features of such signal can be directly correlated to the inflationary scale, the non-minimal coupling parameter and the top quark Yukawa coupling. We distinguish between three possible scenarios: absolute stability with low top quark masses, potential vacuum instability, and absolute stability with new physics above the instability scale. Our findings suggest that the detection of a peaked background of gravitational waves together with its inflationary tail has the potential to unveil the features of the Higgs effective potential at very high energy scales while providing a minimal explanation for the reheating phase and the emergence of the Standard-Model plasma in the early Universe. Unlike other studies in the literature, the generation of gravitational waves in our scenario does not depend on the quantum instability of the Standard Model vacuum.</description>

      <title>Momentum and Matter Matter for Axion Dark Matter Matters on Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of matter effects to searches for axion Dark Matter on Earth. The finite momentum of axion Dark Matter is crucial to elucidating the effects of Earth on both the axion Dark Matter field value and its gradient. We find that experiments targeting axion couplings compatible with canonical solutions of the strong CP puzzle are likely not affected by Earth's matter effects. However, experiments sensitive to lighter axions with stronger couplings can be significantly affected, with a significant part of the parameter space suffering from a reduced axion field value, and therefore decreased experimental sensitivity. In contrast, the spatial gradient of the axion field can be enhanced along Earth's radial direction, with important implications for ongoing and planned experiments searching for axion Dark Matter.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Axion-wind near Earth's Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several detection strategies for wave-like dark matter make use of gradients in the dark matter field, e.g. searches for spin-dependent derivative interactions in CASPEr-wind or experiments looking for oscillating forces. These gradients are usually suppressed by the local dark matter velocity $\sim 10^{-3}$. In this note we investigate how these gradients are modified in the presence of additional quadratic interactions of the dark matter field with ordinary matter. In this case the dark matter density and field are modified in the vicinity of Earth, affecting the detection sensitivity due to the change in the local field value at the Earth's surface but also due to the gradient of the field profile itself. We also use this opportunity to present results on the expected field profiles in presence of a non-vanishing relative velocity of the dark matter with respect to Earth. We also comment how this ameliorates the divergences that appear for certain attractive coupling values.</description>

      <title>Precise determination of the properties of $X(3872)$ and of its isovector partner $W_{c1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a simultaneous fit to BESIII data on $e^+e^-\to \gamma (D^0\bar{D}^{*0}\pi^0/J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-)$ and LHCb data on $B^+\to K^+(J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-)$ to precisely determine the properties of the $X(3872)$, with full consideration of three-body effects from $D^*\to D\pi$ decay, respecting both analyticity and unitarity. The $X(3872)$ is determined to be a bound state with a significance of $6\sigma$, and its pole is located at $E_X{=}\left(-53^{+~9}_{-24}-\,i\,34^{+~2}_{-12}\right) \rm keV$, relative to the nominal $D^0\bar{D}^{*0}$ threshold. Moreover, we confirm the presence of an isovector partner state, $W_{c1}$. It is found as a virtual state at $(1.6^{+0.7}_{-0.9}+ i\, 1.4^{+0.3}_{-0.6})\ \rm MeV$ relative to the $D^+ D^{*-}$ threshold on an unphysical Riemann sheet, strongly supporting a molecular nature of both $X(3872)$ and $W_{c1}$. As a highly non-trivial prediction we show that the $W_{c1}$ leads to nontrivial lineshapes in $B^0\to K^0X(3872)\to K^0 D^0\bar D^0\pi^0$ and $K^0J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ -- thus the scheme presented here can be tested further by improved measurements.</description>

      <title>Chiral effective model of cold and dense two-color QCD: The linear sigma model approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review is devoted to summarizing recent developments of the linear sigma model (LSM) in cold and dense two-color QCD (QC$_2$D), in which lattice simulations are straightforwardly applicable thanks to the disappearance of the sign problem. In QC$_2$D, both theoretical and numerical studies derive the presence of the so-called baryon superfluid phase at sufficiently large chemical potential ($\mu_q$), where diquark condensates govern the ground state. The hadron mass spectrum simulated in this phase shows that the mass of an iso-singlet ($I=0$) and $0^-$ state is remarkably reduced, but such a mode cannot be described by the chiral perturbation theory. Motivated by this fact, I invent the LSM constructed upon the linear representation of chiral symmetry, or more precisely the Pauli-G\"ursey symmetry. Then, it is shown that my LSM successfully reproduces the low-lying hadron mass spectrum in a broad range of $\mu_q$ simulated on the lattice. As applications of the LSM, topological susceptibility and sound velocity in cold and dense QC$_2$D are evaluated to compare with lattice results. Besides, generalized Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation and hardon mass spectrum in the presence of a diquark source are analyzed. I also introduce an extended version of the LSM incorporating spin-$1$ hadrons.</description>

      <title>Flavor Constraints in a Generational Three Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Three Higgs Doublet Model (3HDM) that goes beyond natural flavor conservation and in which each of the three Higgs doublets couples mainly to a single generation of fermions via non-standard Yukawa structures. A hierarchy in the vacuum expectation values of the three Higgs doublets can partially address the SM flavor puzzle. In light of the experimentally observed $125$ GeV Higgs boson, we primarily work within a 3HDM alignment limit such that a Standard Model-like Higgs is recovered. In order to reproduce the observed CKM mixing among quarks, the neutral Higgs bosons of the theory necessarily mediate flavor changing neutral currents at the tree level. We consider constraints from neutral kaon, $B$ meson, and $D$ meson mixing as well as from the rare leptonic decays $B_s/B^0/K_L\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-/e^+e^-$. We identify regions of parameter space in which the new physics Higgs bosons can be as light as a TeV or even lighter.</description>

      <title>Model dependence in SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that, although SMEFT is constructed to be model-independent, this holds only if complete sets of operators are used. SMEFT analyses that focus on subsets of operators are only semi-model-independent. They probe classes of ultraviolet models, opening a window to the underlying new physics. This model dependence originates from the need to choose a weak basis, usually taken to be the down or up basis. This naturally leads to the introduction of a third SMEFT weak basis, the generic basis, which interpolates between the above two bases. Due to its generality, we argue that the generic weak basis is the most natural for new physics. In the down and up weak bases, only a specific product of the two transformation matrices from the weak to the mass basis is observable -- the CKM matrix. However, in the generic weak basis, both transformation matrices are measurable in principle, possibly up to some phases.</description>

      <title>Analytic formulae for T violation in neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a concept known as $\mu$TRISTAN, which involves the acceleration of $\mu^+$, has been proposed. This initiative has led to considerations of a new design for a neutrino factory. Additionally, leveraging the polarization of $\mu^+$, measurements of T violation in neutrino oscillations are also being explored. In this paper, we present analytical expressions for T violation in neutrino oscillations within the framework of standard three flavor neutrino oscillations, a scenario involving nonstandard interactions, and a case of unitarity violation. We point out that examining the energy spectrum of T violation may be useful for probing new physics effects.</description>

Abstract: I will give a brief overview of the Standard Model theory inputs needed for the precise determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $V_{us}$ from semileptonic kaon decays, focusing on the long-distance electromagnetic corrections. I will then describe our recent effort to pin down this correction at sub-permille level, which further sharpens the so-called ``Cabibbo angle anomaly'', an interesting observation which may point towards new physics.</description>

      <title>Lepton flavor violation in the Majorana and Dirac scotogenic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we have considered two minimal versions of scotogenic models, where neutrinos acquire masses through a radiative mechanism. We call these two models as Majorana and Dirac scotogenic models. In the former model, neutrinos have Majorana nature, and in the later one, neutrinos are Dirac particles. These two models are related to each other in terms of additional fields and symmetries of the model. Hence, to compare these two models in future experiments, we have analyzed lepton flavor violating (LFV) processes in both of them, in the charged lepton sector. We have found that the 3-body LFV decays in both these models can get different contributions. Among all the LFV decays and after satisfying relevant constraints, we have found that $\tau\to3\mu$ can have a branching ratio as high as $10^{-10}(10^{-11})$ in the Majorana(Dirac) scotogenic model. This branching ratio can be probed in the future planned experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the status of the Czech Particle Physics Project (CPPP). The CPPP is a learning tool in masterclasses aimed at high school students (aged 15 to 18). The project is structured in modules. The first module is dedicated to the detection of an Axion-Like-Particle (ALP) using the ATLAS Forward Proton (AFP) detector. The second module focuses on the reconstruction of the Higgs boson mass using the Higgs boson golden channel with four leptons in the final state. The third and fourth modules are educational aids and sources for expert information. These web portals are dedicated to Higgs boson research and searches for Supersymmetry. Two databases are created with more than 1000 relevant articles each, using the CERN Document Server API and web scraping methods. The databases are automatically updated when new results on Higgs bosons or searches for Supersymmetric particles become available. Using artificial intelligence and natural language processing, the articles are categorized according to properties of the results. The modules are accessible at https://cern.ch/cppp.</description>

      <title>Identification of $tqg$ flavor-changing neutral current interactions using machine learning techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) are forbidden at tree level in the Standard Model (SM), but they can be enhanced in physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios.In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of deep learning techniques to enhance the sensitivity of current and future collider experiments to the production of a top quark and an associated parton through the $tqg$ FCNC process, which originates from the $tug$ and $tcg$ vertices. The $tqg$ FCNC events can be produced with a top quark and either an associated gluon or quark, while SM only has events with a top quark and an associated quark. We apply machine learning techniques to distinguish the $tqg$ FCNC events from the SM backgrounds, including $qg$-discrimination variables. We use the Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) method as a baseline classifier, assuming that the leading jet originates from the associated parton. We compare with a Transformer-based deep learning method known as the Self-Attention for Jet-parton Assignment (SAJA) network, which allows us to include information from all jets in the event, regardless of their number, eliminating the necessity to match the associated parton to the leading jet. The \SaJa\ network with qg-discrimination variables has the best performance, giving expected upper limits on the branching ratios Br($t \to qg$) that are 25-35\% lower than those from the BDT method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two models of dark matter~(DM) that can provide a natural explanation of the excess of \mbox{$B^+\to K^+ +\,\text{invisible}$} events with respect to the Standard Model~(SM) prediction for \mbox{$B^+\to K^+ \nu\bar\nu$}, which has been reported by the Belle~II collaboration. Interactions between the dark and the visible sector are mediated by an axion-like particle (ALP) in one case, by the kinetic mixing between a dark photon and the SM photon in the second case. Both models encompass a light fermion singlet as the DM candidate and can account for the observed DM relic abundance through, respectively, the freeze-in and the freeze-out production mechanism, while simultaneously explaining the Belle~II excess.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein spacetime model is considered, with one extra compactified spatial dimension. The equation of state of an electrically neutral, zero-temperature Fermi gas with a repulsive linear potential is described. From the equation of state, the speed of sound squared is calculated and shown for different model parameters. Its properties are studied from lower energies up to the conformal limit.</description>

      <title>Short note on spin magnetization in QGP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We outline the theory of spin QGP (quark-gluon plasma) magnetization. We explore the primordial epoch shortly after the Big-Bang within temperatures of 150 MeV to 500 MeV, also of interest to laboratory experiments. The ferro-magnetized fermion gas we consider consists of (light) quarks in laboratory QGP, and also leptons (electrons) for the case of the primordial Universe. We show that a fully spin-polarized up-quark gas could generate cosmic magnetic fields in excess of $10^{15}$ Tesla. We suggest that even a weakly spin-polarized gas would have a profound impact on properties of the primordial Universe which can be explored in laboratory QGP experiments. We present details of how the magnetization is obtained using a grand partition function approach. This requires evaluating slowly convergent magnetized Fermi-Dirac integrals.</description>

      <title>Page Time of Primordial Black Holes: Standard Model and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Page time marks the moment when the von Neumann entropy of the emitted Hawking radiation equals the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of an evaporating black hole, which is assumed to quantify its degrees of freedom as seen from the outside. Beyond this point, from unitarity we would expect that the entropy of the radiation begins to decrease, ensuring that information is eventually recovered. In this work, we investigate the dependence of the Page time on black hole properties and the particle content of nature. Specifically, we analyze its sensitivity to the Standard Model (SM) and potential Beyond-the-SM degrees of freedom, incorporating the effects of particle masses. We find that a Schwarzschild primordial black hole (PBH) with an initial mass of $6.23\times 10^{14}~{\rm g}$ would have a Page time equal to the age of the Universe, assuming emission of SM particles only. We further explore the impact of a non-negligible PBH angular momentum, finding that light spin-2 particles are predominantly emitted before the Page time for Kerr black holes. For For initial angular momenta values exceeding $a_\star &gt; 0.5$, approximately $70\%$ of the total graviton emission occurs prior to the Page time for PBHs with an initial mass $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{10}~{\rm g}$. Finally, we discuss the implications for PBH phenomenology, particularly regarding potential constraints from $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ measurements.</description>

      <title>Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 1. Primordial Theory &amp; Optimal Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primordial four-point function encodes a wealth of information about the inflationary Universe. Despite extensive theoretical work, most models of four-point physics have never been compared to data. In this series, we conduct a detailed analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization trispectra, searching for a wide variety of phenomena including local effects, self-interactions, curvatons, DBI inflation, gauge fields, solid inflation, scalar field exchange, spinning massive field exchange, chiral physics, point sources, and gravitational lensing. After presenting a suite of separable primordial templates, we derive thirteen quasi-optimal estimators that directly estimate the underlying template amplitudes. These are unbiased, minimum variance, mask-deconvolved, and account for correlations between templates (including with lensing). Each estimator can be efficiently implemented using spherical harmonic transforms, Monte Carlo methods, and optimization techniques, and asymptotes to standard forms in certain limits. In Paper 2, we implement these estimators in public code, and in Paper 3, use them to constrain primordial trispectra with Planck data. This enables a wide variety of tests of inflation, including some of the first direct constraints on cosmological collider physics.</description>

      <title>Fermions and the Renormalisation Group at Large N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate fermionic quantum field theories using functional renormalisation. In the limit of many fermion flavours $N$, we demonstrate that theories have exact solutions for their quantum effective actions given by quasi-local interaction functionals of fermion bilinears. The structure implies that local potential approximations are exact, exactly solvable, and that field anomalous dimensions vanish. Theories with non-trivial anomalous dimensions may also arise under conditions that are identified. We further demonstrate that higher derivative interactions are inevitably induced by point-like ones, including at large-$N$. The local potential flows for fermionic theories with the most general $U(N)$ symmetric interactions are provided. For sample theories with scalar, pseudo-scalar, vector, or axial-vector interactions, we identify conformal fixed points, scaling dimensions, conformal manifolds, and quantum-induced shifts in scaling dimensions of higher derivative interactions. We also study fermion mass generation, and subleading modifications due to finite $N$ corrections. Implications for conformal field theories, and applications in condensed matter and particle physics are indicated.</description>

      <title>Clash of the Titans: ultra-high energy KM3NeT event versus IceCube data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: KM3NET has reported the detection of a remarkably high-energy through-going muon. Lighting up about a third of the detector, this muon could originate from a neutrino exceeding 10 PeV energy. The crucial question we need to answer is where this event comes from and what its source is. Intriguingly, IceCube has been running with a much larger effective area for a much longer time, and yet it has not reported neutrinos above 10 PeV. We quantify the tension between the KM3NeT event with the absence of similar high-energy events in IceCube. Through a detailed analysis, we determine the most likely neutrino energy to be in the range 23-2400 PeV. We find a $3.8\sigma$ tension between the two experiments assuming the neutrino to be from the diffuse isotropic neutrino background. Alternatively, assuming the event is of cosmogenic origin and considering three representative models, this tension still falls within 3.2-3.9$\sigma$. The least disfavored scenario is a steady or transient point source, though still leading to $2.9\sigma$ and $2.1\sigma$ tensions, respectively. The lack of observation of high-energy events in IceCube seriously challenges the explanation of this event coming from any known diffuse fluxes. Our results indicate the KM3NeT event is likely the first observation of a new astrophysical source.</description>

      <title>Investigating the effects of QCD matter's electrical conductivity on charge dependent directed flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge dependent directed flow is an important observable of electromagnetic fields in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We demonstrate how the difference in charge dependent directed flows between protons and antiprotons is sensitive to the resistivity, inverse of quark-gluon plasma's electric conductivity, over different collision centralities. Our model numerically solves the 3+1D relativistic resistive magneto-hydrodynamic (RRMHD) equations, assuming the electric conductivity to be a scalar. For this work, we focus on symmetric Au + Au collisions at the top RHIC energy of $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV. We illustrate the time evolution of the electromagnetic fields in our model and connect that to the charge dependent directed flow results. Our results highlight the importance of modeling quark-gluon plasma's electric conductivity for charge dependent observables in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Lattice perspectives on doubly heavy tetraquarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Doubly heavy tetraquarks have emerged as new probes to study the heavy hadron spectrum. With the experimental observation of the $J^P=1^+$ $T_{cc}^+$, they pose a unique opportunity to bring together efforts in experiment, phenomenology, and lattice QCD. In lattice calculations they are accessible as ground states, unlike hidden flavor tetraquarks, and this enables accurate determinations of the scattering parameters alongside the binding energies of these tetraquarks. Today, lattice calculations firmly predict $J^P=1^+$ $T_{bb}^{ud}$ and $T_{bb}^{us}$ as QCD bound states, while recent studies approaching the $J^P=1^+$ $T_{cc}^{ud}$ find it to be a virtual bound state at slightly non-physical input quark masses. Studies of the $J^P=1^+$ $T_{bc}^{ud}$ are ongoing and a new focus area. In light of these developments the evolution of this field until this point is reviewed. Emphasis is put on the methods in lattice spectroscopy that enable a robust evaluation of the lattice studies gathered. They are further reviewed towards their limitations and achievements. Current challenges and opportunities are discussed, including possibilities to approach the left-hand cut in the scattering analysis of the charm candidates and towards understanding the structure of those including two bottom quarks.</description>

      <title>Is there a chiral dark dynamo in the universe induced by quantum correction, Nieh-Yan gravity and Barbero-Immirzi field?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bombagcino investigated the role of Immirzi parameter when promoted to a field in Einstein-Cartan-Holst black hole and they found that the Immirzi field acts similar to the axion field, as both axial pseudo-vector and vectorial torsion trace appear to be expressed in terms of the 4-gradient of the Immirzi parameter. In this paper we introduced two important ingredients absent in the previous work: the torsion mass, significant for the torsion detection the Large Hadron Collider, and the quantum correction proportional to the 4-divergent of torsion squared. Without the quantum correction, a simple analytical solution is obtained, while the more complicated field equations incorporating the BI field are obtained also analytically. The lower bound of quantum correction parameter is determined in terms of the torsion trace mass squared and axial torsion squared. Our findings reveal that in the late universe, the BI parameter approaches infinity restoring to the Einstein-Cartan theory in the early universe with the dynamical reduction of the Immirzi parameter to a constant BI parameter. Additionally, we derive analytical solutions for magnetic dynamos in the early universe, demonstrating that magnetic helicity is proportional to chiral chemical potential. A magnetic field at the QCD phase is found out of $10^{17}$ G, without quantum correction. Furthermore, from this dark magnetogenesis, we estimate light torsion with mass of the order of 1 TeV, An example of unitary preserved Lagrangian with axion as an Immirzi field is obtained. In the present universe we find a magnetic field strength of approximately $10^{-12}$ G which is quite close to the range found by Miniati at the QCD threshold, between $10^{-18}-10^{-15}$ G. Given that unitary violation on theoretical grounds may indicate new physics, exploring unitary violations in dark magnetogenesis could be particularly intriguing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The canonical cosmological model to explain the recent acceleration of the universe relies on a cosmological constant, and most dynamical dark energy and modified gravity model alternatives are based on scalar fields. Still, further alternatives are possible. One of these involves vector fields: under certain conditions, they can lead to accelerating universes while preserving large-scale homogeneity and isotropy. We report quantitative observational constraints on a model previously proposed by Armend\'ariz-Pic\'on and known as the cosmic triad. We consider several subclasses of the model, which generically is a parametric extension of the canonical $\Lambda$CDM model, as well as two possible choices of the triad's potential. Our analysis shows that any deviations from this limit are constrained to be small. In particular the preferred present-day values of the matter density and the dark energy equation of state are fully consistent with those obtained, for the same datasets, in flat $\Lambda$CDM and $w_0$CDM. The constraints mildly depend on the priors on the dark energy equation of state, specifically on whether phantom values thereof are allowed, while the choice of potential does not play a significant role since any such potential is constrained to be relatively flat.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Dark Energy Phenomenology Across Different Parameterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent evidence for dynamical dark energy from DESI, in combination with other cosmological data, has generated significant interest in understanding the nature of dark energy and its underlying microphysics. However, interpreting these results critically depends on how dark energy is parameterized. This paper examines the robustness of conclusions about the viability of particular kinds of dynamical dark energy models to the choice of parameterization, focusing on four popular two-parameter families: the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), and exponential (EXP) parameterizations. We find that conclusions regarding the viability of minimally and non-minimally coupled quintessence models are independent of the parameterization adopted. We demonstrate this both by mapping these dark energy models into the $(w_0, w_a)$ parameter space defined by these various parameterizations and by showing that all of these parameterizations can equivalently account for the phenomenology predicted by these dark energy models to a high degree of accuracy.</description>

Abstract: We study the light meson - charmonium - glueball mixing using flavor-singlet meson operators built from optimal distillation profiles together with purely gluonic operators in different $J^{PC}$ channels at two different pion masses ($\approx$ $420$, $800$ MeV) in two $N_{\rm f} = 3 + 1$ ensembles at close to physical charm quark mass. We observe non-zero mixing correlations between the different types of operators and quantify the overlaps between states created by them and the energy eigenstates by means of a GEVP formulation. We are particularly interested in the scalar glueball and its possible decay into two pions so we also include two-pion operators in our calculation.</description>

Abstract: Integration-by-parts reductions of Feynman integrals pose a frequent bottle-neck in state-of-the-art calculations in theoretical particle and gravitational-wave physics, and rely on heuristic approaches for selecting integration-by-parts identities, whose quality heavily influences the performance. In this paper, we investigate the use of machine-learning techniques to find improved heuristics. We use funsearch, a genetic programming variant based on code generation by a Large Language Model, in order to explore possible approaches, then use strongly typed genetic programming to zero in on useful solutions. Both approaches manage to re-discover the state-of-the-art heuristics recently incorporated into integration-by-parts solvers, and in one example find a small advance on this state of the art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the effects of including the energy dependence determined from evolution equations within the color glass condensate framework on observables in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. This amounts to integrating the JIMWLK evolution equations into the IP-Glasma model, which is then coupled to viscous relativistic hydrodynamics. This methodology allows for a systematic representation of nuclei at specific Bjorken-$x$ values, which are probed at different center-of-mass energies of the collision and rapidities of final state particles. Comparing to the conventional IP-Glasma model, we find significant effects on multiplicity distributions and particle spectra, especially in smaller collision systems at the highest center of mass energies. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating nonlinear QCD evolution in the description of heavy ion collisions at varying center of mass energies, as the precise extraction of transport coefficients will be affected. This work establishes a robust framework for understanding the quark gluon plasma and nuclear structure at high energy, integrating small-$x$ physics into the initial conditions of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Signals of eV-scale sterile neutrino at long baseline neutrino experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While most of the results of the neutrino oscillation experiments can be accommodated within the standard paradigm of three active flavor, there are tantalizing hints of an light eV-scale sterile neutrino from anomalous results of a few short baseline experiments. This additional light sterile neutrino is expected to leave an imprint on the physics observables pertaining to standard unknowns such as determination of the Dirac-type leptonic $CP$ phase, $\delta_{13}$, the question of neutrino mass hierarchy and the octant of $\theta_{23}$. The upcoming long baseline neutrino experiments such as T2HK, DUNE and P2O will be sensitive to active - sterile mixing. In the present work, we examine and assess the capability of these long baseline experiments to probe the sterile neutrino at the level of probabilities and event rates. We perform a detailed study by taking into account the values of parameters that are presently allowed and (a) study the impact on $CP$ violation by examining the role played by various appearance and disappearance channels, (b) address the question of disentangling the intrinsic effects from extrinsic effects in the standard paradigm as well as three active plus one light sterile neutrino, and finally (c) assess the ability of these long baseline experiments to distinguish between the two scenarios. Our results indicate that for the true values of sterile parameters and for all values of $\delta_{13}$, the sensitivity of P2O is the lowest while the sensitivity of T2HK is modest ($&lt;3\,\sigma$) and the sensitivity of DUNE is $&gt; 3\,\sigma$. For larger values of the sterile mixing angles, there is an improvement in the sensitivity for all the three considered experiments.</description>

      <title>On Quark Substructures in an Inspired Unified Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the growing attention devoted to the Quantum Chromodynamics sector of the Standard Model, and the recent observations of non-standard hadronic states, a possible substructure of quarks $q_{f}\equiv C_{ij}|k_{i}k_{j}\rangle $ in terms of four colorless bound particles $% k_{i(=0,\ldots,3)}$ "hyperparticles" is investigated in a $SO(10)$-inspired unified model. This aims to define a subtle structure of matter as well as an explanation of some particularities of quarks. Precisley, these hyperquarks $k_{i}$ are bound by a $SU(3)_{h}$ "hyperstrong force" under which they are assumed to be charged. Exploiting certain known data, the masses and the charges of such fundamental particles are discussed along with the emerged four extra quarks $q_{f}\equiv \delta_{ii}|k_{i}k_{i}\rangle $ and three hyperweak bosons $W_{h}$.</description>

      <title>$\bar{B}\rightarrow \bar{D} D$ Decays and the Extraction of $f_d/f_u$ at Hadron Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16952v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a detailed model-independent phenomenological analysis of $\bar B\to \bar D D$ decays. Employing an SU(3)$_F$ analysis including symmetry-breaking contributions together with a conservative power counting for various suppression effects, we obtain updated Standard Model predictions for all branching fractions and CP asymmetries from a fit to the available experimental data, testable at Belle II and the LHC experiments. These results include all relevant suppressed contributions, thereby providing upper limits on subleading Standard Model (SM) effects like "penguin pollution", enabling searches for physics beyond the SM. Importantly, allowing in the same fit for the production fractions of charged and neutral $B$ mesons to be different, we find $f_d/f_u = 0.86\pm0.05$, which is $2.5\sigma$ away from unity, which, if confirmed, would have important phenomenological consequences.</description>

      <title>Jet transport coefficients by elastic and radiative scatterings in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the investigation on jet transport coefficients within the effective Dynamical QuasiParticle Model (DQPM) -- constructed for the description of non-perturbative QCD phenomena of the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) in line with the lattice QCD equation-of-state -- by accounting for inelastic $2\to 3$ reactions with gluon radiation additionally to the elastic scattering of partons. The elastic and inelastic reactions are calculated explicitly within leading-order Feynman diagrams with effective propagators and vertices from the DQPM by accounting for all channels and their interferences. We present the results for the jet transport coefficients such as the transverse momentum transfer squared $\hat{q}$ per unit length as well as the energy loss $\Delta E = dE/dx$ per unit length in the sQGP and investigate their dependence on the temperature $T$ and momentum of the jet parton depending on the choice of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ in thermal, jet parton and radiative vertices. For the latter we consider different scenarios used in the literature and find a very strong dependence of $\hat q$ and $\Delta E$ on the choice of $\alpha_s$. Moreover, we explore the relation of $\hat{q}/T^3$ to the ratio of specific shear viscosity to entropy density $\eta/s$ and show that the ratio $T^3/\hat{q}$ to $\eta/s$ has a strong $T$ dependence -- especially when approaching to $T_c$ -- on the choice of $\alpha_s$ in scattering vertices.</description>

      <title>Discrete dark matter with light Dirac neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17861v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new realisation of light Dirac neutrino mass and dark matter (DM) within the framework of a non-Abelian discrete flavour symmetry based on $A_4$ group. In addition to $A_4$, we also consider a $Z_2$ and an unbroken global lepton number symmetry $U(1)_L$ to keep unwanted terms away while guaranteeing the Dirac nature of light neutrinos. The field content, their transformations and flavon vacuum alignments are chosen in such a way that the type-I Dirac seesaw generates only one light Dirac neutrino mass while the other two masses arise from scotogenic contributions at one-loop. This leads to the Dirac scoto-seesaw framework, a generalisation of the widely studied scoto-seesaw model to Dirac neutrinos. The symmetry breaking of $A_4$ leaves a remnant $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry responsible for stabilising DM. Dirac nature of light neutrinos introduces additional relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ within reach of cosmic microwave background experiments.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Dirac Neutrinos and Relic Neutrino Matter Effect on the High-energy Neutrino Flavor Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18507v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if neutrinos are pseudo-Dirac, they can potentially affect the flavor ratio predictions for the high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux observed by IceCube. In this context, we point out a novel matter effect induced by the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B) on the flavor ratio composition. Specifically, the active-sterile neutrino oscillations over the astrophysical baseline lead to an energy-dependent flavor ratio at Earth due to the C$\nu$B matter effect, which is in principle distinguishable from the vacuum oscillation effect, provided there is an asymmetry between the neutrino and antineutrino number densities, as well as a local C$\nu$B overdensity. Considering the projected precision of the 3-neutrino oscillation parameter measurements and improved flavor triangle measurements, we show that the next-generation neutrino telescopes, such as KM3NeT and IceCube-Gen2, can in principle probe the pseudo-Dirac neutrino hypothesis and the C$\nu$B matter effect.</description>

      <title>Star Shearing Season -- Transient Signals in Wave-like Dark Matter Experiments from Black Hole Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ordinary matter coupled to light weakly interacting bosons can lead to the formation of a macroscopic bosonic field in the vicinity of large matter concentrations such as ordinary or neutron stars. When these objects are turned into black holes due to a supernova or a binary merger this ''hair'' could be ''shorn'' off. Part of the field configuration would then be released leading to an outgoing field wave. For small masses this field transient remains rather compact and can induce a transient signal in experiments, in particular those that look for wave-like dark matter. This signal can be correlated with the corresponding astrophysical signal of the event. In this note, we consider a variety of couplings and the associated signals and estimate the corresponding sensitivities.</description>

      <title>The $e^+ e^- \rightarrow Z H$ Process in the SMEFT Beyond Leading Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically study potential effects of Beyond the Standard Model physics in the $e^+ e^- \rightarrow Z H$ process. To this end, we include all relevant dimension-6 Standard Model Effective Field Theory operators and work to next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in the electroweak coupling. We consider both polarized and unpolarized electron and positron beams and present results for $\sqrt{s}=240, ~365$ and $500~{\rm GeV}$, emphasizing contributions where the NLO predictions differ significantly from the leading order results. At NLO, a sensitivity arises to operators that do not contribute at tree level, such as the Higgs tri-linear coupling, CP-violating operators, and dimension-6 operators involving the top quark, among many others. We compare the prospects of future $e^+e^-$ colliders to explore these new physics effects with existing measurements from the LHC, electron EDMs (for CP violating operators), and Z pole measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in the application of light-ray operators (LROs) in high energy physics, we propose a new strategy to study correlation functions of LROs through real-time quantum simulations. We argue that quantum simulators provide an ideal laboratory to explore the properties LROs in lower-dimensional quantum field theories (QFTs). This is exemplified in the 1+1-d Schwinger model, employing tensor network methods, focusing on the calculation of energy and charge correlators. Despite some challenges in extracting the necessary correlation functions from the lattice the methodology used can be extended to real quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the physics potential of the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) in probing active-sterile mixing. We present analytic expressions for relevant oscillation probabilities for three active and one sterile neutrino of eV-scale mass and highlight essential parameters impacting the oscillation signals at DUNE. We then explore the space of sterile parameters as well as study their correlations among themselves and with parameters appearing in the standard framework ($\delta_{13}$ and $\theta_{23}$). We perform a combined fit for the near and far detector at DUNE using GLoBES. We consider alternative beam tune (low energy and medium energy) and runtime combinations for constraining the sterile parameter space. We show that charged current and neutral current interactions over the near and far detector at DUNE allow for an improved sensitivity for a wide range of sterile neutrino mass splittings.</description>

Abstract: We present a method to simulate toponium formation events at the LHC using the Green's function of non-relativistic QCD in the Coulomb gauge, which governs the momentum distribution of top quarks in the presence of the QCD potential. This Green's function can be employed to re-weight any matrix elements relevant for $t\bar{t}$ production and decay processes where a colour-singlet top-antitop pair is produced in the $S$-wave at threshold. As an example, we study the formation of $\eta_t$ toponium states in the gluon fusion channel at the LHC, combining the re-weighted matrix elements with parton showering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first results from the Quantum Resolution-Optimized Cryogenic Observatory for Dark matter Incident at Low Energy (QROCODILE). The QROCODILE experiment uses a microwire-based superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) as a target and sensor for dark matter scattering and absorption, and is sensitive to energy deposits as low as 0.11 eV. We introduce the experimental configuration and report new world-leading constraints on the interactions of sub-MeV dark matter particles with masses as low as 30 keV. The thin-layer geometry of the system provides anisotropy in the interaction rate, enabling directional sensitivity. In addition, we leverage the coupling between phonons and quasiparticles in the detector to simultaneously constrain interactions with both electrons and nucleons. We discuss the potential for improvements to both the energy threshold and effective volume of the experiment in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Massive Helicity-Chirality Spinor Formalism from Massless Amplitudes with On-shell Mass Insertion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a helicity-chirality spinor formalism to describe scattering amplitudes for particles of any masses and spins. The massive spin-spinors introduced by Arkani-hamed-Huang-Huang have been extended to the spin/helicity-transversality spinors, in which a new quantum number transversality, closely related to chirality, is introduced by extending the Poincare symmetry. The massive helicity-chirality amplitudes can be written by the large and small components of massless spinors $\lambda$ and $\eta$ following the $\lambda \sim \sqrt{E}, \eta \sim \mathbf{m}/\sqrt{E}$ expansion order by order, which formulate the power counting rules of a large energy effective theory. Diagrammatically the mass expansion in amplitudes originates from the on-shell mass insertion: the helicity flip and chirality flip, which completely determines the three-point massive amplitudes. From the chirality-helicity unification at the UV, any massive helicity-chirality amplitude can be one-to-one corresponded to massless helicity amplitudes with (without) additional Higgs insertion. This UV-IR correspondence explains the mass enhancement in the weak decay processes $\pi^+ \to \mu^+ \nu$ and $t \to W^+ b$, and isolates the correct UV of the three-point massive QED $F\bar{F}\gamma$ amplitudes in Arkani-hamed-Huang-Huang formalism. From massless-massive correspondence, the massless on-shell techniques can be utilized to construct higher-point massive amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calculations of the parton distribution function (PDF) and distribution amplitude (DA) are highly relevant to core experimental programs as they provide non-perturbative inputs to inclusive and exclusive processes, respectively. Direct computation of the PDFs and DAs remains challenging because they are non-perturbative quantities defined as light-cone correlators of quark and gluon fields, and are therefore inherently time-dependent. In this work, we use a uniform quantum strategy based on tensor network simulation techniques to directly extract these hadronic quantities from first principles using the matrix product state of the hadrons in the same setup. We present exemplary numerical calculations with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in 1+1 dimensions and compare with available exact diagonalization and quantum circuit simulation results. Using tensor networks, we evaluate the PDF and DA at various strong couplings in the large-qubit limit, which is consistent with expectations at perturbative and non-relativistic limits.</description>

Abstract: We consider the thrust ($T$) distribution in electron-positron ($e^+e^-$) annihilation into hadrons and we perform the all-order resummation of the large logarithms of $1-T$ up to next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (N$^4$LL) accuracy in QCD. We consistently combine resummed predictions with the known fixed-order results up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). All perturbative terms up to order $\alpha_S^3$ are included in our calculation which, thanks to a unitarity constraint, exactly reproduce after integration over the variable $T$ the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) result for the total cross section of $e^+e^-$ into hadrons. We resum the large logarithms in the Laplace-conjugated space and compare our results with those obtained with the analytic resummation formalism in the physical ($T$) space. We find that the differences in the spectra obtained with the two different formalisms are sizable. Non-perturbative corrections have been included through an analytic hadronization model depending on two free parameters. Finally, we present a comparison of our spectra with experimental data at the $Z$-boson mass ($m_Z$) energy, which enables us to extract the value of the QCD coupling $\alpha_S(m_Z^2)=0.1181 \pm 0.0018$ fully consistent with the world average.</description>

      <title>Percolation of Domain Walls in the Two-Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain walls formed during a phase transition in a simple field theory model with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in a periodic box have been demonstrated to annihilate as fast as causality allows and their area density scales $\propto t^{-1}$. We have performed numerical simulations of the dynamics of domain walls in the Two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) where the potential has $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in two spatial dimensions. We observed significant differences with the standard case. Although the extreme long-time limit is the same for the $\approx 10^{5}$ sets of random initial configurations analysed, the percolation process is much slower due to the formation of long-lived loops. We suggest that this is due to the build up of superconducting currents on the walls which could lead ultimately to stationary configurations known as Kinky Vortons. We discuss the relevance of these findings for the production of Vortons in three spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Successful $\nu p$-process in neutrino-driven outflows in core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of the solar system abundances of several proton-rich isotopes, especially $^{92,94}$Mo and $^{96,98}$Ru, has been an enduring mystery in nuclear astrophysics. An attractive proposal to solve this problem is the $\nu p$-process, which can operate in neutrino-driven outflows in a core-collapse supernova after the shock is launched. Years of detailed studies, however, have cast doubt over the ability of this process to generate sufficiently high absolute and relative amounts of various $p$-nuclei. The $\nu p$-process is also thought to be excluded by arguments based on the long-lived radionuclide $^{92}$Nb.Here, we present explicit calculations, in which both the abundance ratios and the absolute yields of the $p$-nuclei up to $A\lesssim 105$ are successfully reproduced, even when using the modern (medium enhanced) triple-$\alpha$ reaction rates. The process is also shown to produce the necessary amounts of $^{92}$Nb. The models are characterized by subsonic outflows and by the protoneutron star masses in the $\gtrsim 1.7 M_\odot$ range. This suggests that the Mo and Ru $p$-nuclides observed in the Solar System were made in CCSN explosions characterized by an extended accretion stage.</description>

      <title>Confronting the dark matter capture rate with a continuous gravitational wave probe of local neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) from various astrophysical sources are one of the many future probes of upcoming gravitational wave (GW) search missions. Neutron stars (NSs) with deformity are one of the leading sources of CGW emissions. In this work, for the first time, a novel attempt to estimate the dark matter (DM) capture rate is performed using CGW as the probe to the local NS population. Competitive bounds on DM capture from the local NS population are reported when compared with DM direct search experiments and other astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Inner radius and energy conditions of dark matter halos surrounding Schwarzschild black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of analytic models for a dark matter halo surrounding a Schwarzschild black hole sitting at the center of a galaxy, with a variable inner radius $r_{\text{in}}$ at which the density profile of the dark matter halo vanishes. We examine in detail how the three energy conditions are satisfied in such models. In particular, independent of concrete profile, we find that the three energy conditions are satisfied when $r_{\text{in}}\ge5M/2$, where $M$ denotes the mass of the black hole. This indicates it is crucial to include inner radius when discussing dark matter distributions. All our solutions expressed explicitly in closed form are particularly valuable for the studies of the gravitational waveforms of extreme/intermediate mass ratio inspirals and the nature of dark matter in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Parton Distribution Functions in the Schwinger Model with Tensor Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) describe universal properties of bound states and allow us to calculate scattering amplitudes in processes with large momentum transfer. Calculating PDFs involves the evaluation of matrix elements with a Wilson line in a light-cone direction. In contrast to Monte Carlo methods in Euclidean spacetime, these matrix elements can be directly calculated in Minkowski-space using the Hamiltonian formalism. The necessary spatial- and time-evolution can be efficiently applied using established tensor network methods. We present PDFs in the Schwinger model calculated with matrix product states.</description>

      <title>Matching current observational constraints with nonminimally coupled dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17019v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a Universe with a nonminimally coupled scalar field can fit current measurements of the expansion rate of the Universe better than the standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model or other minimally coupled dark energy models. In particular, the nonminimal coupling in this model allows for the dark energy model to exhibit stable phantom crossing behavior, which seems to be suggested by the constraints on the dark energy equation of state coming from the most recent data. While we find a clear improvement in the goodness of fit for this dark energy model with respect to others that have been considered in the recent literature, using information theoretic criteria, we show that the evidence for it is still inconclusive.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopic study of the $ \Omega \alpha $ interaction in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19705v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-particle momentum correlation between the Omega-baryon ($\Omega$) and the $^{4}He (\alpha) $ in high-energy heavy ion collisions is explored.
  Such correlations as an alternative source of information can help us further understand the interaction between $ \Omega $ and nucleons (N).
  $ \Omega\alpha $ potentials in the single-folding potential approach are constructed by employing two different available $\Omega N $ interactions in $^{5}S_{2}$ channel, i.e, one is based on the (2 + 1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations near the physical point by the HAL QCD collaboration, and another is based on the meson exchanges with effective Lagrangian, where in the latter case coupled channels effect is considered.
  It is found that the correlation functions at small size source depends on the used potential model. This implicitly means that at high density nuclear medium, $ \Omega \alpha $ momentum correlation could drive the feature of $ \Omega N $ interactions.
  Moreover, by extracting the scattering length and the effective range from obtained $ \Omega\alpha $ potentials, the correlation functions are calculated within the Lednicky-Lyuboshits (LL) formalism.
  It is shown that since the $\Omega\alpha $ has large interaction range, the LL formula leads to different results at small source size.</description>

      <title>Scale-dependence in $\Lambda$CDM parameters inferred from the CMB: a possible sign of Early Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The early dark energy (EDE) model is one of the promising solutions to the Hubble tension. One of the successes of the EDE model is that it can provide a similar fit to the $\Lambda$CDM model for the CMB power spectrum. In this work, I analyze the phenomenology of the EDE and $\Lambda$CDM parameters on the CMB temperature power spectrum and notice that this cannot hold on all scales. Thus, if the real cosmology is as described by the EDE model, the $\Lambda$CDM parameters will be scale-dependent when fitting the CMB power spectrum with the $\Lambda$CDM model, which can be hints for the EDE model. I examine CMB-S4-like observations through mock data analysis and find that parameter shifts are notable. As observations include smaller scales, I find lower $H_0$, $n_s$, $\omega_b$ and higher $\omega_m$, $A_s e^{-2\tau}$, which will also constitute new tensions with other observations. They can serve as a possible signal for the EDE model.</description>

      <title>Aspects of the chiral crossover transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD with M\"{o}bius domain-wall fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-singlet part of the chiral symmetry in QCD with two light flavors is known to be restored through a crossover transition at a pseudo-critical temperature. However, the temperature dependence of the singlet part of the chiral symmetry and whether it is effectively restored at the same temperature is not well understood. Using (2+1)-flavor QCD configurations generated using the M\"{o}bius domain-wall discretization on an $N_\tau=8$ lattice, we construct suitable observables where the singlet and non-singlet chiral symmetries are disentangled in order to study their temperature dependence across the crossover transition. From the peak of the disconnected part of the chiral susceptibility, we obtain a pseudo-critical temperature $T_{pc}=158.7{}_{{}-2.3}^{{}+2.6}$ MeV where the non-singlet part of the chiral symmetry is effectively restored. From a calculation of the topological susceptibility and its temperature dependence we find that the singlet $U_A(1)$ part of the chiral symmetry is not effectively restored at $T&lt;186$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Reheating chiral dynamos with spin-0 and massive spin-1 torsions via chiral asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Syderenko et al. (JCAP, 10: 018, 2016) investigated magnetogenesis and chiral asymmetry in the early hot universe. This study explores the impact of minimally coupling a constant torsion in their cosmological model, suggesting new chiral physics. Physically, this means that if torsion is right chiral, the difference between the number of right and left chiralities does not change. Moreover, the decay of chiral asymmetry depends on torsion chirality. We solve the chiral torsionful dynamo equation for magnetic field seeds. Magnetic helical fields are considered important for chiral fermion asymmetry. Even in $(3+1)$ dimensional spacetime, torsion is highly suppressed beyond inflation (Eur Phys J C 82: 291, 2022). However, torsion of $1\,\mathrm{MeV}$ appears in the early universe. Equations for correlated magnetic field coefficients are solved in terms of torsion. Weak magnetic fields of the order of $10^{-42}$ Gauss are boosted by powerful torsionful dynamo amplification, generating a much stronger magnetic field of the order of $10^{-9}$ Gauss in the present universe. A galactic magnetic field of $10^{-6}$ Gauss in the present universe, with torsion of $10^{-15}$ Gauss, leads us to a galactic dynamo seed of $10^{-9}$ Gauss. We also discuss reheating dynamo regeneration of decaying cosmic magnetic fields during the hadronization era. The relation between the reheating contribution to e-folds and the connection between CMF and temperature squared allows us to obtain dynamo amplification in terms of N-folds of inflation. The main innovation of this work is the exploration of constant torsion in a cosmological model, revealing new chiral physics. This study offers a new perspective on the origin and evolution of magnetic fields in the early universe.</description>
