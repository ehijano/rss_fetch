      <title>Towards an effective two-orbital description of Nickelate physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered Nickelates have emerged as promising candidates for high-temperature superconductivity, drawing parallels to the well-studied Cuprates. This study provides a robust theoretical framework to understand the electronic structure of these materials, particularly focusing on the role of effective orbitals and the emergence of extra Fermi pocket. Using a multi-orbital model that takes into account the essential symmetries and interactions of the involved orbitals ($5d_{z^2}$, $3d_{z^2}$, $3d_{x^2-y^2}$, $2p_x$, $2p_y$, $2p_z$), we investigated the impact of the Nickel $3d_{z^2}$ orbital on the Fermi surface and the conditions that favor the emergence of a secondary Fermi surface pocket. Our findings reveal that the $3d_{z^2}$ orbital, through its exchange interactions with the rare-earth layer, can modify the Fermi surface, thus acting as a crucial element in the electronic structure. We develop an effective two-orbital model applicable to both $RNiO_3$ and $RNiO_2$ families, explaining the sensitivity of the Fermi surface to apical Oxygen presence and high-pressure environments. This model captures the evolution of the Fermi surface and predicts susceptibility features analogous to those observed in Cuprate superconductors. We observe a peak in Lindhard susceptibility in these Nickelate systems at wave vector $\mathbf{q} = (\pi, \pi)$, similar to the Cuprates. This peak can be tuned by pressure and doping.</description>

      <title>Stability-superconductivity map for compressed Na-intercalated graphite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent ab initio investigation of Na-C binary compounds under moderate pressures has uncovered a possible stable NaC$_4$ superconductor with an estimated critical temperature up to 41K. We revisit this promising binary system by performing a more focused exploration of Na-intercalated graphite configurations, assessing the sensitivity of their thermodynamic stability to density functional approximations at different (T,P) conditions, and examining their superconducting properties with the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg formalism. The combinatorial screening of possible Na arrangements reveals additional stable stoichiometries, i.e., Na$_3$C$_{10}$, NaC$_8$, NaC$_{10}$, and NaC$_{12}$, that redefine the previously proposed convex hulls for pressures up to 10 GPa. The evaluation of formation enthalpies with different van der Waals functionals indicates that the proposed compounds might not be thermodynamically stable at zero temperature but some of them could stabilize due to the vibrational entropy or form via cold compression if graphite is used as a starting material. Our more rigorous modeling of the electron-phonon coupling in NaC$_4$ confirms the material's potential for high-temperature superconductivity, with a critical temperature reaching 48 K at 10 GPa, and reveals a well-defined two-gap structure unusual for an electron-doped compound. By tracking the position of the intercalant nearly free electron states with respect to the Fermi level in viable Na-C compounds, we map out the range of pressures and compositions needed for strong electron-phonon coupling and identify Na$_3$C$_{10}$ as an equally promising superconductor.</description>

      <title>alpha-Ta Films on c-plane Sapphire with Enhanced Microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting films of alpha-Ta are promising candidates for the fabrication of advanced superconducting qubits. However, alpha-Ta films suffer from many growth-induced structural inadequacies that negatively affect their performance. We have therefore explored a new synthesis method for alpha-Ta films which allows the growth of these films with unprecedented quality. Using this method, high quality alpha-Ta films are deposited at a comparably high substrate temperature of 1150 C. They are single-phase alpha-Ta and have a single out-of-plane (110) orientation. They consist of grains above 2 um that have one of three possible in-plane orientations. As shown by scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss studies the substrate-film interfaces are sharp with no observable intermixing. The obtained insights into the epitaxial growth of body-centered-cubic films on quasi-hexagonal substrates lay the basis for harnessing the high structural coherence of such films in various applications.</description>

      <title>Optical Pumping of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the generation by optical pulses of non-thermal distributions of nuclear spins in quantum dots we investigate the effect of optical pulses applied to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductors. Using time-dependent mean-field theory formulated with Anderson pseudospins, we study the electronic configurations and the energy deposited in the system by optical pulses. The pulses are included by Peierls substitution and we study short rectangular pulses as well as idealized $\delta$ pulses. Already a few and even a single pulse generates highly non-trivial distributions of electron expectation values which we simulate numerically and explain analytically based on the linearization of the equations of motion. These results suggest so far unexplored experimental possibilities for the optical control of superconducting states.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Pressure Dependent Interorbital and Interlayer Doping in Superconducting Nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of nickelate superconductivity provided the first example of a non-copper-based material with superconductivity strongly analogous to the cuprates, but recent findings raise questions and inconsistencies around the electron counts and doping phase diagrams. We show using superconducting La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ that there are unconventional interlayer and interorbital intrinsic doping effects that render the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital occupation similar to the cuprates. The results enable a consistent framework for nickelate superconductivity, while maintaining the connection between cuprate and nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Transverse resistance due to electronic inhomogeneities in superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions in many-body systems are often associated with the emergence of spatial inhomogeneities. Such features may develop at microscopic lengthscales and are not necessarily evident in measurements of macroscopic quantities. In this work, we address the topic of distribution of current paths in superconducting films. Typical lengthscales associated with superconductivity are in the range of nanometres. Accordingly, measurements of electrical resistance over much larger distances are supposed to be insensitive to details of spatial inhomogeneities of electronic properties. We observe that, contrary to expectations, current paths adopt a highly non-uniform distribution at the onset of the superconducting transition which is manifested in the development of a finite transverse resistance. The anisotropic distribution of current density is unrelated to the structural properties of the superconducting films, and indicates the emergence of electronic inhomogeneities perceivable over macroscopic distances. Our experiments reveal the ubiquitous nature of this phenomenon in conventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Ground-State Properties of the $t$-$J$ Model for the CuO Double-Chain Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state properties of a correlated model for the double-chain structure in cuprates. We consider the $t$-$J$ model, in which the nearest-neighbor spin interaction $J_1$ is smaller than the next-nearest-neighbor interaction $J_2$ corresponding to the CuO double-chain structure. We vary $J_1$ from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic values and calculate the correlation functions including the superconducting pair correlation function. Employing the density-matrix renormalization group method, we show that the ground state for antiferromagnetic $J_1$ exhibits the hallmarks of the Luther-Emery liquid phase, in which the spin-singlet pair and charge-density-wave correlations exhibit power-law decays against distance, and the spin correlation function decays exponentially. Its signatures are gradually dismissed as $J_1$ approaches the ferromagnetic regime. Our findings suggest that the antiferromagnetic double-chain structure without ferromagnetic bonds is favorable for superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Microwave Signatures of Topological Superconductivity in Planar Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions provide a platform to host topological superconductivity which, through manipulating Majorana bound states (MBS), could enable fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, what constitutes experimental signatures of topological superconductivity and how MBS can be detected remains strongly debated. In addition to spurious effects that mimic MBS, there is a challenge to discern the inherent topological signals in realistic systems with many topologically-trivial Andreev bound states, determining the transport properties of Josephson junctions. Guided by the advances in microwave spectroscopy, we theoretically study Al/InAs-based planar Josephson junction embedded into a radio-frequency superconducting quantum interference device to identify microwave signatures of topological superconductivity. Remarkably, by exploring the closing and reopening of a topological gap, we show that even in a wide planar Josephson junction with many Andreev bound states, such a topological signature is distinguishable in the resonance frequency shift of a microwave drive and the ``half-slope'' feature of the microwave absorption spectrum. Our findings provide an important step towards experimental detection of non-Abelian statistics and implementing scalable topological quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Correlation between optical phonon softening and superconducting $T_c$ in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_x$ within $d$-wave Eliashberg theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical description, based on d-wave Eliashberg theory, of the strong correlation between the experimentally observed softening of Raman modes associated with in-plane oxygen motions and the corresponding superconducting critical temperature $T_c$, as a function of oxygen doping $x$, in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_x$. The theoretical model provides a direct link between physical trends of soft optical $A_g$ (in-plane) oxygen modes, the level of oxygen doping $x$, and the superconducting $T_c$. Different regimes observed in the trend of $T_c$ vs doping can be related to corresponding regimes of optical phonon softening in the Raman spectra. These results provide further evidence related to the physical origin of high-temperature superconductivity in rare-earth cuprate oxides and to the significant role of electron-phonon coupling therein.</description>

      <title>Efficient electronic cooling above 2 K by niobium-based superconducting tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Replacing the bulky cryo-liquid based cooling stages of cryo-enabled instruments by chip scale refrigeration is envisioned to disruptively reduce the system size similarly as microprocessors did for computers. Electronic refrigerators based on superconducting tunnel junctions have been envisioned to provide a solution, but reaching the necessary above 1 kelvin operation temperature range has remained a goal out of reach for several decades. We show efficient electronic refrigeration by Al-AlOx-Nb superconducting tunnel junctions starting from bath temperatures above 2 K. The junctions can deliver electronic cooling power up to $\sim$mW/mm$^2$, which enables us to demonstrate tunnel current driven electron temperature reduction from 2.4 K to below 1.6 K (34% relative cooling) against the phonon bath. Our work shows that the key material of integrated superconducting circuits - niobium - enables powerful cryogenic refrigerator technology. This result is a prerequisite for practical cryogenic chip scale refrigerators and, at the same time, it introduces a new electro-thermal tool for quantum heat transport experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillations in the hole-doped cuprates and the confinement of spinons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A long standing problem in the study of the under-hole-doped cuprates has been the description of the Fermi surfaces underlying the high magnetic field quantum oscillations, and their connection to the higher temperature pseudogap metal. Harrison and Sebastian (arXiv:1103.4181) proposed that the pseudogap `Fermi arcs' are reconstructed into an electron pocket by field-induced charge density wave order. But computations on such a model (Zhang and Mei, arXiv:1411.2098) show an unobserved additional oscillation frequency from a Fermi surface arising from the backsides of the hole pockets completing the Fermi arcs. We describe a transition from a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) model of the pseudogap metal, to a metal with bi-directional charge density wave order without fractionalization. We show that the confinement of the fermionic spinon excitations of the FL* across this transition can eliminate the unobserved oscillation frequency.</description>
