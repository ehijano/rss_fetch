      <title>The inflated, eccentric warm Jupiter TOI-4914 b orbiting a metal-poor star, and the hot Jupiters TOI-2714 b and TOI-2981 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of giant planets have revealed unexpected bulk densities. Hot Jupiters, in particular, appear larger than expected for their masses compared to planetary evolution models, while warm Jupiters seem denser than expected. These differences are often attributed to the influence of the stellar incident flux, but could they also result from different planet formation processes? Is there a trend linking the planetary density to the chemical composition of the host star? In this work we present the confirmation of three giant planets in orbit around solar analogue stars. TOI-2714 b ($P \simeq 2.5$ d, $R_{\rm p} \simeq 1.22 R_{\rm J}$, $M_{\rm p} = 0.72 M_{\rm J}$) and TOI-2981 b ($P \simeq 3.6$ d, $R_{\rm p} \simeq 1.2 R_{\rm J}$, $M_{\rm p} = 2 M_{\rm J}$) are hot Jupiters on nearly circular orbits, while TOI-4914 b ($P \simeq 10.6$ d, $R_{\rm p} \simeq 1.15 R_{\rm J}$, $M_{\rm p} = 0.72 M_{\rm J}$) is a warm Jupiter with a significant eccentricity ($e = 0.41 \pm 0.02$) that orbits a star more metal-poor ([Fe/H]$~= -0.13$) than most of the stars known to host giant planets. Our radial velocity (RV) follow-up with the HARPS spectrograph allows us to detect their Keplerian signals at high significance (7, 30, and 23$\sigma$, respectively) and to place a strong constraint on the eccentricity of TOI-4914 b (18$\sigma$). TOI-4914 b, with its large radius and low insolation flux ($F_\star &lt; 2 \times 10^8~{\rm erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}}$), appears to be more inflated than what is supported by current theoretical models for giant planets. Moreover, it does not conform to the previously noted trend that warm giant planets orbiting metal-poor stars have low eccentricities. This study thus provides insights into the diverse orbital characteristics and formation processes of giant exoplanets, in particular the role of stellar metallicity in the evolution of planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Nightside Clouds on Tidally-locked Terrestrial Planets Mimic Atmosphere-Free Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of nightside cloud formation on the observable night-day contrast of tidally-locked terrestrial planet atmospheres. We demonstrate that, in the case where the planetary dayside is only 10s of Kelvin hotter than the planetary nightside, the presence of optically thick nightside clouds can lead to observations that mimic a planet without an atmosphere, despite the planet actually hosting a significant (10 bar) atmosphere. The scenario presented in this work requires a level of intrinsic atmospheric day/night temperature contrast such that the nightside can form clouds while the dayside is too hot for cloud formation to occur. This scenario is most likely for hotter terrestrials and terrestrials with low volatile inventories. We thus note that a substantial dayside/nightside temperature difference alone does not robustly indicate that a planet does not host an atmosphere and additional observations and modeling are essential for characterization. We further discuss several avenues for future study to improve our understanding of the terrestrial planets and how best to characterize them with JWST.</description>

      <title>JWST COMPASS: The 3-5 Micron Transmission Spectrum of the Super-Earth L 98-59 c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a JWST NIRSpec transmission spectrum of the super-Earth exoplanet L 98-59 c. This small (R$_p=1.385\pm0.085$R$_\oplus$, M$_p=2.22\pm0.26$R$_\oplus$), warm (T$_\textrm{eq}=553$K) planet resides in a multi-planet system around a nearby, bright (J = 7.933) M3V star. We find that the transmission spectrum of L 98-59 c is featureless at the precision of our data. We achieve precisions of 22ppm in NIRSpec G395H's NRS1 detector and 36ppm in the NRS2 detector at a resolution R$\sim$200 (30 pixel wide bins). At this level of precision, we are able rule out primordial H$_2$-He atmospheres across a range of cloud pressure levels up to at least $\sim$0.1mbar. By comparison to atmospheric forward models, we also rule out atmospheric metallicities below $\sim$300$\times$ solar at 3$\sigma$ (or equivalently, atmospheric mean molecular weights below $\sim$10~g/mol). We also rule out pure methane atmospheres. The remaining scenarios that are compatible with our data include a planet with no atmosphere at all, or higher mean-molecular weight atmospheres, such as CO$_2$- or H$_2$O-rich atmospheres. This study adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that planets $\lesssim1.5$R$_\oplus$ lack extended atmospheres.</description>

      <title>How external photoevaporation changes the inner disc's chemical composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars mostly form in clusters where neighboring stars can influence proto-planetary disc evolution. Besides gravitational interactions, external photoevaporation can shape these discs. Depending on the strength of photoevaporation, discs can be destroyed within 1-2 Myrs or more gradually. We use the chemcomp code, incorporating a viscous disc evolution model with pebble drift and evaporation, to calculate the chemical composition of protoplanetary discs. This code is extended to include external photoevaporation based on the FRIED grid. Initially, the disc evolves purely viscously, with the inner disc's C/O ratio decreasing due to inward drifting and evaporating water ice pebbles. Over time, the C/O ratio increases as water vapor accretes onto the star and carbon-rich gas migrates inward. Once external photoevaporation starts, the outer disc disperses, but the inner disc's chemical evolution follows that of a purely viscous disc, as most pebbles have already drifted inward within 1 Myr. At low viscosity, the inner disc's C/O ratio remains sub-solar until dispersion by photoevaporation. At high viscosity, the C/O ratio can reach super-solar values, due to faster accretion of water vapor and inward migration of carbon-rich gas, provided the disc survives a few Myrs. In both cases, there is no significant difference in the inner disc's chemical composition compared to a purely viscous model due to the rapid inward drift of pebbles. Our model predicts that inner disc chemistry should be similar for discs subject to external photoevaporation and isolated discs, consistent with JWST observations.</description>

      <title>Hot Jupiters are asynchronous rotators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters are typically assumed to be synchronously rotating, from tidal locking. Their thermally-driven atmospheric winds experience Lorentz drag on the planetary magnetic field anchored at depth. We find that the magnetic torque does not integrate to zero over the entire atmosphere. The resulting angular momentum feedback on the bulk interior can thus drive the planet away from synchronous rotation. Using a toy tidal-ohmic model and atmospheric GCM outputs for HD189733b, HD209458b and Kepler7b, we establish that off-synchronous rotation can be substantial at tidal-ohmic equilibrium for sufficiently hot and/or magnetized hot Jupiters. Potential consequences of asynchronous rotation for hot Jupiter phenomenology motivate follow-up work on the tidal-ohmic scenario with approaches that go beyond our toy model.</description>

      <title>The secondary classification of unequilibrated chondrites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiplication of decimal petrologic schemes for different or the same chondrite groups evinces a lack of unified guiding principle in the secondary classification of type 1-3 chondrites. We show that the current OC, R and CO classifications can be a posteriori unified, with only minor reclassifications, if the decimal part of the subtype is defined as the ratio $m=Fa_I/Fa_{II}$ of the mean fayalite contents of type I and type II chondrules rounded to the nearest tenth (with adaptations from Cr systematics for the lowest subtypes). This parameter is more efficiently evaluable than the oft-used relative standard deviations of fayalite contents and defines a general metamorphic scale from M0.0 to M1 (where the suffixed number is the rounded $m$). Type 3 chondrites thus span the range M0.0-M0.9 and M1 designates type 4. Corresponding applications are then proposed for other chondrite groups. Known type 1 and 2 chondrites are at M0.0 (i.e. the metamorphic grade of type 3.0 chondrites). Independently, we define an aqueous alteration scale from A0.0 to A1.0, where the suffixed number is the (rounded) phyllosilicate fraction (PSF). For CM and CR chondrites, the subtypes can be characterized in terms of the thin-section-based criteria of previous schemes which are thus incorporated in the present framework. The rounding of the PSF to the (in principle) nearest tenth makes the proposed taxonomy somewhat coarser than those schemes, but hereby more robust and more likely to be generalized in future meteorite declarations. We propose the corresponding petrologic subtype to be 3-PSF, rounded to the nearest tenth (so that type 1 would correspond to subtypes 2.0 and 2.1). At the level of precision chosen, nonzero alteration and metamorphic degrees remain mutually exclusive, so that a single petrologic subtype $\approx$ 3+$m$-PSF indeed remains a good descriptor of secondary processes.</description>

      <title>Transit Timing Variation of K2-237b: Hints Toward Planet Disk Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters should initially form at considerable distances from host stars and subsequently migrate towards inner regions, supported directly by transit timing variation (TTV). We report the TTV of K2-237b, using reproduced timings fitted from \textit{Kepler} K2 and \textit{TESS} data. The timings span from 2016 to 2021, leading to an observational baseline of 5 years. The timing evolution presents a significant bias to a constant period scenario. The model evidence is evaluated utilizing the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which favours the scenario of period decay with a $\Delta$BIC of 14.1. The detected TTV induces a period decay rate ($\dot{P}$) of -1.14$\pm$0.28$\times$10$^{-8}$ days per day ($-$0.36 s/year). Fitting the spectral energy distribution, we find infrared excess at the significance level of 1.5 $\sigma$ for WISE W1 and W2 bands, and 2 $\sigma$ level for W3 and W4 bands. This potentially reveals the existence of a stellar disk, consisting of hot dust at 800$\pm$300 K, showing a $L_{dust}/L_{\ast}$ of 5$\pm$3$\times$10$^{-3}$. We obtain a stellar age of 1.0$^{+1.4}_{-0.7}$$\times$10$^{9}$ yr from isochrone fitting. The properties of K2-237b potentially serve as a direct observational support to the planet disk migration though more observation are needed.</description>

      <title>Impact sculpting of the early martian atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intense bombardment of solar system planets in the immediate aftermath of protoplanetary disk dissipation has played a key role in their atmospheric evolution. During this epoch, energetic collisions will have removed significant masses of gas from rocky planet atmospheres. Noble gases are powerful tracers of this early atmospheric history, xenon in particular, which on Mars and Earth shows significant depletions and isotopic fractionations relative to the lighter noble gasses. To evaluate the effect of impacts on the loss and fractionation of xenon, we measure its ionization and recombination efficiency by laser shock and apply these constraints to model impact-driven atmospheric escape on Mars. We demonstrate that impact bombardment within the first $200$ to $300\,\text{Myr}$ of solar system history generates the observed Xe depletion and isotope fractionation of the modern martian atmosphere. This process may also explain the Xe depletion recorded in Earth's deep mantle and provides a latest date for the timing of giant planet instability.</description>

      <title>Vertical Shear Instability with Partially Reflecting Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vertical shear instability (VSI) is widely believed to be effective in driving turbulence in protoplanetary disks. Prior studies on VSI exclusively exploit the reflecting boundary conditions (BCs) at the disk surfaces. VSI depends critically on the boundary behaviors of waves at the disk surfaces. We extend earlier studies by performing a comprehensive numerical analysis of VSI with partially reflecting BCs for both the axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric unstable VSI modes. We find that the growth rates of the unstable modes diminish when the outgoing component of the flow is greater than the incoming one for high-order body modes. When the outgoing wave component dominates, the growth of VSI is notably suppressed. We find that the non-axisymmetric modes are unstable and they grow at a rate that decreases with the azimuthal wavenumber. The different BCs at the lower and upper disk surfaces naturally lead to non-symmetric modes relative to the disk midplane. The potential implications of our studies for further understanding planetary formation and evolution in protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>HD 222237 b: a long period super-Jupiter around a nearby star revealed by radial-velocity and Hipparcos-Gaia astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant planets on long period orbits around the nearest stars are among the easiest to directly image. Unfortunately these planets are difficult to fully constrain by indirect methods, e.g., transit and radial velocity (RV). In this study, we present the discovery of a super-Jupiter, HD 222237 b, orbiting a star located $11.445\pm0.002$ pc away. By combining RV data, Hipparcos and multi-epoch Gaia astrometry, we estimate the planetary mass to be ${5.19}_{-0.58}^{+0.58}\,M_{\rm Jup}$, with an eccentricity of ${0.56}_{-0.03}^{+0.03}$ and a period of ${40.8}_{-4.5}^{+5.8}$ yr, making HD 222237 b a promising target for imaging using the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) of JWST. A comparative analysis suggests that our method can break the inclination degeneracy and thus differentiate between prograde and retrograde orbits of a companion. We further find that the inferred contrast ratio between the planet and the host star in the F1550C filter ($15.50\,\mu \rm m$) is approximately $1.9\times10^{-4}$, which is comparable with the measured limit of the MIRI coronagraphs. The relatively low metallicity of the host star ($\rm-0.32\,dex$) combined with the unique orbital architecture of this system presents an excellent opportunity to probe the planet-metallicity correlation and the formation scenarios of giant planets.</description>

      <title>JWST ice band profiles reveal mixed ice compositions in the HH 48 NE disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet formation is strongly influenced by the composition and distribution of volatiles within protoplanetary disks. With JWST, it is now possible to obtain direct observational constraints on disk ices, as recently demonstrated by the detection of ice absorption features towards the edge-on HH 48 NE disk as part of the Ice Age Early Release Science program. Here, we introduce a new radiative transfer modeling framework designed to retrieve the composition and mixing status of disk ices using their band profiles, and apply it to interpret the H2O, CO2, and CO ice bands observed towards the HH 48 NE disk. We show that the ices are largely present as mixtures, with strong evidence for CO trapping in both H2O and CO2 ice. The HH 48 NE disk ice composition (pure vs. polar vs. apolar fractions) is markedly different from earlier protostellar stages, implying thermal and/or chemical reprocessing during the formation or evolution of the disk. We infer low ice-phase C/O ratios around 0.1 throughout the disk, and also demonstrate that the mixing and entrapment of disk ices can dramatically affect the radial dependence of the C/O ratio. It is therefore imperative that realistic disk ice compositions are considered when comparing planetary compositions with potential formation scenarios, which will fortunately be possible for an increasing number of disks with JWST.</description>

      <title>Coma composition and profiles of comet 12P/Pons-Brooks using long-slit spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comet 12P/Pons-Brook exhibited multiple large and minor outbursts in 2023 on its way to its 2024 perihelion, as it has done during its previous apparitions. We obtained long-slit optical spectra of the comet in 2023 August and 2023 November with the INT-IDS, and in 2023 December with NOT-ALFOSC. Using a standard Haser model in a 10000km-radius aperture and commonly used empirical parent and daughter scale-lengths, our calculated abundance ratios show a constant "typical" composition throughout the period with a C$_2$/CN ratio of about 90 per cent. Molecular density profiles of different species along the slit show asymmetries between opposite sides of the coma and that C$_2$ seems to behave differently than CN and C$_3$. Comparing the coma profiles to a standard Haser model shows that this model cannot accurately reproduce the shape of the coma, and therefore that the calculated production rates cannot be deemed as accurate. We show that an outburst Haser model is a {slightly} better match to the C$_3$ and CN profile shapes, but the model still does not explain the shape of the C$_2$ profiles and requires equal parent and daughter scale-lengths. Our results suggest that the coma morphology could be better explained by extended sources, and that the nature of 12P's activity introduces bias in the determination of its composition.</description>

      <title>The Retrieved Atmospheric Properties of the Sub-stellar Object VHS 1256 b from Analyzing HST, VLT and JWST Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the observed ~30% variations in flux from the L7 dwarf VHS 1256 b, we subjected its time-resolved Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 spectra (measured in two epochs in 2018 and 2020), as well as medium-resolution Very Large Telescope (VLT) X-shooter and Early Release Science James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) spectra to a suite of both standard Bayesian (nested sampling) and machine-learning (random forest) retrievals. We find that both HST and VLT data require vertically varying abundance profiles of water in order to model the spectra accurately. Despite the large flux variations observed in the HST data, the temporal variability cannot be attributed to a single varying atmospheric property. The retrieved atmospheric quantities are consistent with being invariant across time. However, we find that model grids provide generally poor fits to the measured HST spectra and are unsuitable for quantifying the temporal variability of atmospheric properties. Additionally, our analysis of JWST spectra using model grids indicates consistency in retrieved properties across different wavelength channels. Despite the temporal variability in flux, the retrieved properties between HST and VLT, as well as between HST and JWST, are consistent within the respective posterior uncertainties. Such an outcome bodes well for future retrieval analyses of exoplanetary atmospheres, which are expected to exhibit weaker flux variations.</description>

      <title>Confirming the Tidal Tails of the Young Open Cluster Blanco 1 with TESS Rotation Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blanco 1 is an $\approx 130\,\mathrm{Myr}$ open cluster located 240 pc from the Sun below the Galactic plane. Recent studies have reported the existence of diffuse tidal tails extending 50-60 pc from the cluster center based on the positions and velocities measured by Gaia. To independently assess the reality and extent of this structure, we used light curves generated from TESS full-frame images to search for photometric rotation periods of stars in and around Blanco 1. We detected rotation periods down to a stellar effective temperature of $\approx 3100\,\mathrm{K}$ in 347 of the 603 cluster member candidates for which we have light curves. For cluster members in the core and candidate members in the tidal tails, both within a temperature range of 4400 to 6200 K, 74% and 72% of the rotation periods are consistent with the single-star gyrochronological sequence, respectively. In contrast, a comparison sample of field stars yielded gyrochrone-consistent rotation periods for only 8.5% of stars. The tidal tail candidates' overall conformance to the core members' gyrochrone sequence implies that their contamination ratio is consistent with zero and &lt; 0.33 at the $2\sigma$ level. This result confirms the existence of Blanco 1 tidal tails and doubles the number of Blanco 1 members for which there are both spatio-kinematic and rotation-based cluster membership verification. Extending the strategy of using TESS light curves for gyrochronology to other nearby young open clusters and stellar associations may provide a viable strategy for mapping out their dissolution and broadening the search for young exoplanets.</description>

      <title>RISTRETTO: a VLT XAO design to reach Proxima Cen b in the visible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RISTRETTO is the evolution of the original idea of coupling the VLT instruments SPHERE and ESPRESSO \cite{lovis_2016a}, aiming at High Dispersion Coronagraphy. RISTRETTO is a visitor instrument that should enable the characterization of the atmospheres of nearby exoplanets in reflected light, by using the technique of high-contrast, high-resolution spectroscopy. Its goal is to observe Prox Cen b and other planets placed at about 35mas from their star, i.e. $2\lambda/D$ at $\lambda$=750nm. The instrument is composed of an extreme adaptive optics, a coronagraphic Integral Field Unit, and a diffraction-limited spectrograph (R=140.000, $\lambda =$620-840 nm).
  We present the RISTRETTO XAO architecture that reach the specification, providing contrasts down to $5\times10^{-5}$ at 2$\lambda/D$ from the star in the visible, in the presence of atmosphere and low wind effect. This performance is allowed by a new two-sensors-one-dm architecture, some variations to the already known concepts of unmodulated pyWFS and zWFS, and exploiting to the maximum of their capabilities the state-of-the-art high speed, low noise cameras \&amp; fast DM. We present the result of end-to-end simulations, that demonstrate stable closed loop operation of an unmodulated pyramid and a zernike WFS (together), and in presence of low wind effect.</description>

      <title>The April 2023 SYM-H = -233 nT Geomagnetic Storm: A Classical Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 23-24 April 2023 double-peak (SYM-H intensities of -179 and -233 nT) intense geomagnetic storm was caused by interplanetary magnetic field southward component Bs associated with an interplanetary fast-forward shock-preceded sheath (Bs of 25 nT), followed by a magnetic cloud (MC) (Bs of 33 nT), respectively. At the center of the MC, the plasma density exhibited an order of magnitude decrease, leading to a sub-Alfvenic solar wind interval for ~2.1 hr. Ionospheric Joule heating accounted for a significant part (~81%) of the magnetospheric energy dissipation during the storm main phase. Equal amount of Joule heating in the dayside and nightside ionosphere is consistent with the observed intense and global-scale DP2 (disturbance polar) currents during the storm main phase. The sub-Alfvenic solar wind is associated with disappearance of substorms, a sharp decrease in Joule heating dissipation, and reduction in electromagnetic ion cyclotron wave amplitude. The shock/sheath compression of the magnetosphere led to relativistic electron flux losses in the outer radiation belt between L* = 3.5 and 5.5. Relativistic electron flux enhancements were detected in the lower L* &lt; 3.5 region during the storm main and recovery phases. Equatorial ionospheric plasma anomaly structures are found to be modulated by the prompt penetration electric fields. Around the anomaly crests, plasma density at ~470 km altitude and altitude-integrated ionospheric total electron content are found to increase by ~60% and ~80%, with ~33% and ~67% increases in their latitudinal extents compared to their quiet-time values, respectively.</description>
