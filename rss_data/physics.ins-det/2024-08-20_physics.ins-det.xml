      <title>Progress of Inorganic Scintillators for Future HEP Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Caltech HEP Crystal Lab has been actively investigating novel inorganic scintillators along the following three directions. Fast and radiation hard inorganic scintillators to face the challenge of severe radiation environment expected by future HEP experiments at hadron colliders, such as the high luminosity LHC and FCC hh. Ultrafast inorganic scintillators to face the challenge of unprecedented event rate expected by future HEP experiments searching for rare decays, such as Mu2e II, and ultrafast time of flight system at hadron colliders. Cost effective inorganic scintillators for the homogeneous hadron calorimeter concept to face the challenge of both electromagnetic and jet mass resolutions required by the proposed Higgs factory. We report novel materials along all directions: LuAG:Ce ceramic fibers for the HL LHC, Lu2O3:Yb ceramic scintillators for ultrafast applications, and ABS:Ce and DSB:Ce glass scintillators for the proposed Higgs factory. The result of this investigation may also benefit nuclear physics experiments, GHz hard X ray imaging, medical imaging, and homeland security applications.</description>

      <title>Low-vibration cryogenic test facility for next generation of ground-based gravitational-wave observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and commissioning of a cryogenic low-vibration test facility that measures displacement noise from a gram-scale silicon cantilever at the level of 10$^{-16}\, \mathrm{m/\sqrt{Hz}}$ at 1kHz. A volume of $\sim$36 litres is enclosed by radiation shields cooling an optical test cavity that is suspended from a multi-stage pendulum chain providing isolation from acoustic and environmental noise. This 3kg test cavity housing a crystalline silicon cantilever is radiatively cooled to 123K in 41 hours and held at that temperature over many months with a relative temperature stability of $\pm$1mK. The facility is capable of interferometrically measuring temperature-dependent broadband displacement noise between 50Hz and 10kHz where current and future ground-based gravitational wave observatories are most sensitive. With suitable cantilever design, the cryogenic facility we describe here will allow for the measurement of broadband thermal noise in crystalline silicon at 123K. This will guide the design of suspensions in planned future cryogenic ground-based gravitational-wave detectors such as LIGO Voyager and the Einstein Telescope. This facility is also suitable for the testing of new mirror coatings at cryogenic temperatures.</description>

      <title>Scalable DAQ system operating the CHIPS-5 neutrino detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CHIPS R&amp;D project focuses on development of low-cost water Cherenkov neutrino detectors through novel design strategies and resourceful engineering. This work presents an end-to-end DAQ solution intended for a recent 5 kt CHIPS prototype, which is largely based on affordable mass-produced components. Much like the detector itself, the presented instrumentation is composed of modular arrays that can be scaled up and easily serviced. A single such array can carry up to 30 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) accompanied by electronics that generate high voltage in-situ and deliver time resolution of up to 0.69 ns. In addition, the technology is compatible with the White Rabbit timing system, which can synchronize its elements to within 100 ps. While deployment issues did not permit the presented DAQ system to operate beyond initial evaluation, the presented hardware and software successfully passed numerous commissioning tests that demonstrated their viability for use in a large-scale neutrino detector, instrumented with thousands of PMTs.</description>

      <title>Full Detector Simulation of a Projective Dual-Readout Segmented Crystal Electromagnetic Calorimeter with Precision Timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A full detector simulation for projective, segmented geometries has been implemented in the key4hep software stack for future colliders. Calculations are presented for a fully parameterized geometry construction routine based on only a few input dimensions. Custom sensitive detector actions, filters, and data readout classes for dual-readout are implemented and their effects on optical photons in full detector simulation are studied for the first time. New sources of uncorrelated handles for AI/ML reconstruction algorithms are presented. A lightweight, portable custom event display using a JavaScript-based plotting library is implemented and run in a python notebook.</description>

      <title>Beam-induced backgrounds measured in the ATLAS detector during local gas injection into the LHC beam vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inelastic beam-gas collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), within a few hundred metres of the ATLAS experiment, are known to give the dominant contribution to beam backgrounds. These are monitored by ATLAS with a dedicated Beam Conditions Monitor (BCM) and with the rate of fake jets in the calorimeters. These two methods are complementary since the BCM probes backgrounds just around the beam pipe while fake jets are observed at radii of up to several metres. In order to quantify the correlation between the residual gas density in the LHC beam vacuum and the experimental backgrounds recorded by ATLAS, several dedicated tests were performed during LHC Run 2. Local pressure bumps, with a gas density several orders of magnitude higher than during normal operation, were introduced at different locations. The changes of beam-related backgrounds, seen in ATLAS, are correlated with the local pressure variation. In addition the rates of beam-gas events are estimated from the pressure measurements and pressure bump profiles obtained from calculations. Using these rates, the efficiency of the ATLAS beam background monitors to detect beam-gas events is derived as a function of distance from the interaction point. These efficiencies and characteristic distributions of fake jets from the beam backgrounds are found to be in good agreement with results of beam-gas simulations performed with the FLUKA Monte Carlo programme.</description>

      <title>Optical and Raman spectroscopies of 171Yb3+:Y2SiO5 hyperfine structure for application toward microwave-to-optical transducer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10277v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study analyzed the optical techniques for high resolution, low-noise spectroscopy of a hyperfine structure (HFS) made of ytterbium-isotope 171 ions ($^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$:$\mathrm{Y}_2\mathrm{SiO}_5$). Large energy spacings in $^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ are advantageous for spin-state preparations of quantum memory and construction of a transducer, thereby promoting the simultaneous stable control of the optical frequencies of lasers over a wide range of 3 GHz. We also built our own 2.7-K cryogenic system for optical, radio-wave-assisted spectroscopy. We attained to high resolution and sensitivity both in pump-probe saturation spectroscopy (PPS) and Raman heterodyne spectroscopy (RHS). Our frequency-stabilized PPS achieved a high-resolution spectrum of the HFS, whereas our setup of RHS enabled the efficient detection of paramagnetic spin resonance efficiently for a wide range of radio frequencies. As the underlying Raman process is an up-converting transduction, we present the optimization of the sensitivity of Raman heterodyne detections by selecting the best crystal orientation and efficient radio-wave coupling in future applications toward photon transducers.</description>

      <title>Latest activities and results from T2K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The T2K neutrino oscillation experiment has gone through a period of renewal over the last couple of years, with several upgrades designed to improve sensitivity to leptonic CP violation. The change that most affects future analyses is the ND280 upgrade, which will constrain interaction models in new ways. At the same time the analysis continues to be developed, both by combining with the Super-Kamiokande atmospheric measurements and with refinements to the T2K-only analysis. This proceedings describes the highlights of these analyses, and the status of the various T2K upgrades.</description>
