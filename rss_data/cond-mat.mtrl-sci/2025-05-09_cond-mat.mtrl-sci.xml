      <title>Advancing Antiferromagnetic Nitrides via Metal Alloy Nitridation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitride materials, valued for their structural stability and exceptional physical properties, have garnered significant interest in both fundamental research and technological applications. The fabrication of high-quality nitride thin films is essential for advancing their use in microelectronics and spintronics. Yet, achieving single-crystal nitride thin films with excellent structural integrity remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a straightforward yet innovative metallic alloy nitridation technique for the synthesis of stable single-crystal nitride thin films. By subjecting metal alloy thin films to a controlled nitridation process, nitrogen atoms integrate into the lattice, driving structural transformations while preserving high epitaxial quality. Combining nanoscale magnetic imaging with a diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) probe, X-ray magnetic linear dichroism, and comprehensive transport measurements, we confirm that the nitridated films exhibit a robust antiferromagnetic character with a zero net magnetic moment. This work not only provides a refined and reproducible strategy for the fabrication of nitride thin films but also lays a robust foundation for exploring their burgeoning device applications.</description>

      <title>$\Delta$SCF in \texttt{VASP} for excited-state defect computations: tips and pitfalls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\Delta$SCF with constrained occupations have been wildly used to investigate the excited-state and optical properties of defects. Recent studies have demonstrated that combining $\Delta$SCF with hybrid functionals yields good accuracy in predicting defect properties. The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (\texttt{VASP}) is one of the most widely used quantum mechanical packages based on plane-wave methods. Despite the increasing application of $\Delta$SCF as implemented in \texttt{VASP} for defect studies, detailed walkthroughs explaining how to conduct these calculations remain limited, making this approach a nontrivial task. Applying $\Delta$SCF with hybrid functionals can present convergence challenges; worse, it may sometimes converge to incorrect excited states and can go largely unnoticed. This document aims to serve as a concise guide outlining what we think might be the appropriate approach for performing $\Delta$SCF calculations in \texttt{VASP}. We benchmark this method by simulating excited states for a particularly challenging system: the neutral charge state of the silicon vacancy (SiV$^0$) defect in diamond. By highlighting potential pitfalls, we hope this document encourages further discussion within the community and assists researchers experiencing difficulties with this technique. The guidelines provided here are largely based on private discussions with Oscar Bulancea Lindvall from Link{\"o}ping University and Chris Ciccarino from Stanford University.</description>

      <title>HOP-graphene: A high-capacity anode for Li/Na-ion batteries unveiled by first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for efficient energy storage has driven the search for advanced anode materials for lithium- and sodium-ion batteries (LIBs and SIBs). In this context, we report the application of HOP-graphene (a 5-6-8-membered 2D carbon framework) as a high-performance anode material for LIBs and SIBs using density functional theory simulations. Diffusion studies reveal low energy barriers of 0.70 eV for Li and 0.39 eV for Na, indicating superior mobility at room temperature compared to other carbon allotropes, like graphite. Full lithiation and sodiation accommodate 24 Li and 22 Na atoms, respectively, delivering outstanding theoretical capacities of 1338 mAh/g (Li) and 1227 mAh/g (Na). Bader charge analysis and charge density difference maps confirm substantial electron transfer from the alkali metals to the substrate. Average open-circuit voltages of 0.42 V (Li) and 0.33 V (Na) suggest favorable electrochemical performance. HOP-graphene also demonstrates excellent mechanical strength. These findings position HOP-graphene as a promising candidate for next-generation LIB and SIB anodes.</description>

      <title>Athos-Graphene: Computational Discovery of an Art-Inspired 2D Carbon Anode for Lithium-Ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotropes have attracted growing interest for their structural versatility and potential in energy storage and nanoelectronics. We propose Athos-Graphene (AG), a novel 2D carbon allotrope inspired by the geometric patterns of Brazilian artist Athos Bulc\~ao. Designed using density functional theory, AG features a periodic structure with high thermodynamic and thermal stability, as evidenced by a low cohesive energy of -7.96 eV/atom, the absence of imaginary phonon modes, and robust performance in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations up to 1000 K. It exhibits anisotropic mechanical properties, with Young's modulus values of 585 GPa and 600 GPa along the x- and y-directions, and Poisson's ratios of 0.19 and 0.17, respectively. Electronic structure analyses confirm its metallic behavior, while optical studies reveal anisotropic absorption in the visible and UV regions. For lithium-ion storage, Athos-Graphene shows strong Li adsorption (-2.3 to -1.0 eV), a high theoretical capacity of 836.78 mAh/g, and a low average open-circuit voltage of 0.54 V. Lithium diffusion barriers are as low as 0.3 eV on the surface and 0.66 eV between layers, with a high diffusion coefficient greater than 6x10^-6 cm^2/s. These features highlight AG as a promising anode material for high-performance lithium-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>Accurate Prediction of Sequential Tensor Properties Using Equivariant Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical spectra serve as a powerful tool for probing the interactions between materials and light, unveiling complex electronic structures such as flat bands and nontrivial topological features. These insights are crucial for the development and optimization of photonic devices, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors, where understanding the electronic structure directly impacts device performance. Moreover, in anisotropic bulk materials, the optical responses are direction-dependent, and predicting those response tensors still remains computationally demanding due to its inherent complexity and the constraint from crystal symmetry. To address this challenge, we introduce the sequential tensorial properties equivariant neural network (StepENN), a graph neural network architecture that maps crystal structures directly to their full optical tensors across different photon frequencies. By encoding the isotropic sequential scalar components and anisotropic sequential tensor components into l=0 and l=2 spherical tensor components, StepENN ensures symmetry-aware sequential tensor predictions that are consistent with the inherent symmetry constraints of crystal systems. Trained on a dataset of frequency-dependent permittivity tensors for 1,432 bulk semiconductors computed from first-principles methods, our model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 24.216 millifarads per meter (mF/m) on the predicted tensorial spectra with 85.7% of its predictions exhibiting less than 10% relative error, demonstrating its potential for deriving other spectrum-related properties, such as optical conductivity. This framework opens new avenues for the data-driven design of materials with engineered anisotropic optical responses, accelerating material advances in optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Improvement of spontaneous orientation polarization by multiple introductions of fluoroalkyl groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous orientation polarization (SOP) of polar molecules is formed in vacuum-deposited films. SOP is driven by asymmetric intermolecular interactions; however, the design of polar molecules for the improvement of dipole orientation is limited. In this study, we developed SOP molecules with high structural asymmetry by introducing multiple fluoroalkyl groups into a polar molecule. The developed polar molecules exhibited high dipole orientation degrees in vacuum-deposited films and achieved a high surface potential growth rate relative to the film thickness, over -350 mV nm-1, which is a record high for the reported compounds. The developed dipolar films can be used to generate rectification properties for the charge transport of organic films. The findings of this study provide methodologies for the formation of highly anisotropic glassy films, leading to improved performance of organic devices.</description>

      <title>Giant Tunneling Magnetoresistance in Graphene/$h$-BN Based van der Waals Magnetic Tunnel Junctions via 3$d$ Transition Metal Intercalation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic intercalation offers a powerful route for engineering two-dimensional (2D) materials by precisely tuning interlayer electronic coupling and spin configurations. Here, we propose a generic strategy for the construction of fully 2D magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) based on transition metal-intercalated graphene electrodes with $h$-BN barrier layer. First-principles calculations reveal that intercalation not only stabilizes uniform atomic dispersion via steric hindrance but also induces robust ferromagnetism in graphene. Manganese- and vanadium-intercalated systems (Mn-Gr and V-Gr) exhibit exceptional spintronic performance, with tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) showing a pronounced odd-even oscillation as a function of barrier thickness. A giant TMR of $4.35 \times 10^8\,\%$ is achieved in the Mn-Gr system with a monolayer barrier $h$ -BN ($n=1$), while V-Gr reaches a maximum TMR of $1.86 \times 10^5\,\%$ for a trilayer barrier ($n=3$). Moreover, biaxial strain further enhances the TMR to $10^9\,\%$ and $10^7\,\%$ in Mn-Gr and V-Gr systems, respectively. The devices also exhibit perfect spin filtering and pronounced negative differential resistance, offering new opportunities for high-performance spintronic and memory applications based on 2D van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Tailoring composite skyrmionic spin textures in an above-room-temperature ferromagnet Fe3-xGaTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing room-temperature tunable skyrmionic objects in van der Waals ferromagnet offers unparalleled prospects for future spintronics. Here, we report an experimental investigation on the emergence and evolution of skyrmionic spin textures in the non-stoichiometric Fe3-xGaTe2 using magnetic force microscopy. The iron-deficiency-specific magnetic states of stripe, striped skyrmionium and striped skyrmion sack are observed. Through zero-field-cooling and field-cooling measurements, we observed distinct topological transitions and trivial transitions (distinguished by changes in topological charge) emerging during the stepwise evolution of topological spin textures, which enabled us to develop an evolution pathway model. Leveraging this model, the room-temperature stable composite topological spin textures of skyrmionium, skyrmion bag and sack states are further controllably realized via the exclusive topological-transition path (regulated by magnetic field and DMI intensity). Our work provides valuable insights into the room-temperature realization of topological spin textures in Fe3-xGaTe2, and inspires further exploration of their potential applications in heterostructure spintronics.</description>

      <title>Novel structures of Gallenene intercalated in epitaxial Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The creation of atomically thin layers of non-exfoliable materials remains a crucial challenge, requiring the development of innovative techniques. Here, confinement epitaxy is exploited to realize two-dimensional gallium via intercalation in epitaxial graphene grown on silicon carbide. Novel superstructures arising from the interaction of gallenene (a monolayer of gallium) with graphene and the silicon carbide substrate are investigated. The coexistence of different gallenene phases, including b010-gallenene and the elusive high-pressure Ga(III) phase, is identified. This work sheds new light on the formation of two-dimensional gallium and provides a platform for investigating the exotic electronic and optical properties of confined gallenene.</description>

      <title>Peak Broadening in Photoelectron Spectroscopy of Amorphous Polymers: the Leading Role of the Electrostatic Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The broadening in photoelectron spectra of polymers can be attributed to several factors, such as light source spread, spectrometer resolution, finite lifetime of the hole state, and solid-state effects. Here, for the first time, we set up a computational protocol to assess the peak broadening induced for both core and valence levels by solid-state effects in four amorphous polymers by using a combination of density functional theory, many-body perturbation theory, and classical polarizable embedding. We show that intrinsic local inhomogeneities in the electrostatic environment induce a Gaussian broadening of $0.2$-$0.7$~eV in the binding energies of both core and semi-valence electrons, corresponding to a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $0.5$-$1.7$~eV for the investigated systems. The induced broadening is larger in acrylate- than in styrene- based polymers, revealing the crucial role of polar groups in controlling the roughness of the electrostatic landscape in the solid matrix.</description>

      <title>Probing orbital magnetism of a kagome metal CsV3Sb5 by a tuning fork resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits a complex phase diagram that encompasses frustrated magnetism, topological charge density wave (CDW), and superconductivity. One CDW state that breaks time-reversal symmetry was proposed in this compound, while the exact nature of the putative magnetic state remains elusive. To examine the thermodynamic state of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and assess the character of the associated magnetism, we conducted tuning fork resonator measurements of magnetotropic susceptibility over a broad range of angles, magnetic fields, and temperature. We found a cascade of phase transition in the CDW phase. Of particular interest is a highly anisotropic magnetic structure that arises below about 30~K, with a magnetic moment along the $c$-axis that has an extremely small magnitude. This magnetic state demonstrates extremely slow dynamics and small saturate field, all suggest that electronic phase below 30~K breaks time reversal symmetry and has an unconventional origin.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Skyrmions in 2D Lattices Exhibiting Anisotropic Skyrmion Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic skyrmion Hall effect (A-SkHE) in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic systems represents a captivating phenomenon in condensed-matter physics and materials science. While conventional antiferromagnetic systems inherently suppress this effect through parity-time symmetry-mediated cancellation of Magnus forces acting on skyrmions, A-SkHE is primarily confined to ferromagnetic platforms. Here, we present a paradigm-shifting demonstration of this phenomenon in spin-splitting 2D antiferromagnets through the investigation of altermagnetic skyrmions. Combining comprehensive symmetry analysis with theoretical modeling, we elucidate the mechanism governing A-SkHE realization in 2D altermagnetic systems and establish a quantitative relationship between the transverse velocity of altermagnetic skyrmions and applied current orientation. Using first-principles calculations and micromagnetic simulations, this mechanism is further illustrated in a prototypical altermagnetic monolayer V2SeTeO. Crucially, we identify that the [C2C4zt] symmetry-protected anisotropic field serves as the critical stabilizer for maintaining the A-SkHE in this system. Our results greatly enrich the research on 2D altermagnetism and skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Polymorphic spin ordering in a single-crystalline cobalt-doped Fe3GaTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A single crystalline system typically stabilizes a unique state for spin ordering below a critical temperature. Certain materials exhibit multiple magnetic states, driven by structural phase transitions under varying thermodynamic conditions. Recently, van der Waals magnets have demonstrated subtle interlayer exchange interactions, offering a promising approach to electrically control spin states without structural transformation. Here, we report the emergence of three distinct magnetic states, ferromagnetic ordering and both collinear and non-collinear antiferromagnetic orderings, in a layered single crystalline magnet, cobalt-doped Fe3GaTe2 ((Co, Fe)3GaTe2). These three magnetic phases occur without structural phase transitions, a phenomenon we designate as polymorphic spin ordering in the material. The introduction of 16% Co-doping in Fe3GaTe2 modulates the interlayer magnetic interaction, enabling multiple spin orderings within the same lattice system with three critical temperatures: a Curie temperature for a ferromagnetic state (Tc=210 K) and two Neel temperatures for the collinear (TN1=110 K) and non-collinear (TN2=30 K) antiferromagnetic states. Our findings are supported by magnetic force microscopy, first-principles calculations, and circular dichroism angular photoemission spectroscopy, which reveals varying spin ordering and changes in the topological band structure and Berry curvature at different temperatures within the single-crystalline (Co, Fe)3GaTe2.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-enabled atomistic insights into phase boundary engineering of solid-solution ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic control of phase boundaries is crucial for optimizing the functional properties of solid-solution ferroelectrics, yet their microstructural mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we harness machine-learning-driven molecular dynamics to resolve the phase boundary behavior in the KNbO3-KTaO3 (KNTO) system. Our simulations reveal that chemical composition and ordering enable precise modulation of polymorphic phase boundaries (PPBs), offering a versatile pathway for materials engineering. Diffused PPBs and polar nano regions, predicted by our model, highly match with experiments, underscoring the fidelity of the machine-learning atomistic simulation. Crucially, we identify elastic and electrostatic mismatches between ferroelectric KNbO3 and paraelectric KTaO3 as the driving forces behind complex microstructural evolution. This work not only resolves the longstanding microstructural debate but also establishes a generalizable framework for phase boundary engineering toward next-generation high-performance ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Strong tunability of epitaxial relationship and reconstruction at improper ferroelectric interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atomic structures at epitaxial film-substrate interfaces determine scalability of thin films and can result in new phenomena. However, it is challenging to control the interfacial structures since they are decided by the most stable atomic bonding. In this work, we report strong tunability of the epitaxial interface of improper ferroelectric hexagonal ferrites deposited on spinel ferrites. The selection of two interface types, related by a 90 deg rotation of in-plane epitaxial relations and featured by disordered and hybridized reconstructions respectively, can be achieved by growth conditions, stacking sequences, and spinel compositions. While the disordered type suppresses the primary K3 structure distortion and ferroelectricity in hexagonal ferrites, the hybridized type is more coherent with the distortion with minimal suppression. This tunable interfacial structure provides critical insight on controlling interfacial clamping and may offer a solution for the long-standing problem of practical critical thickness in improper ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Electronic and Optical Properties of the Recently Synthesized 2D Vivianites (Vivianenes): Insights from First-Principles Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vivianite (Fe$_3$(PO$_4$)$_2$8H$_2$O) is a naturally occurring layered material with significant environmental and technological relevance. This work presents a comprehensive theoretical investigation of its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart, Vivianene, focusing on its structural, electronic, and optical properties. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, we evaluate its thermodynamic stability, band structure, density of states, and optical response. Our results confirm that Vivianene retains the main structural features of bulk Vivianite while exhibiting enhanced thermodynamic stability at room temperature. The electronic structure analysis reveals an indirect bandgap of 3.03 eV for Vivianene, which is slightly lower than the 3.21 eV observed for bulk Vivianite, deviating from the expected quantum confinement trend in 2D materials. The projected density of states (PDOS) analysis indicates that Fe d orbitals predominantly contribute to the valence and conduction bands. Optical calculations demonstrate that Vivianene exhibits a higher optical band gap (3.6 eV) than bulk Vivianite (3.2 eV), with significant absorption in the ultraviolet region. The refractive index and reflectivity analyses suggest that most of the incident light is absorbed rather than reflected, reinforcing its potential for optoelectronic applications. These findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental properties of Vivianene and highlight its potential for advanced applications in sensing, optoelectronics, and energy-related technologies.</description>

      <title>Polaritonic Quantum Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polaritons are quantum mechanical superpositions of photon states with elementary excitations in molecules and solids. The light-matter admixture causes a characteristic frequency-momentum dispersion shared by all polaritons irrespective of the microscopic nature of material excitations that could entail charge, spin, lattice or orbital effects. Polaritons retain the strong nonlinearities of their matter component and simultaneously inherit ray-like propagation of light. Polaritons prompt new properties, enable new opportunities for spectroscopy/imaging, empower quantum simulations and give rise to new forms of synthetic quantum matter. Here, we review the emergent effects rooted in polaritonic quasiparticles in a wide variety of their physical implementations. We present a broad portfolio of the physical platforms and phenomena of what we term polaritonic quantum matter. We discuss the unifying aspects of polaritons across different platforms and physical implementations and focus on recent developments in: polaritonic imaging, cavity electrodynamics and cavity materials engineering, topology and nonlinearities, as well as quantum polaritonics.</description>

      <title>Type-III Weyl Semi-Half-Metal in an Ultralight Monolayer Li$_2$N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between magnetic ordering and band topology has emerged as a fertile ground for discovering novel quantum states with profound implications for fundamental physics and next-generation electronics. Here, we theoretically predict a new type-III Weyl semi-half-metal (SHM) state in monolayer Li$_2$N, uniquely combining magnetic half-metallicity and type-III Weyl semimetal characteristics. First-principles calculations reveal a fully spin-polarized and critically tilted Weyl cone around the Fermi level in monolayer Li$_2$N, driven by $p$-orbital ferromagnetism. This arises from the symmetry-protected band crossing between a flat valence band and a highly dispersive conduction band, leading to type-III Weyl fermions with strong transport anisotropy. A low-energy $k{\cdot}p$ Hamiltonian is constructed and corresponding nontrivial edge states are uncovered to capture the topological nature of Li$_2$N. Notably, this Weyl SHM phase remains robust under biaxial strain ranging from -2$\%$ to $4\%$, with an ideal type-III Weyl fermion emerging alongside a line-like ergodic surface emerging at 3.7$\%$ strain, offering a promising platform for exploring correlated electronic phenomena. Our results establish Li$_2$N as a viable candidate for realizing exotic type-III Weyl SHM states and open a new avenue for exploring the intricate interplay among magnetism, topology, and flat-band physics.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity Grain Growth Modeling: Leveraging Deep Learning for Fast Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain growth simulation is crucial for predicting metallic material microstructure evolution during annealing and resulting final mechanical properties, but traditional partial differential equation-based methods are computationally expensive, creating bottlenecks in materials design and manufacturing. In this work, we introduce a machine learning framework that combines a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory networks with an Autoencoder to efficiently predict grain growth evolution. Our approach captures both spatial and temporal aspects of grain evolution while encoding high-dimensional grain structure data into a compact latent space for pattern learning, enhanced by a novel composite loss function combining Mean Squared Error, Structural Similarity Index Measurement, and Boundary Preservation to maintain structural integrity of grain boundary topology of the prediction. Results demonstrated that our machine learning approach accelerates grain growth prediction by up to \SI{89}{\times} faster, reducing computation time from \SI{10}{\minute} to approximately \SI{10}{\second} while maintaining high-fidelity predictions. The best model (S-30-30) achieving a structural similarity score of \SI{86.71}{\percent} and mean grain size error of just \SI{0.07}{\percent}. All models accurately captured grain boundary topology, morphology, and size distributions. This approach enables rapid microstructural prediction for applications where conventional simulations are prohibitively time-consuming, potentially accelerating innovation in materials science and manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Unconventional magnetoresistance and spin gapless semiconductor like behavior across the Martensitic transformation in off-stoichiometric Co-Fe-Ti-Si Heusler alloy thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the effect of anti-site disorder on magnetic, electrical resistivity, transverse magnetoresistance MR, and anomalous Hall resistivity of off-stoichiometric CFTS Heusler alloy thin films, with a particular focus on martensitic phase transformation and spin gapless semiconductor SGS-like behavior, is investigated. These thin films were grown on Si (100) substrate at different substrate temperatures, TS, ranging from 200 C to 550 C using magnetron sputtering, enabling control over the degree of anti-site atomic ordering from disordered A2 to ordered L21. All the films, irrespective of their disorder, exhibit a distinct thermal hysteresis and significant drop in resistivity, crossover from asymmetric to symmetric magnetoresistance, and a sharp increase in MR around 300 K, confirming the occurrence of a thermo-elastic martensitic phase transformation. Detailed analysis of resistivity data indicates that for TS200 and TS350 films, a SGS based two channel model describes the conductivity in the martensite phase, whereas TS450, TS500, and TS550 films, exhibit a usual metallic behavior with a resistivity minimum at low temperatures. All the CFTS films show soft ferromagnetic nature and follow the spin-wave equation up to 390 K. The saturation magnetization and Hall conductivity increase with increasing crystalline order. The scaling relation between the longitudinal resistivity and the anomalous Hall resistivity in the martensite phase revels that skew scattering is the dominating contribution in disordered films, and a change in charge carrier type from hole to electron around the martensitic transformation temperature. The asymmetric MR, persistent up to room temperature, highlights the potential of these films for spintronic applications such as spin valves.</description>

      <title>Machine learning model for efficient nonthermal tuning of the charge density wave in monolayer NbSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the charge density wave (CDW) phase diagram of transition metal dichalcogenides is a long-studied problem in condensed matter physics. However, due to complex involvement of electron and lattice degrees of freedom and pronounced anharmonicity, theoretical simulations of the CDW phase diagram at the density-functional-theory level are often numerically demanding. To reduce the computational cost of first principles modelling by orders of magnitude, we have developed an electronic free energy machine learning model for monolayer NbSe$_2$ that allows changing both electronic and ionic temperatures independently. Our approach relies on a machine learning model of the electronic density of states and zero-temperature interatomic potential. This allows us to explore the CDW phase diagram of monolayer NbSe$_2$ both under thermal and laser-induced nonthermal conditions. Our study provides an accurate estimate of the CDW transition temperature at low cost and can disentangle the role of hot electrons and phonons in nonthermal ultrafast melting process of the CDW phase in NbSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Elucidating Ion Capture and Transport Mechanisms of Preyssler Anions in Aqueous Solutions Using Biased MACE-Accelerated MD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equilibrium and biased MACE accelerated MD simulations in aqueous solutions are performed to investigate the ion capture and transport mechanisms of the {P5W30} Preyssler anion (PA) as the smallest representative member of the extended polyoxometalate (POM) family with an internal cavity. The unique interatomic interactions present in the internal cavity vs. exterior of PA are carefully investigated using equilibrium MACE MD simulations for two representative Na(H2O)@PA and Na@PA complexes. Our careful analyses of radial distribution functions and coordination numbers show that the presence of confined water in Na(H2O)@PA has profound modulating effects on the nature of the interactions of the encapsulated ion with the oxygens of the PA cavity. Using well-converged MACE-accelerated multiple walker well-tempered metadynamics simulations, two different associative and dissociative ion transport mechanisms were carefully investigated for Na+ as one of the most abundant and representative ions present in seawater and saline solutions. By comparing systems with and without confined water, it was found that the presence of only one pre-encapsulated confined water in Na(H2O)@PA dramatically changes the free energy landscape of ion transport processes. It was also found that the contraction and dilation of the two windows present in PA directly influence the Na+ and H2O transport. Results from this work are helpful as they show a viable path toward tuning the ion exchange and transport phenomena in aqueous solutions of POM molecular clusters and frameworks.</description>

      <title>Efficient construction of effective Hamiltonians with a hybrid machine learning method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective Hamiltonian method is a powerful tool for simulating large-scale systems across a wide range of temperatures. However, previous methods for constructing effective Hamiltonian models suffer from key limitations: some require to manually predefine interaction terms limited flexibility in capturing complex systems, while others lack efficiency in selecting optimal interactions. In this work, we introduce the Lasso-GA Hybrid Method (LGHM), a novel approach that combines Lasso regression and genetic algorithms to rapidly construct effective Hamiltonian models. Such method is broadly applicable to both magnetic systems (e.g., spin Hamiltonians) and atomic displacement models. To verify the reliability and usefulness of LGHM, we take monolayer CrI_3 and Fe_3 GaTe_2 as examples. In both cases, LGHM not only successfully identifies key interaction terms with high fitting accuracy, but also reproduces experimental magnetic ground states and Curie temperatures with further Monte Carlo simulations. Notable, our analysis of monolayer Fe_3 GaTe_2 reveals that the single-ion anisotropy and Heisenberg interaction lead to an out-of-plane ferromagnetic ground state, while the fourth-order interactions contribute significantly to the high Curie temperature. Our method is general so it can be applied to construct other effective Hamiltonian models.</description>

      <title>Microscopic phase-transition theory of charge density waves: revealing hidden transitions of phason and amplitudon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a self-consistent phase-transition theory of charge density waves (CDWs), starting from a purely microscopic model. Specifically, we derive a microscopic CDW gap equation $|\Delta_0(T)|$, taking into account of thermal phase fluctuations (i.e., thermal excitation of phason) and their influence on CDW pinning (i.e., the phason mass) and CDW gap. We demonstrate that as temperature increases from zero, the phason gradually softens, leading to a depinning transition (where the phason becomes gapless) at $T_d$ and a subsequent first-order CDW phase transition at $T_c&gt;T_d$. The predicted values of $T_d$, $T_c$ as well as the large ratio of $|\Delta_0(T=0)|/(k_BT_c)$ for the quasi-one-dimensional CDW material (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I show remarkable quantitative agreements with experimental measurements and explain many of the previously observed key thermodynamic features and unresolved issues in literature. To further validate the theory, we calculate the energy gap of CDW amplitudon and its lifetime, and reveal a transition of amplitudon from a lightly damped to a heavily damped excitation during pinning-depinning transition while its energy gap is nearly unchanged throughout the entire CDW phase. This finding quantitatively captures and explains the recently observed coherent signal in ultrafast THz emission spectroscopy on (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interlayer exchange coupling in Fe/MgO(001) superlattices is found to increase exponentially with decreasing temperature. Around 150~K, the field induced response changes from discrete switching, governed by field-driven domain propagation, to a collective rotation of the magnetic layers. This transition is accompanied by a change in the magnetic ground state from 180$^{\circ}$ (antiferromagnetic) to 90$^{\circ}$ alignment between adjacent Fe layers. These effects are argued to arise from quantum well states, defined by the total thickness of the samples.</description>

      <title>Report on Neural-like Criticality in Ag-based Nanoparticle Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emulating the neural-like information processing dynamics of the brain provides a time and energy efficient approach for solving complex problems. While the majority of neuromorphic hardware currently developed rely on large arrays of highly organized building units, such as in rigid crossbar architectures, in biological neuron assemblies make use of dynamic transitions within highly parallel, reconfigurable connection schemes. Neuroscience suggests that efficiency of information processing in the brain rely on dynamic interactions and signal propagations which are self-tuned and non-rigid. Brain-like dynamic and avalanche criticality have already been found in a variety of self-organized networks of nanoobjects, such as nanoparticles (NP) or nanowires. Here we report on the dynamics of the electrical spiking signals from Ag-based self-organized nanoparticle networks (NPNs) at the example of monometallic Ag NPNs, bimetallic AgAu alloy NPNs and composite Ag/ZrN NPNs, which combine two distinct NP species. We present time series recordings of the resistive switching responses in each network and showcase the determination of switching events as well as the evaluation of avalanche criticality. In each case, for Ag NPN, AgAu NPN and Ag/ZrN NPN, the agreement of three independently derived estimates of the characteristic exponent provides evidence for avalanche criticality. The study shows that Ag-based NPNs offer a broad range of versatility for integration purposes into physical computing systems without destroying their critical dynamics, as the composition of these NPNs can be modified to suit specific requirements for integration.</description>

      <title>Partitioning Law of Polymer Chains into Flexible Polymer Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equilibrium partitioning of linear polymer chains into flexible polymer networks is governed by intricate entropic constraints arising from configurational degrees of freedom of both chains and network, yet a quantitative understanding remains elusive. Using model hydrogels with precisely defined network structures, we experimentally reveal a universal law governing linear polymer partitioning into flexible polymer networks. We establish a novel label-free, contactless method to measure partition ratio, based on the increase in osmotic pressure induced by external polymer chains partitioning into the network. Moreover, we find a universal law in which the partition constant is solely determined by the squared ratio $(R_g / l_\mathrm{cycle})^2$, where $R_g$ is the gyration radius of the polymer chain and $l_\mathrm{cycle}$ is the characteristic mesh size of the network, as defined by the cycle length.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Palladium Telluride (PdTe), a non-layered intermetallic crystalline compound, has captured attention for its unique superconducting properties and strong spin-orbit coupling. In this work, we investigate the superconducting state of PdTe using point-contact Andreev reflection (PCAR) spectroscopy. The experimental data are analyzed using the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) model for s, p and d wave symmetries. Our results reveal clear evidence of unconventional superconductivity. The superconducting gap showing features consistent with either p-wave or d-wave pairing symmetries but cannot be fitted with s-wave symmetry. The observed anisotropic gap structure and deviations from conventional BCS behaviour highlight the complex nature of the pairing interactions in PdTe. These findings provide strong evidence of unconventional pairing symmetry in this material.</description>

      <title>Josephson current signature of Floquet Majorana and topological accidental zero modes in altermagnet heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the generation and Josephson current signatures of Floquet Majorana end modes (FMEMs) in a periodically driven altermagnet (AM) heterostructure. Considering a one-dimensional (1D) Rashba nanowire (RNW) proximitized to a regular $s$-wave superconductor and a $d$-wave AM, we generate both $0$- and $\pi$-FMEMs by driving the nontopological phase of the static system. While the static counterpart hosts both topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs) and non-topological accidental zero modes (AZMs), the drive can gap out the static AZMs and generate robust $\pi$-FMEMs, termed as topological AZMs (TAZMs). We topologically characterize the emergent FMEMs via dynamical winding numbers exploiting chiral symmetry of the system. Moreover, we consider a periodically driven Josephson junction comprising of RNW/AM-based 1D topological superconduting setup. We identify the signature of MZMs and FMEMs utilizing $4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect, distinguishing them from trivial AZMs exhibiting $2\pi$-periodicty, in both static and driven platforms. This Josephson current signal due to Majorana modes survives even in presence of finite disorder. Our work establishes a route to realize and identify FMEMs in AM-based platforms through Floquet engineering and Josephson current response.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical response of truly chiral phonons: Light-induced phonon angular momentum, Peltier effect, and orbital current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear optical responses of chiral phonons to terahertz and infrared light are studied using the nonlinear response theory. We show that the photo-induced angular momentum increases with the square of the chiral-phonon relaxation time $\tau$, giving a significantly larger angular momentum compared to ordinary phonons. We also find that the photo-induced Peltier effect by chiral phonons occurs through a mechanism distinct from those proposed recently; the induced energy current scales $\propto\tau^2$, giving a larger energy current in the clean limit. We prove a linear relation between the generated angular momentum and the energy current. Lastly, we show that the orbital current, an analog of the spin current, occurs through a nonlinear response. These findings demonstrate the unique properties and functionalities of chiral phonons.</description>

      <title>Evidence of chiral fermion edge modes through geometric engineering of thermal Hall in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The experimental observation of half-integer-quantized thermal Hall conductivity in the Kitaev candidate material $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has served as smoking-gun signature of non-Abelian anyons through an associated chiral Majorana edge mode. However, both the reproducibility of the quantized thermal Hall conductivity and the fundamental nature of the associated heat carriers, whether bosonic or fermionic, are subjects of ongoing and vigorous debate. In a recent theoretical work, it was proposed that varying the sample geometry through creating constrictions can distinguish between different origins of the thermal Hall effect in magnetic insulators. Here, we provide experimental evidence of chiral fermion edge modes by comparing the thermal Hall effect of a geometrically constricted $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ sample with that of an unconstricted bulk sample. In contrast to the bulk crystals where the thermal Hall signal fades below 5\,K, the constricted crystals display a significant thermal Hall signal that remains measurable even at 2\,K. This sharp difference agrees well with the theoretical prediction and provides compelling evidence for the contribution of chiral fermion edge modes to the thermal Hall effect in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. More broadly, this work confirms that the geometry dependence of the thermal Hall effect can help identify chiral spin liquids in candidate materials like $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and paves the way for the experimental realization of thermal anyon interferometry.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Electrochemical Limits Preceding Dendrite Penetration in Ceramic Electrolytes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solid-state electrolytes have the potential to stabilize lithium metal anodes, which hold the promise to increase the energy density of lithium-ion batteries. However, lithium metal dendrites that occur locally at the solid-solid interface plague the solid-state lithium metal cells during charging, limiting the cycle life, and rendering high safety risks in practical applications. While multiple explanations have been proposed, understandings of the dynamics preceding and causing the metal penetration in solid electrolytes are still not conclusive. Here, by testing many highly consistent Ta-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZTO) samples and utilizing an improved operando technique on symmetrical cells, we observed a consistent and statistically significant trend of current-dependent dendrite initiation time, which coincides with the Sand's time scaling in liquid electrolytes. This new understanding offers an electrochemical origin of dendritic initiation but also provides future insight into optimal all-solid-state battery design.</description>

      <title>In-poor IGZO: superior resilience to hydrogen in forming gas anneal and PBTI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating In-Ga-Zn-oxide (IGZO) channel transistors in silicon-based ecosystems requires the resilience of the channel material to hydrogen treatment. Standard IGZO, containing 40% In (metal ratio) suffers from degradation under forming gas anneal (FGA) and hydrogen (H) driven positive bias temperature instability (PBTI). We demonstrate scaled top-gated ALD transistors with an In-poor (In $\le$ 17%) IGZO channel that show superior resilience to hydrogen compared to the In-rich (In=40%) counterpart. The devices, fabricated with a 300-mm FAB process with dimensions down to $W_\mathrm{CH} \times L_\mathrm{TG} = 80 \times 40 \mathrm{nm}^2$, show excellent stability in 2-hour 420$^\circ$C forming gas anneal ($0.06 \le \left| \Delta V_{\mathrm{TH}} \right| \le 0.33\mathrm{V}$) and improved resilience to H in PBTI at 125$^\circ$C (down to no detectable H-induced $V_{\mathrm{TH}}$ shift) compared to In-rich devices. We demonstrate that the device degradation by H in the FGA is different from the H-induced VTH instability in PBTI, namely oxygen scavenging by H and H release from a gate-dielectric into the channel, respectively, and that resilience to H in one process does not automatically translate to resilience to H in the other one. This significant improvement in IGZO resilience to H enables the use of FGA treatments during fabrication needed for silicon technology compatibility, as well as further scaling and 3D integration, bringing IGZO-based technologies closer to mass production.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the robustness of {\it virtual} topological states -- topological phases away from the Fermi energy -- against the electron-electron interaction and band filling. As a case study, we employ a realistic model to investigate the properties of vacancy-driven topological phases in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and establish a connection between the degree of localization of topological wave functions, the vacancy density, and the electron-electron interaction strength with the topological phase robustness. We demonstrate that electron-electron interactions play a crucial role in degrading topological phases thereby determining the validity of single-particle approximations for topological insulator phases. Our findings can be naturally extended to {\it virtual} topological phases of a wide range of materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been an ongoing race for the past several years to develop the best universal machinelearning interatomic potential. This progress has led to increasingly accurate models for predictingenergy, forces, and stresses, combining innovative architectures with big data. Here, we benchmarkthese models on their ability to predict harmonic phonon properties, which are critical for under-standing the vibrational and thermal behavior of materials. Using around 10 000 ab initio phononcalculations, we evaluate model performance across various phonon-related parameters to test theuniversal applicability of these models. The results reveal that some models achieve high accuracyin predicting harmonic phonon properties. However, others still exhibit substantial inaccuracies,even if they excel in the prediction of the energy and the forces for materials close to dynamicalequilibrium. These findings highlight the importance of considering phonon-related properties inthe development of universal machine learning interatomic potentials.</description>

Abstract: This work analyzes the behavior of the interface between a ferromagnetic material and an alter-magnet. We use a well-established line of arguments based on electronic mean-field calculations to show that new surface phenomena that lead to altermagnetic materials induce an exchange bias effect on the nearby ferromagnet. We reveal the physical mechanisms behind this phenomenon that lead to quantitative control over its strength. Interestingly, we predict exotic electric-field-induced phenomena. This is an analogy to the relationship between exchange bias and the injection of spin currents in spin-transfer-dominated scenarios, which has been reported earlier in the traditional antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic junction.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we implement thiol termination on the surface of few-nanometer-sized silicon carbide (SiC) nanoparticles (NPs) to enable further applications, such as fluorescent biomarkers. Various spectroscopic techniques are employed to monitor the effectiveness of the surface treatment. A thiol-Michael addition reaction is performed by conjugating 4-arm PEGmaleimide molecules to the thiol groups of SiC NPs, further demonstrating the reactivity of thiol-terminated SiC NPs, which also acts as a protection layer against oxidation. These fluorescent thiolated SiC NPs, both with and without conjugated molecules, are directly applicable as bioinert probes. Since SiC NPs can potentially host room-temperature fluorescent defect quantum bits, our results are an important step to realize a bioinert, ultrasmall quantum sensor bioagents, which may open new avenues in biotechnology.</description>

Abstract: The ground-state quantum geometry is at the root of several static and adiabatic properties, while genuinely dynamic properties are routinely addressed via Kubo formulae, whose essential entries are the excited states. It is shown here that the ground-state metric-curvature tensor evolves in time by means of a causal unitary operator, which by construction elucidates the geometrical effect of the excited states in compact form. In the condensed-matter case the generalized tensor encompasses the whole conductivity tensor at arbitrary frequencies in both insulators and metals, with the exception of the Drude term in the metallic case; the latter is shown to be eminently nongeometrical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy provides a unique and direct way to explore the real-time nonequilibrium dynamics of electrons and holes. The formal theory of the spectral function evolution requires inclusion of electronic correlations and dissipation, which are challenging due to the associated long simulation timescales which translate to a high computational cost. Recent methodological developments, namely the Real-Time Dyson Expansion, as well as theoretical developments of many-body perturbation theory for dissipative systems, have allowed for the study of driven-dissipative interacting quantum systems. In this work, we implement the hitherto unrealized study of driven-dissipative interacting quantum systems which includes driven dynamical correlations and utilizes these new methods and perturbative expansions. We illustrate the combined formalism on a prototypical two-band semiconductor model with long-range density-density Coulomb interactions. We show that the intraband thermalization of conduction band electrons induces nontrivial time-dependent changes in the system's bandstructure and a time-evolving band-gap renormalization (with a reduction by up to 10\%). We show that the qualitative features are preserved for a variety of parameters, discuss the corresponding spectral dynamics, and provide an outlook on the newly introduced simulation framework, which enables treating electron-electron scattering and dissipation effects on equal footing.</description>

      <title>Differentiation of Distinct Single Atoms via Multi-Defocus Fusion Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) is a vital tool for characterizing single-atom catalysts (SACs). However, reliable elemental identification of different atoms remains challenging because the signal intensity of HAADF depends strongly on defocus and other imaging parameters, potentially ruining the Z-contrast of atoms at different depths. In this work, we investigated the influence of the vertical position of atoms (defocus), support thickness, interatomic height, convergence and collection angles via multi-slice simulations on a model system of Fe/Pt atoms on amorphous carbon supports. Our calculation shows that at a convergence angle of 28 mrad, a defocus of 4.6 nm can cause Fe and Pt atoms indistinguishable. At a larger convergence angle, this critical indistinguishable defocus can be even shorter. To address this limitation, we propose a Multi-Defocus Fusion (MDF) method, retrieving the Z-contrast from serial images from multiple defocus. Experimental validation on a Fe/Pt SAC sample confirms the effectiveness of MDF, yielding clearly separated intensity histograms corresponding to Fe and Pt atoms. This work presents a robust, easy-to-implement strategy for accurate single-atom identification, offering valuable guidance for the accelerated screening and rational design of high-performance SACs.</description>

Depending on the time scale and host material, excitons can exhibit free diffusion, phonon-limited diffusion, or polaronic diffusion, and exciton transport often limits the efficiency of optoelectronic devices such as solar cells or photodetectors. We demonstrate that topological excitons exhibit enhanced diffusion in all transport regimes. Using quantum geometry, we find that topological excitons are generically larger and more dispersive than their trivial counterparts, promoting their diffusion. We apply this general theory to organic polyacene semiconductors and show that exciton transport increases up to fourfold when topological excitons are present. We also propose that non-uniform electric fields can be used to directly probe the quantum metric of excitons, providing a rare experimental window into a basic geometric feature of quantum states. Our results provide a new strategy to enhance exciton transport in semiconductors and reveal that mathematical ideas of topology and quantum geometry can be important ingredients in the design of next-generation optoelectronic technologies.</description>

      <title>The origin of strings and rings in the atomic dynamics of disordered systems</title>

Abstract: It has long been believed that the atomic dynamics in disordered structures, such as undercooled liquids and pre-melted interfaces, are characterized by collective atomic rearrangements in the form of quasi-one-dimensional chains of atomic displacements (strings) and their closed forms (rings). Here, we show by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that strings involving more than a few atoms do not form by a single collective event. Instead, they represent trajectories of propagating local density perturbations, which we call densitons. The atoms on this trajectory are almost indistinguishable from their environments except for the moving head of the string (densiton). A densiton migrates by either single-atom jumps or a concerted rearrangement of 2-3 atoms. The simulations reveal a remarkable similarity between the strings in disordered and crystalline structures, in which the densitons localize into point defects. This work calls for a significant reinterpretation of the string concept and instead proposes a densiton model of the atomic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unconventional excitonic insulators in two-dimensional topological materials</title>

Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons can form a coherent state at low temperatures akin to a BCS condensate. The resulting phase is known as the excitonic insulator and has superfluid properties. Here we theoretically study the excitonic insulator in a pair of recently proposed two-dimensional candidate materials with nontrivial band topology. Contrary to previous works, we include interaction channels that violate the individual electron and hole number conservations. These are on equal footing with the number-conserving processes due to the substantial overlap of Wannier orbitals of different bands, which cannot be exponentially localized due to the nontrivial Chern numbers of the latter. Their inclusion is crucial to determine the symmetry of the electron-hole pairing, and by performing mean-field calculations at nonzero temperatures we find that the order parameter in these systems is a chiral $d$-wave. We discuss the nontrivial topology of this unconventional state and discuss some properties of the associated Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. In particular, we argue that here it becomes a smooth crossover and estimate the associated temperature to lie between $\SI{50}{\kelvin}$ and $\SI{75}{\kelvin}$ on realistic substrates, over an order of magnitude larger than in the number-conserving approximation where $s$-wave pairing is favored. Our results highlight the interplay between topology at the single-particle level and long-range interactions, motivating further research in systems where both phenomena coexist.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry and adiabaticity in molecules and in condensed matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10672</link>

Abstract: The adiabatic theorem states that when the time evolution of the Hamiltonian is "infinitely slow", a system, when started in the ground state, remains in the instantaneous ground state at all times. This, however, does not mean that the adiabatic evolution of a generic observable obtains simply as its expectation value over the instantaneous eigenstate. As a general principle there is an additional adiabatic term, of quantum-geometrical nature, which is the relevant one for several static or adiabatic observables. This is shown explicitly for the cases of polarizability and infrared tensors (in molecules and condensed matter); rotational g factor and magnetizability (in molecules only). Quantum geometry allows for a transparent derivation and a compact expression for these observables, alternative to the well known sum-over-states Kubo formulas.</description>
