      <title>NP-TCMtarget: a network pharmacology platform for exploring mechanisms of action of Traditional Chinese medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The biological targets of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are the core effectors mediating the interaction between TCM and the human body. Identification of TCM targets is essential to elucidate the chemical basis and mechanisms of TCM for treating diseases. Given the chemical complexity of TCM, both in silico high-throughput drug-target interaction predicting models and biological profile-based methods have been commonly applied for identifying TCM targets based on the structural information of TCM chemical components and biological information, respectively. However, the existing methods lack the integration of TCM chemical and biological information, resulting in difficulty in the systematic discovery of TCM action pathways. To solve this problem, we propose a novel target identification model NP-TCMtarget to explore the TCM target path by combining the overall chemical and biological profiles. First, NP-TCMtarget infers TCM effect targets by calculating associations between drug/disease inducible gene expression profiles and specific gene signatures for 8,233 targets. Then, NP-TCMtarget utilizes a constructed binary classification model to predict binding targets of herbal ingredients. Finally, we can distinguish TCM direct and indirect targets by comparing the effect targets and binding targets to establish the action pathways of herbal components-direct targets-indirect targets by mapping TCM targets in the biological molecular network. We apply NP-TCMtarget to the formula XiaoKeAn to demonstrate the power of revealing the action pathways of herbal formula. We expect that this novel model could provide a systematic framework for exploring the molecular mechanisms of TCM at the target level. NP-TCMtarget is available at http://www.bcxnfz.top/NP-TCMtarget.</description>

      <title>Parametric Sensitivity Analysis for Models of Reaction Networks within Interacting Compartments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of reaction networks within interacting compartments (RNIC) are a generalization of stochastic reaction networks. It is most natural to think of the interacting compartments as ``cells'' that can appear, degrade, split, and even merge, with each cell containing an evolving copy of the underlying stochastic reaction network. Such models have a number of parameters, including those associated with the internal chemical model and those associated with the compartment interactions, and it is natural to want efficient computational methods for the numerical estimation of sensitivities of model statistics with respect to these parameters. Motivated by the extensive work on computational methods for parametric sensitivity analysis in the context of stochastic reaction networks over the past few decades, we provide a number of methods in the RNIC setting. Provided methods include the (unbiased) Girsanov transformation method (also called the Likelihood Ratio method) and a number of coupling methods for the implementation of finite differences. We provide several numerical examples and conclude that the method associated with the ``Split Coupling'' provides the most efficient algorithm. This finding is in line with the conclusions from the work related to sensitivity analysis of standard stochastic reaction networks. We have made all of the Matlab code used to implement the various methods freely available for download.</description>

      <title>Generic consistency and nondegeneracy of vertically parametrized systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02302v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the generic consistency, dimension and nondegeneracy of the zero locus over $\mathbb{C}^*$, $\mathbb{R}^*$ and $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$ of vertically parametrized systems: parametric polynomial systems consisting of linear combinations of monomials scaled by free parameters. These systems generalize sparse systems with fixed monomial support and freely varying parametric coefficients. As our main result, we establish the equivalence among three key properties: the existence of nondegenerate zeros, the zero set having generically the expected dimension, and the system being generically consistent. Importantly, we prove that checking whether a vertically parametrized system has these properties amounts to an easily computed matrix rank condition.</description>
