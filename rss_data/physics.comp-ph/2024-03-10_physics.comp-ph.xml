      <title>Tensor approximation of functional differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional Differential Equations (FDEs) play a fundamental role in many areas of mathematical physics, including fluid dynamics (Hopf characteristic functional equation), quantum field theory (Schwinger-Dyson equation), and statistical physics. Despite their significance, computing solutions to FDEs remains a longstanding challenge in mathematical physics. In this paper we address this challenge by introducing new approximation theory and high-performance computational algorithms designed for solving FDEs on tensor manifolds. Our approach involves approximating FDEs using high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), and then solving such high-dimensional PDEs on a low-rank tensor manifold leveraging high-performance parallel tensor algorithms. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through its application to the Burgers-Hopf FDE, which governs the characteristic functional of the stochastic solution to the Burgers equation evolving from a random initial state.</description>

      <title>Simulating adiabatic quantum computation with a variational approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theoretical analysis of the Adiabatic Quantum Computation protocol presents several challenges resulting from the difficulty of simulating, with classical resources, the unitary dynamics of a large quantum device. We present here a variational approach to substantially alleviate this problem in many situations of interest. Our approach is based on the time-dependent Variational Monte Carlo method, in conjunction with a correlated and time-dependent Jastrow ansatz. We demonstrate that accurate results can be obtained in a variety of problems, ranging from the description of defect generation through a dynamical phase transition in 1D to the complex dynamics of frustrated spin-glass problems both on fully-connected and Chimera graphs.</description>

      <title>On Representing Electronic Wave Functions with Sign Equivariant Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent neural networks demonstrated impressively accurate approximations of electronic ground-state wave functions. Such neural networks typically consist of a permutation-equivariant neural network followed by a permutation-antisymmetric operation to enforce the electronic exchange symmetry. While accurate, such neural networks are computationally expensive. In this work, we explore the flipped approach, where we first compute antisymmetric quantities based on the electronic coordinates and then apply sign equivariant neural networks to preserve the antisymmetry. While this approach promises acceleration thanks to the lower-dimensional representation, we demonstrate that it reduces to a Jastrow factor, a commonly used permutation-invariant multiplicative factor in the wave function. Our empirical results support this further, finding little to no improvements over baselines. We conclude with neither theoretical nor empirical advantages of sign equivariant functions for representing electronic wave functions within the evaluation of this work.</description>

      <title>Load Balancing For High Performance Computing Using Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of exascale computing, effective load balancing in massively parallel software applications is critically important for leveraging the full potential of high performance computing systems. Load balancing is the distribution of computational work between available processors. Here, we investigate the application of quantum annealing to load balance two paradigmatic algorithms in high performance computing. Namely, adaptive mesh refinement and smoothed particle hydrodynamics are chosen as representative grid and off-grid target applications. While the methodology for obtaining real simulation data to partition is application specific, the proposed balancing protocol itself remains completely general. In a grid based context, quantum annealing is found to outperform classical methods such as the round robin protocol but lacks a decisive advantage over more advanced methods such as steepest descent or simulated annealing despite remaining competitive. The primary obstacle to scalability is found to be limited coupling on current quantum annealing hardware. However, for the more complex particle formulation, approached as a multi-objective optimization, quantum annealing solutions are demonstrably Pareto dominant to state of the art classical methods across both objectives. This signals a noteworthy advancement in solution quality which can have a large impact on effective CPU usage.</description>

      <title>Ultimate Performance of Biomedical Ablation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave ablation is a therapeutic procedure to eliminate abnormal tissue within a body selectively. There are two types of ablations; the thermal one aims to raise the temperature at the target, while the non-thermal one induces a temporarily high electric field at the target to disrupt cellular membrane integrity. This work identifies the fundamental bounds of the efficiency for each type of ablation and the sources to achieve them. For both types, the bounds exceed the performance of existing solutions by tenfold, showing a large room for improvement. Finally, the optimal source for thermal ablation is physically realized with an 11 x 11 dipole array, the performance of which closely approaches the bound.</description>

      <title>A scalable method to model large suspensions of colloidal phoretic particles with arbitrary shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phoretic colloids self-propel thanks to surface flows generated in response to surface gradients (thermal, electrical, or chemical), that are self-induced and/or generated by other particles. Here we present a scalable and versatile framework to model chemical and hydrodynamic interactions in large suspensions of arbitrarily shaped phoretic particles, accounting for thermal fluctuations at all Damkholer numbers. Our approach, inspired by the Boundary Element Method (BEM), employs second-layer formulations, regularised kernels and a grid optimisation strategy to solve the coupled Laplace-Stokes equations with reasonable accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost associated with BEM. As demonstrated by our large-scale simulations, the capabilities of our method enable the exploration of new physical phenomena that, to our knowledge, have not been previously addressed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of a stochastic dynamics leading to cascades and loss of regularity: applications to fluid turbulence and generation of fractional Gaussian fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the modeling of the spatial structure of the velocity field of three-dimensional turbulent flows, and the phenomenology of cascade phenomena, a linear dynamics has been recently proposed able to generate high velocity gradients from a smooth-in-space forcing term. It is based on a linear Partial Differential Equation (PDE) stirred by an additive random forcing term which is delta-correlated in time. The underlying proposed deterministic mechanism corresponds to a transport in Fourier space which aims at transferring energy injected at large scales towards small scales. The key role of the random forcing is to realize these transfers in a statistically homogeneous way. Whereas at finite times and positive viscosity the solutions are smooth, a loss of regularity is observed for the statistically stationary state in the inviscid limit. We here present novel simulations, based on finite volume methods in the Fourier domain and a splitting method in time, which are more accurate than the pseudo-spectral simulations. We show that the novel algorithm is able to reproduce accurately the expected local and statistical structure of the predicted solutions. We conduct numerical simulations in one, two and three spatial dimensions, and we display the solutions both in physical and Fourier spaces. We additionally display key statistical quantities such as second-order structure functions and power spectral densities at various viscosities.</description>

      <title>Design of perfectly conducting objects that are invisible to an incident plane wave</title>

Abstract: This work concerns the design of perfectly conducting objects that are invisible to an incident transverse magnetic plane wave. The object in question is a finite planar waveguide with a finite periodic array of barriers. By optimizing this array, the amplitude of the scattered field is reduced to less than $10^{-9}$ times the amplitude of the incident plane wave everywhere outside the waveguide. To accurately evaluate such minute amplitudes, we employ a recently developed boundary integral equation technique, adapted for objects whose boundaries have endpoints, corners, and branch points.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an efficient generation procedure to produce synthetic multi-modal datasets of fluid simulations. The procedure can reproduce the dynamics of fluid flows and allows for exploring and learning various properties of their complex behavior, from distinct perspectives and modalities. We employ our framework to generate a set of thoughtfully designed training datasets, which attempt to span specific fluid simulation scenarios in a meaningful way. The properties of our contributions are demonstrated by evaluating recently published algorithms for the neural fluid simulation and fluid inverse rendering tasks using our benchmark datasets. Our contribution aims to fulfill the community's need for standardized training data, fostering more reproducibile and robust research.</description>

      <title>Efficient Light Propagation Algorithm using Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms can potentially overcome the boundary of computationally hard problems. One of the cornerstones in modern optics is the beam propagation algorithm, facilitating the calculation of how waves with a particular dispersion relation propagate in time and space. This algorithm solves the wave propagation equation by Fourier transformation, multiplication with a transfer function, and subsequent back transformation. This transfer function is determined from the respective dispersion relation, which can often be expanded as a polynomial. In the case of paraxial wave propagation in free space or picosecond pulse propagation, this expansion can be truncated after the quadratic term. The classical solution to the wave propagation requires $\mathcal{O}(N log N)$ computation steps, where $N$ is the number of points into which the wave function is discretized. Here, we show that the propagation can be performed as a quantum algorithm with $\mathcal{O}((log{}N)^2)$ single-controlled phase gates, indicating exponentially reduced computational complexity. We herein demonstrate this quantum beam propagation method (QBPM) and perform such propagation in both one- and two-dimensional systems for the double-slit experiment and Gaussian beam propagation. We highlight the importance of the selection of suitable observables to retain the quantum advantage in the face of the statistical nature of the quantum measurement process, which leads to sampling errors that do not exist in classical solutions.</description>

      <title>Neural General Circulation Models for Weather and Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07222v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General circulation models (GCMs) are the foundation of weather and climate prediction. GCMs are physics-based simulators which combine a numerical solver for large-scale dynamics with tuned representations for small-scale processes such as cloud formation. Recently, machine learning (ML) models trained on reanalysis data achieved comparable or better skill than GCMs for deterministic weather forecasting. However, these models have not demonstrated improved ensemble forecasts, or shown sufficient stability for long-term weather and climate simulations. Here we present the first GCM that combines a differentiable solver for atmospheric dynamics with ML components, and show that it can generate forecasts of deterministic weather, ensemble weather and climate on par with the best ML and physics-based methods. NeuralGCM is competitive with ML models for 1-10 day forecasts, and with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ensemble prediction for 1-15 day forecasts. With prescribed sea surface temperature, NeuralGCM can accurately track climate metrics such as global mean temperature for multiple decades, and climate forecasts with 140 km resolution exhibit emergent phenomena such as realistic frequency and trajectories of tropical cyclones. For both weather and climate, our approach offers orders of magnitude computational savings over conventional GCMs. Our results show that end-to-end deep learning is compatible with tasks performed by conventional GCMs, and can enhance the large-scale physical simulations that are essential for understanding and predicting the Earth system.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Radiative Transfer Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiation transfer equation is widely used for simulating such as heat transfer in engineering, diffuse optical tomography in healthcare, and radiation hydrodynamics in astrophysics. By combining the lattice Boltzmann method, we propose a quantum algorithm for radiative transfer. This algorithm encompasses all the essential physical processes of radiative transfer: absorption, scattering, and emission. Although a sufficient number of measurements are required to precisely estimate the quantum state, and the initial encoding of the quantum state remains a challenging problem, our quantum algorithm exponentially accelerates radiative transfer calculations compared to classical algorithms. In order to verify the quantum algorithm, we perform quantum circuit simulation using IBM Qiskit Aer and find good agreement between our numerical result and the exact solution. The algorithm opens new application of fault-tolerant quantum computers for plasma engineering, telecommunications, nuclear fusion technology, healthcare and astrophysics.</description>
