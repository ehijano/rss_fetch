      <title>A combinatorial approach to categorical M\"obius inversion and pseudoinversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Cramer's formula for the inverse of a matrix and a combinatorial expression for the determinant in terms of paths of an associated digraph (which can be traced back to Coates) to give a combinatorial interpretation of M\"obius inversion whenever it exists. Every M\"obius coefficient is a quotient of two sums, each indexed by certain collections of paths in the digraph. Our result contains, as particular cases, previous theorems by Hall (for posets) and Leinster (for skeletal categories whose idempotents are identities). A byproduct is a novel expression for the magnitude of a metric space as sum over self-avoiding paths with finitely many terms. By means of Berg's formula, our main constructions can be extended to Moore-Penrose pseudoinverses, yielding an analogous combinatorial interpretation of M\"obius pseudoinversion and, consequently, of the magnitude of an arbitrary finite category.</description>

      <title>The monomial expansion formula for Hall-Littlewood $P$-polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a Hecke algebra derivation of Macdonald's expansion formula for Hall-Littlewood polynomials in terms of semistandard Young tableaux. This is accomplished by first obtaining a Hecke algebra lift of the expansion coefficients and then proving a generalization of Klostermann's recursions.</description>

      <title>A Yannakakis-type theorem for lifts of affine semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yannakakis' theorem relating the extension complexity of a polytope to the size of a nonnegative factorization of its slack matrix is a seminal result in the study of lifts of convex sets. Inspired by this result and the importance of lifts in the setting of integer programming, we show that a similar result holds for the discrete analog of convex polyhedral cones-affine semigroups. We define the notions of the integer slack matrix and a lift of an affine semigroup. We show that many of the characterizations of the slack matrix in the convex cone setting have analogous results in the affine semigroup setting. We also show how slack matrices of affine semigroups can be used to obtain new results in the study of nonnegative integer rank of nonnegative integer matrices.</description>

      <title>Orientable sequences over non-binary alphabets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe new, simple, recursive methods of construction for orientable sequences over an arbitrary finite alphabet, i.e. periodic sequences in which any sub-sequence of n consecutive elements occurs at most once in a period in either direction. In particular we establish how two variants of a generalised Lempel homomorphism can be used to recursively construct such sequences, generalising previous work on the binary case. We also derive an upper bound on the period of an orientable sequence.</description>

      <title>On the multicolor Tur\'{a}n conjecture for color-critical graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A {\it simple $k$-coloring} of a multigraph $G$ is a decomposition of the edge multiset as a disjoint sum of $k$ simple graphs which are referred as colors. A subgraph $H$ of a multigraph $G$ is called {\it multicolored} if its edges receive distinct colors in a given simple $k$-coloring of $G$. In 2004, Keevash-Saks-Sudakov-Verstra\"{e}te introduced the {\it $k$-color Tur\'{a}n number} $ex_k(n,H)$, which denotes the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex multigraph that has a simple $k$-coloring containing no multicolored copies of $H$. They made a conjecture for any $r\geq 3$ and $r$-color-critical graph $H$ that in the range of $k\geq \frac{r-1}{r-2}(e(H)-1)$, if $n$ is sufficiently large, then $ex_k(n, H)$ is achieved by the multigraph consisting of $k$ colors all of which are identical copies of the Tur\'{a}n graph $T_{r-1}(n)$. In this paper, we show that this holds in the range of $k\geq 2\frac{r-1}{r}(e(H)-1)$, significantly improving earlier results. Our proof combines the stability argument of Chakraborti-Kim-Lee-Liu-Seo with a novel graph packing technique for embedding multigraphs.</description>

      <title>Projective geometries, $Q$-polynomial structures, and quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2023 we obtained a $Q$-polynomial structure for the projective geometry $L_N(q)$. In the present paper, we display a more general $Q$-polynomial structure for $L_N(q)$. Our new $Q$-polynomial structure is defined using a free parameter $\varphi$ that takes any positive real value. For $\varphi=1$ we recover the original $Q$-polynomial structure. We interpret the new $Q$-polynomial structure using the quantum group $U_{q^{1/2}}(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ in the equitable presentation. We use the new $Q$-polynomial structure to obtain analogs of the four split decompositions that appear in the theory of $Q$-polynomial distance-regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Designs in compact symmetric spaces and applications of great antipodal sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of designs is an important branch of combinatorial mathematics. It is well-known in the theory of designs that a finite subset of a sphere is a tight spherical 1-design if and only if it is a pair of antipodal points. On the other hand, antipodal sets and 2-number for a Riemannian manifold are introduced by B.-Y. Chen and T. Nagano in 1982.
  An antipodal set is called a great antipodal set if its cardinality is equal to the 2-number. The main purpose of this paper is to provide a survey on important results in compact symmetric spaces with great antipodal sets as the designs. In the last two sections of this paper, we present some important applications of 2-number and great antipodal sets to topology and group theory.</description>

      <title>Towards a solution of Archdeacon's conjecture on integer Heffter arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we make significant progress on a conjecture proposed by Dan Archdeacon on the existence of integer Heffter arrays $H(m,n;s,k)$ whenever the necessary conditions hold, that is, $3\leqslant s \leqslant n$, $3\leqslant k\leqslant m$, $ms=nk$ and $nk\equiv 0,3 \pmod 4$. By constructing integer Heffter array sets, we prove the conjecture in the affirmative whenever $k\geqslant 7\cdot \gcd(s,k)$ is odd and $s\neq 3,5,6,10$.</description>

      <title>The finite products of shifted primes and Moreira's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $r\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}=\bigcup_{i=1}^{r}C_{i}$. Do there exist $x,y\in\mathbb{N}$ and $r\in\left\{1,2,\ldots,r\right\}$ such that $\left\{x,y,xy,x+y\right\}\subseteq C_{i}$? This is still an unanswered question asked by N. Hindman. Joel Moreira in [J. Moreira, Monochromatic sums and products in N, Annals of Mathematics 185 (2017) 1069-1090] established a partial answer to this question and proved that for infinitely many $x,y\in\mathbb{N}$, $\left\{x,xy,x+y\right\}\subseteq C_{i}$ for some $i\in\left\{1,2,\ldots,r\right\}$, which is called Moreira's Theorem. Recently, H. Hindman and D. Strauss established a refinement of Moreira's Theorem and proved that for infinitely many $y$, $\left\{x\in\mathbb{N}:\left\{x,xy,x+y\right\}\subseteq C_{i}\right\}$ is a piecewise syndetic set. In this article, we will prove infinitely many $y\in FP\left(\mathbb{P}-1\right)$ such that $\left\{x\in\mathbb{N}:\left\{xy,x+f(y):f\in F\right\}\subseteq C_{i}\right\}$ is piecewise syndetic, where $F$ is a finite subset of $x\mathbb{Z}\left[x\right]$. $\mathbb{P}$ is the set of prime numbers in $\mathbb{N}$ and $FP\left(\mathbb{P}-1\right)$ is the set of all finite products of $\mathbb{P}-1$.</description>

      <title>Inversion Diameter and Treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an oriented graph $\overrightarrow{G}$, the inversion of a subset $X$ of vertices consists in reversing the orientation of all arcs with both end-vertices in $X$. The inversion graph of a graph $G$, denoted by $\mathcal{I}(G)$, is the graph whose vertices are orientations of $G$ in which two orientations $\overrightarrow{G_1}$ and $\overrightarrow{G_2}$ are adjacent if and only if there is an inversion $X$ transforming $\overrightarrow{G_1}$ into $\overrightarrow{G_2}$. The inversion diameter of a graph $G$ is the diameter of its inversion graph $\mathcal{I}(G)$ denoted by $diam(\mathcal{I}(G))$. Havet, H\"orsch, and Rambaud~(2024) first proved that for $G$ of treewidth $k$, $diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \le 2k$, and there are graphs of treewidth $k$ with inversion diameter $k+2$. In this paper, we construct graphs of treewidth $k$ with inversion diameter $2k$, which implies that the previous upper bound $diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \le 2k$ is tight. Moreover, for graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$, Havet, H\"orsch, and Rambaud~(2024) proved $diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \le 2\Delta-1$ and conjectured that $diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \le \Delta$. We prove the conjecture when $\Delta=3$ with the help of computer calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dowker theorem is a classical result in the topology of finite spaces, claiming that any binary relation between two finite spaces defines two homotopy-equivalent complexes (the Dowker complexes). Recently, Barmak strengthened this to a simple-homotopy-equivalence. We reprove Barmak's result using a combinatorial argument that constructs an explicit acyclic matching in the sense of discrete Morse theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our study of exponent semigroups of rational matrices. Our main result is that the matricial dimension of a numerical semigroup is at most its multiplicity (the least generator), greatly improving upon the previous upper bound (the conductor). For many numerical semigroups, including all symmetric numerical semigroups, our upper bound is tight.</description>

      <title>Partial Difference Sets with Denniston Parameters in Elementary Abelian $p$-Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denniston \cite{D1969} constructed partial difference sets (PDS) with parameters $(2^{3m}, (2^{m+r}-2^m+2^r)(2^m-1), 2^m-2^r+(2^{m+r}-2^m+2^r)(2^r-2), (2^{m+r}-2^m+2^r)(2^r-1))$ in elementary abelian groups of order $2^{3m}$ for all $m\geq 2$ and $1 \leq r &lt; m$. These PDS correspond to maximal arcs in the Desarguesian projective planes PG$(2, 2^m)$. Davis et al. \cite{DHJP2024} and also De Winter \cite{dewinter23} presented constructions of PDS with Denniston parameters $(p^{3m}, (p^{m+r}-p^m+p^r)(p^m-1), p^m-p^r+(p^{m+r}-p^m+p^r)(p^r-2), (p^{m+r}-p^m+p^r)(p^r-1))$ in elementary abelian groups of order $p^{3m}$ for all $m \geq 2$ and $r \in \{1, m-1\}$, where $p$ is an odd prime. The constructions in \cite{DHJP2024, dewinter23} are particularly intriguing, as it was shown by Ball, Blokhuis, and Mazzocca \cite{BBM1997} that no nontrivial maximal arcs in PG$(2, q^m)$ exist for any odd prime power $q$. In this paper, we show that PDS with Denniston parameters $(q^{3m}, (q^{m+r}-q^m+q^r)(q^m-1), q^m-q^r+(q^{m+r}-q^m+q^r)(q^r-2), (q^{m+r}-q^m+q^r)(q^r-1))$ exist in elementary abelian groups of order $q^{3m}$ for all $m \geq 2$ and $1 \leq r &lt; m$, where $q$ is an arbitrary prime power.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a weakening of the Freiman isomorphisms between subsets of non necessarily abelian groups.
  Inspired by the breakthrough result of Kravitz, [14], on cyclic groups, as an application, we prove that any subset of size $k$ of the dihedral group $D_{2m}$ (and, more in general, of a class of semidirect products) is sequenceable, provided that the prime factors of $m$ are larger than $k!$. Also, a refined bound of $k!/2$ for the size of the prime factors of $m$ can be obtained for cyclic groups $\mathbb{Z}_m$, slightly improving the result of [14].</description>

Newton-Okounkov bodies and tropical geometry are two such combinatorial theories. As shown by Kaveh and Manon, there is a certain correspondence between these two. Building on this correspondence, and exploiting the link of both theories to toric degenerations, Harada and Escobar obtained their wall-crossing result for prime cones. This result states that moving between two adjacent prime maximal cones in a tropical variety corresponds to a mutation between the associated Newton-Okounkov bodies of these cones.  In this thesis, we provide a method for applying the wall-crossing result to non-prime cones. Our approach uses a procedure developed by Bossinger, Lamboglia, Mincheva and Mohammadi in order to compute an embedding which changes a tropical variety in such a way that a non-prime cone becomes prime. Assuming that adjacent cones stay adjacent, the wall-crossing result can then be applied in this new embedding.  Building on computations by Clarke, Mohammadi and Zaffalon, we show that for Gr(3,6), this approach works. We compute the new embedding and its tropicalization in this case, and study the relation between cones in the new embedding and the original embedding.</description>

      <title>Concentration and limit of large random matrices with given margins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study large random matrices with i.i.d. entries conditioned to have prescribed row and column sums (margin). This problem has rich connections to relative entropy minimization, Schr\"{o}dinger bridge, the enumeration of contingency tables, and random graphs with given degree sequences. We show that such margin-constrained random matrix is sharply concentrated around a certain deterministic matrix, which we call the \textit{typical table}. Typical tables have dual characterizations: (1) the expectation of the random matrix ensemble with minimum relative entropy from the base model constrained to have the expected target margin, and (2) the expectation of the maximum likelihood model obtained by rank-one exponential tilting of the base model. The structure of the typical table is dictated by two dual variables, which give the maximum likelihood estimates of the tilting parameters. Based on these results, for a sequence of "tame" margins that converges in \( L^{1} \) to a limiting continuum margin as the size of the matrix diverges, we show that the sequence of margin-constrained random matrices converges in cut norm to a limiting kernel, which is the $L^{2}$-limit of the corresponding rescaled typical tables. The rate of convergence is controlled by how fast the margins converge in $L^{1}$. We derive several new results for random contingency tables from our general framework.</description>

Abstract: A generator matrix of a linear code $\C$ over $\gf(q)$ is also a matrix of the same rank $k$ over any extension field $\gf(q^\ell)$ and generates a linear code of the same length, same dimension and same minimum distance over $\gf(q^\ell)$, denoted by $\C(q|q^\ell)$ and called a lifted code of $\C$. Although $\C$ and their lifted codes $\C(q|q^\ell)$ have the same parameters, they have different weight distributions and different applications. Few results about lifted linear codes are known in the literature. This paper proves some fundamental theory for lifted linear codes, settles the weight distributions of lifted Hamming codes and lifted Simplex codes, and investigates the $2$-designs supported by the lifted Hamming and Simplex codes. Infinite families of $2$-designs are obtained. In addition, an infinite family of two-weight codes and an infinite family of three-weight codes are presented.</description>

      <title>The v-numbers and linear presentations of ideals of covers of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph and let $J=I_c(G)$ be its ideal of covers. The aims of this work are to study the {\rm v}-number ${\rm v}(J)$ of $J$ and to study when $J$ is linearly presented using combinatorics and commutative algebra. We classify when ${\rm v}(J)$ attains its minimum and maximum possible values in terms of the vertex covers of the graph that satisfy the exchange property. If the cover ideal of a graph has a linear presentation, we express its v-number in terms of the covering number of the graph. We show necessary and sufficient conditions for the graph $\mathcal{G}_J$ of $J$ to be connected. One of our main theorems shows that if $G$ has no induced 4-cycles, then $J$ is linearly presented. To prove this theorem, we show three results about unmixed K\"onig graphs related to some results already in the literature. For unmixed graphs without $3$- and $5$-cycles, we classify combinatorially when $J$ is linearly presented, and show that the columns of the linear syzygy matrix of $J$ are linearly independent if and only if $\mathcal{G}_J$ has no strong $3$-cycles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the natural extended-variable formulation for the disjunction of $n+1$ polytopes in $R^d$. We demonstrate that the convex hull $D$ in the natural extended-variable space $R^{d+n}$ is given by full optimal big-M lifting (i) when $d\leq 2$ (and that it is not generally true for $d\geq 3$), and also (ii) under some technical conditions, when the polytopes have a common facet-describing constraint matrix, for arbitrary $d\geq 1$ and $n\geq 1$. Additionally, we give further results on the polyhedral structure of $D$, and we demonstrate that all facets of $D$ can be enumerated in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Distributional limits of graph cuts on discretized grids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph cuts are among the most prominent tools for clustering and classification analysis. While intensively studied from geometric and algorithmic perspectives, graph cut-based statistical inference still remains elusive to a certain extent. Distributional limits are fundamental in understanding and designing such statistical procedures on randomly sampled data. We provide explicit limiting distributions for balanced graph cuts in general on a fixed but arbitrary discretization. In particular, we show that Minimum Cut, Ratio Cut and Normalized Cut behave asymptotically as the minimum of Gaussians as sample size increases. Interestingly, our results reveal a dichotomy for Cheeger Cut: The limiting distribution of the optimal objective value is the minimum of Gaussians only when the optimal partition yields two sets of unequal volumes, while otherwise the limiting distribution is the minimum of a random mixture of Gaussians. Further, we show the bootstrap consistency for all types of graph cuts by utilizing the directional differentiability of cut functionals. We validate these theoretical findings by Monte Carlo experiments, and examine differences between the cuts and the dependency on the underlying distribution. Additionally, we expand our theoretical findings to the Xist algorithm, a computational surrogate of graph cuts recently proposed in Suchan, Li and Munk (arXiv, 2023), thus demonstrating the practical applicability of our findings e.g. in statistical tests.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Regularity Lemma for Semi-Algebraic Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the polynomial method of Guth and Katz to establish stronger and {\it more efficient} regularity and density theorems for such $k$-uniform hypergraphs $H=(P,E)$, where $P$ is a finite point set in ${\mathbb R}^d$, and the edge set $E$ is determined by a semi-algebraic relation of bounded description complexity. In particular, for any $0&lt;\epsilon\leq 1$ we show that one can construct in $O\left(n\log (1/\epsilon)\right)$ time, an equitable partition $P=U_1\uplus \ldots\uplus U_K$ into $K=O(1/\epsilon^{d+1+\delta})$ subsets, for any $0&lt;\delta$, so that all but $\epsilon$-fraction of the $k$-tuples $U_{i_1},\ldots,U_{i_k}$ are {\it homogeneous}: we have that either $U_{i_1}\times\ldots\times U_{i_k}\subseteq E$ or $(U_{i_1}\times\ldots\times U_{i_k})\cap E=\emptyset$. If the points of $P$ can be perturbed in a general position, the bound improves to $O(1/\epsilon^{d+1})$, and the partition is attained via a {\it single partitioning polynomial} (albeit, at expense of a possible increase in worst-case running time). In contrast to the previous such regularity lemmas which were established by Fox, Gromov, Lafforgue, Naor, and Pach and, subsequently, Fox, Pach and Suk, our partition of $P$ does not depend on the edge set $E$ provided its semi-algebraic description complexity does not exceed a certain constant. As a by-product, we show that in any $k$-partite $k$-uniform hypergraph $(P_1\uplus\ldots\uplus P_k,E)$ of bounded semi-algebraic description complexity in ${\mathbb R}^d$ and with $|E|\geq \epsilon \prod_{i=1}^k|P_i|$ edges, one can find, in expected time $O\left(\sum_{i=1}^k|P_i|\log (1/\epsilon)+(1/\epsilon)\log(1/\epsilon)\right)$, subsets $Q_i\subseteq P_i$ of cardinality $|Q_i|\geq |P_i|/\epsilon^{d+1+\delta}$, so that $Q_1\times\ldots\times Q_k\subseteq E$.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Amdeberhan, Sellers and Singh introduced the notion of a generalized cubic partition function $a_c(n)$ and proved two isolated congruences via modular forms, namely $a_3(7n+4)\equiv 0\pmod{7}$ and $a_5(11n+10)\equiv 0\pmod{11}$. In this paper, we prove these congruences using $q$-series manipulations and provide additional congruences for $a_c(n)$ modulo certain primes via modular forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.07176v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blokhuis showed that all maximum cliques in Paley graphs of square order have a subfield structure. Recently, it has been shown that in Peisert-type graphs, all maximum cliques are affine subspaces, and yet some maximum cliques do not arise from a subfield. In this paper, we investigate the existence of a clique of size $\sqrt{q}$ with a subspace structure in pseudo-Paley graphs of order $q$ from unions of semi-primitive cyclotomic classes. We show that such a clique must have an equal contribution from each cyclotomic class and that most such pseudo-Paley graphs do not admit such cliques, suggesting that the Delsarte bound $\sqrt{q}$ on the clique number can be improved in general. We also prove that generalized Peisert graphs are not isomorphic to Paley graphs or Peisert graphs, confirming a conjecture of Mullin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the number of tropical critical points of an affine matroid (M,e) is equal to the beta invariant of M. Motivated by the computation of maximum likelihood degrees, this number is defined to be the degree of the intersection of the Bergman fan of (M,e) and the inverted Bergman fan of N=(M/e)*, where e is an element of M that is neither a loop nor a coloop. Equivalently, for a generic weight vector w on E-e, this is the number of ways to find weights (0,x) on M and y on N with x+y=w such that on each circuit of M (resp. N), the minimum x-weight (resp. y-weight) occurs at least twice. This answers a question of Sturmfels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of curvature on graphs has recently gained traction in the networks community, with the Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC) in particular being used for several tasks in network analysis, such as community detection. In this work, we choose a different approach and study augmentations of the discretization of the Ricci curvature proposed by Forman (AFRC). We empirically and theoretically investigate its relation to the ORC and the un-augmented Forman-Ricci curvature. In particular, we provide evidence that the AFRC frequently gives sufficient insight into the structure of a network to be used for community detection, and therefore provides a computationally cheaper alternative to previous ORC-based methods. Our novel AFRC-based community detection algorithm is competitive with an ORC-based approach.</description>

      <title>Treewidth is Polynomial in Maximum Degree on Weakly Sparse Graphs Excluding a Planar Induced Minor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ contains a graph $H$ as an induced minor if $H$ can be obtained from $G$ after vertex deletions and edge contractions. We show that for every $k$-vertex planar graph $H$, every graph $G$ excluding $H$ as an induced minor and $K_{t,t}$ as a subgraph has treewidth at most $\Delta(G)^{f(k,t)}$ where $\Delta(G)$ denotes the maximum degree of $G$. Without requiring the absence of a $K_{t,t}$ subgraph, Korhonen [JCTB '23] has shown the upper bound of $k^{O(1)} 2^{\Delta(G)^5}$ whose dependence in $\Delta(G)$ is exponential. Our result partially answers a question of Chudnovsky [Dagstuhl seminar '23] asking whether the treewidth of graphs with $\Delta(G)=O(\log{|V(G)|})$ excluding both a $k$-vertex planar graph as an induced minor and the biclique $K_{t,t}$ as a subgraph is in $O_{k,t}(\log |V(G)|)$. We confirm that the treewidth is in this case polylogarithmic in $|V(G)|$.</description>

      <title>Numerical semigroups, polyhedra, and posets IV: walking the faces of the Kunz cone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A numerical semigroup is a cofinite subset of $\mathbb Z_{\ge 0}$ containing $0$ and closed under addition. Each numerical semigroup $S$ with smallest positive element $m$ corresponds to an integer point in the Kunz cone $\mathcal C_m \subseteq \mathbb R^{m-1}$, and the face of $\mathcal C_m$ containing that integer point determines certain algebraic properties of $S$. In this paper, we introduce the Kunz fan, a pure, polyhedral cone complex comprised of a faithful projection of certain faces of $\mathcal C_m$. We characterize several aspects of the Kunz fan in terms of the combinatorics of Kunz nilsemigroups, which are known to index the faces of $\mathcal C_m$, and our results culminate in a method of "walking" the face lattice of the Kunz cone in a manner analogous to that of a Gr\"obner walk. We apply our results in several contexts, including a wealth of computational data obtained from the aforementioned "walks" and a proof of a recent conjecture concerning which numerical semigroups achieve the highest minimal presentation cardinality when one fixes the smallest positive element and the number of generators.</description>

Abstract: A conjecture of Erd\H{o}s, Graham, Montgomery, Rothschild, Spencer and Straus states that, with the exception of equilateral triangles, any two-coloring of the plane will have a monochromatic congruent copy of every three-point configuration. This conjecture is known only for special classes of configurations.

Abstract: A graph $G$ is $k$-locally sparse if for each vertex $v \in V(G)$, the subgraph induced by its neighborhood contains at most $k$ edges. Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov showed that for $f &gt; 0$ if a graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ is $\Delta^2/f$-locally-sparse, then $\chi(G) = O\left(\Delta/\log f\right)$. We introduce a more general notion of local sparsity by defining graphs $G$ to be $(k, F)$-locally-sparse for some graph $F$ if for each vertex $v \in V(G)$ the subgraph induced by the neighborhood of $v$ contains at most $k$ copies of $F$. Employing the R\"{o}dl nibble method, we prove the following generalization of the above result: for every bipartite graph $F$, if $G$ is $(k, F)$-locally-sparse, then $\chi(G) = O\left( \Delta /\log\left(\Delta k^{-1/|V(F)|}\right)\right)$. This improves upon results of Davies, Kang, Pirot, and Sereni who consider the case when $F$ is a path. Our results also recover the best known bound on $\chi(G)$ when $G$ is $K_{1, t, t}$-free for $t \geq 4$, and hold for list and correspondence coloring in the more general so-called ''color-degree'' setting.</description>

      <title>Identifying codes in graphs of given maximum degree: Characterizing trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $\textit{identifying code}$ of a closed-twin-free graph $G$ is a dominating set $S$ of vertices of $G$ such that any two vertices in $G$ have a distinct intersection between their closed neighborhoods and $S$. It was conjectured that there exists an absolute constant $c$ such that for every connected graph $G$ of order $n$ and maximum degree $\Delta$, the graph $G$ admits an identifying code of size at most $( \frac{\Delta-1}{\Delta} )n +c$. We provide significant support for this conjecture by exactly characterizing every tree requiring a positive constant $c$ together with the exact value of the constant. Hence, proving the conjecture for trees. For $\Delta=2$ (the graph is a path or a cycle), it is long known that $c=3/2$ suffices. For trees, for each $\Delta\ge 3$, we show that $c=1/\Delta\le 1/3$ suffices and that $c$ is required to have a positive value only for a finite number of trees. In particular, for $\Delta = 3$, there are 12 trees with a positive constant $c$ and, for each $\Delta \ge 4$, the only tree with positive constant $c$ is the $\Delta$-star. Our proof is based on induction and utilizes recent results from [F. Foucaud, T. Lehtil\"a. Revisiting and improving upper bounds for identifying codes. SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, 2022]. We remark that there are infinitely many trees for which the bound is tight when $\Delta=3$; for every $\Delta\ge 4$, we construct an infinite family of trees of order $n$ with identification number very close to the bound, namely $\left( \frac{\Delta-1+\frac{1}{\Delta-2}}{\Delta+\frac{2}{\Delta-2}} \right) n &gt; (\frac{\Delta-1}{\Delta} ) n -\frac{n}{\Delta^2}$. Furthermore, we also give a new tight upper bound for identification number on trees by showing that the sum of the domination and identification numbers of any tree $T$ is at most its number of vertices.</description>

      <title>Identifying codes in triangle-free graphs of bounded maximum degree</title>

Abstract: An $\textit{identifying code}$ of a closed-twin-free graph $G$ is a set $S$ of vertices of $G$ such that any two vertices in $G$ have a distinct intersection between their closed neighborhood and $S$. It was conjectured that there exists a constant $c$ such that for every connected closed-twin-free graph $G$ of order $n$ and maximum degree $\Delta$, the graph $G$ admits an identifying code of size at most $\left( \frac{\Delta-1}{\Delta} \right) n+c$. In [D. Chakraborty, F. Foucaud, M. A. Henning, and T. Lehtil\"{a}. Identifying codes in graphs of given maximum degree: Characterizing trees. arXiv preprint arXiv:2403.13172, 2024], we proved the conjecture for all trees. In this article, we show that the conjecture holds for all triangle-free graphs, with the same list of exceptional graphs needing $c&gt;0$ as for trees: for $\Delta\ge 3$, $c=1/3$ suffices and there is only a set of 12 trees requiring $c&gt;0$ for $\Delta=3$, and when $\Delta\ge 4$ this set is reduced to the $\Delta$-star only. Our proof is by induction, whose starting point is the above result for trees. Along the way, we prove a generalized version of Bondy's theorem on induced subsets [J. A. Bondy. Induced subsets. Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B, 1972] that we use as a tool in our proofs. We also use our main result for triangle-free graphs, to prove the upper bound $\left( \frac{\Delta-1}{\Delta} \right) n+1/\Delta+4t$ for graphs that can be made triangle-free by the removal of $t$ edges.</description>

      <title>Almost $t$-intersecting families for vector spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space over a finite field, and $\mathcal{F}$ a family consisting of $k$-subspaces of $V$. The family $\mathcal{F}$ is called $t$-intersecting if $\dim(F_{1}\cap F_{2})\geq t$ for any $F_{1}, F_{2}\in \mathcal{F}$. We say $\mathcal{F}$ is almost $t$-intersecting if for each $F\in \mathcal{F}$ there is at most one member $F^{\prime}$ of $\mathcal{F}$ such that $\dim(F\cap F^{\prime})&lt;t$. In this paper, we prove that almost $t$-intersecting families with maximum size are $t$-intersecting. We also consider almost $t$-intersecting families which are not $t$-intersecting, and characterize such families with maximum size for $t\geq2$. The results for almost $1$-intersecting families provided by Shan and Zhou are generalized.</description>

      <title>Graceful coloring is computationally hard</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a (proper) vertex coloring $f$ of a graph $G$, say $f\colon V(G)\to \mathbb{N}$, the difference edge labelling induced by $f$ is a function $h\colon E(G)\to \mathbb{N}$ defined as $h(uv)=|f(u)-f(v)|$ for every edge $uv$ of $G$. A graceful coloring of $G$ is a vertex coloring $f$ of $G$ such that the difference edge labelling $h$ induced by $f$ is a (proper) edge coloring of $G$. A graceful coloring with range $\{1,2,\dots,k\}$ is called a graceful $k$-coloring. The least integer $k$ such that $G$ admits a graceful $k$-coloring is called the graceful chromatic number of $G$, denoted by $\chi_g(G)$.
  We prove that $\chi(G^2)\leq \chi_g(G)\leq a(\chi(G^2))$ for every graph $G$, where $a(n)$ denotes the $n$th term of the integer sequence A065825 in OEIS. We also prove that graceful coloring problem is NP-hard for planar bipartite graphs, regular graphs and 2-degenerate graphs. In particular, we show that for each $k\geq 5$, it is NP-complete to check whether a planar bipartite graph of maximum degree $k-2$ is graceful $k$-colorable. The complexity of checking whether a planar graph is graceful 4-colorable remains open.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07486v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve a classical counting problem for non-degenerate forms of symplectic and hermitian type defined on a vector space: given a subspace $\pi$, we find the number of non-singular subspaces that are trivially intersecting with $\pi$ and span a non-singular subspace with $\pi$. Lower bounds for the quantity of such pairs where $\pi$ is non-singular were first studied in ``Glasby, Niemeyer, Praeger (Finite Fields Appl., 2022)'', which was later improved in ``Glasby, Ihringer, Mattheus (Des. Codes Cryptogr., 2023)'' and generalised in ``Glasby, Niemeyer, Praeger (Linear Algebra Appl., 2022)''. In this paper, we derive explicit formulae, which allow us to give the exact proportion and improve the known lower bounds.</description>

Abstract: In [5], Elnitsky constructed three elegant bijections between classes of reduced words for Type $\mathrm{A}$, $\mathrm{B}$ and $\mathrm{D}$ families of Coxeter groups and certain tilings of polygons. This paper offers a particular generalization of this concept to all finite Coxeter Groups in terms of embeddings into the Symmetric Group.

      <title>Dispersion on the Complete Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a synchronous process of particles moving on the vertices of a graph $G$, introduced by Cooper, McDowell, Radzik, Rivera and Shiraga (2018). Initially,~$M$ particles are placed on a vertex of $G$. At the beginning of each time step, for every vertex inhabited by at least two particles, each of these particles moves independently to a neighbour chosen uniformly at random. The process ends at the first step when no vertex is inhabited by more than one particle.
  Cooper et al. showed that when the underlying graph is the complete graph on~$n$ vertices, then there is a phase transition when the number of particles $M = n/2$. They showed that if $M&lt;(1-\varepsilon)n/2$ for some fixed $\varepsilon&gt;0$, then the process finishes in a logarithmic number of steps, while if $M&gt;(1+\varepsilon)n/2$, an exponential number of steps are required with high probability. Here we provide a thorough asymptotic analysis of the dispersion time around criticality, where $\varepsilon = o(1)$, and describe the transition from logarithmic to exponential time. As a consequence of our results we establish, for example, that the dispersion time is in probability and in expectation in $\Theta(n^{1/2})$ when $|\varepsilon| = O(n^{-1/2})$, and provide qualitative bounds for its tail behavior.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansions relating to the lengths of longest monotone subsequences of involutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03798v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the distribution of the length of longest monotone subsequences in random (fixed-point free) involutions of $n$ integers as $n$ grows large, establishing asymptotic expansions in powers of $n^{-1/6}$ in the general case and in powers of $n^{-1/3}$ in the fixed-point free cases. Whilst the limit laws were shown by Baik and Rains to be one of the Tracy-Widom distributions $F_\beta$ for $\beta=1$ or $\beta=4$, we find explicit analytic expressions of the first few expansion terms as linear combinations of higher order derivatives of $F_\beta$ with rational polynomial coefficients. Our derivation is based on a concept of generalized analytic de-Poissonization and is subject to the validity of certain hypotheses for which we provide compelling (computational) evidence. In a preparatory step expansions of the hard-to-soft edge transition laws of L$\beta$E are studied, which are lifted into expansions of the generalized Poissonized length distributions for large intensities. (This paper continues our work arXiv:2301.02022, which established similar results in the case of general permutations and $\beta=2$.)</description>

Abstract: Let G be a numerical semigroup. In this paper, we prove an upper bound for the Betti numbers of the semigroup ring of G which depends only on the width of G, that is, the difference between the largest and the smallest generator of G. In this way, we make progress towards a conjecture of Herzog and Stamate. Moreover, for 4-generated numerical semigroups, the first significant open case, we prove the Herzog-Stamate bound for all but finitely many values of the width.</description>

      <title>Average-Case Matrix Discrepancy: Asymptotics and Online Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the operator norm discrepancy of i.i.d. random matrices, initiating the matrix-valued analog of a long line of work on the $\ell^{\infty}$ norm discrepancy of i.i.d. random vectors. First, using repurposed results on vector discrepancy and new first moment method calculations, we give upper and lower bounds on the discrepancy of random matrices. We treat i.i.d. matrices drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) and low-rank Gaussian Wishart distributions. In both cases, for what turns out to be the "critical" number of $\Theta(n^2)$ matrices of dimension $n \times n$, we identify the discrepancy up to constant factors. Second, we give a new analysis of the matrix hyperbolic cosine algorithm of Zouzias (2011), a matrix version of an online vector discrepancy algorithm of Spencer (1977) studied for average-case inputs by Bansal and Spencer (2020), for the case of i.i.d. random matrix inputs. We both give a general analysis and extract concrete bounds on the discrepancy achieved by this algorithm for matrices with independent entries (including GOE matrices) and Gaussian Wishart matrices.</description>

Abstract: We consider the representation theory of the Ariki-Koike algebra, a $q$-deformation of the group algebra of the complex reflection group $C_r \wr S_n$. We define the addition of a runner full of beads for the abacus display of a multipartition and investigate some combinatorial properties of this operation. We focus our attention on the $q$-decomposition numbers, i.e. the polynomials arising from the Fock space representation of the quantum group $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_e)$. Using Fayers' LLT-type algorithm for Ariki-Koike algebras, we relate $q$-decomposition numbers for different values of $e$ for the class of $e$-multiregular multipartitions, by adding a full runner of beads to each component of the abacus displays for the labelling multipartitions.</description>

Abstract: We prove that a connected, locally finite, quasi-transitive graph which is quasi-isometric to a planar graph is necessarily accessible. This leads to a complete classification of the finitely generated groups which are quasi-isometric to planar graphs. In particular, such a group is virtually a free product of free and surface groups, and thus virtually admits a planar Cayley graph.</description>

      <title>Identifying circular orders for blobs in phylogenetic networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interest in the inference of evolutionary networks relating species or populations has grown with the increasing recognition of the importance of hybridization, gene flow and admixture, and the availability of large-scale genomic data. However, what network features may be validly inferred from various data types under different models remains poorly understood. Previous work has largely focused on level-1 networks, in which reticulation events are well separated, and on a general network's tree of blobs, the tree obtained by contracting every blob to a node. An open question is the identifiability of the topology of a blob of unknown level. We consider the identifiability of the circular order in which subnetworks attach to a blob, first proving that this order is well-defined for outer-labeled planar blobs. For this class of blobs, we show that the circular order information from 4-taxon subnetworks identifies the full circular order of the blob. Similarly, the circular order from 3-taxon rooted subnetworks identifies the full circular order of a rooted blob. We then show that subnetwork circular information is identifiable from certain data types and evolutionary models. This provides a general positive result for high-level networks, on the identifiability of the ordering in which taxon blocks attach to blobs in outer-labeled planar networks. Finally, we give examples of blobs with different internal structures which cannot be distinguished under many models and data types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deletion order of a finitely generated Coxeter group W is a total order on the elements which, as is proved, is a refinement of the Bruhat order. This order is applied in [8] to construct Elnitsky tilings for any finite Coxeter group. Employing the deletion order, a corresponding normal form of an element w of W is defined which is shown to be the same as the normal form of w using right to left lexicographic ordering. Further results on the deletion order are obtained relating to the property of being Artinian and, when W is finite, its interplay with the longest element of W.</description>

      <title>SL(2,Z)-matrixizations of generalized Markov numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $k\geq 0$, a $k$-generalized Markov number is an integer which appears in some positive integer solution to the $k$-generalized Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k(yz + zx + xy) = (3 + 3k)xyz$. In this paper, we discuss a combinatorial structure of generalized Markov numbers. To investigate this structure in detail, we use two families of matrices: the $k$-generalized Cohn matrices and the $k$-Markov-monodromy matrices, which are elements of $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ whose $(1,2)$-entries are $k$-generalized Markov numbers. We show that these two families of matrices recover the tree structure of the positive integer solutions to the generalized Markov equation, and we give geometric interpretations and a combinatorial interpretation of $k$-generalized Markov numbers. As an application, we provide a computation algorithm of classical Markov number from a one-dimensional dynamical viewpoint. Moreover, we clarify a relation between $k$-generalized Markov numbers and toric surface singularities via continued fractions.</description>

The model is then used to count the number of $d$-term silting objects for linearly oriented $A_n$, recovering the result that they are counted by the Pfaff-Fuss-Catalan numbers.</description>
