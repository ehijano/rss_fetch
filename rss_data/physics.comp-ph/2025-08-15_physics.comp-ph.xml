      <title>MCP-Enabled LLM for Meta-optics Inverse Design: Leveraging Differentiable Solver without LLM Expertise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic differentiation (AD) enables powerful metasurface inverse design but requires extensive theoretical and programming expertise. We present a Model Context Protocol (MCP) assisted framework that allows researchers to conduct inverse design with differentiable solvers through large language models (LLMs). Since LLMs inherently lack knowledge of specialized solvers, our proposed solution provides dynamic access to verified code templates and comprehensive documentation through dedicated servers. The LLM autonomously accesses these resources to generate complete inverse design codes without prescribed coordination rules. Evaluation on the Huygens meta-atom design task with the differentiable TorchRDIT solver shows that while both natural language and structured prompting strategies achieve high success rates, structured prompting significantly outperforms in design quality, workflow efficiency, computational cost, and error reduction. The minimalist server design, using only 5 APIs, demonstrates how MCP makes sophisticated computational tools accessible to researchers without programming expertise, offering a generalizable integration solution for other scientific tasks.</description>

      <title>Sum-of-Gaussians tensor neural networks for high-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an accurate, efficient, and low-memory sum-of-Gaussians tensor neural network (SOG-TNN) algorithm for solving the high-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation. The SOG-TNN utilizes a low-rank tensor product representation of the solution to overcome the curse of dimensionality associated with high-dimensional integration. To handle the Coulomb interaction, we introduce an SOG decomposition to approximate the interaction kernel such that it is dimensionally separable, leading to a tensor representation with rapid convergence. We further develop a range-splitting scheme that partitions the Gaussian terms into short-, long-, and mid-range components. They are treated with the asymptotic expansion, the low-rank Chebyshev expansion, and the model reduction with singular-value decomposition, respectively, significantly reducing the number of two-dimensional integrals in computing electron-electron interactions. The SOG decomposition well resolves the computational challenge due to the singularity of the Coulomb interaction, leading to an efficient algorithm for the high-dimensional problem under the TNN framework. Numerical results demonstrate the outstanding performance of the new method, revealing that the SOG-TNN is a promising way for tackling large and complex quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Virtual Sensing for Solder Layer Degradation and Temperature Monitoring in IGBT Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring the degradation state of Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) modules is essential for ensuring the reliability and longevity of power electronic systems, especially in safety-critical and high-performance applications. However, direct measurement of key degradation indicators - such as junction temperature, solder fatigue or delamination - remains challenging due to the physical inaccessibility of internal components and the harsh environment. In this context, machine learning-based virtual sensing offers a promising alternative by bridging the gap from feasible sensor placement to the relevant but inaccessible locations. This paper explores the feasibility of estimating the degradation state of solder layers, and the corresponding full temperature maps based on a limited number of physical sensors. Based on synthetic data of a specific degradation mode, we obtain a high accuracy in the estimation of the degraded solder area (1.17% mean absolute error), and are able to reproduce the surface temperature of the IGBT with a maximum relative error of 4.56% (corresponding to an average relative error of 0.37%).</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Deep Contrast Source Inversion: A Unified Framework for Inverse Scattering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse scattering problems are critical in electromagnetic imaging and medical diagnostics but are challenged by their nonlinearity and diverse measurement scenarios. This paper proposes a physics-informed deep contrast source inversion framework (DeepCSI) for fast and accurate medium reconstruction across various measurement conditions. Inspired by contrast source inversion (CSI) and neural operator methods, a residual multilayer perceptron (ResMLP) is employed to model current distributions in the region of interest under different transmitter excitations, effectively linearizing the nonlinear inverse scattering problem and significantly reducing the computational cost of traditional full-waveform inversion. By modeling medium parameters as learnable tensors and utilizing a hybrid loss function that integrates state equation loss, data equation loss, and total variation regularization, DeepCSI establishes a fully differentiable framework for joint optimization of network parameters and medium properties. Compared with conventional methods, DeepCSI offers advantages in terms of simplicity and universal modeling capabilities for diverse measurement scenarios, including phase-less and multi-frequency observation. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that DeepCSI achieves high-precision, robust reconstruction under full-data, phaseless data, and multifrequency conditions, outperforming traditional CSI methods and providing an efficient and universal solution for complex inverse scattering problems.</description>

      <title>FreeBird.jl: An Extensible Toolbox for Simulating Interfacial Phase Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present FreeBird.jl, an extensible Julia-based platform for computational studies of phase equilibria at generic interfaces. The package supports a range of system configurations, from atomistic solid surfaces to coarse-grained lattice$-$gas models, with energies evaluated using classical interatomic potentials or lattice Hamiltonians. Both atomistic and lattice systems accommodate single- or multi-component mixtures with flexibly definable surface and lattice geometries. Implemented sampling algorithms include nested sampling, Wang$-$Landau sampling, Metropolis Monte Carlo, and, for tractable lattice systems, exact enumeration. Leveraging Julia's type hierarchies and multiple dispatch, FreeBird.jl provides a modular interface that allows seamless integration of system definitions, energy evaluators, and sampling schemes. Designed for flexibility, extensibility, and performance, FreeBird.jl offers a versatile framework for exploring the thermodynamics of interfacial phenomena.</description>

      <title>Type-I Multiferroic VHfO$_4$ with Strain-Switchable Magnetic Orders and Magnetoelectric Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the complementary properties of vanadium-based ferromagnets and HfO$_2$-based ferroelectrics, we propose a novel multiferroic oxide, VHfO$_4$, through 50\% Hf$^{4+}$ substitution with V$^{4+}$ in the ferroelectric $Pca2_1$ phase of HfO$_2$. First-principles DFT calculations reveal that the $Pca2_1$-like VHfO$_4$ phase exhibits dynamic stability and concurrent ferroic orders: robust ferroelectric polarization comparable to HfO$_2$ and V-driven magnetism. Parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations identify an antiferromagnetic ground state, while strain engineering enables tunable magnetoelectric coupling. Biaxial in-plane strain induces four magnetic states: intralayer FM/interlayer AFM, intralayer AFM/interlayer FM, spiral-like non-collinear order, and discrete alternating spin alignment. Critically, $c$-axis strain modulates magnetic energy landscapes, demonstrating electromechanical control of magnetism. This work establishes VHfO$_4$ as a Type-I multiferroic with coexisting atomic-scale ferroic origins and strain-tunable cross-coupling, offering a platform for voltage-controlled spintronics devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a real-space renormalization group algorithm for accurately coarse-graining two-dimensional tensor networks. The central innovation of our method lies in utilizing variational boundary tensors as a globally optimized environment for the entire system. Based on this optimized environment, we construct renormalization projectors that significantly enhance accuracy. By leveraging the canonical form of tensors, our algorithm maintains the same computational complexity as the original tensor renormalization group (TRG) method, yet achieves higher accuracy than existing approaches that do not incorporate entanglement filtering. Our work offers a practical pathway for extending TRG methods to higher dimensions while keeping computational costs manageable.</description>

      <title>Compressible boundary layers over isotropic porous surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A compressible laminar boundary layer developing over an isotropic porous substrate is investigated by asymptotic and numerical methods. The substrate is modeled as an array of cubes. The momentum and enthalpy balance equations are derived by volume averaging. The self-similar solution proposed by Tsiberkin (2018) [Transp. Porous Media 121(1):109-120] for streamwise-growing permeability is extended to include compressibility, heat conduction and a nonlinear drag. The velocity profile shows an inflection point at the free fluid-porous interfacial layer, below which it decreases to zero. A marked reduction of the adiabatic recovery temperature of the fluid and the velocity gradient at the interface is observed for high porosity, large grains and relatively high Mach numbers. The temperature imposed at the bottom of the porous substrate has a negligible influence on the shear stresses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a rapid, accurate framework for computing atomic migration barriers in crystals by combining universal machine learning force fields (MLFFs) with 3D potential energy surface sampling and interpolation. Our method suppresses periodic self interactions via supercell expansion, builds a continuous PES from MLFF energies on a spatial grid, and extracts minimum energy pathways without predefined NEB images. Across twelve benchmark electrode and electrolyte materials including LiCoO2, LiFePO4, and LGPS our MLFF-derived barriers lie within tens of meV of DFT and experiment, while achieving ~10^2 x speedups over DFT-NEB. We benchmark GPTFF, CHGNet, and MACE, show that fine-tuning on PBE/PBE+U data further enhances accuracy, and provide an open-source package for high-throughput materials screening and interactive PES visualization.</description>

      <title>Simulating Mass-Dependent Decoherence in Quantum Computers: Baseline Signatures for Testing Gravity-Induced Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum computing simulation study of mass-dependent decoherence models inspired by Penrose's gravity-induced collapse hypothesis. According to objective reduction (OR) theory, quantum superpositions become unstable when the gravitational self-energy difference between branches exceeds a certain threshold, leading to a collapse time $\tau \approx \hbar / E_G$. In this work, we implement a mass-dependent dephasing noise channel, $p(m) = 1 - e^{-k m^{\alpha}}$, within the Qiskit AerSimulator, where $m$ is a proxy for the effective mass of a superposition, mapped to circuit parameters such as the number of entangled qubits or branch size. We apply this model to three canonical quantum computing experiments: GHZ state parity measurements, branch-mass entanglement tests, and Grover's search to generate distinctive collapse signatures that differ qualitatively from constant-rate dephasing. The resulting patterns serve as a baseline reference: if future hardware experiments exhibit the same scaling trends under ideal isolation, this could indicate a contribution from mass-dependent collapse processes. Conversely, deviation toward constant-noise behaviour would suggest the absence of such gravitationally induced effects. Our results provide a reproducible protocol and reference for using quantum computers as potential testbeds for probing fundamental questions in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific progress is tightly coupled to the emergence of new research tools. Today, machine learning (ML)-especially deep learning (DL)-has become a transformative instrument for quantum science and technology. Owing to the intrinsic complexity of quantum systems, DL enables efficient exploration of large parameter spaces, extraction of patterns from experimental data, and data-driven guidance for research directions. These capabilities already support tasks such as refining quantum control protocols and accelerating the discovery of materials with targeted quantum properties, making ML/DL literacy an essential skill for the next generation of quantum scientists. At the same time, DL's power brings risks: models can overfit noisy data, obscure causal structure, and yield results with limited physical interpretability. Recognizing these limitations and deploying mitigation strategies is crucial for scientific rigor. These lecture notes provide a comprehensive, graduate-level introduction to DL for quantum applications, combining conceptual exposition with hands-on examples. Organized as a progressive sequence, they aim to equip readers to decide when and how to apply DL effectively, to understand its practical constraints, and to adapt AI methods responsibly to problems across quantum physics, chemistry, and engineering.</description>

      <title>AEGISS -- Atomic orbital and Entropy-based Guided Inference for Space Selection -- A novel semi-automated active space selection workflow for quantum chemistry and quantum computing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The selection of a balanced active space is a critical step in multi-reference quantum chemistry calculations, particularly for systems with strong electron correlation. Likewise, active space selection is a key to unlock the potential of contemporary quantum computing in quantum chemistry. Albeit recent progress, there remains a lack of a unified, robust, and fully automated framework for active space selection that performs reliably across a wide range of molecular systems.
  In this work, we present a novel approach inspired by both the AVAS (Atomic Valence Active Space) and AutoCAS methods. Our method unifies orbital entropy analysis with atomic orbital projections to guide the construction of chemically and physically meaningful active spaces. This integrated scheme enables a more consistent and flexible selection of active orbitals while retaining automation and scalability. We validate our approach on a set of molecular systems relevant to photodynamic therapy, in particular a set of Ru(II)-complexes, selected to span increasing levels of electron correlation and structural complexity. These molecules serve as challenging test cases due to the presence of strong static correlation and the need for highly accurate electronic structure descriptions. Our results demonstrate that the method can reliably identify compact, chemically intuitive active spaces that capture the essential physics, making it suitable for both classical and quantum computational frameworks.
  Furthermore, we have developed this approach in a package that is intuitive to use for users and can be interfaced with both standard quantum chemistry and quantum computing applications, making it accessible to a broad research community.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Constrained Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Graphene Electronic Band Structure Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of electronic band structures in two-dimensional materials remains a fundamental challenge, with existing methods struggling to balance computational efficiency and physical accuracy. We present the Symmetry-Constrained Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural Network (SCMS-PINN) v35, which directly learns graphene band structures while rigorously enforcing crystallographic symmetries through a multi-head architecture. Our approach introduces three specialized ResNet-6 pathways -- K-head for Dirac physics, M-head for saddle points, and General head for smooth interpolation -- operating on 31 physics-informed features extracted from k-points. Progressive Dirac constraint scheduling systematically increases the weight parameter from 5.0 to 25.0, enabling hierarchical learning from global topology to local critical physics. Training on 10,000 k-points over 300 epochs achieves 99.99\% reduction in training loss (34.597 to 0.003) with validation loss of 0.0085. The model predicts Dirac point gaps within 30.3 $\mu$eV of theoretical zero and achieves average errors of 53.9 meV (valence) and 40.5 meV (conduction) across the Brillouin zone. All twelve C$_{6v}$ operations are enforced through systematic averaging, guaranteeing exact symmetry preservation. This framework establishes a foundation for extending physics-informed learning to broader two-dimensional materials for accelerated discovery.</description>

      <title>Run-and-Tumble Escape in Pursuit-Evasion Dynamics of Intelligent Active Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pursuit-evasion game is studied for two adversarial active agents, modelled as a deterministic self-steering pursuer and a stochastic, cognitive evader. The pursuer chases the evader by reorienting its propulsion direction with limited maneuverability, while the evader escapes by executing sharp, unpredictable turns, whose timing and direction the pursuer cannot anticipate. To make the target responsive and agile when the threat level is high, the tumbling frequency is set to increase with decreasing distance from the pursuer; furthermore, the range of preferred tumbling directions is varied. Numerical simulations of such a pursuit-target pair in two spatial dimensions reveal two important scenarios. For dominant pursuers, the evader is compelled to adopt a high-risk strategy that allows the pursuer to approach closely before the evader executes a potentially game-changing backward maneuver to pull away from the pursuer. Otherwise, a strategy where the evader tumbles forward with continuous slight adjustments of the propulsion direction can significantly increase the capture time by preventing the pursuer from aligning with the target propulsion direction, while maintaining the persistence of the target motion. Our results can guide the design of bioinspired robotic systems with efficient evasion capabilities.</description>

      <title>Relative accuracy of turbulence simulations using pseudo-spectral and finite difference solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a single timestep, a spectral solver is known to be more accurate than its finite-difference counterpart. However, as we show in this paper, turbulence simulations using the two methods have nearly the same accuracy. In this paper, we simulate forced hydrodynamic turbulence on a uniform 256$^3$ grid for Reynolds numbers 965, 1231, 1515, and 1994. We show that the two methods yield nearly the same evolution for the total energy and the flow profiles. In addition, the steady-state energy spectrum, energy flux, and probability distribution functions of the velocity and its derivatives are very similar. We argue that within a turbulence attractor, the numerical errors are likely to get cancelled (rather than get added up), which leads to similar results for the finite-difference and spectral methods. These findings are very valuable, considering that a parallel finite-difference simulation is more versatile and efficient (for large grids) than its spectral counterpart.</description>

      <title>Performance of universal machine-learned potentials with explicit long-range interactions in biomolecular simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal machine-learned potentials promise transferable accuracy across compositional and vibrational degrees of freedom, yet their application to biomolecular simulations remains underexplored. This work systematically evaluates equivariant message-passing architectures trained on the SPICE-v2 dataset with and without explicit long-range dispersion and electrostatics. We assess the impact of model size, training data composition, and electrostatic treatment across in- and out-of-distribution benchmark datasets, as well as molecular simulations of bulk liquid water, aqueous NaCl solutions, and biomolecules, including alanine tripeptide, the mini-protein Trp-cage, and Crambin. While larger models improve accuracy on benchmark datasets, this trend does not consistently extend to properties obtained from simulations. Predicted properties also depend on the composition of the training dataset. Long-range electrostatics show no systematic impact across systems. However, for Trp-cage, their inclusion yields increased conformational variability. Our results suggest that imbalanced datasets and immature evaluation practices currently challenge the applicability of universal machine-learned potentials to biomolecular simulations.</description>

      <title>New analytic formulae for memory and prediction functions in reservoir computers with time delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time delays increase the effective dimensionality of reservoirs, thus suggesting that time delays in reservoirs can enhance their performance, particularly their memory and prediction abilities. We find new closed-form expressions for memory and prediction functions of linear time-delayed reservoirs in terms of the power spectrum of the input and the reservoir transfer function. We confirm this relationship numerically for some time-delayed reservoirs using simulations, including when the reservoir can be linearized but is actually nonlinear. Finally, we use these closed-form formulae to address the utility of multiple time delays in linear reservoirs in order to perform memory and prediction, finding similar results to previous work on nonlinear reservoirs. We hope these closed-form formulae can be used to understand memory and predictive capabilities in time-delayed reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Bridging Quantum Mechanics to Organic Liquid Properties via a Universal Force Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are essential tools for unraveling atomistic insights into the structure and dynamics of condensed-phase systems. However, the universal and accurate prediction of macroscopic properties from ab initio calculations remains a significant challenge, often hindered by the trade-off between computational cost and simulation accuracy. Here, we present ByteFF-Pol, a graph neural network (GNN)-parameterized polarizable force field, trained exclusively on high-level quantum mechanics (QM) data. Leveraging physically-motivated force field forms and training strategies, ByteFF-Pol exhibits exceptional performance in predicting thermodynamic and transport properties for a wide range of small-molecule liquids and electrolytes, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) classical and machine learning force fields. The zero-shot prediction capability of ByteFF-Pol bridges the gap between microscopic QM calculations and macroscopic liquid properties, enabling the exploration of previously intractable chemical spaces. This advancement holds transformative potential for applications such as electrolyte design and custom-tailored solvent, representing a pivotal step toward data-driven materials discovery.</description>

      <title>What metric to optimize for suppressing instability in a Vlasov-Poisson system?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stabilizing plasma dynamics is an important task in green energy generation via fusion. A common strategy is to introduce an external field to prevent the plasma distribution from becoming turbulent. However, finding such external fields efficiently remains an open question, even for simplified models such as the Vlasov-Poisson (VP) system. In this work, we present an integrated method where we first perform an analytical derivation of the VP system's dispersion relation to construct a high-quality initial guess for the stabilizing field. This analytically-derived field is then used to initialize a PDE-constrained optimization loop that refines the control to a local optimum. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that objective functions evaluated only at the target time-when stable plasma is desired-lead to highly non-convex optimization landscapes, making the global minimum difficult to locate. This behavior arises regardless of the choice of loss function (e.g., KL divergence or electric energy). In contrast, integrating the loss function over time yields a landscape with a convex basin near the global minimum, facilitating convergence. Furthermore, when using electric energy as the objective, the landscape outside this basin is dominated by flat, unphysical local minima, highlighting the critical importance of our analytical approach for generating an initial guess that lies within the global minimum's basin of attraction.</description>

      <title>Critical Behavior Analysis of Pure Dipolar Triangular Lattice via Equilibrium and Non-Equilibrium Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic thin films and 2D arrays of magnetic nanoparticles exhibit unique physical properties that make them valuable for a wide range of technological applications. In such systems, dipolar interactions play a crucial role in determining their physical behavior. However, due to the anisotropic and long-range nature of dipolar interactions, conventional Monte Carlo (MC) methods face challenges in investigating these systems near criticality. In this study, we examine the critical behavior of a triangular lattice of XY dipoles using the optimized Tomita MC algorithm tailored for dipolar interactions. We employ two independent computational approaches to estimate the critical temperature and exponents: equilibrium MC simulations with histogram reweighting and the non-equilibrium relaxation method. Notably, both approaches demonstrate that this XY dipolar system might be in a new universality class very close to the 2D Ising universality class.</description>

      <title>Boundary layer flow dynamics of propulsive flapping foils with increasing Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study flapping foils at optimally propulsive Strouhal number $St=0.3$ with increasing chord-based Reynolds number at $Re = 10^4$, $10^5$, and $10^6$ to examine changes in their unsteady boundary layers. Despite being prescribed the same freestream, the inner boundary layer characteristics exhibit different trends due to the generation of leading-edge vortices (LEVs) and their advection into the downstream flow. Propulsive flapping foils show an extended laminar region known as the relaminarization, during which the velocity profiles deviate from the standard log law. This relaminarization is accompanied by a significant decrease in the cyclic fluctuation of the wall friction coefficient and an increase in the shape factor while the freestream velocity increases under favourable pressure gradient conditions. This phenomenon intensifies with increasing $Re$. We found that higher $Re$ produces smaller LEVs in greater quantities, with a more rapid but stable breakdown, without resulting in a more chaotic turbulent downstream. This study strongly indicates that the relaminarization could extend beyond $Re=10^6$ as predicted by Fukagata[Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics, 2023]. The results support the potential for further exploration of flapping foils at high $Re$ for noise and drag reduction.</description>
