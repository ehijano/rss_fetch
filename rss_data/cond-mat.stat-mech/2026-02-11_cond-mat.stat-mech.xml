      <title>Anomalous spin transport in integrable random quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-temperature spin transport in integrable quantum spin chains exhibits a rich dynamical phase diagram, including ballistic, superdiffusive, and diffusive regimes. While integrability is known to survive in static and periodically driven systems, its fate in the complete absence of time-translation symmetry, particularly in interacting random quantum circuits, has remained unclear. Here we construct integrable random quantum circuits built from inhomogeneous XXZ R-matrices. Remarkably, integrability is preserved for arbitrary sequences of gate layers, ranging from quasiperiodic to fully random, thereby explicitly breaking both continuous and discrete time-translation symmetry. Using large-scale time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group simulations at infinite temperature and half filling, we map out the resulting spin-transport phase diagram and identify ballistic, superdiffusive, and diffusive regimes controlled by the spectral parameters of the R-matrices. The spatiotemporal structure of spin correlations within each regime depends sensitively on the inhomogeneity, exhibiting spatial asymmetry and sharp peak structures tied to near-degenerate quasiparticle velocities. To account for these findings, we develop a generalized hydrodynamics framework adapted to time-dependent integrable circuits, yielding Euler-scale predictions for correlation functions, Drude weights, and diffusion bounds. This approach identifies the quasiparticles governing transport and quantitatively captures both the scaling exponents and fine structures of the correlation profiles observed numerically. Our results demonstrate that exact Yang-Baxter integrability is compatible with stochastic quantum dynamics and establish generalized hydrodynamics as a predictive framework for transport in time-dependent integrable systems.</description>

      <title>The chiral random walk: A quantum-inspired framework for odd diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality in active and passive fluids gives rise to odd transport properties, most notably the emergence of robust edge currents that defy standard dissipative dynamics. While these phenomena are well-described by continuum hydrodynamics, a microscopic framework connecting them to their topological origins has remained elusive. Here, we present a lattice model for an isotropic chiral random walk that bridges the gap between classical stochastic diffusion and unitary quantum evolution. By equipping the walker with an internal degree of freedom and a tunable chirality parameter, $p$, we interpolate between a standard diffusive random walk and a deterministic, topologically non-trivial quantum walk. We show that the topological protection characteristic of the unitary limit ($p=1$) remarkably persists into the dissipative regime ($p&lt;1$). This correspondence allows us to theoretically ground the robustness of edge flows in classical chiral systems using the bulk-boundary correspondence of Floquet topological insulators. Our results provide a discrete microscopic description for odd diffusion, offering a powerful toolkit to predict transport in confined geometries and disordered chiral media.</description>

      <title>Model Reduction of Multivariate Geometric Brownian Motions and Localization in a Two-State Quantum System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09413v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for the model reduction of multivariate geometric Brownian motions (GBMs), a fundamental class of stochastic processes with broad applications in mathematical finance, population biology, and statistical physics. Our approach leverages the interplay between the method of invariant manifolds and adiabatic elimination to derive closed-form reduced equations for the deterministic drift. An extended formulation of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is subsequently employed to characterize the stochastic component of the reduced description. As a concrete application, we apply our reduction scheme to a GBM arising from a two-state quantum system, showing that the reduced dynamics accurately capture the localization properties of the original model while significantly simplifying the analysis.</description>

      <title>Structural Theory of Information Backflow in Non-Markovian Relaxation: TC/TCL Formalism and Minimal Phase Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09054v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a structural theory of information backflow in minimal non-Markovian relaxation processes within the framework of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. The approach is based on the time-convolution (TC) and time-convolutionless (TCL) projection-operator formalisms for reduced dynamics and on the doubling construction of non-equilibrium thermo field dynamics, which provides an embedding representation of dissipative evolution.
  We introduce a general backflow functional associated with a time-dependent information measure and derive generator-based sufficient conditions for the absence of backflow in terms of divisibility properties and effective relaxation rates. This allows a direct connection between memory kernels in generalized master equations and observable transient phenomena such as entropy overshoot and revival.
  Furthermore, we propose a decomposition of backflow into classical mixing and intrinsic contributions in the doubled representation, leading to a unified classification of transient regimes. Minimal classical and quantum two-state models are analyzed as analytically tractable examples, yielding explicit phase diagrams and recovering Mittag-Leffler-type fractional relaxation as a universal envelope of non-Markovian damping.
  The framework provides a constructive TC-to-TCL procedure for extracting effective rates and organizing memory-induced phenomena in a model-independent manner.</description>

      <title>Average Categorical Symmetries in One-Dimensional Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study one-dimensional disordered systems with average non-invertible symmetries, where quenched disorder may locally break part of the symmetry while preserving it upon disorder averaging. A canonical example is the random transverse-field Ising model, which at criticality exhibits an average Kramers-Wannier duality. We consider the general setting in which the full symmetry is described by a $G$-graded fusion category $\mathcal{B}$, whose identity component $\mathcal{A}$ remains exact, while the components with nontrivial $G$-grading are realized either exactly or only on average. We develop a topological holographic framework that encodes the symmetry data of the 1D system in a 2D topological order $\mathcal{Z}[\mathcal{A}]$ (the Drinfeld center of $\mathcal{A}$), enriched by an exact or, respectively, average $G$ symmetry. Within this framework, we obtain a complete classification of anomalies and average symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases: when the components with nontrivial $G$-grading are realized only on average, the symmetry is anomaly-free if and only if $\mathcal{Z}[\mathcal{A}]$ admits a magnetic Lagrangian algebra that is invariant under the permutation action of $G$ on anyons. When an anomaly is present, we show that the ground state of a single disorder realization is long-range entangled with probability one in the thermodynamic limit, and is expected to exhibit power-law Griffiths singularities in the low-energy spectrum. Finally, we present an explicit, exactly solvable lattice model based on a symmetry-enriched string-net construction. It yields trivial ground state ensemble in the anomaly-free case, and exhibits exotic low-energy behavior in the presence of an average anomaly.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization for Local versus Translationally Invariant Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local observables and their translationally invariant counterparts are generally thought as providing the same predictions for experimental measurements. This is used in the context of their expectation values, which are indeed the same in clean systems (up to finite-size effects), but also in the context of their correlation functions, which need not be the same. We examine this intuition from the perspective of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Specifically, we explore the diagonal matrix elements and the spectral functions of local and translationally invariant observables in the spin-1 tilted field Ising chain with periodic and open boundary conditions. We discuss in which ways those observables are different and in which contexts they can be thought as being the same. Furthermore, we unveil a novel form of off-diagonal eigenstate thermalization in translationally invariant systems that applies to pairs of energy eigenstates with different quasimomenta.</description>

      <title>A parameterised equation of state, glass transition and jamming of the hard sphere system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Gamma-distribution based potential energy landscape (PEL) theory has recently been proposed for supercooled liquids and glasses. This new PEL theory introduces a singularity term in the equation of state (EoS) suitable for representing the pressure of a glassy or jammed system. Using this framework, a parameterised EoS, Z(eta J), is developed with the random-jammed-packing fraction, eta J, as an input. This EoS is capable of accurately calculating the compressibility (pressure) across the entire metastable and glassy region from eta J=0.62 to 0.66, while seamlessly passing through the stable fluid region. Two special cases (paths) are examined in detail. The first path exhibits a singularity at the random close packing eta J=eta rcp=0.64, traversing the metastable region explored by most simulations. Various thermodynamic properties calculated are compared to simulation data, showing excellent agreements. The second case addresses the first analytical EoS for the ideal glass transition in the hard sphere system. Finally, the transport properties of the hard sphere fluid are modeled using the Arrhenius law and the excess entropy scaling law. It is found that both laws fail (with slope changing) at eta=0.555, where the heat capacity peaks and the contributions of inherent structures and jamming effects begin to emerge.</description>

      <title>Quantum Correlation Dynamics Subjected to Quantum Reset-Driven Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09348v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two central qubits interacting with a transverse-field Ising chain that serves as their environment. The environment is driven linearly in time across its quantum critical points (QCPs) and, during the evolution, is subjected to quantum reset (QR), where it is returned at random times to its initial state. We investigate how such QR of the environmental spin chain modifies the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord between the qubits. Our results show that in the strong-coupling regime, entanglement and discord exhibit pronounced revivals within the interval bounded by the Ising QCPs, but these revivals diminish as the QR rate increases. In contrast, weak coupling leads to a monotonic reduction of quantum correlations. Numerically, we find that the revival peaks of concurrence decay and scale exponentially with the QR rate, while quantum discord shows no clear scaling behavior. In the weak-coupling regime without QR, the correlations decay monotonically as the driven field crosses the second QCP. When QR is applied, however, both entanglement and discord undergo oscillatory suppression, with the oscillation period increasing as either the QR rate or the ramp time scale is reduced.</description>

      <title>Tunable many-body burst in isolated quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermalization in isolated quantum many-body systems can be nonmonotonic, with its process dependent on an initial state. We propose a numerical method to construct a low-entangled initial state that creates a ``burst''$\unicode{x2013}\unicode{x2013}$a transient deviation of an observable from its thermal equilibrium value$\unicode{x2013}\unicode{x2013}$at a designated time. We apply this method to demonstrate that a burst of magnetization can be realized for a nonintegrable mixed-field Ising chain on a timescale comparable to the onset of quantum scrambling. Contrary to the typical spreading of information in this regime, the created burst is accompanied by a slow or even negative entanglement growth. Analytically, we show that a burst becomes probabilistically rare after a long time. Our results suggest that a nonequilibrium state is maintained for an appropriately chosen initial state until scrambling becomes dominant. These predictions can be tested with programmable quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Topology and higher-order global synchronization on directed and hollow simplicial and cell complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order networks encode the many-body interactions of complex systems ranging from the brain to biological transportation networks. Simplicial and cell complexes are ideal higher-order network representations for investigating higher-order topological dynamics where dynamical variables are not only associated with nodes, but also with edges, triangles, and higher-order simplices and cells. Global Topological Synchronization (GTS) refers to the dynamical state in which identical oscillators associated with higher-dimensional simplices and cells oscillate in unison. On standard unweighted and undirected complexes this dynamical state can be achieved only under strict topological and combinatorial conditions on the underlying discrete support. In this work we consider generalized higher-order network representations including directed and hollow complexes. Based on an in depth investigation of their topology defined by their associated algebraic topology operators and Betti numbers, we determine under which conditions GTS can be observed. We show that directed complexes always admit a global topological synchronization state independently of their topology and structure. However, we demonstrate that for directed complexes this dynamical state cannot be asymptotically stable. While hollow complexes require more stringent topological conditions to sustain global topological synchronization, these topologies can favor both the existence and the stability of global topological synchronization with respect to undirected and unweighted complexes.</description>

      <title>How Geometry Tames Disorder in Lattice Fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fracture behavior of pre-cracked triangular beam-lattices whose elements have failure stresses drawn from a Weibull distribution. Through a statistical analysis and numerical simulations, we identify and verify the existence of three distinct failure regimes: (i) disorder is effectively suppressed, (ii) disorder manifests locally near the crack tip, modifying the crack morphology, and (iii) disorder manifests globally, leading to initially diffuse failure. Our model naturally reveals the key parameters governing this behavior: the Weibull modulus, quantifying the spread in failure thresholds, and a geometric quantity termed the Slenderness Ratio. We also reproduce the disorder-induced toughening reported in previous experimental and numerical studies, further demonstrating that its manifestation depends non-monotonically on disorder. Crucially, our results indicate that this toughening cannot be simply connected to the amount of damage in the lattice, challenging interpretations that attribute increased fracture energy solely to enhanced crack tortuosity or diffuse failure. Overall, our results establish geometry as a powerful control parameter for regulating how disorder is expressed during fracture in beam-lattices, with broader implications for the disorder-induced toughening in engineered materials.</description>

      <title>Symmetric preferences, asymmetric outcomes: Tipping dynamics in an open-city segregation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schelling's model of segregation demonstrates that even in the absence of social or governmental interventions, individuals with mild in-group preferences can self-organize into strongly segregated neighborhoods. Many variants of this celebrated model have been proposed by assuming agents tend to increase their satisfaction. Complementary to this traditional, utility-based approach, we model residential moves using satisfaction-independent reaction rates in a spatially extended chemical reaction network. The resulting model exhibits a counter-intuitive phenomenon: despite symmetric in-group preferences, the system undergoes a tipping transition at a critical preference level, beyond which one agent type dominates. We characterize this asymmetric phase transition in details using mean-field analysis, numerical simulations and finite size scaling methods. We find that while the transition shares key features with the Ising universality class, such as $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking and similar exponent ratios, the full set of critical exponents does not match any known universality class.</description>

      <title>A dialog between cell adhesion and topology at the core of morphogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the development of an organism, cells must coordinate and organize to generate the correct shape, structure, and spatial patterns of tissues and organs, a process known as morphogenesis. The morphogenesis of embryonic tissues is supported by multiple processes that induce the precise physical deformations required for tissues to ultimately form organs with complex geometries. Among the most active players shaping the morphogenetic path are fine-tuned changes in cell adhesion. In this paper, we show that a local, pair-wise property defined at the cell-cell contact level has important global consequences for embryonic tissue topology, being determinant in defining both the geometric and material properties of early embryo tissues.</description>

      <title>Universal Foundations of Thermodynamics: Entropy and Energy Beyond Equilibrium and Without Extensivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamics is commonly presented as a theory of macroscopic systems in stable equilibrium, built upon assumptions of extensivity and scaling with system size. In this paper, we present a universal formulation of the elementary foundations of thermodynamics, in which entropy and energy are defined and employed beyond equilibrium and without assuming extensivity. The formulation applies to all systems -- large and small, with many or few particles -- and to all states, whether equilibrium or nonequilibrium, by relying on carefully stated operational definitions and existence principles rather than macroscopic idealizations. Key thermodynamic concepts, including adiabatic availability and available energy, are developed and illustrated using the energy-entropy diagram representation of nonequilibrium states, which provides geometric insight into irreversibility and the limits of work extraction for systems of any size. A substantial part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of entropy transfer in non-work interactions, leading to precise definitions of heat interactions and heat-and-diffusion interactions of central importance in mesoscopic continuum theories of nonequilibrium behavior in simple and complex solids and fluids. As a direct consequence of this analysis, Clausius inequalities and the Clausius statement of the second law are derived in forms explicitly extended to nonequilibrium processes. The resulting framework presents thermodynamics as a universal theory whose concepts apply uniformly to all systems, large and small, and provides a coherent foundation for both teaching and modern applications.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of Binary Autoencoders for QUBO-Based Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In black-box combinatorial optimization, objective evaluations are often expensive, so high quality solutions must be found under a limited budget. Factorization machine with quantum annealing (FMQA) builds a quadratic surrogate model from evaluated samples and optimizes it on an Ising machine. However, FMQA requires binary decision variables, and for nonbinary structures such as integer permutations, the choice of binary encoding strongly affects search efficiency. If the encoding fails to reflect the original neighborhood structure, small Hamming moves may not correspond to meaningful modifications in the original solution space, and constrained problems can yield many infeasible candidates that waste evaluations. Recent work combines FMQA with a binary autoencoder (bAE) that learns a compact binary latent code from feasible solutions, yet the mechanism behind its performance gains is unclear. Using a small traveling salesman problem as an interpretable testbed, we show that the bAE reconstructs feasible tours accurately and, compared with manually designed encodings at similar compression, better aligns tour distances with latent Hamming distances, yields smoother neighborhoods under small bit flips, and produces fewer local optima. These geometric properties explain why bAE+FMQA improves the approximation ratio faster while maintaining feasibility throughout optimization, and they provide guidance for designing latent representations for black-box optimization.</description>

      <title>Theory for enzymatic degradation of semi-crystalline polymer particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In enzymatic recycling or biodegradation of semi-crystalline plastic waste, crystalline spherulites embedded into an amorphous matrix hinder and slow down depolymerisation. When the enzymatic depolymerisation temperature exceeds the glass transition temperature, these spherulites tend to grow. The depolymerisation process is thus controlled by a competition between erosion of the amorphous matrix from the particle surface and the growth of recalcitrant spherulites within the particle bulk and at its surface. We present a geometric model that captures this competition, together with an algorithm to solve the equations numerically. Our algorithm introduces a new extension of Voronoi/Delaunay tessellation in space. We extract the parameters for the model from experimental data on the enzymatic depolymerization by hydrolase LCC-ICCG of PET bottle flakes and textile waste, in order to make a prediction of the observed degradation yield as a function of time. Both the final yield and the degradation kinetics are correctly predicted. Most importantly, the model clarifies how and to which extent nucleating agents, impurities, additives, and/or rapid crystal growth present in the waste can undermine pretreatment efforts aiming to initiate depolymerisation from a material with a low initial crystallinity.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lotka-Volterra model with sparse interactions: non-Gaussian effects and topological multiple-equilibria phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the equilibrium phases of a generalized Lotka-Volterra model characterized by a species interaction matrix which is random, sparse and symmetric. Dynamical fluctuations are modeled by a demographic noise with amplitude proportional to the effective temperature T. The equilibrium distribution of species abundances is obtained by means of the cavity method and the Belief Propagation equations, which allow for an exact solution on sparse networks. Our results reveal a rich and non-trivial phenomenology that deviates significantly from the predictions of fully connected models. Consistently with data from real ecosystems, which are characterized by sparse rather than dense interaction networks, we find strong deviations from Gaussianity in the distribution of abundances. In addition to the study of these deviations from Gaussianity, which are not related to multiple-equilibria, we also identified a novel topological glass phase, present at both finite temperature, as shown here, and at T=0, as previously suggested in the literature. The peculiarity of this phase, which differs from the multiple-equilibria phase of fully-connected networks, is its strong dependence on the presence of extinctions. These findings provide new insights into how network topology and disorder influence ecological networks, particularly emphasizing that sparsity is a crucial feature for accurately modeling real-world ecological phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how to compute the probability distributions of the order parameter of the $O(n)$ model at two-loop order of perturbation theory generalizing the methods developed for computing the same in case of the Ising model \cite{Sahu:2025bkp}. We show that even for the $O(n)$ model, there exists not one but a family of these probability distribution functions indexed by $\zeta$ which is the ratio of system size $L$ to the bulk correlation length $\xi_{\infty}$. We also compare these PDFs to the Monte-Carlo simulations and the existing FRG results for the $O(2)$ and $O(3)$ models.</description>

      <title>Canonical partition function and distance dependent correlation functions of a quasi-one-dimensional system of hard disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The canonical NLT partition function of a quasi-one dimensional (q1D) one-file system of equal hard disks [J. Chem Phys. 153, 144111 (2020)] provides an analytical description of the thermodynamics and ordering in this system (a pore) as a function of linear density Nd/L where d is the disk diameter. We derive the analytical formulae for the distance dependence of the translational pair distribution function and the distribution function of distances between next neighbor disks, and then demonstrate their use by calculating the translational order in the pore. In all cases, the order is found to be of a short range and to exponentially decay with the disks' separation. The correlation length presented for different pore widths and densities shows a non-monotonic dependence with a maximum at Nd/L=1 and tends to the 1D value for a vanishing pore width. The results indicate a special role of this density when the pore length L is equal exactly to N disk diameters. A comparison between the theoretical results for an infinite system and the results of a molecular dynamics simulation for a finite system with periodic boundary conditions is presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>From equivalent Lagrangians to inequivalent open quantum system dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lagrangians can differ by a total derivative without altering the equations of motion, thus encoding the same physics. This is true both classically and quantum mechanically. We show, however, that in the context of open quantum systems, two Lagrangians that differ by a total derivative can lead to inequivalent reduced dynamics. While these Lagrangians are connected via unitary transformations at the level of the global system-plus-environment description, the equivalence breaks down after tracing out the environment. We argue that only those Lagrangians for which the canonical and mechanical momenta of the system coincide lead to operationally meaningful dynamics. Applying this insight to quantum electrodynamics (QED), we derive the master equation for bremsstrahlung due to an accelerated non-relativistic electron upto second order in the interaction. The resulting reduced dynamics predicts decoherence in the position basis and closely matches the Caldeira-Leggett form, thus resolving previous discrepancies in the literature. Our findings have implications for both QED and gravitational decoherence, where similar ambiguities arise.</description>

Abstract: It is of great interest to understand the thermalization of open quantum many-body systems, and how quantum computers are able to efficiently simulate that process. A recently introduced disispative evolution, inspired by existing models of open system thermalization, has been shown to be efficiently implementable on a quantum computer. Here, we prove that, at high enough temperatures, this evolution reaches the Gibbs state in time scaling logarithmically with system size. The result holds for Hamiltonians that satisfy the Lieb-Robinson bound, such as local Hamiltonians on a lattice, and includes long-range systems. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results rigorously establishing the rapid mixing property of high-temperature quantum Gibbs samplers, which is known to give the fastest possible speed for thermalization in the many-body setting. We then employ our result to the problem of estimating partition functions at high temperature, showing an improved performance over previous classical and quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Rare Trajectories in a Prototypical Mean-field Disordered Model: Insights into Landscape and Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00107v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For disordered systems within the random first-order transition (RFOT) universality class, such as structural glasses and certain spin glasses, the role played by activated relaxation processes is rich to the point of perplexity. Over the last decades, various efforts have attempted to formalize and systematize such processes in terms of instantons similar to the nucleation droplets of first-order phase transitions. In particular, Kirkpatrick, Thirumalai, and Wolynes proposed in the late '80s an influential nucleation theory of relaxation in structural glasses. Already within this picture, however, the resulting structures are far from the compact objects expected from the classical droplet description. In addition, an altogether different type of single-particle hopping-like instantons has recently been isolated in molecular simulations. Landscape studies of mean-field spin glass models have further revealed that simple saddle crossing does not capture relaxation in these systems. We present here a landscape-agnostic study of rare dynamical events, which delineates the richness of instantons in these systems. Our work not only captures the structure of metastable states, but also identifies the point of irreversibility, beyond which activated relaxation processes become a fait accompli. An interpretation of the associated landscape features is articulated, thus charting a path toward a complete understanding of RFOT instantons.</description>

      <title>Cosmic structure from the path integral of classical mechanics and its comparison to standard perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate cosmic structure formation in the framework of a path-integral formulation of an $N$-particle ensemble in phase space, dubbed Resummed Kinetic Field Theory (RKFT), up to one-loop perturbative order. In particular, we compute power spectra of the density contrast, the divergence and curl of the momentum density and arbitrary $n$-point cumulants of the stress tensor. In contrast to earlier works, we propose a different method of sampling initial conditions, with a Gaussian initial phase-space density. Doing so, we exactly reproduce the corresponding results from Eulerian standard perturbation theory (SPT) at one-loop order, showing that formerly found deviations can be fully attributed to inconsistencies in the previous sampling method. Since, in contrast to SPT, the full phase-space description does not assume a truncation of the Vlasov hierarchy, our findings suggest that nonperturbative techniques are required to accurately capture the physics of cosmic structure formation.</description>

      <title>Quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of mid-anneal measurement in quantum annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a promising metaheuristic for solving constrained combinatorial optimization problems. However, parameter tuning difficulties and hardware noise often prevent optimal solutions from being properly encoded as the ground states of the problem Hamiltonian. This study investigates mid-anneal measurement as a mitigation approach for such situations, analyzing its effectiveness and underlying physical mechanisms. We introduce a quantitative metric to evaluate the effectiveness of mid-anneal measurement and apply it to the graph bipartitioning problem and the quadratic knapsack problem. Our findings reveal that mid-anneal measurement is most effective when the energy difference between desired solutions and ground states is small, with effectiveness strongly governed by the energy structure. Furthermore, the effectiveness increases as the Hamming distance between the ground and excited states gets small, highlighting the role of state similarity. Analysis of fully-connected Ising models demonstrates that the effectiveness of mid-anneal measurement persists with increasing system size, indicating its scalability and practical applicability to large-scale quantum annealing.</description>

      <title>Unitary and Nonunitary A-D-E minimal models: Coset graph fusion algebras, defects, entropies, SREEs and dilogarithm identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider both unitary and nonunitary A-D-E minimal models on the cylinder with topological defects along the non-contractible cycle of the cylinder. We define the coset graph $A \otimes G/\mathbb{Z}_2$ and argue that it encodes not only the (i) coset graph fusion algebra, but also (ii) the Affleck-Ludwig boundary g-factors; (iii) the defect g-factors (quantum dimensions) and (iv) the relative symmetry resolved entanglement entropy. By studying A-D-E restricted solid-on-solid models, we find that these boundary conformal field theory structures are also present on the lattice: defects (seams) are implemented by face weights with special values of the spectral parameter. Integrability allows the study of lattice transfer matrix T- and Y-system functional equations to reproduce the fusion algebra of defect lines. The effective central charges and conformal weights are expressed in terms of dilogarithms of the braid and bulk asymptotics of the Y-system expressed in terms of the quantum dimensions.</description>

      <title>Localizable Entanglement as an Order Parameter for Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify localizable entanglement (LE) as an order parameter for measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT). LE exhibits universal finite-size scaling with critical exponents that match previous MIPT results and gives a nice operational interpretation connecting MIPTs to classical percolation. Remarkably, we find that LE decays exponentially with distance in the area-law phase as opposed to being essentially constant for the volume-law phase thereby, discover an intrinsic length scale $\xi_E$ that diverges at the critical measurement probability $p_c$. While classical percolation transition captures successful transport across a network, MIPT as characterized by LE can be interpreted as quantifying the amount of quantum teleportation between two given nodes in a quantum circuit. Building on this insight, we propose a two-ancilla protocol that provides an experimentally accessible readout of entanglement redistribution across the transition.</description>
