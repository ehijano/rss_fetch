      <title>A Note on Assortativeness Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiappori et al. (2025) study several indices that measure the assortativeness of a matching, including the aggregate likelihood ratio. We provide a counterexample showing that their axiomatization of the aggregate likelihood ratio is not valid as stated. We identify the exact class of indices characterized by the axioms in Chiappori et al. (2025). We then show that the axiomatization of the aggregate likelihood ratio can be recovered by adding new axioms.</description>

      <title>Sharing with Frictions: Limited Transfers and Costly Inspections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radio spectrum suitable for commercial wireless services is limited. A portion of the radio spectrum has been reserved for institutions using it for non-commercial purposes such as federal agencies, defense, public safety bodies and scientific institutions. In order to operate efficiently, these incumbents need clean spectrum access. However, commercial users also want access, and granting them access may materially interfere with the existing activity of the incumbents. Conventional market based mechanisms for allocating scarce resources in this context are problematic. Allowing direct monetary transfers to and from public or scientific institutions risks distorting their non-commercial mission. Moreover, often only the incumbent knows the exact value of the interference it experiences, and, likewise, only commercial users can predict accurately the expected monetary outcome from sharing the resource. Thus, our problem is to determine the efficient allocation of resources in the presence of private information without the use of direct monetary transfers. The problem is not unique to spectrum. Other resources that governments hold in trust share the same feature. We propose a novel mechanism design formulation of the problem, characterize the optimal mechanism and describe some of its qualitative properties.</description>

      <title>Centralization and Stability in Formal Constitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a social-choice function (SCF) is chosen to decide votes in a formal system, including votes to replace the voting method itself. Agents vote according to their ex-ante preference between the incumbent SCF and the suggested replacement. The existing SCF then aggregates the agents' votes and arrives at a decision of whether it should itself be replaced. An SCF is self-maintaining if it can not be replaced in such fashion by any other SCF. Our focus is on the implications of self-maintenance for centralization. We present results considering optimistic, pessimistic and i.i.d. approaches w.r.t. agent beliefs, and different tie-breaking rules. To highlight two of the results, (i) for the i.i.d. unbiased case with arbitrary tie-breaking, we prove an ``Arrow-Style'' Theorem for Dynamics: We show that only a dictatorship is self-maintaining, and any other SCF has a path of changes that arrives at a dictatorship. (ii) If we take into account wisdom of the crowd effects, for a society with a variable size of ruling elite, we demonstrate how the stable elite size is decreasing in both how extractive the economy is, and the quality of individual decision-making. All in all we provide a basic framework and body of results for centralization dynamics and stability, applicable for institution design, especially in formal ``De-Jure'' systems, such as Blockchain Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).</description>

      <title>Multi-agent Adaptive Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a sequential mechanism design problem in which a principal seeks to elicit truthful reports from multiple rational agents while starting with no prior knowledge of agents' beliefs. We introduce Distributionally Robust Adaptive Mechanism (DRAM), a general framework combining insights from both mechanism design and online learning to jointly address truthfulness and cost-optimality. Throughout the sequential game, the mechanism estimates agents' beliefs and iteratively updates a distributionally robust linear program with shrinking ambiguity sets to reduce payments while preserving truthfulness. Our mechanism guarantees truthful reporting with high probability while achieving $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ cumulative regret, and we establish a matching lower bound showing that no truthful adaptive mechanism can asymptotically do better. The framework generalizes to plug-in estimators, supporting structured priors and delayed feedback. To our knowledge, this is the first adaptive mechanism under general settings that maintains truthfulness and achieves optimal regret when incentive constraints are unknown and must be learned.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Domar aggregation over transforming production networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18137v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An economy-wide production network, manifested through monetary input-output coefficients, inherently destabilizes during the general equilibrium propagation of sectoral productivity shocks when substitution elasticities are non-neutral. This study explores the global properties of such networks by mapping the non-linear price manifold into a linearized \textit{transcendent space}. Within this framework, we identify the emergence of network \textit{singularities}, identifying the metabolic thresholds where productivity declines lead to supply-chain paralysis or efficiency gains render primary factors redundant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the interaction between productivity shocks -- the sign of \textit{synergism} -- is uniquely determined by the substitution elasticity $\sigma$. Our findings transform industrial policy into an \textit{inverse problem} of network topology: we provide a rigorous justification for why an inelastic network necessitates selective concentration on bottleneck sectors, whereas an elastic network favors a diversified investment strategy.</description>

      <title>Treatment Effects with Correlated Spillovers: Bridging Discrete and Continuous Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12653v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a continuous functional framework for treatment effects propagating through geographic space and economic networks. We derive a master equation from three independent economic foundations -- heterogeneous agent aggregation, market equilibrium, and cost minimization -- establishing that the framework rests on fundamental principles rather than ad hoc specifications. The framework nests conventional econometric models -- autoregressive specifications, spatial autoregressive models, and network treatment effect models -- as special cases, providing a bridge between discrete and continuous methods. A key theoretical result shows that the spatial-network interaction coefficient equals the mutual information between geographic and network coordinates, providing a parameter-free measure of channel complementarity. The Feynman-Kac representation characterizes treatment effects as accumulated policy exposure along stochastic paths representing economic linkages, connecting the continuous framework to event study methodology. The no-spillover case emerges as a testable restriction, creating a one-sided risk profile where correct inference is maintained regardless of whether spillovers exist. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that conventional estimators exhibit 25-38% bias when spillovers are present, while our estimator maintains correct inference across all configurations including the no-spillover case.</description>
