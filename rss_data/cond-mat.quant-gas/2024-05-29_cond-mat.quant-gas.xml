      <title>Exploring Frustration Effects of Strongly Interacting Bosons via the Hall Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Hall response of hardcore bosonic atoms on a triangular ladder in a magnetic field. We show that the behavior of the Hall polarization, both in its saturation value and in the short-time dynamics, correlates with the features of the underlying phase diagram. In particular, it exhibits a strong negative response at the Meissner to vortex phase transitions, while at large magnetic fluxes, after changing sign, it shows a strong positive response due to non-trivial vortex commensurability effects stemming from the interplay of interactions and geometric frustration. Thus, one can employ the Hall response as a sensitive probe of the many-body chiral quantum phases present in the system.</description>

      <title>Optical superlattice for engineering Hubbard couplings in quantum simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of Hubbard models with ultracold atoms rely on the exceptional control of coherent motion provided by optical lattices. Here we demonstrate enhanced tunability using an optical superlattice in a fermionic quantum gas microscope. With our phase-stable bichromatic design, we achieve a precise control of tunneling and tilt throughout the lattice, as evidenced by long-lived coherent double-well oscillations and next-nearest-neighbor quantum walks in a staggered configuration. We furthermore present correlated quantum walks of two particles initiated through a resonant pair-breaking mechanism. Finally, we engineer tunable spin couplings through local offsets and create a spin ladder with ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings along the rungs and legs, respectively. Our work underscores the high potential of optical superlattices for engineering, simulating, and detecting strongly correlated many-body quantum states.</description>

      <title>Kinked linear response from non-Hermitian cold-atom pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that non-Hermitian, non-reciprocal systems may harbor exponentially localized skin modes. However, in this work, we find that, generically, non-Hermiticity gives rise to abrupt and prominent kinks in the semi-classical wave packet trajectories of quantum gases, despite the absence of sudden physical impulses. This physically stems from a hitherto underappreciated intrinsic non-locality from non-Hermitian pumping, even if all physical couplings are local, thereby resulting in enigmatic singularities in the band structure that lead to discontinuous band geometry and Berry curvature. Specifically, we focus on the realization of the kinked response in an ultracold atomic setup. For a concrete experimental demonstration, we propose an ultracold atomic setup in a two-dimensional optical lattice with laser-induced loss such that response kinks can be observed without fine-tuning in the physical atomic cloud dynamics. Our results showcase unique non-monotonic behavior from non-Hermitian pumping beyond the non-Hermitian skin effect and suggest new avenues for investigating non-Hermitian dynamics on ultracold atomic platforms.</description>

      <title>Interface Dynamics of Strongly interacting Binary Superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the interface dynamics in non-equilibrium quantum systems remains a challenge. We study the interface dynamics of strongly coupled immiscible binary superfluids by using holographic duality. The full nonlinear evolution of the binary superfluids with a relative velocity shows rich nonlinear patterns toward quantum turbulence, which is reminiscent of the quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The wave number of the fast growing modes $k_0$ extracted from the interface pattern yields a non-monotonic dependence of the relative velocity, independent of the temperature and interaction. The value of $k_0$ first increases with the velocity difference and then decreases, which stands in sharp contrast to the results of mean-field theory described by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and is confirmed by using the linear analyses on top of the stationary configuration. We uncover that the critical velocity associated with the maximum correspond to the case when the mean separation of vortices generated by interface instabilities becomes comparable to the vortex size, which could be a universal physical mechanism at strongly interacting superfluids and is directly testable in laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic time evolution of highly excited states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic time evolution of quantum systems is a widely used tool with applications ranging from state preparation through simplifications of computations and topological transformations to optimization and quantum computing. Adiabatic time evolution generally works well for gapped ground states, but not for thermal states in the middle of the spectrum that lack a protecting energy gap. Here we show that quantum many-body scars -- a particular type of highly excited states -- are suitable for adiabatic time evolution despite the absence of a protecting energy gap. Considering two rather different models, namely a one-dimensional model constructed from tensor networks and a two-dimensional fractional quantum Hall model with anyons, we find that the quantum scars perform similarly to gapped ground states with respect to adiabatic dynamics when the required final adiabatic fidelity is around 0.99. The maximum speed at which the scar state of the one-dimensional model can be adiabatically transformed decreases as a power law with system size, as opposed to exponentially for both generic thermal and disorder-driven localized states. At constant and very low ramp speed, we find that the deviation of the fidelity from unity scales linearly with ramp speed for scar states, but quadratically for gapped ground states. The gapped ground states hence perform better when the required adiabatic fidelities are very high, such as 0.9999 and above. We identify two mechanisms for leakage out of the scar state and use them to explain our results. While manipulating a single, isolated ground state is common in quantum applications, adiabatic evolution of scar states provides the flexibility to manipulate an entire tower of ground-state-like states simultaneously in a single system.</description>

      <title>Entanglement from superradiance and rotating quantum fluids of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The amplification of radiation by superradiance is a universal phenomenon observed in numerous physical systems. We demonstrate that superradiant scattering generates entanglement for different input states, including coherent states, thereby establishing the inherently quantum nature of this phenomenon. To put these concepts to the test, we propose a novel approach to create horizonless ergoregions, which are nonetheless dynamically stable thanks to the dissipative dynamics of a polaritonic fluid of light. We numerically simulate the system to demonstrate the creation of a stable ergoregion. Subsequently, we investigate rotational superradiance within this system, with a primary focus on entanglement generation and the possibilities for its enhancement using current techniques. Our methods permit the investigation of quantum emission by rotational superradiance in state-of-the-art experiments, in which the input state can be controlled at will.</description>

      <title>Nanofluidic platform for studying the first-order phase transitions in superfluid helium-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The symmetry-breaking first-order phase transition between superfluid phases $^3$He-A and $^3$He-B can be triggered extrinsically by ionising radiation or heterogeneous nucleation arising from the details of the sample cell construction. However, the role of potential homogeneous intrinsic nucleation mechanisms remains elusive. Discovering and resolving the intrinsic processes may have cosmological consequences, since an analogous first-order phase transition, and the production of gravitational waves, has been predicted for the very early stages of the expanding Universe in many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics. Here we introduce a new approach for probing the phase transition in superfluid $^3$He. The setup consists of a novel stepped-height nanofluidic sample container with close to atomically smooth walls. The $^3$He is confined in five tiny nanofabricated volumes and assayed non-invasively by NMR. Tuning of the state of $^3$He by confinement is used to isolate each of these five volumes so that the phase transitions in them can occur independently and free from any obvious sources of heterogeneous nucleation. The small volumes also ensure that the transitions triggered by ionising radiation are strongly suppressed. Here we present the preliminary measurements using this setup, showing both strong supercooling of $^3$He-A and superheating of $^3$He-B, with stochastic processes dominating the phase transitions between the two. The objective is to study the nucleation as a function of temperature and pressure over the full phase diagram, to both better test the proposed extrinsic mechanisms and seek potential parallel intrinsic mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of the effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the known effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model in the thermodynamic limit of large number of particles, obtained from the standard procedure in conformal field theory: the Hilbert space is constructed a priori in terms of irreducible representations of the symmetry algebra, and not by diagonalization of the hamiltonian, which is given in terms of fields that carry representations of the W-infinity algebra (representing the incompressibility of the Fermi sea). Nevertheless, the role of the effective hamiltonian of the theory is to establish a specific dynamics, which deserves further consideration. We show that the time evolution of the (chiral or antichiral) density field is given by the quantum Benjamin-Ono equation, in agreement with previous results obtained from the alternative description of the continuous limit of the model, based on quantum hydrodynamics. In this study, all calculations are performed at the quantum operator level, without making any assumption on the semiclassical limit of the fields and their equations of motion. This result may be considered as a reliable indication of the equivalence between the quantum field theoretic and quantum hydrodynamical formulations of the effective theories of the model. A one-dimensional quantum compressible fluid that includes both chiralities is the physical picture that emerges for the continuous limit of the Calogero-Sutherland model.</description>
