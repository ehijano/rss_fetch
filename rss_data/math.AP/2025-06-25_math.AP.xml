      <title>Asymptotic analysis and design of linear elastic shell lattice metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an asymptotic analysis of shell lattice metamaterials based on Ciarlet's shell theory, introducing a new metric--asymptotic directional stiffness (ADS)--to quantify how the geometry of the middle surface governs the effective stiffness. We prove a convergence theorem that rigorously characterizes ADS and establishes its upper bound, along with necessary and sufficient condition for achieving it. As a key result, our theory provides the first rigorous explanation for the high bulk modulus observed in Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces (TPMS)-based shell lattices. To optimize ADS on general periodic surfaces, we propose a triangular-mesh-based discretization and shape optimization framework. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimization under various design objectives. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/lavenklau/minisurf.</description>

      <title>Weighted nonlocal area functionals without the triangle inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a weighted nonlocal area functional in which the coefficients do not satisfy the triangle inequality. In the context of three phase transitions, this means that one of the weights is larger than the sum of the other two, say $$\sigma_{-1,1} &gt; \sigma_{-1,0} + \sigma_{0,1}.$$ We show that the energy can be reduced by covering interfaces between phases $-1$ and $1$ with a thin strip of phase $0$.
  Moreover, as the fractional parameter $s\nearrow1$, we prove that the nonlocal energies $\Gamma$-converge to a local area functional with different weights.
  The functional structure of this long-range interaction model is conceptually different from its classical counterpart, since the functional remains lower semicontinuous, even in the absence of the triangle inequality.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic estimates for solutions of inhomogeneous non-divergence diffusion equations with drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-time dynamics of the nonlinear processes modeled by diffusion-transport partial differential equations in non-divergence form with drifts. The solutions are subject to some inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. Starting with the reduced linear problem, we obtain the asymptotic estimates for the solutions, as time $t\to\infty$, depending on the asymptotic behavior of the forcing term and boundary data. These are established in both cases when the drifts are uniformly bounded, and unbounded as $t\to\infty$. For the nonlinear problem, we prove the convergence of the solutions under suitable conditions that balance the growth of the nonlinear term with the decay of the data. To take advantage of the diffusion in the non-divergence form, we prove an inhomogeneous version of the Landis-typed Growth Lemma and apply it to successive time-intervals. At each time step, the center for the barrier function is selected carefully to optimize the contracting factor. Our rigorous results show the robustness of the model.</description>

      <title>A frequency function approach to quantitative unique continuation for elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantitative unique continuation properties of solutions to second order elliptic equations with bounded lower order terms. In particular, we establish quantitative forms of the strong unique continuation property for solutions to generalized Schr\"odinger equations of the form $- \nabla \cdot (A \nabla u) + W \cdot \nabla u + V u = 0$, where we assume that $A$ is bounded, elliptic, symmetric, and Lipschitz, while $W$ and $V$ belong to $L^\infty$. We also study the global unique continuation properties of solutions to these equations, establishing results that are related to Landis' conjecture concerning the optimal rate of decay at infinity. Versions of the theorems in this article have been previously proved using Carleman estimates, but here we present novel proof techniques that rely on frequency functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the logistic elliptic equation $-\Delta u = u- u^{p}$ in a smooth bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{N}$, $N\geq2$, equipped with the sublinear Neumann boundary condition $\frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu} = \mu u^{q}$ on $\partial \Omega$, where $0&lt;q&lt;1&lt;p$, and $\mu\geq0$ is a parameter. With sub- and super-solutions and a comparison principle for the equation, we analyze the asymptotic profile of a unique positive solution for the equation as $\mu \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Laplacian on General Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce, for the first time, a Bochner integral formula for the logarithmic Laplacian on any complete Riemannian manifold. This unified framework recovers the classical pointwise expression on Euclidean space and allows us to define logarithmic Laplacian in both compact and noncompact settings. Under a Ricci lower bound, we derive explicit pointwise integral formulas for logarithmic Laplacian, analogous to those for the fractional Laplacian. We further compare spectral versus heat kernel definitions of both fractional and logarithmic Laplacians, showing that their discrepancy is governed by the mass loss function and hence by stochastic completeness. Finally, on real hyperbolic space we exploit sharp heat kernel asymptotics to obtain precise estimates for the fractional and logarithmic kernels, identify the optimal pointwise domain for logarithmic Laplacian and establish its Lp continuity.</description>

      <title>Formation and construction of large variational shock waves for 1-D $n\times n$ quasilinear hyperbolic conservation systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper [Li Jun, Xu Gang, Yin Huicheng, On the blowup mechanism of smooth solutions to 1D quasilinear strictly hyperbolic systems with large variational initial data, Nonlinearity 38 (2025), No.2, 025016], for the 1-D $n\times n$ ($n\geqslant 3$) strictly hyperbolic system $\partial_tv+F(v)\partial_xv=0$ with some classes of large variational initial data $v(x, 0)$, the geometric blowup mechanism and the detailed singularity behaviours of $\partial_{x,t}v$ near the blowup point are studied when the $n\times n$ matrix $F(v)$ admits at least one genuinely nonlinear eigenvalue. In this paper, we focus on the formation and construction of a large variational shock wave from the blowup point for 1-D $n\times n$ quasilinear hyperbolic conservation law system $\partial_tu+\partial_xf(u)=0$ when some smooth simple wave solution is generic non-degenerate before the formation of singularity and the corresponding eigenvalue is genuinely nonlinear.</description>

      <title>An improvement toward global boundedness in a fully parabolic chemotaxis with singular sensitivity in any dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the following chemotaxis system \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  u_t = \Delta u -\chi \nabla \cdot \left ( \frac{u}{v} \nabla v\right ),
  v_t = \Delta v -u+ v,
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} in an open bounded domain with smooth boundary $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with $n \geq 3$. It is known that solutions are globally bounded when $0&lt;\chi&lt; \sqrt{ \frac{2}{n}}$. In this paper, by considering the following energy functional \begin{align*}
  F_\lambda(u,v)= \int_\Omega \frac{u^p}{v^r} + \lambda \int_\Omega \frac{|\nabla v|^{2p}}{v^{p+r}} + \int_\Omega v^{p-r} \end{align*} for $p&gt;1$, $r= \frac{p-1}{2}$, and $\lambda&gt;0$, we improve this result by showing that there exists $\chi_0&gt;\sqrt{\frac{2}{n}}$ such that for any $\chi \in (0,\chi_0)$, solutions exist globally and remain bounded.</description>

      <title>From kinetic mixtures to compressible two-phase flow: A BGK-type model and rigorous derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a BGK-type kinetic model for a binary gas mixture, designed to serve as a kinetic formulation of compressible two-phase fluid dynamics. The model features species-dependent adiabatic exponents, and the relaxation operator is constructed by solving an entropy minimization problem under moments constraints. Starting from this model, we derive the compressible two-phase Euler equations via a formal Chapman--Enskog expansion and identify dissipative corrections of Navier--Stokes type. We then rigorously justify the Euler limit using the relative entropy method, establishing quantitative convergence estimates under appropriate regularity assumptions. Finally, we present numerical experiments based on an implicit-explicit Runge--Kutta method, which confirm the asymptotic preserving property and demonstrate the convergence from the BGK model to the isentropic two-phase Euler system in the hydrodynamic regime.</description>

      <title>On inverse problem for generalized Kerr-type nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the inverse problem of reconstructing the shape of unknown inclusions in semilinear elliptic equations with nonanalytic nonlinearities, by extending Ikehata's enclosure method to accommodate such nonlinear effects. To address the analytical challenges, we construct an approximate solution based on the linearized equation, enabling the enclosure method to operate in this setting. The proposed method applies to a broad class of semilinear elliptic equations with non-analytic nonlinearities, including representative examples such as the Kerr-type nonlinearity, which appears in models of nonlinear optics, and the Ginzburg-Landau-type nonlinearity, which models light propagation in nonlinear dissipative media.</description>

      <title>A Nonlinear Nonlocal Problem for the Caputo Fractional Subdiffusion Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a time-fractional subdiffusion equation with a nonlinear nonlocal initial condition involving the unknown solution at the final time. The considered problem is formulated using the Caputo fractional derivative of order \(0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1\), along with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The nonlocal initial condition is of the form \( u(x,0) = g(x, u(x,T)) \), where \(g\) is a nonlinear function satisfying a Lipschitz condition. The main challenge arises from the implicit dependence on the unknown final state. Using an explicit representation of the solution in terms of the Green function and applying the Banach fixed point theorem, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a regular solution. We also provide uniform estimates for the Green function and analyze the influence of the Lipschitz constant on solvability.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the blow-up criterion and the maximal existence time for solutions of the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system in 2d-Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the blow-up criteria for the simplest parabolic-elliptic (PKS) system in the 2D Euclidean space, including a consumption term. In the supercritical mass case M &gt; 8pi, and under an additional global assumption on the second moment (or variance) of the initial data, we establish blow-up results for a broader class of initial conditions than those traditionally considered. We also derive improved upper bounds for the maximal existence time of (PKS) solutions on the plane. These time estimates are obtained through a sharp analysis of a one-parameter differential inequality governing the evolution of the second moment of the (PKS) system. As a consequence, for any given non-negative (non-zero) initial datum n1 with finite second moment, we construct blow-up solutions of the (PKS) system.</description>

      <title>Controllability of Boussinesq flows driven by finite-dimensional and physically localized forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show approximate controllability of Boussinesq flows in $\mathbb{T}^2 = \mathbb{R}^2 / 2\pi\mathbb{Z}^2$ driven by finite-dimensional controls that are supported in any fixed region $\omega \subset \mathbb{T}^2$. This addresses a Boussinesq version of a question by Agrachev and provides a first example of fluid PDEs controllable in that sense. In particular, we add in this context to results obtained for the Navier-Stokes system by Agrachev-Sarychev (Comm. Math. Phys. 265, 2006), where the controls are finite-dimensional but not localized in physical space, and Nersesyan-Rissel (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 78, 2025), where physically localized controls admit for special $\omega$ a degenerate but not finite-dimensional structure.
  For our proof, we study controllability properties of tailored convection equations governed by time-periodic degenerately forced Euler flows that provide a twofold geometric mechanism: transport of information through $\omega$ versus non-stationary mixing effects transferring energy from low-dimensional sources to higher frequencies. The temperature is then controlled by using Coron's return method, while the velocity is mainly driven by the buoyant force.
  When $\omega$ contains two cuts of the torus and a closed square of side-length $L$, our approach yields explicit control spaces for the velocity and temperature of dimensions $2 + 18\lceil2\pi/L\rceil^2 + 8\lceil2\pi/L\rceil^4$ and $2 + 8\lceil2\pi/L\rceil^2$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Singular limits of anisotropic weak solutions to compressible magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim is to justify rigorously the so-called reduced magnetohydrodynamic model (abbreviated as RMHD), which is widely used in fusion, space and astrophysical plasmas. Motivated by physics, the focus is on plasmas that are simultaneously strongly magnetized and anisotropic. We consider conducting fluids that can be described by viscous and resistive barotropic compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations. The purpose is to study the asymptotic behaviour of global weak solutions, which do exist, for strongly anisotropic plasmas such as the large aspect ratio framework. We prove that such anisotropic weak solutions converge to the weak solutions of the RMHD equations. Rigorous justification of this limit is performed both in a periodic domain and in the whole space. It turns out that the resulting system is incompressible only in the perpendicular direction to the external strong magnetic field, whereas it involves compressible features in the parallel direction. In order to pass to the singular limit in the perpendicular direction we exploit, among others, tools elaborated for proving the low Mach number limit of compressible fluid flows such as the introduction of a fast oscillatory unitary group associated to the dynamics of transverse fast magnetosonic waves. In the parallel direction, we bring out compactness arguments and particular cancellations coming from the structure of our equations.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity results for mixed local-nonlocal variable exponent problem involving singular and superlinear term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of quasilinear elliptic equations involving both local and nonlocal operators with variable exponents. The problem exhibits singular nonlinearities along with a subcritical superlinear growth term and a parameter $\lambda$. We study the existence of multiple solutions with the help of variational methods by restricting the associated energy functional on appropriate subsets of the Nehari manifold. Using the topological index and the structure of the fibering maps, we analyse a key splitting property of the associated Nehari manifold. This decomposition allows us to establish the existence of two distinct solutions. Additionally, we establish the $L^\infty$-bound for the solutions.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation and film rupture in a two-dimensional thermocapillary thin-film model of the B\'enard-Marangoni problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional, stationary square and hexagonal patterns in the thermocapillary deformational thin-film model for the fluid height $h$\begin{equation*}
  \partial_t h+\nabla\cdot\left(h^3\left(\nabla\Delta h-g\nabla h\right)+M\frac{h^2}{(1+h)^2}\nabla h\right)=0,\quad t&gt;0,\quad x\in\mathbb{R}^2,
  \end{equation*} that can be formally derived from the B\'enard-Marangoni problem via a long-wave approximation. Using a linear stability analysis, we show that the flat surface profile corresponding to the pure conduction state destabilises at a critical Marangoni number $M^*$ via a conserved long-wave instability. For any fixed absolute wave number $k_0$, we find that square and hexagonal patterns bifurcate from the flat surface profile at $M=M^* + 4k_0^2$. Using analytic global bifurcation theory, we show that the local bifurcation curves can be extended to global curves of square and hexagonal patterns with constant absolute wave number and mass. We exclude that the global bifurcation curves are closed loops through a global bifurcation in cones argument, which also establishes nodal properties for the solutions. Furthermore, assuming that the Marangoni number is uniformly bounded on the bifurcation branch, we prove that solutions exhibit film rupture, that is, their minimal height tends to zero. This assumption is substantiated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Global regularity of the value function in a stopper vs. singular-controller game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of zero-sum stochastic games between a stopper and a singular-controller, previously considered in [Bovo and De Angelis (2025)]. The underlying singularly-controlled dynamics takes values in $\mathcal{O}\subseteq\mathbb{R}$. The problem is set on a finite time-horizon and is connected to a parabolic variational inequality of min-max type with spatial-derivative and obstacle constraints.
  We show that the value function of the problem is of class $C^1$ in the whole domain $[0,T)\times\mathcal{O}$ and that the second-order spatial derivative and the second-order mixed derivative are continuous everywhere except for a (potential) jump across a non-decreasing curve (the stopping boundary of the game). The latter discontinuity is a natural consequence of the partial differential equation associated to the problem. Beyond its intrinsic analytical value, such a regularity for the value function is a stepping stone for further exploring the structure and properties of the free-boundaries of the stochastic game, which in turn determine the optimal strategies of the players.</description>

Abstract: We prove that total instability is a generic phenomenon in the real analytic class of electromagnetic Lagrangian systems under a weak magnetism hypothesis. The main object in the proof is an adaptation of the McGehee blowup for these systems. Together with this result, new criteria for total instability are introduced for both generic and non-generic cases.</description>

      <title>Hamilton-Jacobi equations from mean-field spin glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.12732v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a meaning to the Hamilton--Jacobi equation arising from mean-field spin glass models in the viscosity sense, and establish the corresponding well-posedness. Originally defined on the set of monotone probability measures, these equations can be interpreted, via an isometry, to be defined on an infinite-dimensional closed convex cone with an empty interior in a Hilbert space. We prove the comparison principle, and the convergence of finite-dimensional approximations furnishing the existence of solutions. Under additional convexity conditions, we show that the solution can be represented by a version of the Hopf--Lax formula, or the Hopf formula on cones. Previously, two notions of solutions were considered, one defined directly as the Hopf--Lax formula, and another as limits of finite-dimensional approximations. They have been proven to describe the limit free energy in a wide class of mean-field spin glass models. This work shows that these two kinds of solutions are viscosity solutions.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of the Poincar{\'e} operator in an ellipsoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of the Poincar\'e operator in triaxial ellipsoids subject to a constant rotation. As explained in the paper, this mathematical problem is interesting for many physical applications. It is known that the spectrum of this bounded self-adjoint operator is pure point with polynomial eigenvectors [Backus &amp; Rieutord, Phys. Rev. E 95 (2017), 053116]. We give two new proofs of this result. Moreover, we describe the large-degree asymptotics of the restriction of that operator to polynomial vector fields of fixed degrees. The main tool is the microlocal analysis of the partial differential equation satisfied by the orthogonal polynomials in ellipsoids. This work also contains numerical calculations of these spectra, showing a very good agreement with the mathematical results.</description>

Abstract: We obtain weighted mixed norm Sobolev estimates in the whole space for nonstationary Stokes equations in divergence and nondivergence form with variable viscosity coefficients that are merely measurable in time variable and have small mean oscillation in spatial variables in small cylinders. As an application, we prove interior mixed norm derivative estimates for solutions to both equations. We also discuss boundary mixed norm Hessian estimates for solutions to equations in nondivergence form under the Lions boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on flat tori satisfying a simple and explicit Diophantine non-degeneracy condition. Provided that the nonlinearity contains a cubic term, we prove the almost global existence and stability of most of the small solutions in high regularity Sobolev spaces. To this end, we develop a normal form approach designed to handle general resonant Hamiltonian partial differential equations for which it is possible to modulate the frequencies by using the initial data.</description>

Abstract: It is proved in \cite[J. Funct. Anal., 2020]{AP} that the Cauchy problem for some Oldroyd-B model is well-posed in $\B^{d/p-1}_{p,1}(\R^d) \times \B^{d/p}_{p,1}(\R^d)$ with $1\leq p&lt;2d$. In this paper, we prove that the Cauchy problem for the same Oldroyd-B model is ill-posed in $\B^{d/p-1}_{p,r}(\R^d) \times \B^{d/p}_{p,r}(\R^d)$ with $1\leq p\leq \infty$ and $1&lt; r\leq\infty$ due to the lack of continuous dependence of the solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the well-posedness of transmission problems on classes of two-sided Sobolev extension domains to give variational definitions for (boundary) layer potential operators and Neumann-Poincar{\'e} operators. These classes of domains contain Lipschitz domains, and also domains with fractal boundaries. Although our variational formulation does not involve any measures on the boundary, we recover the classical results in smooth domains by considering the surface measure on the boundary. We discuss properties of these operators and generalize basic results in imaging beyond the Lipschitz case.</description>

Abstract: Recently, great attention has been focused on the study of fractional and non-local operators of elliptic type, both for pure mathematical research and in view of concrete real-world applications. Our problem is related to the fractional Yamabe problem. First, we study a non-local problem involving the fractional laplacian, a critical nonlinearity with a non-symmetric weight,and a pertubation __in a bounded domain. We show that in the case of a linear perturbation. Next, if the perturbation is nonlinear, we find non-ground-state solutions for the problem.</description>

This level of regularity goes significantly beyond existing deterministic results, in a regime where the flow map cannot be extended uniformly continuously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01842v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile. We are interested in the existence of stable standing waves by considering the associated $L^2$-minimization problem. The presence of a doping profile causes a difficulty in the proof of the strict sub-additivity. A key ingredient is to establish the strict sub-additivity by adapting a scaling argument, which is inspired by \cite{ZZou}. When the doping profile is a characteristic function supported on a bounded smooth domain, smallness of some geometric quantity related to the domain ensures the existence of stable standing waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a universal, conceptually simple and systematic method to prove well-posedness to Cauchy problems for weak solutions of parabolic equations with non-smooth, time-dependent, elliptic part having a variational definition. Our classes of weak solutions are taken with minimal assumptions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a fundamental solution which seems new in this generality: it is shown to always coincide with the associated evolution family for the initial value problem with zero source and it yields representation of all weak solutions. Our strategy is a variational approach avoiding density arguments, a priori regularity of weak solutions or regularization by smooth operators. One of our main tools are embedding results which yield time continuity of our weak solutions going beyond the celebrated Lions regularity theorem and that is addressing a variety of source terms. We illustrate our results with three concrete applications : second order uniformly elliptic part with Dirichlet boundary condition on domains, integro-differential elliptic part, and second order degenerate elliptic part.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to investigate the emergence of cross-diffusion in the time evolution of two slow-fast species in competition. A class of triangular cross-diffusion system is obtained as the singular limit of a fast reaction-diffusion system. We first prove the convergence of the unique strict solution of the fast reaction-diffusion system towards a (weak, strong) solution of the cross-diffusion system, as the reaction rate $\epsilon^{-1}$ goes to $+\infty$. Furthermore, under the assumption of small cross-diffusion, we obtain a convergence rate as well as the influence of the initial layer, due to initial data, on the convergence rate itself. Both results are obtained through energy functionals that handle the fast reaction terms uniformly in $\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>A nonvariational Neumann problem for the Helmholtz equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a bounded open subset $\Omega$ of ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ of class $C^{1,\alpha}$ for some $\alpha\in]0,1[$ and we solve the Neumann problem for the Helmholtz equation both in $\Omega$ and in the exterior of $\Omega$. We look for solutions in the space for $\alpha$-H\"{o}lder continuous functions that may not have a classical normal derivative at the boundary points of $\Omega$ and that may have an infinite Dirichlet integral around the boundary of $\Omega$. Namely for solutions that do not belong to the classical variational setting.</description>

      <title>Global hypoellipticity of systems of Fourier multipliers on compact Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the characterization of global hypoellipticity for $G$-invariant operators on homogeneous vector bundles obtained by Cardona and Kowacs [J. Pseudo-Differ. Oper. Appl. 16, 23 (2025)] to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for an arbitrary system of left-invariant operators on a compact Lie group to be globally hypoelliptic, providing a full proof independent of the bundle structure of that paper. We then prove alternative sufficient conditions for globally hypoellipticity for a large class of particular cases of systems making use of lower bounds for the smallest singular value of complex matrices.</description>

      <title>The Whitney method of fundamental solutions with Lusin wavelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09458v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the theoretical foundation for a variant of the method of fundamental solutions (MFS), where the source points $\{q_j\}_{j=1}^\infty$ accumulate towards the domain in a Whitney fashion, meaning that their separation is proportional to the distance to the domain. We prove that the normalized Lusin wavelets $\psi_j(w) = b_j(w-q_j)^{-2}$ constitute a generalized basis, known as a frame, for the Hardy subspace of $L_2$-traces of holomorphic functions on the domain. Consequently, our method, where $\psi_j$ are used as basis functions in the MFS, enables a numerically stable approximation of solutions to Laplace boundary value problems, even when the solutions lack analytic continuation across the boundary. Despite the source points accumulating towards the domain, our computations achieve at least 12 digits of accuracy uniformly up to the boundary, including cases when the solution lacks analytic continuation or when the boundary has corners.</description>
