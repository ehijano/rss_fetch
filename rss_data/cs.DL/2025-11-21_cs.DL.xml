      <title>AI-Assisted Writing Is Growing Fastest Among Non-English-Speaking and Less Established Scientists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dominance of English in global science has long created significant barriers for non-native speakers. The recent emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) dramatically reduces drafting and revision costs, but, simultaneously, raises a critical question: how is the technology being adopted by the global scientific community, and is it mitigating existing inequities? This study provides first large-scale empirical evidence by analyzing over two million full-text biomedical publications from PubMed Central from 2021 to 2024, estimating the fraction of AI-generated content using a distribution-based framework. We observe a significant post-ChatGPT surge in AI-assisted writing, with adoption growing fastest in contexts where language barriers are most pronounced: approximately 400% in non-English-speaking countries compared to 183% in English-speaking countries. This adoption is highest among less-established scientists, including those with fewer publications and citations, as well as those in early career stages at lower-ranked institutions. Prior AI research experience also predicted higher adoption. Finally, increased AI usage was associated with a modest increase in productivity, narrowing the publication gap between scientists from English-speaking and non-English-speaking countries with higher levels of AI adoption. These findings provide large-scale evidence that generative AI is being adopted unevenly, reflecting existing structural disparities while also offering a potential opportunity to mitigate long-standing linguistic inequalities.</description>

      <title>SemanticCite: Citation Verification with AI-Powered Full-Text Analysis and Evidence-Based Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective scientific communication depends on accurate citations that validate sources and guide readers to supporting evidence. Yet academic literature faces mounting challenges: semantic citation errors that misrepresent sources, AI-generated hallucinated references, and traditional citation formats that point to entire papers without indicating which sections substantiate specific claims. We introduce SemanticCite, an AI-powered system that verifies citation accuracy through full-text source analysis while providing rich contextual information via detailed reasoning and relevant text snippets. Our approach combines multiple retrieval methods with a four-class classification system (Supported, Partially Supported, Unsupported, Uncertain) that captures nuanced claim-source relationships and enables appropriate remedial actions for different error types. Our experiments show that fine-tuned lightweight language models achieve performance comparable to large commercial systems with significantly lower computational requirements, making large-scale citation verification practically feasible. The system provides transparent, evidence-based explanations that support user understanding and trust. We contribute a comprehensive dataset of over 1,000 citations with detailed alignments, functional classifications, semantic annotations, and bibliometric metadata across eight disciplines, alongside fine-tuned models and the complete verification framework as open-source software. SemanticCite addresses critical challenges in research integrity through scalable citation verification, streamlined peer review, and quality control for AI-generated content, providing an open-source foundation for maintaining citation accuracy at scale.</description>
