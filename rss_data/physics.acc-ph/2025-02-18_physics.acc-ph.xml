      <title>High-Power Test of a C-band Linear Accelerating Structure with an RFSoC-based LLRF System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normal conducting linear particle accelerators consist of multiple rf stations with accelerating structure cavities. Low-level rf (LLRF) systems are employed to set the phase and amplitude of the field in the accelerating structure, and to compensate the pulse-to-pulse fluctuation of the rf field in the accelerating structures with a feedback loop. The LLRF systems are typically implemented with analogue rf mixers, heterodyne based architectures and discrete data converters. There are multiple rf signals from each of rf station, so the number of rf channels required increases rapidly with multiple rf stations. With many rf channels, the footprint, component cost and system complexity of the LLRF hardware increase significantly. To meet the design goals to be compact and affordable for future accelerators, we have designed the next generation LLRF (NG-LLRF) with higher integration level based on RFSoC technology. The NG-LLRF system samples rf signals directly and performs the rf mixing digitally. The NG-LLRF has been characterized in a loopback mode to evaluate the performance of the system and tested with a standing-wave accelerating structure, a prototype for the Cool Copper Collider (C3) with peak rf power up to 16.45 MW. The loopback test demonstrated amplitude fluctuation below 0.15% and phase fluctuation below 0.15 degree, which are considerably better than the requirements of C3. The rf signals from the different stages of accelerating structure at different power levels are measured by the NG-LLRF, which will be critical references for the control algorithm designs. The NG-LLRF also offers flexibility in waveform modulation, so we have used rf pulses with various modulation schemes which could be useful for controlling some of rf stations in accelerators. In this paper, the high-power test results at different stages of the test setup will be summarized, analyzed and discussed.</description>

      <title>Conical Targets for Enhanced High-Current Positron Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous pair-production-driven positron source designs have assumed that the transverse dimension of the target is significantly greater than the secondary beam it generates. This paper explores the use of targets with different transverse profiles with the aim of enhancing positron production. The starting point of this research is the concept of wire targets, proposed by M. James et al. in 1991 for the former SLC positron source. Building on this foundation, this study takes this concept a step further by introducing conical-shaped targets, which can substantially improve the yield by reducing the reabsorption of positrons by the target--an issue that is worsened by the high-field solenoid lenses commonly used for positron capture. Using Geant4 simulations, we propose new conical targets adapted for the parameters of the future collider FCC-ee and its positron source test facility P-cubed (PSI Positron Production experiment) at the Paul Scherrer Institute. We find that conical targets can nearly double the positron production at the target and enhance the baseline positron yield of FCC-ee by around 60%. Additionally, we present the thermo-mechanical studies for the conical targets based on the FCC-ee primary beam power requirements and outline the mechanical implementation for a future proof-of-principle demonstration at the P-cubed facility.</description>

      <title>A Compact Low-level RF Control System for Advanced Concept Compact Electron Linear Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A compact low-level RF (LLRF) control system based on RF system-on-chip (RFSoC) technology has been designed for the Advanced Concept Compact Electron Linear-accelerator (ACCEL) program, which has challenging requirements in both RF performance and size, weight and power consumption (SWaP). The compact LLRF solution employs the direct RF sampling technique of RFSoC, which samples the RF signals directly without any analogue up and down conversion. Compared with the conventional heterodyne based architecture used for LLRF system of linear accelerator (LINAC), the elimination of analogue mixers can significantly reduce the size and weight of the system, especially with LINAC requires a larger number of RF channels. Based on the requirements of ACCEL, a prototype LLRF platform has been developed, and the control schemes have been proposed. The prototype LLRF system demonstrated magnitude and phase fluctuation levels below 1% and 1 degree, on the flat top of a 2 microseconds RF pulse. The LLRF control schemes proposed for ACCEL are implemented with a prototype hardware platform. This paper will introduce the new compact LLRF solution and summarize a selection of experimental test results of the prototype itself and with the accelerating structure cavities designed for ACCEL.</description>

      <title>Commissioning of a radiofrequency quadrupole cooler-buncher for collinear laser spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A RadioFrequency Quadrupole (RFQ) cooler-buncher system has been developed and implemented in a collinear laser spectroscopy setup. This system is dedicated to convert a continuous ion beam into short bunches, while enhancing beam quality and reducing energy spread. The functionality of the RFQ cooler-buncher has been verified through offline tests with stable rubidium and indium beam, delivered from a surface ion source and a laser ablation ion source, respectively. With a transmission efficiency exceeding 60%, bunched ion beams with a full width at half maximum of approximately 2{\mu}s in the time-of-flight spectrum have been successfully achieved. The implementation of RFQ cooler-buncher system has significantly improved the overall transmission efficiency of the collinear laser spectroscopy setup.</description>
