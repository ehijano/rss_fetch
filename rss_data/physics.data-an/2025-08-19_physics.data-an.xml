      <title>Log Gaussian Cox Process Background Modeling in High Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background modeling is one of the most critical components in high energy physics data analyses, and for smooth backgrounds it is often performed by fitting using an analytic functional form. In this paper a novel method based on Log Gaussian Cox Processes (LGCP) is introduced to model smooth backgrounds while making minimal assumptions on the underlying shape. In LGCP, samples are assumed to be drawn from a non-homogeneous Poisson process, with an intensity function drawn from a Gaussian process. Markov Chain Monte Carlo is used for optimizing the hyper parameters and drawing the final fit for the background estimate from the posterior. Synthetic experiments comparing background modeling from functional forms and the LGCP are used to compare the different methods.</description>

      <title>Wavelets for power spectral density estimation of gravitational wave data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power spectral density (PSD) estimation is a critical step in gravitational wave (GW) detectors data analysis. The Welch method is a typical non-parametric spectral estimation approach that estimates the PSD of stationary noise by averaging periodograms of several time segments, or by taking the median of periodograms to adapt to non-stationary noise. In this work, we propose a wavelet-based approach for fast PSD estimation of both stationary and non-stationary noise. For stationary noise, we apply wavelet smoothing to the periodogram, avoiding the segmentation step in the Welch method, and enabling PSD estimates with high frequency resolution and low variance. The wavelet smoothing PSD outperforms Welch PSD in matched filtering and parameter estimation. For non-stationary noise, we estimate the PSD by taking the median of wavelet packet coefficients in each frequency bin, which offers greater robustness than the traditional median periodogram method. This work introduces a new PSD estimation approach for GW data analysis and expands the application of wavelet methods in this field.</description>

      <title>Short-Term Forecasting of Energy Production and Consumption Using Extreme Learning Machine: A Comprehensive MIMO based ELM Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel methodology for short-term energy forecasting using an Extreme Learning Machine ($\mathtt{ELM}$) is proposed. Using six years of hourly data collected in Corsica (France) from multiple energy sources (solar, wind, hydro, thermal, bioenergy, and imported electricity), our approach predicts both individual energy outputs and total production (\cyr{including imports, which closely follow energy demand, modulo losses)} through a Multi-Input Multi-Output ($\mathtt{MIMO}$) architecture. To address non-stationarity and seasonal variability, sliding window techniques and cyclic time encoding are incorporated, enabling dynamic adaptation to fluctuations. The $\mathtt{ELM}$ model significantly outperforms persistence-based forecasting, particularly for solar and thermal energy, achieving an $\mathtt{nRMSE}$ of $17.9\%$ and $5.1\%$, respectively, with $\mathtt{R^2} &gt; 0.98$ (1-hour horizon). The model maintains high accuracy up to five hours ahead, beyond which renewable energy sources become increasingly volatile. While $\mathtt{MIMO}$ provides marginal gains over Single-Input Single-Output ($\mathtt{SISO}$) architectures and offers key advantages over deep learning methods such as $\mathtt{LSTM}$, it provides a closed-form solution with lower computational demands, making it well-suited for real-time applications, including online learning. Beyond predictive accuracy, the proposed methodology is adaptable to various contexts and datasets, as it can be tuned to local constraints such as resource availability, grid characteristics, and market structures.</description>

      <title>Spectral fluctuations and crossovers in multilayer network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate spectral fluctuations in multilayer networks within the random matrix theory (RMT) framework to characterize universal and non-universal features. The adjacency matrix of a multilayer network exhibits a block structure, with diagonal blocks representing intra-layer connections and off-diagonal blocks encoding inter-layer connections. Applying appropriate scaling factors for these blocks, we equalize variances across inter- and intra-layers, enabling direct comparison of spectral statistics. We analyze eigenvalue spectra across multilayer network configurations with varying inter- and intra-layer connectivities. Introducing a crossover model for bilayer networks, we capture the smooth transition of spectral properties from block-diagonal (two independent GOEs) to single-layer (one GOE) statistics as the relative strength of inter-layer to intra-layer connection varies. Furthermore, we analyze interatomic distance networks derived from protein crystal structures, including 1EWT, 1EWK, and 1UW6, to demonstrate applicability. Our findings reveal that the universality of spectral fluctuations persists across multilayer network architectures and highlight RMT as a robust tool for probing topological and dynamical complexities of real-world networks.</description>

      <title>A Distribution-Free Approach to Testing Models for Angular Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel goodness-of-fit strategy is introduced for testing models of angular power spectra with unknown parameters. Using this strategy, it is possible to assess the validity of such models without specifying the distribution of the angular power spectrum estimators. This holds under general conditions, ensuring the method's applicability in diverse applications. Moreover, the proposed solution overcomes the need for case-by-case simulations when testing different models, leading to notable computational advantages.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Analysis of Unstructured Data with Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the particle physics community needs higher and higher precisions in order to test our current model of the subatomic world, larger and larger datasets are necessary. With upgrades scheduled for the detectors of colliding-beam experiments around the world, and specifically at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, more collisions and more complex interactions are expected. This directly implies an increase in data produced and consequently in the computational resources needed to process them. At CERN, the amount of data produced is gargantuan. This is why the data have to be heavily filtered and selected in real time before being permanently stored. This data can then be used to perform physics analyses, in order to expand our current understanding of the universe and improve the Standard Model of physics. This real-time filtering, known as triggering, involves complex processing happening often at frequencies as high as 40 MHz. This thesis contributes to understanding how machine learning models can be efficiently deployed in such environments, in order to maximize throughput and minimize energy consumption. Inevitably, modern hardware designed for such tasks and contemporary algorithms are needed in order to meet the challenges posed by the stringent, high-frequency data rates. In this work, I present our graph neural network-based pipeline, developed for charged particle track reconstruction at the LHCb experiment at CERN. The pipeline was implemented end-to-end inside LHCb's first-level trigger, entirely on GPUs. Its performance was compared against the classical tracking algorithms currently in production at LHCb. The pipeline was also accelerated on the FPGA architecture, and its performance in terms of power consumption and processing speed was compared against the GPU implementation.</description>

      <title>Network inference applicable to both synchronous and desynchronous systems from oscillatory signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronization is ubiquitous in nature, which is mathematically described by coupled oscillators. Synchronization strongly depends on the interaction network, and the network plays a crucial role in controlling the dynamics. To understand and control synchronization dynamics in the real world, it is essential to identify the network from the observed data. While previous studies have developed the methods for inferring the network of asynchronous systems, it remains challenging to infer the network of well-synchronized oscillators. In this study, we develop a method for inferring the network of synchronized and desynchronized oscillators from time series. Our method expands the applicability of network inference to a wider class of oscillatory systems. The proposed method discards a large part of data used for inference, which may seem counterintuitive. However, the effectiveness of the method is supported by the phase reduction theory, a well-established theory for weakly coupled oscillators. We verify the proposed method by applying it to simulated data of the limit-cycle oscillators. This study provides an important step towards understanding synchronization in real-world systems from a network perspective.</description>

      <title>Starobinsky in Stereo: SKA-CMB Synergy in SBI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning techniques can unlock the vast cosmological information encoded in forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) observations. We show that tomographic 21 cm data from the reionisation era can yield stringent tests of inflationary models - here illustrated with Starobinsky $R+R^2$ inflation. Using a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework, we compare neural summaries (convolutional network and vision transformer) with a traditional power spectrum summary and perform a fully joint SBI analysis combining 21 cm data with data of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Forecasts based on realistic mock observations indicate that SKA alone will achieve constraints competitive with Planck, and that the combined SKA + CMB dataset will tighten bounds on both inflationary and $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ parameters considerably while improving precision on key astrophysical quantities.</description>
