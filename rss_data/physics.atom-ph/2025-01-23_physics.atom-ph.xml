      <title>Radiative decay of muonic molecules in resonance states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01756v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we theoretically investigated x-ray spectra from the radiative decay of muonic deuterium molecules in resonance states dd$\mu^\ast$, which plays an important role in a new kinetic model of muon catalyzed fusion ($\mu$CF). The resonance states are Feshbach resonances located below the d$\mu$($n=2$) + d threshold energy and radiatively decay into the continuum or bound states. The x-ray spectra having characteristic shapes according to the radial distribution of the two nuclei are obtained using precise three-body wave functions. We carefully examined the convergence of the x-ray spectra and achieved agreements between the length- and velocity-gauge calculations. We revealed a non-adiabatic kinetic energy distribution of the decay fragments, indicating that the radiative decay becomes a heating source of muonic atoms. We also investigated the decay branch that directly results in bound-state muonic molecules. Some resonance states dd$\mu^\ast$ and dt$\mu^\ast$ are found to have high branching ratios to the bound state where intramolecular nuclear fusion occurs. The formation of the muonic molecules in the bound states from metastable muonic atoms can be a fast track in the $\mu$CF cycle which skips a slow path to form the bound state from the ground-state muonic atoms and increases the $\mu$CF cycle rate. Although the spectra from the radiative decays are located in the energy range of $1.5$--$1.997$ keV, which is close to the K$\alpha$ x-ray of 1.997 keV from muonic deuterium atoms, state-of-the-art microcalorimeters can distinguish them.</description>

      <title>A neural network approach for line detection in complex atomic emission spectra measured by high-resolution Fourier transform spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The atomic spectra and structure of the open d- and f-shell elements are extremely complex, where tens of thousands of transitions between fine structure energy levels can be observed as spectral lines across the infrared and UV per species. Energy level quantum properties and transition wavenumbers of these elements underpins almost all spectroscopic plasma diagnostic investigations, with prominent demands from astronomy and fusion research. Despite their importance, these fundamental data are incomplete for many species. A major limitation for the analyses of emission spectra of the open d- and f-shell elements is the amount of time and human resource required to extract transition wavenumbers and intensities from the spectra. Here, the spectral line detection problem is approached by encoding the spectrum point-wise using bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks, where transition wavenumber positions are decoded by a fully connected neural network. The model was trained using simulated atomic spectra and evaluated against experimental Fourier transform spectra of Ni ($Z=28$) covering 1800-70,000 cm$^{-1}$ (5555-143 nm) and Nd ($Z=60$) covering 25,369-32,485 cm$^{-1}$ (394-308 nm), measured under a variety of experimental set-ups. Improvements over conventional methods in line detection were evident, particularly for spectral lines that are noisy, blended, and/or distorted by instrumental spectral resolution-limited ringing. In evaluating model performance, a brief energy level analysis of Ni II using lines newly detected by the neural networks has led to the confident identification of two Ni II levels, $3\text{d}^8$$(^3\text{F}_4)6\text{f} [2]_{3/2}$ at 134,261.8946 $\pm$ 0.0081 cm$^{-1}$ and $3\text{d}^8$$(^3\text{F}_4)6\text{f} [1]_{3/2}$ at 134,249.5264 $\pm$ 0.0054 cm$^{-1}$, previously concluded to be unidentifiable using previously analysed Ni spectra.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry-like tunneling current noise as a probe of Goldstino excitation in a Bose-Fermi mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Goldstino, which is a fermionic Nambu-Goldstone mode, has been predicted in a Bose-Fermi mixture when the supersymmetry is broken. To detect this excitation mode, we theoretically investigate the shot noise of the supersymmetry-like tunneling current in a weakly interacting ultracold Bose-Fermi mixture. The Fano factor, which is defined by the noise-to-current ratio, reflect the elementary carriers of the tunneling process. The change of the Fano factor microscopically as the density changes evinces a crossover from the quasiparticle transport to multiparticle (Goldstino) transport. The tunneling channel can also be changed by tuning the potential barrier.</description>

      <title>Optical Nuclear Electric Resonance as Single Qubit Gate for Trapped Neutral Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise control of nuclear spin states is crucial for a wide range of quantum technology applications. Here, we propose a fast and robust single qubit gate in $^{87}$Sr, utilizing the concept of optical nuclear electric resonance (ONER). ONER exploits the interaction between the quadrupole moment of a nucleus and the electric field gradient generated by its electronic environment, enabling spin level transitions via amplitude-modulated laser light. We investigate the hyperfine structure of the 5s$^2$ $^1S_{0}\rightarrow{}$ 5s5p $^3P_1$ optical transition in neutral $^{87}$Sr, and identify the magnetic field strengths and laser parameters necessary to drive spin transitions between the $m_I$ = -9/2 and $m_I$ = -5/2 hyperfine levels in the ground state. Our simulations show that ONER could enable faster spin operations compared to the state-of-the-art oscillations in this 'atomic qubit'. Moreover, we show that the threshold for fault-tolerant quantum computing can be surpassed even in the presence of typical noise sources. These results pave the way for significant advances in nuclear spin control, opening new possibilities for quantum memories and other quantum technologies.</description>
