      <title>Safety-Driven Battery Charging: A Fisher Information-guided Adaptive MPC with Real-time Parameter Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are ubiquitous in modern energy storage systems, highlighting the critical need to comprehend and optimize their performance. Yet, battery models often exhibit poor parameter identifiability which hinders the development of effective battery management strategies and impacts their overall performance, longevity, and safety. This manuscript explores the integration of Fisher Information (FI) theory with Model Predictive Control (MPC) for battery charging. The study addresses the inherent hurdles in accurately estimating battery model parameters due to nonlinear dynamics and uncertainty. Our proposed method aims to ensure safe battery charging and enhance real-time parameter estimation capabilities by leveraging adaptive control strategies guided by FI metrics. Simulation results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating parameter identifiability issues, offering promising solutions for improving the control of batteries during safe charging process.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Thermal Modeling for Electrically Excited Synchronous Motors -- A Supervised Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven supervised machine learning (ML) for online thermal modeling of electrically excited synchronous motors (EESMs). EESMs are desired for EVs due to their high performance, efficiency, and durability at a relatively low cost. Therefore, obtaining precise EESM temperature estimations are significantly important, because online accurate temperature estimation can lead to EESM performance improvement and guaranteeing its safety and reliability. In this study, in addition to the default inputs' data, EESM losses data is leveraged to improve the performance of the proposed ML approach for thermal modeling. Exponentially weighted moving averages and standard deviations of the inputs are also incorporated in the learning process to consider the memory effect for modeling a dynamical thermal model. Using the experimental data of an EESM prototype, the performance of ordinary least squares (OLS) method is evaluated through a complete training, testing and cross-validation process. Finally, simulation results will provide the key performance metrics of OLS for EESM thermal modeling.</description>

      <title>The expressway network design problem for multiple urban subregions based on the macroscopic fundamental diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As urbanization advances, cities are expanding, leading to a more decentralized urban structure and longer average commuting durations. The construction of an urban expressway system emerges as a critical strategy to tackle this challenge. However, the traditional link-level network design method faces modeling and solution challenges when dealing with the large-scale expressway network design problem (ENDP). To address the challenges, this paper proposes an expressway network design method for multiple urban subregions based on the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD). Initially, a mixed road network traffic model that describes traffic dynamics of multiple subregions and candidate expressways is developed by integrating the MFD and the cell transmission model (CTM). Then, treating urban subregions and candidate expressways as route nodes in the mixed road network, a route choice model is established based on stochastic user equilibrium. Finally, a decision model for ENDP is proposed to minimize vehicle travel time under the construction budget constraint. The impact of financial investment and traffic demand on expressway network design schemes in the case study is explored separately. The simulation results indicate that during the initial stages of expressway planning, the construction of new expressways can significantly alleviate traffic congestion. However, as the expressway network expands further, the effectiveness of improving traffic conditions through new expressway construction gradually diminishes if traffic demand does not continue to increase. Additionally, variations in traffic demand between subregions result in different construction schemes, emphasizing the importance of adjusting budget allocations based on specific traffic demands.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Cooperative Streaming of Holographic Video Over Wireless Networks: A Proximal Policy Optimization Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting holographic video streaming to fluctuating wireless channels is essential to maintain consistent and satisfactory Quality of Experience (QoE) for users, which, however, is a challenging task due to the dynamic and uncertain characteristics of wireless networks. To address this issue, we propose a holographic video cooperative streaming framework designed for a generic wireless network in which multiple access points can cooperatively transmit video with different bitrates to multiple users. Additionally, we model a novel QoE metric tailored specifically for holographic video streaming, which can effectively encapsulate the nuances of holographic video quality, quality fluctuations, and rebuffering occurrences simultaneously. Furthermore, we formulate a formidable QoE maximization problem, which is a non-convex mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. Using proximal policy optimization (PPO), a new class of reinforcement learning algorithms, we devise a joint beamforming and bitrate control scheme, which can be wisely adapted to fluctuations in the wireless channel. The numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme over representative baselines.</description>

      <title>Predicting Fault-Ride-Through Probability of Inverter-Dominated Power Grids using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the increasing share of renewables, the analysis of the dynamical behavior of power grids gains importance. Effective risk assessments necessitate the analysis of large number of fault scenarios. The computational costs inherent in dynamic simulations impose constraints on the number of configurations that can be analyzed. Machine Learning (ML) has proven to efficiently predict complex power grid properties. Hence, we analyze the potential of ML for predicting dynamic stability of future power grids with large shares of inverters. For this purpose, we generate a new dataset consisting of synthetic power grid models and perform dynamical simulations. As targets for the ML training, we calculate the fault-ride-through probability, which we define as the probability of staying within a ride-through curve after a fault at a bus has been cleared. Importantly, we demonstrate that ML models accurately predict the fault-ride-through probability of synthetic power grids. Finally, we also show that the ML models generalize to an IEEE-96 Test System, which emphasizes the potential of deploying ML methods to study probabilistic stability of power grids.</description>

      <title>Joint Observer Gain and Input Design for Asymptotic Active Fault Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a joint gain and input design method for observer-based asymptotic active fault diagnosis, which is based on a newly-defined notion named the excluding degree of the origin from a zonotope. Using the excluding degree, a quantitative specification is obtained to characterize the performance of set-based robust fault diagnosis. Furthermore, a single gain design method and a joint gain and input design method are proposed, respectively. This is the first work to achieve a joint observer gain and input design for set-based active fault diagnosis. Compared with the existing methods that design gains and input separately, the proposed joint gain and input design method has advantages to exploit the fault diagnosis potential of observer-based schemes. Finally, several examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Data-driven modeling and supervisory control system optimization for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based intelligent energy management systems for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are crucial for achieving efficient energy utilization. However, their application faces system reliability challenges in the real world, which prevents widespread acceptance by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). This paper begins by establishing a PHEV model based on physical and data-driven models, focusing on the high-fidelity training environment. It then proposes a real-vehicle application-oriented control framework, combining horizon-extended reinforcement learning (RL)-based energy management with the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) to enhance practical applicability, and improves the flawed method of equivalent factor evaluation based on instantaneous driving cycle and powertrain states found in existing research. Finally, comprehensive simulation and hardware-in-the-loop validation are carried out which demonstrates the advantages of the proposed control framework in fuel economy over adaptive-ECMS and rule-based strategies. Compared to conventional RL architectures that directly control powertrain components, the proposed control method not only achieves similar optimality but also significantly enhances the disturbance resistance of the energy management system, providing an effective control framework for RL-based energy management strategies aimed at real-vehicle applications by OEMs.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Actor-Critic Based Optimal Regulation for Drift-Free Uncertain Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a continuous-time adaptive actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL) controller is developed for drift-free nonlinear systems. Practical examples of such systems are image-based visual servoing (IBVS) and wheeled mobile robots (WMR), where the system dynamics includes a parametric uncertainty in the control effectiveness matrix with no drift term. The uncertainty in the input term poses a challenge for developing a continuous-time RL controller using existing methods. In this paper, an actor-critic or synchronous policy iteration (PI)-based RL controller is presented with a concurrent learning (CL)-based parameter update law for estimating the unknown parameters of the control effectiveness matrix. An infinite-horizon value function minimization objective is achieved by regulating the current states to the desired with near-optimal control efforts. The proposed controller guarantees closed-loop stability and simulation results validate the proposed theory using IBVS and WMR examples.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Modelling of a Water and Air Injector in a Subsonic Icing Wind Tunnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of droplet generation in wind tunnels in conducting icing experiments is of great importance in determining ice formation on structures or surfaces, where parameters such as Liquid Water Content (LWC) and Median Volumetric Diameter (MVD) play a relevant role. The measurement of these parameters requires specialised instrumentation. In this paper, several experiments have been carried out in a subsonic wind tunnel facility to study the parameters that are part of the icing process in structures. Furthermore, a mathematical modelling of the constituent subsystems of the plant study that allow us to have a comprehensive understanding of the behaviour of the system is developed using techniques based on first principles and machine learning techniques such as regression trees and neural networks. The simulation results show that the implementation of the model manages to obtain prominent expected values of LWC and MVD within the range of values obtained in the real experimental data.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for a Real-World Labyrinth Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a nonlinear non-convex model predictive control approach to solving a real-world labyrinth game. We introduce adaptive nonlinear constraints, representing the non-convex obstacles within the labyrinth. Our method splits the computation-heavy optimization problem into two layers; first, a high-level model predictive controller which incorporates the full problem formulation and finds pseudo-global optimal trajectories at a low frequency. Secondly, a low-level model predictive controller that receives a reduced, computationally optimized version of the optimization problem to follow the given high-level path in real-time. Further, a map of the labyrinth surface irregularities is learned. Our controller is able to handle the major disturbances and model inaccuracies encountered on the labyrinth and outperforms other classical control methods.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Quadcopter Controller: A Practical Approach and Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadcopters have been studied for decades thanks to their maneuverability and capability of operating in a variety of circumstances. However, quadcopters suffer from dynamical nonlinearity, actuator saturation, as well as sensor noise that make it challenging and time consuming to obtain accurate dynamic models and achieve satisfactory control performance. Fortunately, deep reinforcement learning came and has shown significant potential in system modelling and control of autonomous multirotor aerial vehicles, with recent advancements in deployment, performance enhancement, and generalization. In this paper, an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning-based controller for quadcopters is proposed that is secure for real-world implementation, data-efficient, and free of human gain adjustments. First, a novel actor-critic-based architecture is designed to map the robot states directly to the motor outputs. Then, a quadcopter dynamics-based simulator was devised to facilitate the training of the controller policy. Finally, the trained policy is deployed on a real Crazyflie nano quadrotor platform, without any additional fine-tuning process. Experimental results show that the quadcopter exhibits satisfactory performance as it tracks a given complicated trajectory, which demonstrates the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method and signifies its capability in filling the simulation-to-reality gap.</description>

      <title>OmniH2O: Universal and Dexterous Human-to-Humanoid Whole-Body Teleoperation and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present OmniH2O (Omni Human-to-Humanoid), a learning-based system for whole-body humanoid teleoperation and autonomy. Using kinematic pose as a universal control interface, OmniH2O enables various ways for a human to control a full-sized humanoid with dexterous hands, including using real-time teleoperation through VR headset, verbal instruction, and RGB camera. OmniH2O also enables full autonomy by learning from teleoperated demonstrations or integrating with frontier models such as GPT-4. OmniH2O demonstrates versatility and dexterity in various real-world whole-body tasks through teleoperation or autonomy, such as playing multiple sports, moving and manipulating objects, and interacting with humans. We develop an RL-based sim-to-real pipeline, which involves large-scale retargeting and augmentation of human motion datasets, learning a real-world deployable policy with sparse sensor input by imitating a privileged teacher policy, and reward designs to enhance robustness and stability. We release the first humanoid whole-body control dataset, OmniH2O-6, containing six everyday tasks, and demonstrate humanoid whole-body skill learning from teleoperated datasets.</description>

      <title>Human-Robot Interface for Teleoperated Robotized Planetary Sample Collection and Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As human space exploration evolves toward longer voyages farther from our home planet, in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) becomes increasingly important. Haptic teleoperations are one of the technologies by which such activities can be carried out remotely by humans, whose expertise is still necessary for complex activities. In order to perform precision tasks with effectiveness, the operator must experience ease of use and accuracy. The same features are demanded to reduce the complexity of the training procedures and the associated learning time for operators without a specific background in robotic teleoperations. Haptic teleoperation systems, that allow for a natural feeling of forces, need to cope with the trade-off between accurate movements and workspace extension. Clearly, both of them are required for typical ISRU tasks. In this work, we develop a new concept of operations and suitable human-robot interfaces to achieve sample collection and assembly with ease of use and accuracy. In the proposed operational concept, the teleoperation space is extended by executing automated trajectories, offline planned at the control station. In three different experimental scenarios, we validate the end-to-end system involving the control station and the robotic asset, by assessing the contribution of haptics to mission success, the system robustness to consistent delays, and the ease of training new operators.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Membership Function Dynamics for Stability Analysis of T-S Fuzzy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to develop a new linear matrix inequality (LMI) condition for the asymptotic stability of continuous-time Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems. A key advantage of this new condition is its independence from the bounds on the time-derivatives of the membership functions, a requirement present in the existing approaches. This is achieved by introducing a novel fuzzy Lyapunov function that incorporates an augmented state vector. Notably, this augmented state vector encompasses the membership functions, allowing the dynamics of these functions to be integrated into the proposed condition. This inclusion of additional information about the membership function serves to reduce the conservativeness of the suggested stability condition. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, examples are provided.</description>

      <title>Predictive Linear Online Tracking for Unknown Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of online tracking in linear control systems, where the objective is to follow a moving target. Unlike classical tracking control, the target is unknown, non-stationary, and its state is revealed sequentially, thus, fitting the framework of online non-stochastic control. We consider the case of quadratic costs and propose a new algorithm, called predictive linear online tracking (PLOT). The algorithm uses recursive least squares with exponential forgetting to learn a time-varying dynamic model of the target. The learned model is used in the optimal policy under the framework of receding horizon control. We show the dynamic regret of PLOT scales with $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{TV_T})$, where $V_T$ is the total variation of the target dynamics and $T$ is the time horizon. Unlike prior work, our theoretical results hold for non-stationary targets. We implement PLOT on a real quadrotor and provide open-source software, thus, showcasing one of the first successful applications of online control methods on real hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many control system applications, state constraint satisfaction needs to be guaranteed within a prescribed time. While this issue has been partially addressed for systems with known dynamics, it remains largely unaddressed for systems with unknown dynamics. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian process-based time-varying control method that leverages backstepping and control barrier functions to achieve safety requirements within prescribed time windows for control affine systems. It can be used to keep a system within a safe region or to make it return to a safe region within a limited time window. These properties are cemented by rigorous theoretical results. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated in a simulation of a robotic manipulator.</description>

      <title>Research on material identification of mobile phones falling to the ground</title>

Abstract: The failure mode of the phone falling has a lot to do with the ground material. At present, the research on ground material and mobile phone damage is generally carried out through experiments, which is extremely costly. This paper presents a method to identify the material of mobile phones falling on the ground. The method determines the material of the mobile phone falling to the ground according to the data of the mobile phone accelerometer and can obtain the ground material of the mobile phone falling through a large number of user data. By analyzing the physical process of mobile phone falling, the accelerometer data interval which can reflect the characteristics of falling is reasonably intercepted. And the data features that can reflect the collision are extracted. Finally, based on the fully connected neural network, the method of determining the material of mobile phones falling on the ground is developed. The experimental results show that the method has a high identification rate, and the average identification rate for different ground materials is 96.75%. Instead of relying on auxiliary devices, the identification process only relies on the phone's built-in acceleration sensor. This paper fills the gap in the field of mobile phone falling ground material identification. It has a great contribution to the collection of user drop data, the analysis of the drop process, and the improvement of mobile phone design defects.</description>

      <title>Multi-Static ISAC based on Network-Assisted Full-Duplex Cell-Free Networks: Performance Analysis and Duplex Mode Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-static integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology, which can achieve a wider coverage range and avoid self-interference, is an important trend for the future development of ISAC. Existing multi-static ISAC designs are unable to support the asymmetric uplink (UL)/downlink (DL) communication requirements in the scenario while simultaneously achieving optimal sensing performance. This paper proposes a design for multi-static ISAC based on network-assisted full-duplex (NAFD) cell-free networks can well solve the above problems. Under this design, closed-form expressions for the individual comunication rate and localization error rate are derived under imperfect channel state information, which are respectively utilized to assess the communication and sensing performances. Then, we propose a deep Q-network-based accesss point (AP) duplex mode optimization algorithm to obtain the trade-off between communication and sensing from the UL and DL perspectives of the APs. Simulation results demonstrate that the NAFD-based ISAC system proposed in this paper can achieve significantly better communication performance than other ISAC systems while ensuring minimal impact on sensing performance. Then, we validate the accuracy of the derived closed-form expressions. Furthermore, the proposed optimization algorithm achieves performance comparable to that of the exhaustion method with low complexity.</description>

      <title>On the detection of the presence of malicious components in cyber-physical systems in the almost sure sense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12516v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article studies a fundamental problem of security of cyber-physical systems (CPSs): that of detecting, almost surely, the presence of malicious components in the CPS. We assume that some of the actuators may be malicious while all sensors are honest. We introduce a novel idea of separability of state trajectories generated by CPSs in two situations: those under the nominal no-attack situation and those under the influence of an attacker. We establish its connection to security of CPSs in the context of detecting the presence of malicious actuators (if any) in them. As primary contributions we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the aforementioned detection in CPSs modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs). Moreover, we focus on the mechanism of perturbing the pre-determined control policies of the honest agents in CPSs modeled as stochastic linear systems, by injecting a certain class of random process called private excitation; sufficient conditions for detectability and non-detectability of the presence of malicious actuators assuming that the policies are randomized history dependent and randomized Markovian, are established. Several technical aspects of our results are discussed extensively.</description>

      <title>Multi-contact Stochastic Predictive Control for Legged Robots with Contact Locations Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trajectory optimization under uncertainties is a challenging problem for robots in contact with the environment. Such uncertainties are inevitable due to estimation errors, control imperfections, and model mismatches between planning models used for control and the real robot dynamics. This induces control policies that could violate the contact location constraints by making contact at unintended locations, and as a consequence leading to unsafe motion plans. This work addresses the problem of robust kino-dynamic whole-body trajectory optimization using stochastic nonlinear model predictive control (SNMPC) by considering additive uncertainties on the model dynamics subject to contact location chance-constraints as a function of robot's full kinematics. We demonstrate the benefit of using SNMPC over classic nonlinear MPC (NMPC) for whole-body trajectory optimization in terms of contact location constraint satisfaction (safety). We run extensive Monte-Carlo simulations for a quadruped robot performing agile trotting and bounding motions over small stepping stones, where contact location satisfaction becomes critical. Our results show that SNMPC is able to perform all motions safely with 100% success rate, while NMPC failed 48.3% of all motions.</description>

      <title>LQG Information Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses information design with linear best responses of agents, quadratic objective functions of an information designer, and a payoff state distributed according to a Gaussian distribution. We formulate the problem as semidefinite programming (SDP) and use the duality principle to characterize an optimal information structure. There exists a Gaussian information structure that is optimal among all information structures. A necessary and sufficient condition for optimality is that the realizations of the induced action profile and a state satisfy linear constraints derived from the primal and dual SDP. As a result, an observed action profile typically reveals the true state even if individual agents have only partial knowledge. In symmetric network games, an optimal information structure inherits this symmetry, which facilitates the computation of an optimal information structure.</description>

      <title>Multi-AUV Kinematic Task Assignment based on Self-organizing Map Neural Network and Dubins Path Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07536v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To deal with the task assignment problem of multi-AUV systems under kinematic constraints, which means steering capability constraints for underactuated AUVs or other vehicles likely, an improved task assignment algorithm is proposed combining the Dubins Path algorithm with improved SOM neural network algorithm. At first, the aimed tasks are assigned to the AUVs by improved SOM neural network method based on workload balance and neighborhood function. When there exists kinematic constraints or obstacles which may cause failure of trajectory planning, task re-assignment will be implemented by change the weights of SOM neurals, until the AUVs can have paths to reach all the targets. Then, the Dubins paths are generated in several limited cases. AUV's yaw angle is limited, which result in new assignments to the targets. Computation flow is designed so that the algorithm in MATLAB and Python can realizes the path planning to multiple targets. Finally, simulation results prove that the proposed algorithm can effectively accomplish the task assignment task for multi-AUV system.</description>

      <title>After the Breach: Incident Response within Enterprises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enterprises are constantly under attack from sophisticated adversaries. These adversaries use a variety of techniques to first gain access to the enterprise, then spread laterally inside its networks, establish persistence, and finally exfiltrate sensitive data, or hold it for ransom. While historically, enterprises have used different Incident Response systems that monitor hosts, servers, or network devices to detect and report threats, these systems often need many analysts to triage and respond to alerts. However, the immense quantity of alerts to sift through, combined with the potential risk of missing a valid threat makes the task of the analyst challenging. To ease this manual and laborious process, researchers have proposed a variety of systems that perform automated attack investigations. These systems collect data, track causally related events, and present the analyst with an interpretable summary of the attack. In this paper, we present a survey of systems that perform automated attack investigation, and compare them based on their designs, goals, and heuristics. We discuss the challenges faced by these systems, and present a comparison in terms of their effectiveness, practicality, and ability to address these challenges. We conclude by discussing the future of these systems, and the open problems in this area.</description>

      <title>GAPses: Versatile smart glasses for comfortable and fully-dry acquisition and parallel ultra-low-power processing of EEG and EOG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in head-mounted wearable technology are revolutionizing the field of biopotential measurement, but the integration of these technologies into practical, user-friendly devices remains challenging due to issues with design intrusiveness, comfort, and data privacy. To address these challenges, this paper presents GAPSES, a novel smart glasses platform designed for unobtrusive, comfortable, and secure acquisition and processing of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals. We introduce a direct electrode-electronics interface with custom fully dry soft electrodes to enhance comfort for long wear. An integrated parallel ultra-low-power RISC-V processor (GAP9, Greenwaves Technologies) processes data at the edge, thereby eliminating the need for continuous data streaming through a wireless link, enhancing privacy, and increasing system reliability in adverse channel conditions. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the designed prototype through validation in a number of EEG-based interaction tasks, including alpha waves, steady-state visual evoked potential analysis, and motor movement classification. Furthermore, we demonstrate an EEG-based biometric subject recognition task, where we reach a sensitivity and specificity of 98.87% and 99.86% respectively, with only 8 EEG channels and an energy consumption per inference on the edge as low as 121 uJ. Moreover, in an EOG-based eye movement classification task, we reach an accuracy of 96.68% on 11 classes, resulting in an information transfer rate of 94.78 bit/min, which can be further increased to 161.43 bit/min by reducing the accuracy to 81.43%. The deployed implementation has an energy consumption of 24 uJ per inference and a total system power of only 16.28 mW, allowing for continuous operation of more than 12 h with a small 75 mAh battery.</description>
