      <title>DLSOM: A Deep learning-based strategy for liver cancer subtyping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liver cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with its high genetic heterogeneity complicating diagnosis and treatment. This study introduces DLSOM, a deep learning framework utilizing stacked autoencoders to analyze the complete somatic mutation landscape of 1,139 liver cancer samples, covering 20,356 protein-coding genes. By transforming high-dimensional mutation data into three low-dimensional features, DLSOM enables robust clustering and identifies five distinct liver cancer subtypes with unique mutational, functional, and biological profiles. Subtypes SC1 and SC2 exhibit higher mutational loads, while SC3 has the lowest, reflecting mutational heterogeneity. Novel and COSMIC-associated mutational signatures reveal subtype-specific molecular mechanisms, including links to hypermutation and chemotherapy resistance. Functional analyses further highlight the biological relevance of each subtype. This comprehensive framework advances precision medicine in liver cancer by enabling the development of subtype-specific diagnostics, biomarkers, and therapies, showcasing the potential of deep learning in addressing cancer complexity.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence for Central Dogma-Centric Multi-Omics: Challenges and Breakthroughs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing platforms, an increasing number of omics technologies, such as genomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics, are being applied to disease genetics research. However, biological data often exhibit high dimensionality and significant noise, making it challenging to effectively distinguish disease subtypes using a single-omics approach. To address these challenges and better capture the interactions among DNA, RNA, and proteins described by the central dogma, numerous studies have leveraged artificial intelligence to develop multi-omics models for disease research. These AI-driven models have improved the accuracy of disease prediction and facilitated the identification of genetic loci associated with diseases, thus advancing precision medicine. This paper reviews the mathematical definitions of multi-omics, strategies for integrating multi-omics data, applications of artificial intelligence and deep learning in multi-omics, the establishment of foundational models, and breakthroughs in multi-omics technologies, drawing insights from over 130 related articles. It aims to provide practical guidance for computational biologists to better understand and effectively utilize AI-based multi-omics machine learning algorithms in the context of central dogma.</description>
