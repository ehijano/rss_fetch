      <title>Determining Magnetic Field Directions and Omni-directional Fluxes of Particles from STPSat-6 ZPS Plasma Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report summarizes our recent data derivation efforts on STPSat-6 ZPS plasma measurements, presenting final outcomes. We begin by outlining the methodology developed to determine local magnetic field directions from measured directional intensities of ~20 keV ions,leveraging symmetry in particles' pitch-angle distributions, and the determined field directions over a storm period are shown with errors analyzed through comparison with NOAA GOES measurements. Next, we further assess the validity of the method and quantify its overall high performance while acknowledging certain caveats. Finally, given local magnetic field directions and ZPS data, we explain how omni-directional fluxes of particles can be derived from ZPS measurements with limited directional coverage, and estimate the related errors under several theoretical scenarios. The methods developed in this study can be applied for processing and augmenting ZPS data for the next, and the insights gained here can also inform instrument design in the future.</description>

      <title>How does the limited resolution of space plasma analyzers affect the accuracy of space plasma measurements?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the systematic errors in measured plasma velocity distribution functions and their corresponding velocity moments, arising from the limited energy and angular resolution of top-hat electrostatic analyzers. For this purpose, we develop a forward model of a concept analyzer that simulates observations of typical solar wind proton plasma particles with their velocities following a Maxwell distribution function. We then review the standard conversion of the observations to physical parameters and evaluate the errors arising from the limited resolution of the modeled instrument. We show that the limited resolution of the instrument results in velocity distributions that underestimate the core and overestimate the tails of the actual Maxwellian plasma velocity distribution functions. As a consequence, the velocity moments of the observed plasma underestimate the proton density and overestimate the proton temperature. Moreover, we show that the examined errors become significant for cold and fast plasma protons. We finally determine a mathematical formula that predicts these systematic inaccuracies based on specific plasma inputs and instrument features. Our results inform and contextualize future evaluations of observations by analyzers in various plasma regimes.</description>

      <title>Imaging and spectropolarimetric observations of a band-split type II solar radio burst with LOFAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type II solar radio bursts are generated by electrons accelerated by coronal shock waves. They appear in dynamic spectra as lanes drifting from higher to lower frequencies at the plasma frequency and its harmonic. These lanes can often be split into two or more sub-bands that have similar drift rates. This phenomenon is called band-splitting, and its physical origins are still under debate. Our aim is to investigate the origin of band-splitting using novel imaging and spectropolarimetric observations of a type II solar radio burst from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). We used LOFAR imaging at multiple frequencies and time steps to track the locations of the radio sources corresponding to the two components of the band-split emission lane. In addition, we estimated the degree of circular polarisation (dcp) for both components using LOFAR's full Stokes dynamic spectra. From the imaging of the type II burst, we found two close but clearly separated emission regions clustered over several frequencies spanning each split band. One emission region corresponds to the lower frequency band and the other to the higher frequency band of the split lane. Using the full Stokes dynamic spectra, we also found the dcp to be very similar for both bands. The two distinct emission regions suggest that the split bands originate from two separate regions at the shock. The similar values of dcp for both sub-bands correspond to similar values of magnetic field strength in the two regions and indicate little to no change in the emission region plasma. Thus, our findings are in contradiction with previous theories, which have suggested that split bands originate in the same region but upstream and downstream of the shock. Instead, our results suggest that both bands originate in two separate upstream regions since we find a clear separation in locations and no magnetic compression.</description>
