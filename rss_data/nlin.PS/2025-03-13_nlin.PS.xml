      <title>Vector soliton molecules and their collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent times, bound soliton states have often been referred to as soliton molecules in the nonlinear optics literature. The striking analogies between photonic bound states and matter molecular structures in chemistry and physics have intensified studies on optical soliton molecules in both conservative and dissipative systems. In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of vector soliton molecules and their related isomer structures in a conservative optical fiber system by considering the integrable Manakov equation. We show their existence by applying the velocity resonance condition and appropriate choice of temporal separations to the degenerate $N=(\bar{N}+\bar{M})$-soliton solution. Then, we classify the obtained molecular states as either dissociated or synthesized molecular states based on the temporal locations of the constituent solitons. Furthermore, we analyze the collision properties of vector soliton molecules in the present conservative system. The collision scenarios reveal that the soliton molecules undergo intriguing energy-sharing collisions through energy redistribution among the modes. To characterize these collisions, we have carried out an appropriate asymptotic analysis and found that elastic collisions arise as a special case of energy-sharing collisions under specific choices of polarization constants. Finally, we numerically verify the robustness of vector soliton molecules. We believe that the results presented in this paper show potential for soliton molecule-based applications such as optical computation and multi-level encoding for communications.</description>

      <title>Observation of supersolid-like sound modes in a driven quantum gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven systems are of fundamental scientific interest, as they can exhibit properties that are radically different from the same system at equilibrium. In certain cases, long-lived states of driven matter can emerge, which exhibit new material properties. In this work, we probe the excitation spectrum of an emergent patterned state in a driven superfluid, finding that its response is identical to that of a one-dimensional supersolid. In order to extract physical quantities that parametrize the observed sound modes, we apply an effective hydrodynamic theory of superfluid smectics, which is agnostic to microscopic processes. We therefore use the conceptual framework of supersolids to characterize an otherwise dynamic and far-from-equilibrium state.</description>

      <title>Rogue wave patterns associated with Adler Moser polynomials in the nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, novel rogue wave patterns in the nolocal nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) are investigated by means of asymptotic analysis, including heart-pentagon, oval-trangle, and fan-trangle. It is demonstrated that when multiple free parameters get considerably large, rogue wave patterns can approximately be predicted by the root structures of Adler-Moser polynomials. These polynomials, which extend the Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomial hierarchy, exhibit richer geometric shapes in their root distributions. The (x,t)-plane is partitioned into three regions and through a combination of asymptotic results in different regions, unreported rogue wave patterns can be probed. Predicted solutions are compared with true rogue waves in light of graphical illustrations and numerical confirmation, which reveal excellent agreement between them.</description>

      <title>Giant Dynamical Paramagnetism in the driven pseudogap phase of $ \rm YBa_2Cu_3O_{6+x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, photo-induced superconducting-like behaviors have been reported in a number of materials driven by intense pump fields. Of particular interest is the high-$T_c$ cuprate $\rm Y Ba_2 Cu_2 O_{6+x}$, where such effect has been reported up to the so-called pseudogap temperature $T^* \sim 300-400$ K. In a recent tour-de-force experiment, a transient magnetic field which is proportional to and in the same direction of an applied field has been observed outside the sample, suggestive of flux exclusion due to the Meissner effect. In this paper, we point out that the transient magnetic field could be explained by a model of bilayers of copper-oxygen planes with a local superconducting phase variable persisting up to the pseudo-gap temperature at equilibrium. Under pumping, the time evolution is described by a driven sine-Gordon equation. In the presence of an external magnetic field, this model exhibits a novel instability which amplifies the current at the edges of the bilayer formed by defects or grain boundaries, producing a giant paramagnetic magnetization in the same direction as the applied field. We present how this scenario can fit most of the available data and propose additional experimental tests which can distinguish our proposal from the Meissner flux exclusion scenario. To the extent that this model can account for the data, we conclude that the experiments have the important consequence of revealing the presence of local pairing in the pseudogap phase. More broadly, this work provides a new mechanism for amplifying external magnetic fields at ultra-fast time scales.</description>
