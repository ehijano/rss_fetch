      <title>Contextual Refinement of Higher-Order Concurrent Probabilistic Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Foxtrot, the first higher-order separation logic for proving contextual refinement of higher-order concurrent probabilistic programs with higher-order local state. From a high level, Foxtrot inherits various concurrency reasoning principles from standard concurrent separation logic, e.g. invariants and ghost resources, and supports advanced probabilistic reasoning principles for reasoning about complex probability distributions induced by concurrent threads, e.g. tape presampling and induction by error amplification. The integration of these strong reasoning principles is highly non-trivial due to the combination of probability and concurrency in the language and the complexity of the Foxtrot model; the soundness of the logic relies on a version of the axiom of choice within the Iris logic, which is not used in earlier work on Iris-based logics. We demonstrate the expressiveness of Foxtrot on a wide range of examples, including the adversarial von Neumann coin and the $\mathsf{randombytes\_uniform}$ function of the Sodium cryptography software library.
  All results have been mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant and the Iris separation logic framework.</description>

      <title>Quantum modal logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A modal logic based on quantum logic is formalized in its simplest possible form. Specifically, a relational semantics and a sequent calculus are provided, and the soundness and the completeness theorems connecting both notions are demonstrated. This framework is intended to serve as a basis for formalizing various modal logics over quantum logic, such as quantum alethic logic, quantum temporal logic, quantum epistemic logic, and quantum dynamic logic.</description>

      <title>Certified Branch-and-Bound MaxSAT Solving (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, combinatorial solvers have seen remarkable performance improvements, enabling their practical use in real-world applications. In some of these applications, ensuring the correctness of the solver's output is critical. However, the complexity of modern solvers makes them susceptible to bugs in their source code. In the domain of satisfiability checking (SAT), this issue has been addressed through proof logging, where the solver generates a formal proof of the correctness of its answer. For more expressive problems like MaxSAT, the optimization variant of SAT, proof logging had not seen a comparable breakthrough until recently.
  In this paper, we show how to achieve proof logging for state-of-the-art techniques in Branch-and-Bound MaxSAT solving. This includes certifying look-ahead methods used in such algorithms as well as advanced clausal encodings of pseudo-Boolean constraints based on so-called Multi-Valued Decision Diagrams (MDDs). We implement these ideas in MaxCDCL, the dominant branch-and-bound solver, and experimentally demonstrate that proof logging is feasible with limited overhead, while proof checking remains a challenge.</description>

Abstract: In this research note, we show the relationship between two non-admissible argumentation framework semantics: cogent and weakly admissible semantics. We prove that, while cogent extensions are weakly admissible, the converse is not true.</description>

      <title>Datalog-Expressibility for Monadic and Guarded Second-Order Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.05677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterise the sentences in Monadic Second-order Logic (MSO) that are over finite structures equivalent to a Datalog program, in terms of an existential pebble game. We also show that for every class C of finite structures that can be expressed in MSO and is closed under homomorphisms, and for all integers l,k, there exists a canonical Datalog program Pi of width (l,k) in the sense of Feder and Verdi. The same characterisations also hold for Guarded Second-order Logic (GSO), which properly extends MSO. To prove our results, we show that every class C in GSO whose complement is closed under homomorphisms is a finite union of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) of countably categorical structures. The intersection of MSO and Datalog is known to contain the class of nested monadically defined queries (Nemodeq); likewise, we show that the intersection of GSO and Datalog contains all problems that can be expressed by the more expressive language of nested guarded queries. Yet, by exploiting our results, we can show that neither of the two query languages can serve as a characterization, as we exhibit a query in the intersection of MSO and Datalog that is not expressible in nested guarded queries.</description>

      <title>A Sequent Calculus For Trace Formula Implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Specification languages are essential in deductive program verification, but they are usually based on first-order logic, hence less expressive than the programs they specify. Recently, trace specification logics with fixed points that are at least as expressive as their target programs were proposed. This makes it possible to specify not merely pre- and postconditions, but the whole trace of even recursive programs. Previous work established a sound and complete calculus to determine whether a program satisfies a given trace formula. However, the applicability of the calculus and prospects for mechanized verification rely on the ability to prove consequence between trace formulas. We present a sound sequent calculus for proving implication (i.e. trace inclusion) between trace formulas. To handle fixed point operations with an unknown recursive bound, fixed point induction rules are used. We also employ contracts and {\mu}-formula synchronization. While this does not yet result in a complete calculus for trace formula implication, it is possible to prove many non-trivial properties.</description>

      <title>Discussion Graph Semantics of First-Order Logic with Equality for Reasoning about Discussion and Argumentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12163v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We make three contributions. First, we formulate a discussion-graph semantics for first-order logic with equality, enabling reasoning about discussion and argumentation in AI more generally than before. This addresses the current lack of a formal reasoning framework capable of handling diverse discussion and argumentation models. Second, we generalise Dung's notion of extensions to cases where two or more graph nodes in an argumentation framework are equivalent. Third, we connect these two contributions by showing that the generalised extensions are first-order characterisable within the proposed discussion-graph semantics. Propositional characterisability of all Dung's extensions is an immediate consequence. We furthermore show that the set of all generalised extensions (acceptability semantics), too, are first-order characterisable. Propositional characterisability of all Dung's acceptability semantics is an immediate consequence.</description>
