      <title>Geometry of extensions of free groups via automorphisms with fixed points on the complex of free factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give conditions of an extension of a free group to be hyperbolic and relatively hyperbolic using the dynamics of the action of $\out$ on the complex of free factors combined with the weak attraction theory. We work with subgroups of exponentially growing outer automorphisms and instead of using a standard pingpong argument with loxodromics, we allow fixed points for the action and investigate the geometry of the extension group when the fixed points of the automorphisms on the complex of free factors are sufficiently far apart.</description>

      <title>Torsion groups of subexponential growth cannot act on finite-dimensional CAT(0)-spaces without a fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that finitely generated torsion groups of subexponential growth must have a global fixed point whenever they act by isometry on a finite dimensional complete CAT(0)-space. The same statement for simple groups of subexponential growth is also shown. The method of proof uses ultralimits, equivariant harmonic maps, subharmonic functions, horofunctions and random walks.</description>

      <title>On the Boston's Unramified Fontaine-Mazur Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the Unramified Fontaine-Mazur Conjecture for $ p $-adic Galois representations and its generalizations. We prove some basic cases of the conjecture and provide some useful criterions for verifying it. In addition, we propose several different strategies to attack the conjecture and reduce it to some special cases. We also prove many new results of the conjecture in the two-dimensional case. Furthermore, we also study the unramified Galois deformation rings. Assuming the Unramified Fontaine-Mazur conjecture, we prove that the generic fiber of the unramified deformation ring is a finite direct product of fields. In particular, the unramified deformation ring has only finitely many $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_{p}$-valued points. We also give some counterexamples to the so-called dimension conjecture for Galois deformation rings assuming the conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper the structure of the Cayley graphs and G-graphs of some gyro-groups are studied and some properties of them will be proved. Moreover we review some special gyro-groups including: gyro-commutative gyrogroups, dihedral gyro-groups and dihedralized gyro-groups. Then we try to establish some important properties of their associated G-graphs. Finally we will examine the symmetry of Cayley graphs and G-graphs of some gyro-groups.</description>

      <title>Local connectedness of boundaries for relatively hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.02463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(\Gamma,\mathbb{P})$ be a relatively hyperbolic group pair that is relatively one ended. Then the Bowditch boundary of $(\Gamma,\mathbb{P})$ is locally connected. Bowditch previously established this conclusion under the additional assumption that all peripheral subgroups are finitely presented, either one or two ended, and contain no infinite torsion subgroups. We remove these restrictions; we make no restriction on the cardinality of $\Gamma$ and no restriction on the peripheral subgroups $P \in \mathbb{P}$.</description>

      <title>Finiteness of CAT(0) group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove some finiteness results for discrete isometry groups $\Gamma$ of uniformly packed CAT$(0)$-spaces $X$ with uniformly bounded codiameter (up to group isomorphism), and for CAT$(0)$-orbispaces $M = \Gamma \backslash X$ (up to equivariant homotopy equivalence or equivariant diffeomorphism); these results generalize, in nonpositive curvature, classical finiteness theorems of Riemannian geometry. As a corollary, the order of every torsion subgroup of $\Gamma$ is bounded above by a universal constant only depending on the packing constants and the codiameter. The main tool is a splitting theorem for sufficiently collapsed actions: namely we show that if a geodesically complete, packed, CAT$(0)$-space admits a discrete, cocompact group of isometries with sufficiently small systole then it necessarily splits a non-trivial Euclidean factor.</description>

      <title>Groups Acting Acylindrically on Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12192v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of groups that act acylindrically and non-elementarily on simplicial trees, which we call acylindrically arboreal groups. We then prove a complete classification of when graph products of groups and the fundamental groups of certain hyperbolic $3$-manifolds are acylindrically arboreal, and use this classification to consider acylindrically hyperbolic groups that have actions on trees but have no non-elementary acylindrical actions on trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give necessary and sufficient conditions for a free-by-free group to be relatively hyperbolic with a cusp-preserving structure. Namely, if $\phi_1, \ldots , \phi_k $ is a collection of exponentially growing outer automorphisms with a common invariant \emph{subgroup system} such that any conjugacy class in the complement of this system grows exponentially under iteration by all $\phi_i$, then such a subgroup system can be used to construct a collection of peripheral subgroups relative to which, the extension of $\mathbb F$ by the free group generated by sufficiently high powers of $\phi_1, \ldots , \phi_k $, will be hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>On the diameter of semigroups of transformations and partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a semigroup $S$ whose universal right congruence is finitely generated (or, equivalently, a semigroup satisfying the homological finiteness property of being type right-$FP_1$), the right diameter of $S$ is a parameter that expresses how `far apart' elements of $S$ can be from each other, in a certain sense. To be more precise, for each finite generating set $U$ for the universal right congruence on $S,$ we have a metric space $(S,d_U)$ where $d_U(a,b)$ is the minimum length of derivations for $(a,b)$ as a consequence of pairs in $U$; the right diameter of $S$ with respect to $U$ is the diameter of this metric space. The right diameter of $S$ is then the minimum of the set of all right diameters with respect to finite generating sets. We investigate whether various natural infinite semigroups of transformations and partitions have a finitely generated universal right/left congruence, and for those that do, we determine their right/left diameter. Among other results, for an arbitrary infinite set $X$ we prove the following. Each of the monoids of all binary relations on $X,$ of all partial transformations on $X,$ and of all full transformations on $X,$ as well as the partition and partial Brauer monoids on $X,$ have right diameter 1 and left diameter 1. The symmetric inverse monoid on $X$ has right diameter 2 and left diameter 2. The monoid of all injective mappings on $X$ has right diameter 4, and its minimal ideal (called the Baer-Levi semigroup on $X$) has right diameter 3, but neither of these two semigroups has a finitely generated universal left congruence. On the other hand, the semigroup of all surjective mappings on $X$ has left diameter 4, and its minimal ideal has left diameter 2, but neither of these semigroups has a finitely generated universal right congruence.</description>

      <title>Subsets of groups with context-free preimages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study subsets $E$ of finitely generated groups where the set of all words over a given finite generating set that lie in $E$ forms a context-free language. We call these sets recognisably context-free. They are invariant of the choice of generating set and a theorem of Muller and Schupp fully classifies when the set $\{1\}$ can be recognisably context-free. We extend Muller and Schupp's result to show that a group $G$ admits a finite recognisably context-free subset if and only if $G$ is virtually free. We show that every conjugacy class of a group $G$ is recognisably context-free if and only if $G$ is virtually free. We conclude by showing that a coset is recognisably context-free if and only if the Schreier coset graph of the corresponding subgroup is quasi-isometric to a tree.</description>

      <title>Coarse Alexander duality for pairs and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.00059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a group $G$ (of type $F$) acting properly on a coarse Poincar\'{e} duality space $X$, Kapovich-Kleiner introduced a coarse version of Alexander duality between $G$ and its complement in $X$. More precisely, the cohomology of $G$ with group ring coefficients is dual to a certain \v{C}ech homology group of the family of increasing neighborhoods of a $G$-orbit in $X$. This duality applies more generally to coarse embeddings of certain contractible simplicial complexes into coarse $PD(n)$ spaces. In this paper we introduce a relative version of this \v{C}ech homology that satisfies the Eilenberg-Steenrod Exactness Axiom, and we prove a relative version of coarse Alexander duality.
  As an application we provide a detailed proof of the following result, first stated by Kapovich-Kleiner. Given a $2$-complex formed by gluing $k$ halfplanes along their boundary lines and a coarse embedding into a contractible $3$-manifold, the complement consists of $k$ deep components that are arranged cyclically in a pattern called a Jordan cycle. We use the Jordan cycle as an invariant in proving the existence of a $3$-manifold group that is virtually Kleinian but not itself Kleinian.</description>

Abstract: We introduce coloring groups, which are permutation groups obtained from a proper edge coloring of a graph. These groups generalize the generalized toggle groups of Striker (which themselves generalize the toggle groups introduced by Cameron and Fon-der-Flaass). We present some general results connecting the structure of a coloring group to the structure of its graph coloring, providing graph-theoretic characterizations of the centralizer and primitivity of a coloring group. We apply these results particularly to generalized toggle groups arising from trees as well as coloring groups arising from the independence posets introduced by Thomas and Williams.</description>

      <title>Homology operations for gravity algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1}$ be the moduli space of genus zero Riemann surfaces with $n+1$ marked points. In this paper we compute $H_*^{\Sigma_n}(\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1};\mathbb{F}_p)$ and $H_*^{\Sigma_n}(\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1};\mathbb{F}_p(\pm 1))$ for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and any prime $p$, where $\mathbb{F}_p(\pm 1)$ denotes the sign representation of the symmetric group $\Sigma_n$. The interest in these homology groups is twofold: on the one hand classes in these equivariant homology groups parametrize homology operations for gravity algebras. On the other hand the homotopy quotient $(\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1})_{\Sigma_n}$ is a model for the classifying space for $B_n/Z(B_n)$, the quotient of the braid group $B_n$ by its center.</description>

      <title>Conformal measure rigidity and ergodicity of horospherical foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a higher rank extension of rigidity theorems of Sullivan, Tukia, Yue, and Kim-Oh for representations of rank one discrete subgroups of divergence type, in terms of the push-forwards of conformal measures via boundary maps. We consider a certain class of higher rank discrete subgroups, which we call hypertransverse subgroups. It includes all rank one discrete subgroups, Anosov subgroups, relatively Anosov subgroups, and their subgroups.
  Our proof of the rigidity theorem generalizes the idea of Kim-Oh to self-joinings of higher rank hypertransverse subgroups, overcoming the lack of CAT(-1) geometry on symmetric spaces. In contrast to the work of Sullivan, Tukia, and Yue, our argument is closely related to the study of horospherical foliations. We also show the ergodicity of horospherical foliations with respect to Burger-Roblin measures. This generalizes the classical work of Hedlund, Burger, and Roblin in rank one and of Lee-Oh for Borel Ansov subgroups in higher rank.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally compact group and $\mu$ an admissible probability measure on $G$. Let $(B,\nu)$ be the universal topological Poisson $\mu$-boundary of $(G,\mu)$ and $\Pi_s(G)$ the universal minimal strongly proximal $G$-flow. In this note we present an alternative proof to a recent result of Hartman and Kalantar. We show that the following conditions are equivalent: (i) the measure $\nu$ is the unique $\mu$-stationary measure on $B$, (ii) $(B,G) \cong (\Pi_s(G),G)$.</description>
