      <title>Counting Homogeneous Einstein Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an explicit upper bound on the number of isolated homogeneous Einstein metrics on compact homogeneous spaces whose isotropy representations consist of pairwise inequivalent irreducibles. This is the BKK bound of the corresponding system of Laurent polynomials and is found combinatorially by computing the volume of a polytope. Inspired by a connection with algebraic statistics, we describe this system's BKK discriminant in terms of the principal $A$-determinant of scalar curvature. As a consequence, we confirm the Finiteness Conjecture of B\"ohm--Wang--Ziller in special cases. In particular, we give a unified proof that it holds on all generalized Wallach spaces. Finally, using numerical algebraic geometry, we compute $G$-invariant Einstein metrics on low-dimensional full flag manifolds $G/T$, where $G$ is a compact simple Lie group and $T$ is a maximal torus.</description>

      <title>Area bounds for constant mean curvature surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a finite-volume hyperbolic $3$-manifold, we establish an upper bound on the area of closed embedded surfaces with constant mean curvature at least one, depending on the mean curvature and the genus bounds. This area bound implies compactness for such surfaces. In particular, for Bryant surfaces with constant mean curvature equal to one, the area is bounded proportionally to the genus.</description>

      <title>Even Cone Spherical Metrics: Blow-Up at a Cone Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study families of spherical metrics on the flat torus $E_{\tau}$ $=$ $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda_{\tau}$ with blow-up behavior at prescribed conical singularities at $0$ and $\pm p$, where the cone angle at $0$ is $6\pi$, and at $\pm p$ is $4\pi$. We prove that the existence of such a necessarily unique, even family of spherical metrics is completely determined by the geometry of the torus: such a family exists if and only if\textbf{ }the Green function $G(z;\tau)$ admits a pair of nontrivial critical points $\pm a$. In this case, the cone point $p$ must equal $a$, and the corresponding monodromy data is $\left( 2r,2s\right) $, where $a=r+s\tau.$
  An explicit transformation relating this family to the one with a single conical singularity of angle $6\pi$ at the origin is established in Theorem 1.4. A rigidity result for rhombic tori is proved in Theorem 1.5.</description>

      <title>On the Linearization of Certain Singularities of Nijenhuis Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a linearization problem for Nijenhuis operators in dimension two around a point of scalar type in analytic category. The problem was almost completely solved in arXiv:1903.06411. One case, however, namely the case of left-symmetric algebra $\mathfrak b_{1, \alpha}$, proved to be difficult. Here we solve it and, thus, complete the solution of the linearization problem for Nijenhuis operators in dimension two. The problem turns out to be related to classical results on the linearization of vector fields and their monodromy mappings.</description>

      <title>Generalised Spin$^r$ Structures on Homogeneous Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05433v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spinorial methods have proven to be a powerful tool to study geometric properties of spin manifolds. Our aim is to continue the spinorial study of manifolds that are not necessarily spin. We introduce and study the notion of $G$-invariance of spin$^r$ structures on a manifold $M$ equipped with an action of a Lie group $G$. For the case when $M$ is a homogeneous $G$-space, we prove a classification result of these invariant structures in terms of the isotropy representation. As an example, we study the invariant spin$^r$ structures for all the homogeneous realisations of the spheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine pairs of closed plane curves that have the same closing property as two conic sections in Poncelet's porism. We show how the vertex curve can be computed for a given envelope and vice versa. Our formulas are universal in the sense that they produce all possible sufficiently regular pairs of such Poncelet curves. We arrive at similar results for sets of curves, analogous to the pencil of conic sections in the full Poncelet theorem. We also study the case of Poncelet curves that carry Poncelet polygons which are equiangular or even congruent.</description>

      <title>Orientation Scores should be a Piece of Cake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We axiomatically derive a family of wavelets for an orientation score, lifting from position space $\mathbb{R}^2$ to position and orientation space $\mathbb{R}^2\times S^1$, with fast reconstruction property, that minimise position-orientation uncertainty. We subsequently show that these minimum uncertainty states are well-approximated by cake wavelets: for standard parameters, the uncertainty gap of cake wavelets is less than 1.1, and in the limit, we prove the uncertainty gap tends to the minimum of 1. Next, we complete a previous theoretical argument that one does not have to train the lifting layer in (PDE-)G-CNNs, but can instead use cake wavelets. Finally, we show experimentally that in this way we can reduce the network complexity and improve the interpretability of (PDE-)G-CNNs, with only a slight impact on the model's performance.</description>

      <title>The $k$th Order Preserving Sets and Isoperimetric Type Inequalities for Planar Ovals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce and investigate a new class of sets, the \textit{$k$th Order Preserving Sets}, arising naturally from the Fourier analysis of support functions associated with hedgehogs. Specifically, we focus on sets whose support functions possess a Fourier series that preserves only terms with positive indices divisible by a fixed $k$.
  We explore the geometry of the \textit{$k$th Order Midpoint Set}, defined as the set of centroids of all equiangular $k$-gons circumscribed about a given hedgehog. This set captures essential structural and symmetry-related features of the underlying geometric configuration.
  We study the geometric properties of such sets and, in particular, establish an isoperimetric-type inequality relating the perimeter and area of a region bounded by a simple smooth convex closed curve (an oval) $\mathcal{O}$: \[ L_{\mathcal{O}}^2 - 4\pi A_{\mathcal{O}} \geqslant 4\pi |A_{\mathcal{P}_k}| + 2\pi |A_{\Omega_{\mathcal{O},k}}|, \] where $L_{\mathcal{O}}$ denotes the length (perimeter) of $\mathcal{O}$, $A_{\mathcal{O}}$ is the area of the region enclosed by $\mathcal{O}$, $A_{\mathcal{P}_k}$ is the oriented area of the associated $k$th Order Preserving Set $\mathcal{P}_k$, and $A_{\Omega_{\mathcal{O},k}}$ is the oriented area of the associated $k$th Order Midpoint Set $\Omega_{\mathcal{O},k}$. Moreover, we characterize the equality case: the inequality becomes an equality if and only if every equiangular circumscribed $k$-gon around $\mathcal{O}$ is a~regular $k$-gon with its center of mass located at the Steiner point of $\mathcal{O}$.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Shock PDEs for Deep Learning on Position-Orientation Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend Regularised Diffusion-Shock (RDS) filtering from Euclidean space R2 [1] to position-orientation space $\mathbb{M}_2 \cong \mathbb{R}^2 \times S^1$. This has numerous advantages, e.g. making it possible to enhance and inpaint crossing structures, since they become disentangled when lifted to $\mathbb{M}_2$. We create a version of the algorithm using gauge frames to mitigate issues caused by lifting to a finite number of orientations. This leads us to study generalisations of diffusion, since the gauge frame diffusion is not generated by the Laplace-Beltrami operator. RDS filtering compares favourably to existing techniques such as Total Roto-Translational Variation (TR-TV) flow, NLM, and BM3D when denoising images with crossing structures, particularly if they are segmented. Furthermore, we see that $\mathbb{M}_2$ RDS inpainting is indeed able to restore crossing structures, unlike $\mathbb{R}^2$ RDS inpainting. In addition to the contributions of our SSVM submission "Diffusion-Shock Filtering on the Space of Positions and Orientations", in this extended work we provide new theorical results and automate RDS filtering by integrating it into a geometric deep learning framework. Regarding our theoretical contributions, we prove that our generalised diffusions are still well-posed, smoothing, and analytic. We developed an RDS filtering PDE layer for the PDE-CNN and PDE-G-CNN deep learning frameworks, using a novel gating mechanism. We show that these new RDS PDE layers can be beneficial in various impainting and denoising tasks.</description>

      <title>Extensions of Schoen--Simon--Yau and Schoen--Simon theorems via iteration \`{a} la De Giorgi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an alternative proof of the Schoen--Simon--Yau curvature estimates and associated Bernstein-type theorems (1975), and extend the original result by including the case of $6$-dimensional (stable minimal) immersions. The key step is an $\epsilon$-regularity theorem, that assumes smallness of the scale-invariant $L^2$ norm of the second fundamental form.
  Further, we obtain a graph description, in the Lipschitz multi-valued sense, for any stable minimal immersion of dimension $n\geq 2$, that may have a singular set $\Sigma$ of locally finite $\mathcal{H}^{n-2}$-measure, and that is weakly close to a hyperplane. (In fact, if $\mathcal{H}^{n-2}(\Sigma)=0$, the conclusion is strengthened to a union of smooth graphs.) This follows directly from an $\epsilon$-regularity theorem, that assumes smallness of the scale-invariant $L^2$ tilt-excess (verified when the hypersurface is weakly close to a hyperplane). Specialising the multi-valued decomposition to the case of embeddings, we recover the Schoen--Simon theorem (1981).
  In both $\epsilon$-regularity theorems the relevant quantity (respectively, length of the second fundamental form and tilt function) solves a non-linear PDE on the immersed minimal hypersurface. The proof is carried out intrinsically (without linearising the PDE) by implementing an iteration method \`{a} la De Giorgi (from the linear De Giorgi--Nash--Moser theory). Stability implies estimates (intrinsic weak Caccioppoli inequalities) that make the iteration effective despite the non-linear framework. (In both $\epsilon$-regularity theorems the method gives explicit constants that quantify the required smallness.)</description>
