      <title>Parental environment and student achievement: Does a Matthew effect exist?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the causal impact of the parental environment on the student's academic performance in mathematics, literature and English (as a foreign language), using a new database covering all children aged 8 to 15 of the Madrid community, from 2016 to 2019. Parental environment refers here to the parents' level of education (i.e. the skills they acquired before bringing up their children), and parental investment (the effort made by parents to bring up their children). We distinguish the persistent effect of the parental environment from the so-called Matthew effect, which describes a possible tendency for the impact of the parental environment to increase as the child grows up. Whatever the subject (mathematics, literature or English), our results are in line with most studies concerning the persistent effect: a favourable parental environment goes hand in hand with better results for the children. As regards the Matthew effect, the results differ between subjects: while the impact of the parental environment tends to diminish from the age of 8 to 15 in mathematics, it forms a bell curve in literature (first increasing, then decreasing) and increases steadily in English. This result, which is encouraging for mathematics and even literature, confirms the social dimension involved in learning a foreign language compared to more academic subjects.</description>

      <title>Once Welcomed, Then Scapegoated: The Enduring Consequences of Assimilation Policies in the Wake of Mass Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the short- and long-term effects of immigrant assimilation policies in Brazil after the Mass Migration period. It focuses on the Nationalization Campaign, launched amid rising anti-immigrant sentiment during the Great Depression and the World Wars. Using newly assembled archival data spanning the twentieth century, I assess the campaign's impact on education among immigrants and their descendants following the closure of immigrant-community schools. In the short term, the policy sharply reduced educational attainment among targeted groups; in the long term, school-age immigrants during the campaign completed less education over their lifetimes, with adverse effects persisting into the second generation. The magnitude of these impacts varied with cultural proximity to native Brazilians.</description>

      <title>Linear fractional relative risk aversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the family of utility functions satisfying linear fractional relative risk aversion (LFRRA) in terms of the Gauss hypergeometric functions. We apply this family, which nests various utility functions used in different strands of literature, to monopolistic competition and obtain the profit-maximizing price by generalizing the Lambert W function. We let firm-level data decide whether the RRA in each sector or in the aggregate economy is increasing, decreasing, or constant, which in turn determines whether markups are decreasing, increasing, or constant with respect to marginal costs.</description>
