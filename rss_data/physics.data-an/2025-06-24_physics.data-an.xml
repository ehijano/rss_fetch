      <title>Algorithm to extract direction in 2D discrete distributions and a continuous Frobenius norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel algorithm for determining directionality in 2D distributions of discrete data. We compare a reference dataset with a known direction to a measured dataset with an unknown direction by the Frobenius norm of the difference (FND) to find the unknown direction. To generalize this concept, we develop a continuous Frobenius norm of the difference (CFND) as a continuous analog of the FND and derive its analytical expression. By relating fitted and normalized 2D Gaussian distributions, we show that the CFND approximates the FND, and we validate this relationship with computer simulations. We find that a first-order approximation of the CFND between two similar Gaussian distributions takes the form of an absolute sine function, offering a simple analytical form with potential for specialized applications in segmented inverse beta decay (IBD) neutrino detectors, astronomy, machine learning, and more. Although this method may easily extend to 3D scalar fields, our focus here is on 2D real-valued fields as it directly applies to directionality. Our methodology consists of modeling a 2D Gaussian distribution, binning the data into a histogram, and encoding it as a square matrix. Rotating this matrix around its geometric center and comparing it to a measured dataset using the FND gives us rotational data that we fit with an absolute sine function. The location of the minimum of this fit is the angle closest to the true angle of the direction in the measured dataset. We present the derivation and discuss initial applications of the CFND in our novel algorithm, demonstrating its success in approximating directionality in 2D distributions.</description>

      <title>Relationship between unpredictability and intermittency in shell models of turbulence and experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the predictability of turbulent velocity signals using probabilistic analog-forecasting. Here, predictability is defined by the accuracy of forecasts and the associated uncertainties. We study the Gledzer-Ohkitani-Yamada (GOY) shell model of turbulence as well as experimental measurements from a fully developed turbulent flow. In both cases, we identify the extreme values of velocity at small scales as localized unpredictable events that lead to a loss of predictability: worse predictions and increase of their uncertainties. The GOY model, with its explicit scale separation, allows to evaluate the prediction performance at individual scales, and so to better relate the intensity of extreme events and the loss of forecast performance. Results show that predictability decreases systematically from large to small scales. These findings establish a statistical connection between predictability loss across scales and intermittency in turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Failure, Repair and Mobility Rates for Markov Reliability Systems: A Wind-Farm application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rate of Occurrence of Failures (ROCOF) is a widely utilized indicator for assessing a system's performance over time, yet it does not fully disclose the instantaneous behavior of a system. This paper introduces new measures to complement the ROCOF, providing a more comprehensive understanding of system reliability, particularly for Markov systems. We define the Rate of Occurrence of Repairs (ROCOR), which quantifies the system's instantaneous tendency to transition from failure to working states, and the Rate of Inoccurrence (ROI), which measures the propensity to remain within the current subset of states (either working or failure) without transitioning out. Explicit expressions for the computation of these rates are derived for Markov systems. Furthermore, a Total Mobility Rate (TMR) is proposed, integrating these individual rates to capture the overall dynamism of the system. The utility of these new indicators is demonstrated through a significant real-world application to wind farm management. The results from the wind farm study show that ROCOR, ROI, and TMR, when used in conjunction with ROCOF, reveal nuanced operational dynamics and reliability characteristics that are not discernible from static measures like Weibull parameters or ROCOF alone. These indicators can distinguish between sites with similar long-term wind profiles by identifying different "reliability logics," such as persistence-driven versus transition-driven behaviors. This enriched, time-dependent perspective provides valuable information for maintenance scheduling, operational strategies, and risk assessment, ultimately enhancing the ability to manage complex systems effectively.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties of a Spherical Magnetic Field Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spherical harmonic expansions are well-established tools for estimating magnetic fields from surface measurements and are widely used in applications such as tomographic imaging, geomagnetism, and biomagnetism. Although the mathematical foundations of these expansions are well understood, the impact of real-world imperfections, on the uncertainty of the field model has received little attention. In this work, we present a systematic uncertainty propagation analysis for a magnetic field camera that estimates the field from surface measurements using a spherical array of Hall magnetometers arranged in a spherical t-design. A Monte Carlo-based approach is employed to quantify how sensor-related uncertainties, such as calibration errors and positioning inaccuracies, affect the spatial distribution of the estimated field's uncertainty. The results offer insights into the robustness of spherical harmonic methods and help identify the dominant sources of uncertainty in practical implementations.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Photonic Circuit Losses with Machine Learning Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-loss waveguides enable efficient light delivery in photonic circuits, which are essential for high-speed optical communications and scalable implementations of photonic quantum technologies. We study the effects of several fabrication and experimental parameters on the waveguide losses of a silicon nitride integrated photonics platform using various machine learning techniques. Compared to more complex machine learning algorithms, our results show that a simple linear regression model with variable selection offers a lower prediction error with high interpretability. The high interpretability, along with our domain knowledge, led to unique identification of fabrication process dependencies on the final outcome. With these insights, we show that by improving the process flow, it is possible to improve the loss by mitigating the cause in a real experiment.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dynamics simulation of the focused electron beam induced deposition process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work reports on the development of a new approach to the multiscale computational modelling of the focused electron beam-induced deposition (FEBID), realised using the advanced software packages: MBN Explorer and MBN Studio. Our approach is based on stochastic dynamics (SD), which describes the probabilistic evolution of complex systems. The parameters for the new SD-based FEBID model were determined using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. A new methodology was developed for this purpose and is described in detail. This methodology can be applied to many other case studies of the dynamics of complex systems. Our work focuses on the FEBID process involving W(CO)$_6$ precursor molecules deposited on a hydroxylated SiO$_2$-H substrate. Simulations and a detailed analysis of a growing W-rich nanostructure were performed. This new approach was shown to provide essential atomistic insights into the complex FEBID process, including the elemental composition and morphology of the deposit at each stage of growth. The derived results were then compared with experimental observations and validated. The multiscale methods developed in this study can be further upgraded and applied to important technological developments, such as 3D nanoprinting.</description>

      <title>Structured Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs for Interpretable Learning and Symbolic Discovery of Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling nonlinear dynamical systems is a fundamental problem across scientific and engineering domains. While deep learning has demonstrated remarkable potential for learning complex system behavior, achieving models that are both highly accurate and physically interpretable remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Structured Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a novel framework that integrates structured state-space modeling with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). SKANODE first employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function approximator within a structured Neural ODE framework to perform virtual sensing, recovering latent states that correspond to physically interpretable quantities such as positions and velocities. Once this structured latent representation is established, we exploit the symbolic regression capability of KAN to extract compact and interpretable expressions for the system's governing dynamics. The resulting symbolic expression is then substituted back into the Neural ODE framework and further calibrated through continued training to refine its coefficients, enhancing both the precision of the discovered equations and the predictive accuracy of system responses. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world systems demonstrate that SKANODE achieves superior performance while offering interpretable, physics-consistent models that uncover the underlying mechanisms of nonlinear dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Scientific Rankings with Breakthrough and Disruption Metrics: A Complex Network-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific progress is often driven by groundbreaking and disruptive research, yet traditional metrics for evaluating contributions to science often emphasize quantity over quality. In this study, we consider metrics that focus on the quality of scientific performance of countries and propose a novel framework that facilitates a competitive ranking of these countries based on their performance, highlighting the impact of their contributions. Using a bipartite network and centrality measures computed through the GENEPY scheme, we evaluate the complexity and diversity of scientific fields. The analysis incorporates two quality indicators of a research paper: the network-based normalized citation score (NBNC) to identify high-impact articles and the Disruptive Index (CD) to classify research as consolidating or disruptive. These metrics focus on the perspective of citing articles, providing a localized view of scientific influence. Our study draws on bibliometric data from OpenAlex, encompassing nearly 60 million articles in the domain of physical sciences published between 1900 and 2023. This data spans 10 fields, 89 subfields, and approximately 1,300 topics, offering a comprehensive view of scientific development over time. By focusing on quality indicators such as breakthroughs and disruptive research, our framework underscores the importance of transformative contributions that challenge existing paradigms and drive innovation. This approach not only highlights the leading contributors to global science but also reveals patterns in the evolution of scientific fields. By prioritizing impactful research, our study offers insights into optimizing resources for advancing science. The results are relevant for policymakers, funding agencies, and researchers, providing a clearer understanding of how quality-driven metrics can reshape the evaluation of scientific performance on a global scale.</description>

      <title>Novel computational approaches for ratio distributions with an application to Hake's ratio in effect size measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ratio statistics and distributions are fundamental in various disciplines, including linear regression, metrology, nuclear physics, operations research, econometrics, biostatistics, genetics, and engineering. In this work, we introduce two novel computational approaches for evaluating ratio distributions using open data science tools and modern numerical quadratures. The first approach employs 1D double exponential quadrature of the Mellin convolution with/without barycentric interpolation, which is a very fast and efficient quadrature technique. The second approach utilizes 2D vectorized Broda-Khan numerical inversion of characteristic functions. It offers broader applicability by not requiring knowledge of PDFs or the independence of ratio constituents. The pilot numerical study, conducted in the context of Hake's ratio - a widely used measure of effect size and educational effectiveness in physics education - demonstrates the proposed methods' speed, accuracy, and reliability. The analytical and numerical explorations also provide more clarifying insight into the theoretical and empirical properties of Hake's ratio distribution. The proposed methods appear promising in a robust framework for fast and exact ratio distribution computations beyond normal random variables, with potential applications in multidimensional statistics and uncertainty analysis in metrology, where precise and reliable data handling is essential.</description>

      <title>Sparsity covariance: a source of uncertainty when estimating correlation functions with a discrete sample of observations in the sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological observables rely heavily on summary statistics such as two-point correlation functions. In many practical cases (e.g. the weak-lensing cosmic shear), those correlation functions are estimated from a finite, discrete sample of measurements that are randomly distributed in the sky. The result then inevitably depends on the sample at hand, regardless of any experimental noise. This sample dependence is a source of uncertainty for cosmological observables which I call sparsity covariance. This article proposes a mathematical definition and a generic method to compute sparsity covariance. It is then applied to the concrete case of cosmic shear, showing that sparsity covariance mostly enhances shape noise, whose amplitude is determined by the apparent ellipticity of galaxies rather than their intrinsic ellipticity. In general, sparsity covariance is non-negligible when the signal-to-noise ratio of individual measurements in the sample is comparable to, or larger than, unity.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation and Dosimetric Analysis of Gold Nanoparticles (AuNPs) in Breast Tissue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01878v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise radiation delivery is critical for effective radiotherapy, and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have emerged as promising tools to enhance local dose deposition while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue. In this study, the PENELOPE Monte Carlo code was used to investigate the dosimetry of AuNPs under different conditions and models. The Dose Enhancement Ratio (DER) was studied in water and breast tissue with spherical shapes and in agreement with previously published results. To further analyse the physical interactions of the particles around the AuNP, a Phase Space File (PSF) in a volume around the AuNPs was created. This showed that larger AuNPs lead to increased doses, as expected, yielding DER values exceeding 100 times. Finally, results reveal that in the volume surrounding the AuNP, 80% of emitted electrons originate from photoelectric absorption, leading to Auger electron emission cascades which were analysed in detail. It was also possible to establish a direct relation between number of secondaries and the particle volumes. The Local Effect Model (LEM) was used to determine survival curves in AuNPs of different sizes at different gold concentrations. The last part of this work consisted in analysing a distribution of AuNPs within a flattened cell typical of clonogenic assays where a log-normal distribution of dose was observed. This led to the development of a new, mechanistic, Local Effect Model which, if further validated, can have further applications in-vitro and in-silico.</description>
