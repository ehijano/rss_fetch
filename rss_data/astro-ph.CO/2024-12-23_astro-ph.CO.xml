      <title>Cosmology with Persistent Homology: Parameter Inference via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon [2308.02636], this article investigates the potential constraining power of persistent homology for cosmological parameters and primordial non-Gaussianity amplitudes in a likelihood-free inference pipeline. We evaluate the ability of persistence images (PIs) to infer parameters, compared to the combined Power Spectrum and Bispectrum (PS/BS), and we compare two types of models: neural-based, and tree-based. PIs consistently lead to better predictions compared to the combined PS/BS when the parameters can be constrained (i.e., for $\{\Omega_{\rm m}, \sigma_8, n_{\rm s}, f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}\}$). PIs perform particularly well for $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$, showing the promise of persistent homology in constraining primordial non-Gaussianity. Our results show that combining PIs with PS/BS provides only marginal gains, indicating that the PS/BS contains little extra or complementary information to the PIs. Finally, we provide a visualization of the most important topological features for $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ and for $\Omega_{\rm m}$. This reveals that clusters and voids (0-cycles and 2-cycles) are most informative for $\Omega_{\rm m}$, while $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ uses the filaments (1-cycles) in addition to the other two types of topological features.</description>

      <title>Non-linear effects on the Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background (CGWB) anisotropies contain valuable information about the physics of the early universe. Given that General Relativity is intrinsically nonlinear, it is important to look beyond first-order contributions in cosmological perturbations. In this work, we present a non-perturbative approach for the computation of CGWB anisotropies at large scales, providing the extension of the initial conditions and the Sachs-Wolfe effect for the CGWB, which encodes the full non-linearity of the scalar metric perturbations. We also derive the non-perturbative expression for three-point correlation of the gravitational wave energy density perturbation in the case of an inflationary CGWB with a scale-invariant power spectrum and negligible primordial non-Gaussianity. We show that, under such conditions, the gravitational wave energy density perturbations are lognormally distributed, leading to an interesting effect such as intermittency.</description>

      <title>Cosmic chronometers, Pantheon+ supernovae, and quasars favor coasting cosmologies over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test and compare coasting cosmological models with curvature parameters ${k=\left\{ -1,0,+1 \right\}}$ in ${H_0^2 c^{-2}}$ units and the flat $\Lambda$CDM model by fitting them to cosmic chronometers (CC), the Pantheon+ sample of type Ia supernovae (SNe), and standardized quasars (QSOs). We used the \texttt{emcee} code for fitting CC data, a custom Markov Chain Monte Carlo implementation for SNe and QSOs, and Anderson-Darling tests for normality on normalized residuals for model comparison. Best-fit parameters are presented, constrained by data within redshift ranges $z\leq 2$ for CCs, $z\leq 2.3$ for SNe, and $z\leq 7.54$ for QSOs. Coasting models, particularly the flat coasting model, are generally favored over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model. The overfitting of the flat $\Lambda$CDM model to Pantheon+ SNe and the large intrinsic scatter in QSO data suggest a need to refine error estimates in these datasets. We also highlight the seemingly fine-tuned nature of either the CC data or $\Omega_{\mathrm{m},0}$ in the flat $\Lambda$CDM model to an ${H_1=H_0}$ coincidence when fitting ${H(z)=H_1z+H_0}$, a natural feature of coasting models.</description>

      <title>Impact of reionization history on constraining primordial gravitational waves in future all-sky cosmic microwave background experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the impact of the reionization history on examining the shape of the power spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization. The large-scale CMB generated from the reionization epoch is important in probing the PGWs from all-sky experiments, such as LiteBIRD. The reionization model has been constrained by several astrophysical observations. However, its uncertainty could impact constraining models of the PGWs if we use large-scale CMB polarization. Here, by expanding the analysis of Mortonson &amp; Hu (2007), we estimate how reionization uncertainty impacts constraints on a generic primordial tensor power spectrum. We assume that CMB polarization is measured by a LiteBIRD-like experiment and the tanh model is adopted for a theoretical template when we fit data. We show that constraints are almost unchanged even if the true reionization history is described by an exponential model, where all parameters are within 68% Confidence Level (CL). We also show an example of the reionization history that the constraints on the PGWs are biased more than 68% CL. Even in that case, using E-mode power spectrum on large scales would exclude such a scenario and make the PGW constraints robust against the reionization uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Astrometric constraints on stochastic gravitational wave background with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrometric measurements provide a unique avenue for constraining the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). In this work, we investigate the application of two neural network architectures, a fully connected network and a graph neural network, for analyzing astrometric data to detect the SGWB. Specifically, we generate mock Gaia astrometric measurements of the proper motions of sources and train two networks to predict the energy density of the SGWB, $\Omega_\text{GW}$. We evaluate the performance of both models under varying input datasets to assess their robustness across different configurations. Our results demonstrate that neural networks can effectively measure the SGWB, showing promise as tools for addressing systematic uncertainties and modeling limitations that pose challenges for traditional likelihood-based methods.</description>

      <title>Reproducibility of machine learning analyses of 21 cm reionization maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) methods have become popular for parameter inference in cosmology, although their reliance on specific training data can cause difficulties when applied across different data sets. By reproducing and testing networks previously used in the field, and applied to 21cmFast and Simfast21 simulations, we show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often learn to identify features of individual simulation boxes rather than the underlying physics, limiting their applicability to real observations. We examine the prediction of the neutral fraction and astrophysical parameters from 21 cm maps and find that networks typically fail to generalise to unseen simulations. We explore a number of case studies to highlight factors that improve or degrade network performance. These results emphasise the responsibility on users to ensure ML models are applied correctly in 21 cm cosmology.</description>

      <title>Probing Primordial Black Hole Mergers in Clusters with Pulsar Timing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the possibility that the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background suggested by Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) datasets is sourced by Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). Specifically, we perform a Bayesian search in the International PTA Data Release 2 (IPTA DR2) for a combined GW background arising from scalar perturbations and unresolved PBH mergers, assuming a broad PBH mass distribution. In our analysis, we incorporate constraints on the curvature power spectrum from CMB $\mu$-distortions and the overproduction of PBHs, which significantly suppress the contribution of PBH mergers to the total GW background. We find that scalar-induced GWs dominate the nHz frequency range, while PBH mergers alone cannot account for the observed signal under the standard PBH formation scenario involving Gaussian perturbations, and including only Poissonian PBH clustering. However, specific PBH models, such as those with enhanced clustering, could yield a GW background dominated by PBH mergers. Overall, we find that the IPTA DR2 strongly favors an astrophysical origin for the reported common-spectrum process over the PBH models considered in this analysis.</description>

      <title>Full Parity-Violating Trispectrum in Axion Inflation: Reduction to Low-D Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the galaxy 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF) have seemingly detected non-zero parity-odd modes at high significance. Since gravity, the primary driver of galaxy formation and evolution is parity-even, any parity violation, if genuine, is likely to have been produced by some new parity-violating mechanism in the early Universe. Here we investigate an inflationary model with a Chern-Simons interaction between an axion and a $U(1)$ gauge field, where the axion itself is the inflaton field. Evaluating the trispectrum (Fourier-space analog of the 4PCF) of the primordial curvature perturbations is an involved calculation with very high-dimensional loop integrals. We demonstrate how to simplify these integrals and perform all angular integrations analytically by reducing the integrals to convolutions and exploiting the Convolution Theorem. This leaves us with low-dimensional radial integrals that are much more amenable to efficient numerical evaluation. This paper is the first in a series in which we will use these results to compute the full late-time 4PCF for axion inflation, thence enabling constraints from upcoming 3D spectroscopic surveys such as Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), Euclid, or Roman.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Zoom-In Simulations of Milky Way Host Size Dark Matter Halos with a Blue-Tilted Primordial Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope revealed a surprisingly large number of galaxies formed at high redshift. Along with strong lensing studies and nearby galaxy observations, these could challenge the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmology with a power-law primordial power spectrum. In this study, we conduct high-resolution cosmological zoom-in dark matter-only simulations of Milky Way host size halos with a blue, tilted primordial power spectrum ($P(k)\propto k^{m_s}$ with $m_s&gt;1$ at small scales $&gt;1~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$). We find that the blue-tilted subhalo mass functions can be enhanced by more than a factor of two for subhalo masses $M_{\rm sub} \lesssim 10^{10}~ M_{\odot}$, whereas the subhalo $V_{\rm max}$ functions can be enhanced by a factor of four for maximum circular velocities $V_{\rm max}\lesssim 30 ~{\rm km/s}$. The blue-tilted scaled cumulative substructure fraction can be an order of magnitude higher at $\sim$10\% of the virial radius. The blue-tilted subhalos also have higher central densities, since the blue-tilted subhalos reach the same $V_{\rm max}$ at a smaller distance $R_{\rm max}$ from the center. We have also verified these findings with higher-resolution simulations.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Photometric Redshift Catalogs Through Color-Space Analysis: Application to KiDS-Bright Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14799v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to refine photometric redshift galaxy catalogs by comparing their color-space matching with overlapping spectroscopic calibration data. We focus on cases where photometric redshifts (photo-$z$) are estimated empirically. Identifying galaxies that are poorly represented in spectroscopic data is crucial, as their photo-$z$ may be unreliable due to extrapolation beyond the training sample. Our approach uses a self-organizing map (SOM) to project a multi-dimensional parameter space of magnitudes and colors onto a 2-D manifold, allowing us to analyze the resulting patterns as a function of various galaxy properties. Using SOM, we compare the Kilo-Degree Survey bright galaxy sample (KiDS-Bright), limited to $r&lt;20$ mag, with various spectroscopic samples, including the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA). Our analysis reveals that GAMA under-represents KiDS-Bright at its faintest ($r\gtrsim19.5$) and highest-redshift ($z\gtrsim0.4$) ranges, however no strong trends in color or stellar mass. By incorporating additional spectroscopic data from the SDSS, 2dF, and early DESI, we identify SOM cells where photo-$z$ are estimated suboptimally. We derive a set of SOM-based criteria to refine the photometric sample and improve photo-$z$ statistics. For the KiDS-Bright sample, this improvement is modest: exclusion of the least represented 20% of the sample reduces photo-$z$ scatter by less than 10%. We conclude that GAMA, used for KiDS-Bright photo-$z$ training, is sufficiently representative for reliable redshift estimation across most of the color space. Future spectroscopic data from surveys such as DESI should be better suited for exploiting the full improvement potential of our method.</description>

      <title>Complete background cosmology of parity-even quadratic metric-affine gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmology of metric-affine gravity is studied for the general, parity preserving action quadratic in curvature, torsion and non-metricity. The model contains 27 a priori independent couplings in addition to the Einstein constant. Linear and higher order relations between the quadratic operators in a Friedmann--Lemaitre--Robertson--Walker spacetime are obtained, along with the modified Friedmann, torsion and non-metricity equations. Extra parameter constraints lead to two special branches of the model. Firstly, a branch is found in which the Riemannian spatial curvature (thought to be slightly closed or flat in the Lambda-CDM model of our Universe) is entirely screened from all the field equations, regardless of its true value. Secondly, an integrable branch is found which yields (anti) de Sitter expansion at late times. The particle spectra of these two branches are studied, and the need to eliminate higher-spin particles as well as ghosts and tachyons motivates further parameter constraints in each case. The most general model is also found which reproduces the exact Friedmann equations of general relativity. The full set of equations describing closed, open or flat cosmologies, for general parity-even quadratic metric-affine gravity, is made available for SymPy, Mathematica and Maple platforms.</description>

      <title>Photon proliferation from $N$-body dark matter annihilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a photon proliferation effect from $N$-body dark matter (DM) annihilation in the early Universe, which can induce a drastic photon-temperature shift after neutrino decoupling. For pseudoscalar DM mass below the eV scale, we show that the photon proliferation effect becomes significant as the mass approaches the ultralight end, due to the huge enhancement from the background DM number density. This presents the leading constraints on the DM-photon coupling, DM self-interaction, and DM-electron coupling, which are stronger than the existing bounds up to several orders of magnitude. The present research can be extended to other interactions and DM candidates, and highlights the importance of multi-body processes in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Non-Gaussianity from Neutrino Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutrino mass generation via conventional seesaw mechanism is realized at high scales around $O(10^{14})$GeV and probing new physics of the seesaw scale poses a great challenge. A striking fact is that the neutrino seesaw scale is typically around the cosmological inflation scale. In this work, we propose a framework incorporating inflation and neutrino seesaw in which the inflaton primarily decays into right-handed neutrinos after inflation. This decay process is governed by the inflaton interaction with the right-handed neutrinos that respects the shift symmetry. Under the neutrino seesaw mechanism, fluctuations of the Higgs field can modulate the inflaton decays, contributing to the curvature perturbation. We investigate the induced non-Gaussian signatures and demonstrate that such signatures provides an important means to probe the high-scale neutrino seesaw mechanism.</description>

      <title>STOLAS: STOchastic LAttice Simulation of cosmic inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a C++ package of the STOchastic LAttice Simulation (STOLAS) of cosmic inflation. It performs the numerical lattice simulation in the application of the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism. STOLAS can directly compute the three-dimensional map of the observable curvature perturbation without estimating its statistical properties. In its application to two toy models of inflation, chaotic inflation and Starobinsky's linear-potential inflation, we confirm that STOLAS is well-consistent with the standard perturbation theory. Furthermore, by introducing the importance sampling technique, we have success in numerically sampling the current abundance of primordial black holes in a non-perturbative way. The package is available at https://github.com/STOchasticLAtticeSimulation/STOLAS_dist.</description>

      <title>A field-level emulator for modified gravity</title>

Abstract: Stage IV surveys like LSST and Euclid present a unique opportunity to shed light on the nature of dark energy. However, their full constraining power cannot be unlocked unless accurate predictions are available at all observable scales. Currently, only the linear regime is well understood in models beyond $\Lambda$CDM: on the nonlinear scales, expensive numerical simulations become necessary, whose direct use is impractical in the analyses of large datasets. Recently, machine learning techniques have shown the potential to break this impasse: by training emulators, we can predict complex data fields in a fraction of the time it takes to produce them.
  In this work, we present a field-level emulator capable of turning a $\Lambda$CDM N-body simulation into one evolved under $f(R)$ gravity. To achieve this, we build on the map2map neural network, using the strength of modified gravity $|f_{R_0}|$ as style parameter. We find that our emulator correctly estimates the changes it needs to apply to the positions and velocities of the input N-body particles to produce the target simulation.
  We test the performance of our network against several summary statistics, finding $1\%$ agreement in the power spectrum up to $k \sim 1$ $h/$Mpc, and $1.5\%$ agreement against the independent boost emulator eMantis. Although the algorithm is trained on fixed cosmological parameters, we find it can extrapolate to models it was not trained on. Coupled with available field-level emulators and simulation suites for $\Lambda$CDM, our algorithm can be used to constrain modified gravity in the large-scale structure using full information available at the field level.</description>

      <title>Reionization relics in the cross-correlation between the Ly$\alpha$ forest and 21 cm intensity mapping in the post-reionization era</title>

Abstract: The tumultuous effects of ultraviolet photons that source cosmic reionization, the subsequent compression and shock-heating of low-density regions, and the modulation of baryons in shallow potential wells induced by the passage of ionization fronts, collectively introduce perturbations to the evolution of the intergalactic medium in the post-reionization era. These enduring fluctuations persist deep into the post-reionization era, casting a challenge upon precision cosmology endeavors targeting tracers in this cosmic era. Simultaneously, these relics from reionization also present a unique opportunity to glean insights into the astrophysics that govern the epoch of reionization. In this work, we propose a first study of the cross-correlation of \lya forest and 21 cm intensity mapping, accounting for the repercussions of inhomogeneous reionization in the post-reionization era. We investigate the ability of SKA $\times$ DESI-like, SKA $\times$ MUST-like, and PUMA $\times$ MUST-like instrumental setups to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the redshift range $3.5 \leq z \leq 4$. Moreover, we assess how alterations in integration time, survey area, and reionization scenarios impact the SNR. Furthermore, we forecast the cross-correlation's potential to constrain cosmological parameters under varying assumptions: considering or disregarding reionization relics, marginalizing over reionization astrophysics, and assuming perfect knowledge of reionization. Notably, our findings underscore the remarkable capability of a futuristic PUMA $\times$ MUST-like setup, with a modest 100-hour integration time over a 100 sq. deg. survey, to constrain the ionization efficiency error to $\sigma_\zeta = 3.42 $.</description>

      <title>The Status of Neutrino Cosmology: Standard $\Lambda$CDM, Extensions, and Tensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the performance of the six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model and its extensions in light of recent cosmological observations, with particular focus on neutrino properties inferred from cosmology. Using a broad suite of nine combinations of datasets, with three separate analyses of the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, and three separate supernovae (SNe) survey data, plus the recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale results, we derive constraints on the sum of neutrino masses ($\Sigma m_\nu$). Our results show upper limits in the range of $\Sigma m_\nu &lt; 76.9\,\mathrm{meV}$ to $\Sigma m_\nu &lt; 108\,\mathrm{meV}$ (95\% CL). The variation in the limits on $\Sigma m_\nu$ arises from the separate analyses of the Planck CMB data and the separate supernovae datasets, as they relate to the inferred matter density and its relation to the sensitivity of the BAO scale and CMB lensing to $\Sigma m_\nu$. In the context of hierarchical mass models in $\Lambda$CDM, we find a $1.47\sigma$ preference for normal ordering (NO) over inverted ordering (IO), with similar values of preference across all datasets. Despite the strong constraints, an inclination towards massless neutrinos over NO remains weak at $1.36\sigma$. We find that a ``negative'' neutrino mass, inferred from the shape of the likelihood in the physical regime, $\Sigma m_\nu &gt; 0$, is only present at less than $2\sigma$. We confirm that models allowing extra relativistic degrees of freedom, with $N_{\rm eff} \approx 3.5$, alleviate the Hubble tension. Significantly, we find a $3.3\sigma$ preference for a 0.1 eV partially thermalized sterile neutrino when the SH0ES $H_0$ measurement is included, a scale of interest in short-baseline oscillation experiment results.

      <title>Finite-temperature renormalization of Standard Model coupled with gravity, and its implications for cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07335v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite-temperature one-loop renormalization of the Standard Model, coupled with dynamic metric, is conducted in this study. The entire analysis is coherently carried out by using the refined background field method, applied in the spirit of the Coleman-Weinberg technique. The general form of the propagator, introduced in our previous work to facilitate Feynman diagram computation in a general curved background, proves useful in the presence of time-dependent temperature. Its utilization allows for the renormalization analysis of a FLRW background to essentially reduce to that of a constant finite-T flat spacetime. The implications of our findings for cosmology, particularly the cosmological constant problem and Hubble tension, are discussed.</description>

      <title>BUFFALO Wild Wings: A High Precision Free-Form Lens Model of MACSJ0416 with Constraints on Dark Matter from Substructure and Highly Magnified Arcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new free-form and hybrid mass reconstructions of the galaxy cluster lens MACS J0416.1$-$2403 at $z=0.396$ using the lens inversion method GRALE. The reconstructions use 237 spectroscopically confirmed multiple images from Bergamini et. al. 2023 as the main input. Our primary model reconstructs images to a positional accuracy of 0.191", thus representing one of the most precise reconstructions of this lens to date. Our models find broad agreement with previous reconstructions, and identify two $\sim 10^{12} M_{\odot}$ light-unaffiliated substructures. We focus on two highly magnified arcs: Spock and Mothra. Our model features a unique critical curve structure around the Spock arc with 2 crossings. This structure enables sufficient magnification across this arc to potentially explain the large number of transients as microlensing events of supergiant stars. Additionally, we develop a model of the millilens substructure expected to be magnifying Mothra, which may be a binary pair of supergiants with $\mu \sim 6000$. This model accounts for flexibility in the millilens position while preserving the observed flux and minimizing image position displacements along the Mothra arc. We constrain the millilens mass and core radius to $\lesssim 10^6 M_{\odot}$ and $\lesssim 17$ pc, respectively, which would render it one of the smallest and most compact substructures constrained by lensing. If the millilens is dominated by wave dark matter, the axion mass is constrained to be $\lesssim 3.0 \times 10^{-21}$ eV. Further monitoring of this lens with JWST will uncover more transients, permitting tighter constraints on the structure surrounding these two arcs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present new constraints on the velocity-independent cross section of keV-scale mass annihilating Dark Matter particles obtained with SRG/ART-XC after 4 full-sky surveys. These constraints are derived from observations of the Milky Way Halo, 33 Local Group spheroidal dwarf (dSph) galaxies and separately for the dSph galaxy Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1. The constraints from the Milky Way Halo are the strongest among others and among all available in literature for this class of Dark Matter models with particle masses from 4 to 15 keV.</description>

      <title>Astraeus X: Indications of a top-heavy initial mass function in highly star-forming galaxies from JWST observations at z&gt;10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered an abundance of $z&gt;10$ galaxies bright in the ultraviolet (UV) that has challenged traditional theoretical models at high redshifts. Recently, various new models have emerged to address this discrepancy by refining their description of star formation. Here we investigate whether modifications to the stellar initial mass function (IMF) alone can reproduce the $z&gt;10$ UV luminosity functions (UV LFs) when the star formation rate is used as a proxy for the fraction of massive stars. We incorporate an Evolving IMF into the {\sc astraeus} galaxy evolution and reionisation simulation framework, which becomes increasingly top-heavy as the gas density in a galaxy rises above a given threshold. Our implementation accounts for the IMF's effects on supernova (SN) feedback, metal enrichment, and the UV and ionising emissivities. For this Evolving IMF model, we find that (i) the maximum UV luminosity enhancement is twice as large in massive galaxies ($\Delta M_\mathrm{UV}\simeq2.6$) than those where star formation is strongly limited by SN feedback ($\Delta M_\mathrm{UV}\simeq1.3$); (ii) it successfully reproduces the observed UV LFs at $z=5-15$; (iii) galaxies with top-heavy IMFs exhibit the highest star formation rates, driven by their location in local density peaks, which facilitates higher gas accretion rates; (iv) the $1\sigma$ variances in the UV luminosity are only slightly higher compared to when assuming a Salpeter IMF, but the $2\sigma$ variances are significantly increased by a factor of $1.4-2$ boosting the abundance of UV-bright galaxies at $z&gt;10$; (v) reionisation begins earlier with more extended large ionised regions and fewer smaller ones during its initial stages, though these differences diminish at lower redshifts, leading to a similar end of reionisation at $z\simeq5.6$.}</description>

      <title>LMC Calls, Milky Way Halo Answers: Disentangling the Effects of the MW--LMC Interaction on Stellar Stream Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The infall of the LMC into the Milky Way (MW) has dynamical implications throughout the MW's dark matter halo. We study the impact of this merger on the statistical properties of populations of simulated stellar streams. Specifically, we investigate the radial and on-sky angular dependence of stream perturbations caused by the direct effect of stream--LMC interactions and/or the response of the MW dark matter halo. We use a time-evolving MW--LMC simulation described by basis function expansions to simulate streams. We quantify the degree of perturbation using a set of stream property statistics including the misalignment of proper motions with the stream track. In the outer halo, direct stream--LMC interactions produce a statistically significant effect, boosting the fraction of misaligned proper motions by ~25% relative to the model with no LMC. Moreover, there is on-sky angular dependence of stream perturbations: the highest fractions of perturbed streams coincide with the same on-sky quadrant as the present-day LMC location. In the inner halo, the MW halo dipole response primarily drives stream perturbations, but it remains uncertain whether this is a detectable signature distinct from the LMC's influence. For the fiducial MW--LMC model, we find agreement between the predicted fraction of streams with significantly misaligned proper motions, $\bar{\vartheta}&gt;10^{\circ}$, and Dark Energy Survey data. Finally, we predict this fraction for the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) footprint. Using LSST data will improve our constraints on dark matter models and LMC properties as it is sensitive to both.</description>

      <title>Spin induction from scattering of two spinning black holes in dense clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we use numerical relativity to study the spin induction effect within close hyperbolic encounters of initially spinning black holes. We review the initially non-spinning case and explore the cases of initially aligned, anti-aligned and orthogonal spins with respect to the orbital angular momentum $\vec L$. We find that, for a given initial effective spin, the black hole with a smaller initial spin acquires a greater spin-up than the other black hole after the interaction. We study three different scenarios regarding initial effective spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}=-0.1, \ 0.0, \ 0.1$), using three different scattering angles in order to obtain maximally spin-inducing scenarios. We also find that the final effective spin-ups with respect to the initial spins are well-fitted by a parabola. For spins orthogonal to $\vec L$, we observe that the black hole spins precess, and that the induced spin in the $z$-direction depends quadratically on the value of the initial spins. These phenomena suggest that dense black hole clusters present a rich spin dynamics, where black hole spins may acquire non-trivial distributions.</description>

      <title>Mitigating cosmic variance in the Hellings-Downs curve: a Cosmic Microwave Background analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation, which characterizes the signature of a stochastic gravitational wave background measured via Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA), is derived using a harmonic formalism. This approach closely follows the theoretical framework traditionally employed to compute correlations of temperature fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This parallel enables a direct comparison between the correlations observed in PTA and those in CMB experiments. After providing analytic estimates of the transmission functions due to the model-fitting procedure, we show that the covariance matrix in frequency space becomes very non-diagonal. We then build formally the quadratic estimator for the HD correlation in multipolar space, for both perfect and imperfect experiments. In particular, we clarify that what has been referred to as \emph{cosmic variance} in some of the previous literature is not an intrinsic limitation for PTA measurements. Instead, when an optimal estimator is used, this variance can be mitigated by accumulating more observation time or improving the cadence of pulsar monitoring. Therefore, unlike CMB angular correlations, where cosmic variance represents an irreducible constraint, it can be reduced in PTA measurements and will continue to diminish in future experiments. Finally, we show that if the primordial power spectrum of tensor fluctuations was very blue with $n_T&gt;4$, the CMB angular correlation due to these tensor modes would also exhibit a HD correlation.</description>
