      <title>Fractional Order Thermo Piezoelectric Modelling of qP Wave Interaction and Energy Partition at Welded Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytical model is developed to investigate the interaction of quasi longitudinal (qP) waves with a perfectly bonded interface between a thermo piezoelectric half space and a functionally graded piezoelectric half space. The formulation is based on the fractional order Lord Shulman generalized thermoelasticity theory, which provides an enhanced description of coupled thermo electro mechanical wave behaviour. Rotational effects are incorporated into the constitutive relations and equations of motion for both media, while the lower half space is assumed to be subjected to initial stress. Closed form solutions for reflection and transmission coefficients are obtained, together with associated energy partition factors, allowing a comprehensive assessment of interface wave characteristics. Numerical simulations carried out using MATLAB demonstrate that the reflection and transmission responses are strongly influenced by initial stress, fractional order parameter, and thermal relaxation time. The calculated energy ratios of scattered waves satisfy the energy conservation condition, confirming the mathematical consistency of the formulation. The findings of this study are relevant to the design and analysis of smart sensors, rotating and aerospace structures, vibration control systems, and energy harvesting devices employing functionally graded thermo piezoelectric materials under fractional order effects.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive semi-automated fabrication system for quartz tuning fork AFM probe with real-time resonance frequency monitoring and Q-factor control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quartz tuning fork-based atomic force microscopy (QTF-AFM) has become a powerful tool for high-resolution imaging of both conductive and insulating samples, including semiconductor structures and metal-coated surfaces as well as soft matter under ambient conditions, while also enabling measurements in more demanding environments including ultrahigh vacuum and cryogenic conditions where conventional cantilever-based AFM often encounters limitations. However, the broader adoption of QTF-AFM has been constrained by the difficulty of attaching a cantilever tip to a quartz tuning fork (QTF) with the positional and angular precision required for repeatable and reproducible probe fabrication. For stable operation, the tip must be placed precisely at the midline of a single tine, aligned parallel to the prong axis, and rigidly secured. Even slight lateral offsets or angular deviations disrupt the intrinsic antisymmetric flexural mode, induce torsional coupling, and ultimately lead to systematic image distortions and reduced measurement integrity. In this work, we present a comprehensive, semi-automated QTF-tip fabrication system that integrates precision alignment, real-time frequency-sweep monitoring, and controlled Q-factor tuning within a single workflow. Experimental characterization demonstrates consistent probe preparation across multiple trials, preservation of sharp and well-defined resonance responses with deliberately adjustable damping, and high-fidelity, high-resolution imaging in practical scanning tests. This integrated approach provides a reproducible framework to QTF-based probe fabrication, lowering the technical barrier to QTF-AFM implementation and broadening its applicability across diverse sample types and operating environments.</description>

      <title>Engineering Near-Infrared Two-Level Systems in Confined Alkali Vapors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combined experimental and theoretical investigations of an effective two-level atomic system operating in the near-infrared telecom wavelength regime, realized using hot rubidium vapor confined within a sub-micron-thick cell. In this strongly confined geometry, atomic coherence is profoundly influenced by wall-induced relaxation arising from frequent atom-surface collisions. By analyzing both absorption and fluorescence spectra, we demonstrate that the optical response is dominated by a closed cycling transition, which effectively isolates the atomic dynamics to a two-level configuration despite the presence of multiple hyperfine states. This confinement-induced selection suppresses optical pumping into uncoupled states and enables robust, controllable light-matter interaction at telecom wavelengths within a miniature atomic platform. Our results establish a practical route to realizing near-infrared atomic two-level systems in compact vapor-cell devices, opening new opportunities for integrated quantum photonic technologies, including on-chip quantum memories, telecom-band frequency references, and scalable quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Active learning for photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active learning for photonic crystals explores the integration of analytic approximate Bayesian last layer neural networks (LL-BNNs) with uncertainty-driven sample selection to accelerate photonic band gap prediction. We employ an analytic LL-BNN formulation, corresponding to the infinite Monte Carlo sample limit, to obtain uncertainty estimates that are strongly correlated with the true predictive error on unlabeled candidate structures. These uncertainty scores drive an active learning strategy that prioritizes the most informative simulations during training. Applied to the task of predicting band gap sizes in two-dimensional, two-tone photonic crystals, our approach achieves up to a 2.6x reduction in required training data compared to a random sampling baseline while maintaining predictive accuracy. The efficiency gains arise from concentrating computational resources on high uncertainty regions of the design space rather than sampling uniformly. Given the substantial cost of full band structure simulations, especially in three dimensions, this data efficiency enables rapid and scalable surrogate modeling. Our results suggest that analytic LL-BNN based active learning can substantially accelerate topological optimization and inverse design workflows for photonic crystals, and more broadly, offers a general framework for data efficient regression across scientific machine learning domains.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of unsteady flow in a reversible pump-turbine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydropower is an important source of renewable energy that provides clean energy. Pump-turbine type hydraulic turbine is widely used to mitigate the intermittent energy demand and store a large-scale energy. Pump-turbine operates in reverse mode in pump mode to store energy. Flow conditions in turbine mode and pump mode operations is substantially different. This study investigates the unsteady flow field in the model pump-turbine. A computational model of the pump-turbine was created, and the model included hexahedral mesh of 58.19 million nodes. Total verification and validation error was 7.7%. Three operating conditions in turbine mode and four in pump mode were simulated. Flow characteristics, such as blade loading, time-dependent pressure fluctuations, frequency spectra, radial and tangential velocity were investigated. The frequency spectra revealed amplitude of frequencies up to tenth harmonics of the blade passing frequency in pump mode. The higher harmonic frequencies can potentially reach the high mode eigen frequencies and increase the risk of resonance. Flow field analysis in the draft tube indicted the strong presence of Dean vortices causing highly asymmetric flow at the runner inlet in pump mode operation. This study provides essential insights into the complex flow phenomena and advances the understanding of unsteady flow behaviour in pump-turbines.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Terahertz Photoresponse via Acoustic Plasmon Cavity Resonances in Scalable Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise control and nanoscale confinement of terahertz (THz) fields are essential requirements for emerging applications in photonics, quantum technologies, wireless communications, and sensing. Here, we demonstrate a polaritonic cavity enhanced THz photoresponse in an antenna coupled device based on chemical vapor deposited (CVD) monolayer graphene. The dipole antenna lobes simultaneously serve as two gate electrodes, concentrate the impinging THz field, and efficiently launch acoustic graphene plasmons (AGPs), which drive a strong photo-thermoelectric (PTE) signal. Between 6 and 90 K, the photovoltage exhibits pronounced peaks, modulating the PTE response by up to 40\%, that we attribute to AGPs forming a Fabry P\'erot THz cavity in the full or half graphene channel. Combined full wave and transport thermal simulations accurately reproduce the gate controlled plasmon wavelength, spatial absorption profile, and the resulting nonuniform electron heating responsible for the PTE response. The lateral and vertical maximum confinement factors of the AGP wavelength relative to the incident wavelength are 165 and 4000, respectively, for frequencies from 1.83 to 2.52 THz. These results demonstrate that wafer scalable CVD graphene, without hBN encapsulation, can host coherent AGP resonances and exhibit an efficient polaritonic enhanced photoresponse under appropriate gating, antenna coupling, and AGP cavity design, opening a route to scalable, polarization and frequency selective, liquid nitrogen cooled, and low power consumption THz detection platforms based on plasmon thermoelectric transduction.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic enhancement of phononic four-wave mixing in AlScN/SiC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface acoustic wave platforms based on piezoelectric thin-film heterostructures provide sub-wavelength acoustic confinement, making them attractive for compact nonlinear phononic systems with applications including frequency conversion, parametric interactions, and nonlinear signal processing. Here, we investigate guided surface acoustic wave phononic four-wave mixing at gigahertz frequencies in an aluminum scandium nitride/4H-silicon carbide heterostructure operated at both room temperature (295 K) and cryogenic temperature (4 K). The 500 nm thick aluminum scandium nitride film supports guided Rayleigh and Sezawa modes with distinct displacement and strain energy density distributions, allowing a direct comparison of mode-dependent nonlinear behavior within the same device. Continuous-wave four-wave mixing measurements reveal an enhancement in the extracted modal nonlinear coefficient at 4 K relative to 295 K for both modes. In addition, the Rayleigh mode exhibits a modal nonlinearity approximately two orders of magnitude larger than that of the Sezawa mode across both temperature regimes. These results demonstrate that phononic four-wave mixing is strongly influenced by temperature, mode confinement, and strain localization while establishing aluminum scandium nitride on silicon carbide heterostructures as a promising platform for engineering enhanced nonlinear phononic interactions for future classical and quantum acoustic on-chip signal processing systems.</description>

      <title>Defects and Impurity Properties of VN precipitates in ARAFM Steels: Modelling using a Universal Machine Learning Potential and Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: VN precipitates used to strengthen ARAFM steels for fusion applications dissolve under high Fe ion irradiation (100 dpa at 10^-3 dpa s^-1, 600 C). This study examined point defects and solute substitutions using atom probe tomography, machine learning interatomic potentials, and density functional theory. Combined with transmission electron microscopy, results show N-vacancies and substitutional Cr exist in VN precipitates before irradiation. Monte Carlo simulations and collision cascade simulations confirm ordered vacancies at operating temperatures help mitigate irradiation damage. However, solute additions disrupt vacancy ordering and enhance irradiation-induced damage, potentially accelerating dissolution.</description>
