      <title>Long-time behaviors of the two-component nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation: higher-order asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the long-time asymptotic behaviors of solutions to the initial value problem of the two-component nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation by inverse scattering transform and Riemann-Hilbert formulism. Two reflection coefficients are defined and their properties are analyzed in detail. The Riemann-Hilbert problem associated with the initial value problem is constructed in term of the two reflection coefficients. The Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method is then employed to analyze the Riemann-Hilbert problem, yielding the long-time asymptotics of the solution in different regions. Specifically, a higher-order asymptotic expansion of the solution inside the light cone is provided, and the leading term of this asymptotic solution is compared with results from direct numerical simulations, showing excellent agreement. This work not only provides a comprehensive analysis of the long-time behaviors of the two-component nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation but also offers a robust framework for future studies on similar nonlinear systems with third-order Lax pair.</description>

      <title>Temporal Complexity Hierarchies in Solvable Quantum Many-Body Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The influence matrix (IM) provides a powerful framework for characterizing nonequilibrium quantum many-body dynamics by encoding multitime correlations into tensor-network states. Understanding how its computational complexity relates to underlying dynamics is crucial for both theoretical insight and practical utility, yet remains largely unexplored despite a few case studies. Here, we address this question for a family of brickwork quantum circuits ranging from integrable to chaotic regimes. Using tools from geometric group theory, we identify three qualitatively distinct scalings of temporal entanglement entropy, establishing a hierarchy of computational resources required for accurate tensor-network representations of the IM for these models. We further analyze the memory structure of the IM and distinguish between classical and quantum temporal correlations. In particular, for certain examples, we identify effectively classical IMs that admit an efficient Monte Carlo algorithm for computing multitime correlations. In more generic settings without an explicit classical description of the IM, we introduce an operational measure of quantum memory with an experimental protocol, and discuss examples exhibiting long-time genuinely quantum correlations. Our results establish a new connection between quantum many-body dynamics and group theory, providing fresh insights into the complexity of the IM and its intricate connection to the physical characteristics of the dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel approach is proposed to characterize the dynamics of perturbed many-body integrable systems. Focusing on the paradigmatic case of the Toda chain under non-integrable Hamiltonian perturbations, this study introduces a method based the time evolution of the Lax eigenvalues $\lambda_\alpha$ as a proxy of the quasi-particles velocities and of the perturbed Toda actions. A set of exact equations of motion for the $\lambda_\alpha$ is derived that closely resemble those for eigenenergies of a quantum problem (also known as the Pechukas-Yukawa gas). Numerical simulations suggest that the invariant measure of such dynamics is basically the thermal density of states of the Toda lattice, regardless of the form of the perturbation.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable dissipative dynamics and one-form strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking in interacting two-dimensional spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11501</link>

Abstract: We study the dissipative dynamics of a class of interacting ``gamma-matrix'' spin models coupled to a Markovian environment. For spins on an arbitrary graph, we construct a Lindbladian that maps to a non-Hermitian model of free Majorana fermions hopping on the graph with a background classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. We show, analytically and numerically, that the steady states and relaxation dynamics are qualitatively independent of the choice of the underlying graph, in stark contrast to the Hamiltonian case. We also show that the exponentially many steady states provide a concrete example of mixed-state topological order, in the sense of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking of a one-form symmetry. While encoding only classical information, the steady states still exhibit long-range quantum correlations. Afterward, we examine the relaxation processes toward the steady state by numerically computing decay rates, which we generically find to be finite, even in the dissipationless limit. However, we identify symmetry sectors where fermion-parity conservation is enhanced to fermion-number conservation, where we can analytically bound the decay rates and prove that they vanish in the limits of both infinitely weak and infinitely strong dissipation. Finally, we show that while the choice of coherent dynamics is very flexible, exact solvability strongly constrains the allowed form of dissipation. Our work establishes an analytically tractable framework to explore nonequilibrium quantum phases of matter and the relaxation mechanisms toward them.</description>
