      <title>Partial Model Theory -- Ultraproducts and Compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we prove the compactness theorem with respect to partial structures and quasi-truth, using the technique of ultraproducts. Partial structures and quasi-truth are two notions developed within the partial structures approach, which is a philosophical conception that emerged in the context of contemporary philosophy of science. Nevertheless, the notions developed within this conception, in particular the two mentioned, have a model-theoretic content that has not been explored so far, so that this paper is part of a project where we intend to analyze their formal properties by means of the development of a partial model theory, which is an extension of traditional model theory to partial structures.</description>

      <title>Maximal \delta-separated sets in separable metric spaces and weak forms of choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the statement ``In every separable pseudometric space there is a maximal non-strictly \delta-separated set.'' implies the axiom of choice for countable families of sets. This gives answers to a question of Dybowski and G\'{o}rka in [M. Dybowski and P. G\'{o}rka, The axiom of choice in metric measure spaces and maximal \delta-separated sets, Archive for Mathematical Logic 62, 735-749, 2023.]. We also prove several related results.</description>

      <title>Preservation theorems on sparse classes revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the work studying homomorphism preservation for first-order logic in sparse classes of structures initiated in [Atserias et al., JACM 2006] and [Dawar, JCSS 2010]. These established that first-order logic has the homomorphism preservation property in any sparse class that is monotone and addable. It turns out that the assumption of addability is not strong enough for the proofs given. We demonstrate this by constructing classes of graphs of bounded treewidth which are monotone and addable but fail to have homomorphism preservation. We also show that homomorphism preservation fails on the class of planar graphs. On the other hand, the proofs of homomorphism preservation can be recovered by replacing addability by a stronger condition of amalgamation over bottlenecks. This is analogous to a similar condition formulated for extension preservation in [Ateserias et al., SiCOMP 2008].</description>

      <title>Noetherian theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A first-order theory is Noetherian with respect to the collection of formulae $\mathcal{F}$ if every definable set is a Boolean combination of instances of formulae in $\mathcal{F}$ and the topology whose subbasis of closed sets is the collection of instances of arbitrary formulae in $\mathcal{F}$ is Noetherian. Noetherianity is a strengthening of equationality, which itself implies stability. We show the Noetherianity of the theory of proper pairs of algebraically closed fields in any characteristic.</description>
