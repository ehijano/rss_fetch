      <title>On the logarithmic energy of solutions to the polynomial eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the expected logarithmic energy of solutions to the polynomial eigenvalue problem for random matrices. We generalize some known results for the Shub-Smale polynomials, and the spherical ensemble. These two processes are the two extremal particular cases of the polynomial eigenvalue problem, and we prove that the logarithmic energy lies between these two cases. In particular, the roots of the Shub-Smale polynomials are the ones with the lowest logarithmic energy of the family.</description>

      <title>Chernoff Bounds for Tensor Expanders on Riemannian Manifolds Using Graph Laplacian Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the advancement of probability tail bound analysis, a crucial statistical tool for assessing the probability of large deviations of random variables from their expected values. Traditional tail bounds, such as Markov's, Chebyshev's, and Chernoff bounds, have proven valuable across numerous scientific and engineering fields. However, as data complexity grows, there is a pressing need to extend tail bound estimation from scalar variables to high-dimensional random objects. Existing studies often rely on the assumption of independence among high-dimensional random objects, an assumption that may not always be valid. Building on the work of researchers like Garg et al. and Chang, who employed random walks to model high-dimensional ensembles, this study introduces a more generalized approach by exploring random walks over manifolds. To address the challenges of constructing an appropriate underlying graph for a manifold, we propose a novel method that enhances random walks on graphs approximating the manifold. This approach ensures spectral similarity between the original manifold and the approximated graph, including matching eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and eigenfunctions. Leveraging graph approximation technique proposed by Burago et al. for manifolds, we derive the tensor Chernoff bound and establish its range for random walks on a Riemannian manifold according to the underlying manifold's spectral characteristics.</description>

      <title>Limit shapes and fluctuations for $(GL_n, GL_k)$ skew Howe duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the probability measures on Young diagrams in the $n \times k$ rectangle obtained by piecewise-continuously differentiable specializations of Schur polynomials in the dual Cauchy identity. We use a free fermionic representation of the correlation kernel to study its asymptotic behavior and derive the uniform convergence to a limit shape of Young diagrams in the limit $n,k \to \infty$. More specifically, we show the bulk is the discrete sine kernel with boundary fluctuations generically given by the Tracy-Widom distribution with the Airy kernel. When our limit shape touches the boundary corner of the rectangle, the fluctuations with a second order correction are given by the discrete Hermite kernel, and we recover the discrete distribution of Gravner-Tracy-Widom (2001) [arXiv:math/0005133] restricting to the leading order. Finally, we demonstrate our limit shapes can have sections with no or full density of particles, where the Pearcey kernel appears when such a section is infinitely small.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for a strongly irreducible product of independent random matrices under optimal moment assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let  $ \nu $  be a probability distribution over the linear semi-group  $ \mathrm{End}(E) $  for  $ E $  a finite dimensional vector space over a locally compact field. We assume that  $ \nu $  is proximal, strongly irreducible and that  $ \nu^{*n}\{0\}=0 $  for all integers  $ n\in\mathbb{N} $. We consider the random sequence  $ \overline\gamma_n := \gamma_0 \cdots \gamma_{n-1} $  for  $ (\gamma_k)_{k \ge 0} $  independents of distribution law  $ \nu $. We define the logarithmic singular gap as  $ \mathrm{sqz} = \log\left( \frac{\mu_1}{\mu_2} \right) $ , where  $ \mu_1 $  and  $ \mu_2 $  are the two largest singular values. We show that  $ (\mathrm{sqz}(\overline{\gamma}_n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}} $  escapes to infinity linearly and satisfies exponential large deviations estimates below its escape rate. With the same assumptions, we also show that the image of a generic line by  $ \overline{\gamma}_n $  as well as its eigenspace of maximal eigenvalue both converge to the same random line  $l_\infty $  at an exponential speed.If we moreover assume that the push-forward distribution  $N(\nu)$  is  $ \mathrm{L}^p $  for  $ N:g\mapsto\log\left(\|g\|\|g^{-1}\|\right) $  and for some  $ p\ge 1 $, then we show that  $ \log|w(l_\infty)| $  is  $ \mathrm{L}^p $  for all unitary linear form  $ w $  and the logarithm of each coefficient of  $ \overline{\gamma}_n $  is almost surely equivalent to the logarithm of the norm.   To prove these results, we do not rely on any classical results for random products of invertible matrices with  $ \mathrm{L}^1 $  moment assumption. Instead we describe an effective way to group the i.i.d factors into i.i.d random words that are aligned in the Cartan projection. We moreover have an explicit control over the moments.</description>

      <title>Fixation of leadership in non-Markovian growth processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a model where $N$ equal agents possess `values', belonging to $\mathbb{N}_0$, that are subject to incremental growth over time. More precisely, the values of the agents are represented by $N$ independent, increasing $\mathbb{N}_0$ valued processes with random, independent waiting times between jumps. We show that the event that a single agent possesses the maximum value for all sufficiently large values of time (called `leadership') occurs with probability zero or one, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for this to occur. Under mild conditions we also provide criteria for a single agent to become the unique agent of maximum value for all sufficiently large times, and also conditions for the emergence of a unique agent having value that tends to infinity before `explosion' occurs (i.e. conditions for `strict leadership' or `monopoly' to occur almost surely). The novelty of this model lies in allowing non-exponentially distributed waiting times between jumps in value. In the particular case when waiting times are mixtures of exponential distributions, we improve a well-established result on the `balls in bins' model with feedback, removing the requirement that the feedback function be bounded from below and also allowing random feedback functions. As part of the proofs we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the distribution of a convergent series of independent random variables to have an atom on the real line, a result which we believe may be of interest in its own right.</description>

      <title>Dickman type stochastic processes with short- and long- range dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study properties of the (generalized) Dickman distribution with two parameters and the stationary solution of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic differential equation driven by a Poisson process. In particular, we show that the marginal distribution of this solution is the Dickman distribution. Additionally, we investigate superpositions of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes which may have short- or long-range dependencies and marginal distribution of the form of the Dickman distribution. The numerical algorithm for simulation of these processes is presented.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity for Ginzburg-Landau equation with complex-valued space-time white noise on two-dimensional torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ergodicity for the stochastic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with a general non-linear term on the two-dimensional torus driven by a complex-valued space-time white noise. Due to the roughness of complex-valued space-time white noise, this equation is a singular stochastic partial differential equation and its solution is expected to be a distribution-valued stochastic process. For this reason, the non-linear term is ill-defined and needs to be renormalized. We first use the theory of complex multiple Wiener-Ito integral to renormalize this equation and then consider its global well-posedness. Further, we prove its ergodicity using an asymptotic coupling argument for a large dissipation coefficient.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Shape of Subadditive Processes on Groups and on Random Geometric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This doctoral thesis undertakes an in-depth exploration of limiting shape theorems across diverse mathematical structures, with a specific focus on subadditive processes within finitely generated groups exhibiting polynomial growth rates, as well as standard First-Passage Percolation (FPP) models applied to Random Geometric Graphs (RGGs). Employing a diverse range of techniques, including subadditive ergodic theorems and tailored modifications suited for polygonal paths within groups, the thesis examines the asymptotic shape under varying conditions. The investigation extends to subadditive cocycles characterized by at least and at most linear growth. Moreover, the study delves into moderate deviations for FPP models on RGGs, refining previous results with theorems that quantify its speed of convergence to the limiting shape, the fluctuation of the geodesics, and its spanning trees. Additionally, we apply the obtained results in a competition model to verify the positive probability of coexistence of two species competing for territory in a random geometric graph.</description>

      <title>Moderate deviation principles for a reaction diffusion model in non-equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study moderate deviations from hydrodynamic limits of a reaction diffusion model. The process is defined as the superposition of the symmetric exclusion process with a Glauber dynamics. When the process starts from a product measure with a constant density, which is a non-equilibrium measure for the process, we prove that the re-scaled density fluctuation field satisfies the moderate deviation principle. Our proof relies on the so-called main lemma developed by Jara and Menezes in [arXiv:1810.09526, 2018].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an extension of the Hawkes process by incorporating a kernel based on the tempered Mittag-Leffler distribution. This is the generalization of the work presented in [10]. We derive analytical results for the expectation of the conditional intensity and the expected number of events in the counting process. Additionally, we investigate the limiting behavior of the expectation of the conditional intensity. Finally, we present an empirical comparison of the studied process with its limiting special cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a class of processes that contains many natural examples. The interesting feature of such type processes lays on its infinite memory that allows it to record a quite ancient history. Then, using the martingale decomposition method, we establish some deviation and moment inequalities for separately Lipschitz functions of such a process, under various moment conditions on some dominating random variables. Our results generalize the Markov models of Dedecker and Fan [Stochastic Process.\ Appl., 2015] and a recent paper by Chazottes et al.\ [Ann.\ Appl.\ Probab., 2023] for the special case of a specific class of infinite memory models with discrete values.</description>

      <title>Realizability of hypergraphs and high-dimensional contingency tables with random degrees and marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A result of Deza, Levin, Meesum, and Onn shows that the problem of deciding if a given sequence is the degree sequence of a 3-uniform hypergraph is NP complete. We tackle this problem in the random case and show that a random integer partition can be realized as the degree sequence of a $3$-uniform hypergraph with high probability. These results are in stark contrast with the case of graphs, where a classical result of Erd\H{o}s and Gallai provides an efficient algorithm for checking if a sequence is a degree sequence of a graph and a result of Pittel shows that with high probability a random partition is not the degree sequence of a graph.
  By the same method, we address analogous realizability problems about high-dimensional binary contingency tables. We prove that if $(\lambda,\mu,\nu)$ are three independent random partitions then with high probability one can construct a three-dimensional binary contingency table with marginals $(\lambda,\mu,\nu)$. Conversely, if one insists that the contingency table forms a pyramid shape, then we show that with high probability one cannot construct such a contingency table. These two results confirm two conjectures of Pak and Panova.</description>

      <title>Mean-field and fluctuations for hub dynamics in heterogeneous random networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a class of heterogeneous random networks, where each node dynamics is a random dynamical system, interacting with neighbor nodes via a random coupling function, we characterize the hub behavior as the mean-field, subject to statistically controlled fluctuations. In particular, we prove that the fluctuations are small over exponentially long time scales and obtain Berry-Esseen estimates for the fluctuation statistics at any fixed time. Our results provide a mathematical explanation for several numerical observations, including the scaling relation between system size and frequency of large fluctuations, as well as system size induced desynchronization. To our best knowledge, these are the first characterizations of mean-field fluctuations on networks with a degree distribution that follows a power-law, a common feature for many realistic systems.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Tempo and Mode of Environmental Fluctuations on Population Growth: Slow- and Fast-Limit Approximations of Lyapunov Exponents for Periodic and Random Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine to what extent the tempo and mode of environmental fluctuations matter for the growth of structured populations. The models are switching, linear ordinary differential equations $x'(t)=A(\sigma(\omega t))x(t)$ where $x(t)=(x_1(t),\dots,x_d(t))$ corresponds to the population densities in the $d$ individual states, $\sigma(t)$ is a piece-wise constant function representing the fluctuations in the environmental states $1,\dots,N$, $\omega$ is the frequency of the environmental fluctuations, and $A(1),\dots,A(n)$ are Metzler matrices. $\sigma(t)$ can either be a periodic function or correspond to a continuous-time Markov chain. Under suitable conditions, there is a Lyapunov exponent $\Lambda(\omega)$ such that $\lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{1}{t}\log\sum_i x_i(t)=\Lambda(\omega)$ for all non-negative, non-zero initial conditions $x(0)$ (with probability one in the random case). For both forms of switching, we derive analytical first-order and second-order approximations of $\Lambda(\omega)$ in the limits of slow ($\omega\to 0$) and fast ($\omega\to\infty$) environmental fluctuations. When the order of switching and the average switching times are equal, we show that the first-order approximations of $\Lambda(\omega)$ are equivalent in the slow-switching limit, but not in the fast-switching limit. We illustrate our results with applications to stage-structured and spatially-structured models. When dispersal rates are symmetric, the first order approximations suggest that population growth rates increase with the frequency of switching -- consistent with earlier work on periodic switching. In the absence of dispersal symmetry, we demonstrate that $\Lambda(\omega)$ can be non-monotonic in $\omega$. In conclusion, our results show how population growth rates depend on the tempo ($\omega$) and mode (random versus deterministic) of the environmental fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we analyzed urn models by solving the discrete-time master equation using an expansion in moments. This approach is a viable alternative to conventional methods, such as system-size expansion, allowing for the determination of analytical expressions for the mean and variance in an exact form and thus valid for any system size. In particular, this approach was used to study Bernoulli-Laplace and Ehrenfest urns, for which analytic expressions describing their evolution were found. This approach and the results will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of stochastic systems and statistical physics for small-sized systems, where the thermodynamic limit cannot be assumed.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inversion for the identification of the doping profile in unipolar semiconductor devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rigorous Bayesian formulation of the inverse doping profile problem in infinite dimensions for a stationary linearized unipolar drift-diffusion model for semiconductor devices is given. The goal is to estimate the posterior probability distribution of the doping profile and to compute its posterior mean. This allows for the reconstruction of the doping profile from voltage-current measurements. The well-posedness of the Bayesian inverse problem is shown by proving boundedness and continuity properties of the semiconductor model with respect to the unknown parameter. A preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Markov chain Monte-Carlo method for the Bayesian estimation of the doping profile, using a physics-informed prior model, is proposed. The numerical results for a two-dimensional diode illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A Markovian Model for Learning-to-Optimize</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a probabilistic model for stochastic iterative algorithms with the use case of optimization algorithms in mind. Based on this model, we present PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for functions that are defined on the trajectory of the learned algorithm, for example, the expected (non-asymptotic) convergence rate and the expected time to reach the stopping criterion. Thus, not only does this model allow for learning stochastic algorithms based on their empirical performance, it also yields results about their actual convergence rate and their actual convergence time. We stress that, since the model is valid in a more general setting than learning-to-optimize, it is of interest for other fields of application, too. Finally, we conduct five practically relevant experiments, showing the validity of our claims.</description>

      <title>Improved Blow-Up Criterion in a Variational Framework for Nonlinear SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend recent existence and uniqueness results for maximal solutions of SPDEs through an improved blow-up criterion. Whilst the maximal time of existence is typically characterised by blow-up in the energy norm of solutions, we show instead that solutions exist until blow-up in the larger spaces of the variational framework. The result is applied to show that solutions of 2D and 3D Stochastic Navier-Stokes Equations retain the higher order regularity of the initial condition on their time of existence.</description>

      <title>On Confidence Sequences for Bounded Random Processes via Universal Gambling Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12382v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of constructing a confidence sequence, which is a sequence of confidence intervals that hold uniformly over time, for estimating the mean of bounded real-valued random processes. This paper revisits the gambling-based approach established in the recent literature from a natural \emph{two-horse race} perspective, and demonstrates new properties of the resulting algorithm induced by Cover (1991)'s universal portfolio. The main result of this paper is a new algorithm based on a mixture of lower bounds, which closely approximates the performance of Cover's universal portfolio with constant per-round time complexity. A higher-order generalization of a lower bound on a logarithmic function in (Fan et al., 2015), which is developed as a key technique for the proposed algorithm, may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Sandpiles on the Vicsek fractal explode with probability 1/4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vicsek fractal graphs are an important class of infinite graphs with self similar properties, polynomial growth and treelike features, on which several dynamical processes such as random walks or Abelian sandpiles can be rigorously analyzed and one can obtain explicit closed form expressions. While such processes on Vicsek fractals and on Euclidean lattices $\mathbb{Z}^2$ share some properties for instance in the recurrence behaviour, many quantities related to sandpiles on Euclidean lattices are still poorly understood. The current work focuses on the stabilization and explosion of Abelian sandpiles on Vicsek fractal graphs, and we prove that a sandpile sampled from the infinite volume limit plus one additional particle stabilizes with probability 3/4, that is, it does not stabilize almost surely and it explodes with the complementary probability 1/4. We prove the main result by using two different approaches: one of probabilistic nature and one of algebraic flavor. The first approach is based on investigating the particles sent to the boundary of finite volumes and showing that their number stays above four with positive probability. In the second approach we relate the question of stabilization and explosion of sandpiles in infinite volume to the order of elements of the sandpile group on finite approximations of the infinite Vicsek graph. The method applies to more general state spaces and by employing it we also find all invariant factors of the sandpile groups on the finite approximations of the infinite Vicsek fractal.</description>

      <title>Boundary touching probability and nested-path exponent for non-simple CLE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conformal loop ensemble (CLE) has two phases: for $\kappa \in (8/3, 4]$, the loops are simple and do not touch each other or the boundary; for $\kappa \in (4,8)$, the loops are non-simple and may touch each other and the boundary. For $\kappa\in(4,8)$, we derive the probability that the loop surrounding a given point touches the domain boundary. We also obtain the law of the conformal radius of this loop seen from the given point conditioned on the loop touching the boundary or not, refining a result of Schramm-Sheffield-Wilson (2009). As an application, we exactly evaluate the CLE counterpart of the nested-path exponent for the Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) random cluster model recently introduced by Song-Tan-Zhang-Jacobsen-Nienhuis-Deng (2022). This exponent describes the asymptotic behavior of the number of nested open paths in the open cluster containing the origin when the cluster is large. For Bernoulli percolation, which corresponds to $\kappa=6$, the exponent was derived recently in Song-Jacobsen-Nienhuis-Sportiello-Deng (2023) by a color switching argument. For $\kappa\neq 6$, and in particular for the FK-Ising case, our formula appears to be new. Our derivation begins with Sheffield's construction of CLE from which the quantities of interest can be expressed by radial SLE. We solve the radial SLE problem using the coupling between SLE and Liouville quantum gravity, along with the exact solvability of Liouville conformal field theory.</description>

Abstract: We study how the resolvent-family of a diffusion behaves, as thedrift grows to infinity. The limit turns out to be a selfadjoint pseudo-resolvent.After reduction of the underlying Hilbert-space, this pseudo-resolvent becomesa resolvent to a strongly continuous semi-group of contractions. We prove thatthis semi-group is associated to some Hunt-process on some suitable state-space which is constructed from equivalence classes of the drifts trajectories.Finally, we show a distributional limit theorem for the accelerated diffusiontoward the associated Hunt process.</description>

Abstract: Dai Pra et al studied two notions of monotonicity for continuous-time Markov processes on a finite partially ordered set (poset), and conjectured that monotonicity equivalence holds for a poset of W-glued diamond, and that there is no other case when it has no acyclic extension. We proved their conjecture and were able to provide a complete characterization of posets for monotonicity equivalence.</description>

      <title>Critical percolation on slabs with random columnar disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a bond percolation model on slabs $\mathbb{S}^+_k=\mathbb{Z}_+\times \mathbb{Z}_+\times\{0,\dots,k\}$ featuring one-dimensional inhomogeneities. In this context, a vertical column on the slab comprises the set of vertical edges projecting to the same vertex on $\mathbb{Z}_+\times\{0,\dots,k\}$. Columns are chosen based on the arrivals of a renewal process, where the tail distributions of inter-arrival times follow a power law with exponent $\alpha&gt;1$. Inhomogeneities are introduced as follows: vertical edges on selected columns are open (closed) with probability $q$ (respectively $1-q$), independently. Conversely, vertical edges within unselected columns and all horizontal edges are open (closed) with probability $p$ (respectively $1-p$). We prove that for all sufficiently large $\alpha$ (depending solely on $k$), the following assertion holds: if $q&gt;p_c(\mathbb{S}^+_k)$, then $p$ can be taken strictly smaller than $p_c(\mathbb{S}^+_k)$ in a manner that percolation still occurs.</description>

      <title>Perfect Sampling for Hard Spheres from Strong Spatial Mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a perfect sampling algorithm for the hard-sphere model on subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$ with expected running time linear in the volume under the assumption of strong spatial mixing. A large number of perfect and approximate sampling algorithms have been devised to sample from the hard-sphere model, and our perfect sampling algorithm is efficient for a range of parameters for which only efficient approximate samplers were previously known and is faster than these known approximate approaches. Our methods also extend to the more general setting of Gibbs point processes interacting via finite-range, repulsive potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Optimal Transport has been proposed as a probabilistic framework in Machine Learning for comparing and manipulating probability distributions. This is rooted in its rich history and theory, and has offered new solutions to different problems in machine learning, such as generative modeling and transfer learning. In this survey we explore contributions of Optimal Transport for Machine Learning over the period 2012 -- 2023, focusing on four sub-fields of Machine Learning: supervised, unsupervised, transfer and reinforcement learning. We further highlight the recent development in computational Optimal Transport and its extensions, such as partial, unbalanced, Gromov and Neural Optimal Transport, and its interplay with Machine Learning practice.</description>

      <title>Entrywise tensor-train approximation of large tensors via random embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of low-rank tensor-train approximation is well-understood when the approximation error is measured in the Frobenius norm. The entrywise maximum norm is equally important but is significantly weaker for large tensors, making the estimates obtained via the Frobenius norm and norm equivalence pessimistic or even meaningless. In this article, we derive a direct estimate of the entrywise approximation error that is applicable in some of these cases. The estimate is given in terms of the higher-order generalization of the matrix factorization norm, and its proof is based on the tensor-structured Hanson-Wright inequality. The theoretical results are accompanied with numerical experiments carried out with the method of alternating projections.</description>

      <title>Numerical method for nonlinear Kolmogorov PDEs via sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine nonlinear Kolmogorov partial differential equations (PDEs). Here the nonlinear part of the PDE comes from its Hamiltonian where one maximizes over all possible drift and diffusion coefficients which fall within a $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of pre-specified baseline coefficients. Our goal is to quantify and compute how sensitive those PDEs are to such a small nonlinearity, and then use the results to develop an efficient numerical method for their approximation. We show that as $\varepsilon\downarrow 0$, the nonlinear Kolmogorov PDE equals the linear Kolmogorov PDE defined with respect to the corresponding baseline coefficients plus $\varepsilon$ times a correction term which can be also characterized by the solution of another linear Kolmogorov PDE involving the baseline coefficients. As these linear Kolmogorov PDEs can be efficiently solved in high-dimensions by exploiting their Feynman-Kac representation, our derived sensitivity analysis then provides a Monte Carlo based numerical method which can efficiently solve these nonlinear Kolmogorov equations. We establish an error and complexity analysis for our numerical method. Moreover, we provide numerical examples in up to 100 dimensions to empirically demonstrate the applicability of our numerical method.</description>
