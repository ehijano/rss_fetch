      <title>Europa's H$_2$O$_2$: Temperature Insensitivity and a Correlation with CO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: H$_2$O$_2$ is part of Europa's water-ice radiolytic cycle and a potential source of oxidants to Europa's subsurface ocean. However, factors controlling the concentration of this critical surface species remain unclear. Though laboratory experiments suggest that Europa's H$_2$O$_2$ should be concentrated in the coldest, most ice-rich regions toward the poles, Keck adaptive optics observations have shown the strongest H$_2$O$_2$ signatures in comparatively warm, salt-bearing terrain at low latitudes. As a result, it was suggested that the local non-ice composition of these terrains -- particularly hypothesized enrichments of CO$_2$ -- may be a more dominant control on H$_2$O$_2$ than temperature or water-ice abundance. Here, we use observations of Europa from the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, Keck Observatory, and JWST to disentangle the potential effects of temperature and composition. In order to isolate the effect of temperature on Europa's H$_2$O$_2$, we use the ground-based observations to assess its response to temperature changes over timescales associated with Europa's daily eclipse and diurnal cycle. We use JWST Cycle 1 data to look for any geographic correlation between Europa's H$_2$O$_2$ and CO$_2$. Both changes in Europa's 3.5-$\mu$m H$_2$O$_2$ absorption band from pre to post eclipse and across a local day suggest minimal effects of the local temperature on these timescales. In contrast, the JWST observations show a strong positive correlation between Europa's H$_2$O$_2$ and CO$_2$ bands, supporting the previously suggested possibility that the presence of CO$_2$ in the ice may enhance H$_2$O$_2$ concentrations via electron-scavenging.</description>

      <title>\textit{Searching for GEMS:} Characterizing Six Giant Planets around Cool Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transiting giant exoplanets around M-dwarf stars (GEMS) are rare, owing to the low-mass host stars. However, the all-sky coverage of TESS has enabled the detection of an increasingly large number of them to enable statistical surveys like the \textit{Searching for GEMS} survey. As part of this endeavour, we describe the observations of six transiting giant planets, which includes precise mass measurements for two GEMS (K2-419Ab, TOI-6034b) and statistical validation for four systems, which includes validation and mass upper limits for three of them (TOI-5218b, TOI-5616b, TOI-5634Ab), while the fourth one -- TOI-5414b is classified as a `likely planet'. Our observations include radial velocities from the Habitable-zone Planet Finder on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope, and MAROON-X on Gemini-North, along with photometry and high-contrast imaging from multiple ground-based facilities. In addition to TESS photometry, K2-419Ab was also observed and statistically validated as part of the K2 mission in Campaigns 5 and 18, which provides precise orbital and planetary constraints despite the faint host star and long orbital period of $\sim 20.4$ days. With an equilibrium temperature of only 380 K, K2-419Ab is one of the coolest known well-characterized transiting planets. TOI-6034 has a late F-type companion about 40\arcsec~away, making it the first GEMS host star to have an earlier main-sequence binary companion. These confirmations add to the existing small sample of confirmed transiting GEMS.</description>

      <title>A synchronous moon as a possible cause of Mars' initial triaxiality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper addresses the possibility of a young Mars having had a massive moon, which synchronised the rotation of Mars, and gave Mars an initial asymmetric triaxiality to be later boosted by geological processes. It turns out that a moon of less than a third of the lunar mass was capable of producing a sufficient initial triaxiality. The asymmetry of the initial tidal shape of the equator depends on timing: the initial asymmetry is much stronger if the synchronous moon shows up already at the magma-ocean stage. From the moment of synchronisation of Mars' rotation with the moon's orbital motion, and until the moon was eliminated (as one possibility, by an impact in the beginning of the LHB), the moon was sustaining an early value of Mars' rotation rate.</description>

      <title>Planetary radio interferometry and Doppler experiment as an operational component of the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an overview of the operations and engineering interface for Planetary Radio Interferometry and Doppler Experiment (PRIDE) radio astronomy observations as a scientific component of the ESA s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) mission, as well as other prospective planetary and space science missions. The article discusses advanced scheduling and planning methods that make it possible to create observing schedules for observations of specific spacecraft in concurrence with observations of natural radio sources. In order to put this into practice and find suitable natural background calibrator sources for PRIDE of JUICE mission, we developed planning and scheduling software. The conventional scheduling software for natural celestial radio sources is not set up to include spacecraft as observation targets in the necessary control files. Therefore, difficulties already arise during observation planning. We report on the development of new and the adaptation of existing routines used in astrophysical and geodetic VLBI for satellite scheduling and planning. The analysis of the PRIDE science observations led to improved observational planning, and the mission s scheduling methodologies were studied using a systems engineering approach. In addition, we highlighted the new procedures, like finding charts for selecting calibrator radio sources over a range of frequency bands and the outcomes of those strategies for science operation planning. A simulation of the flyby of Venus during the cruise phase of the JUICE spacecraft, based on the Tudat software, is also presented, resulting in a promising opportunity to test PRIDE techniques and evaluate the improvements that PRIDE observables can make to natural bodies ephemerides.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Evolution of Lethal Non-Trackable Population and its Effect on LEO Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vast majority of the orbital population today is unobservable and untracked because of their small size. These lethal non-trackable objects will only become more numerous as more payloads and debris are launched into orbit and increase the collision rate. In this paper, the long-term effect of collisions is simulated with an efficient Monte-Carlo method to simulate the future LEO environment including lethal non-trackable objects, which is typically ignored due to the large computational resources required. The results show that simulations that do not incorporate lethal non-trackable debris would be omitting a large number of debilitating collisions with active payloads and catastrophic collisions to a smaller effect. This shows the importance of simulating small debris in the long-term evolution of the orbital population, which is often omitted in the literature. This increased debris population and consequentially the risk to orbital payloads diminishes as smaller lethal non-trackable objects are considered. An efficient and validated model is used to simulate these numerous small objects. Several future cases such as launches of registered megaconstellations, improved post-mission disposal rates and no-future launches are explored to understand the effect of the inclusion or exclusion of lethal non-trackable objects.</description>

      <title>No Thick Atmosphere on the Terrestrial Exoplanet Gl 486b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A primary science goal for JWST is to detect and characterize the atmospheres of terrestrial planets orbiting M dwarfs (M-Earths). The existence of atmospheres on M-Earths is highly uncertain because their host stars' extended history of high XUV irradiation may act to completely remove their atmospheres. We present two JWST secondary eclipse observations of the M-Earth Gl 486b (also known as GJ 486b) between 5-12 $\mu$m. We combined these observations with a precise analysis of the host star parameters to derive a planetary dayside temperature of $T_{p}=865 \pm 14$ K. We compared this temperature to the maximum expected temperature for a zero albedo, zero heat redistribution bare rock and derived a temperature ratio of $R=\frac{T_{p,dayside}}{T_{p,max}}=0.97 \pm 0.01$. This value is consistent with an airless body with a slight non-zero albedo or a thin atmosphere with $&lt;1$% H$_{2}$O or $&lt;1$ ppm CO$_{2}$. However, it is inconsistent with an Earth- or Venus-like atmosphere, and the spectrum shows no clear emission or absorption features. Additionally, our observations are inconsistent with the water-rich atmospheric scenario allowed by previous transit observations and suggest the transmission spectrum was instead shaped by stellar contamination (Moran et al. 2023). Given the potential for atmospheric escape throughout the system's $\geq6.6$-Gyr lifetime (Diamond-Lowe et al. 2024), we conclude that the observations are likely best explained by an airless planet. This result is the most precise measurement yet of terrestrial exoplanet thermal emission with JWST, which places a strong constraint on the position of the "Cosmic Shoreline" between airless bodies and those with atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Warm Jupiters around M-dwarfs are great opportunities for extensive chemical, cloud and haze characterisation with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The population of short-period giant exoplanets around M-dwarf stars is slowly rising. These planets present an extraordinary opportunity for atmospheric characterisation and defy our current understanding of planetary formation. Furthermore, clouds and hazes are ubiquitous in warm exoplanets but their behaviour is still poorly understood. We study the case of a standard warm Jupiter around a M-dwarf star to show the opportunity of this exoplanet population for atmospheric characterisation. We aim to derive the cloud, haze, and chemical budget of such planets using JWST. We leverage a 3D Global Climate Model, the generic PCM, to simulate the cloudy and cloud-free atmosphere of warm Jupiters around a M-dwarf. We then post-process our simulations to produce spectral phase curves and transit spectra as would be seen with JWST.We show that using the amplitude and offset of the spectral phase curves, we can directly infer the presence of clouds and hazes in the atmosphere of such giant planets. Chemical characterisation of multiple species is possible with an unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio, using the transit spectrum in one single visit. In such atmospheres, NH3 could be detected for the first time in a giant exoplanet. We make the case that these planets are key to understanding the cloud and haze budget in warm giants. Finally, such planets are targets of great interest for Ariel.</description>

      <title>Key Science Goals for the Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA): Update from the ngVLA Science Advisory Council (2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2017, the next generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) Science Advisory Council, together with the international astronomy community, developed a set of five Key Science Goals (KSGs) to inform, prioritize and refine the technical capabilities of a future radio telescope array for high angular resolution operation from 1.2 - 116 GHz with 10 times the sensitivity of the Jansky VLA and ALMA. The resulting KSGs, which require observations at centimeter and millimeter wavelengths that cannot be achieved by any other facility, represent a small subset of the broad range of astrophysical problems that the ngVLA will be able address. This document presents an update to the original ngVLA KSGs, taking account of new results and progress in the 7+ years since their initial presentation, again drawing on the expertise of the ngVLA Science Advisory Council and the broader community in the ngVLA Science Working Groups. As the design of the ngVLA has also matured substantially in this period, this document also briefly addresses initial expectations for ngVLA data products and processing that will be needed to achieve the KSGs. The original ngVLA KSGs endure as outstanding problems of high priority. In brief, they are: (1) Unveiling the Formation of Solar System Analogues; (2) Probing the Initial Conditions for Planetary Systems and Life with Astrochemistry; (3) Charting the Assembly, Structure, and Evolution of Galaxies from the First Billion Years to the Present; (4) Science at the Extremes: Pulsars as Laboratories for Fundamental Physics; (5) Understanding the Formation and Evolution of Stellar and Supermassive Black Holes in the Era of Multi-Messenger Astronomy.</description>

      <title>Interplanetary Causes and Impacts of the 2024 May Superstorm on the Geosphere: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent superstorm of 2024 May 10-11 is the second largest geomagnetic storm in the space age and the only one that has simultaneous interplanetary data (there were no interplanetary data for the 1989 March storm). The May superstorm was characterized by a sudden impulse (SI+) amplitude of +88 nT, followed by a three-step storm main phase development which had a total duration of ~9 hr. The cause of the first storm main phase with a peak SYM-H intensity of -183 nT was a fast forward interplanetary shock (magnetosonic Mach number Mms ~7.2) and an interplanetary sheath with southward interplanetary magnetic field component Bs of ~40 nT. The cause of the second storm main phase with a SYM-H intensity of -354 nT was a deepening of the sheath Bs to ~43 nT. A magnetosonic wave (Mms ~0.6) compressed the sheath to a high magnetic field strength of ~71 nT. Intensified Bs of ~48 nT was the cause of the third and most intense storm main phase with a SYM-H intensity of -518 nT. Three magnetic cloud events with Bs fields of ~25-40 nT occurred in the storm recovery phase, lengthening the recovery to ~2.8 days. At geosynchronous orbit, ~76 keV to ~1.5 MeV electrons exhibited ~1-3 orders of magnitude flux decreases following the shock/sheath impingement onto the magnetosphere. The cosmic ray decreases at Dome C, Antarctica (effective vertical cutoff rigidity &lt;0.01 GV) and Oulu, Finland (rigidity ~0.8 GV) were ~17% and ~11%, respectively relative to quite time values. Strong ionospheric current flows resulted in extreme geomagnetically induced currents of ~30-40 A in the sub-auroral region. The storm period is characterized by strong polar region field-aligned currents, with ~10 times intensification during the main phase, and equatorward expansion down to ~50 deg geomagnetic (altitude-adjusted) latitude.</description>

      <title>Systematic search for cool hypervelocity stars in multi-epoch WISE data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sixty years after the discovery of brown dwarfs, the search for these objects continues, particularly in the vicinity of the Sun. Objects near the Sun are characterized by large proper motions, making them seen as fast-moving objects. While the Gaia DR3 catalogue is a comprehensive source of proper motions, it lacks the depth needed for discovering fainter objects. Modern multi-epoch surveys, with their greater depth, offer a new opportunity for systematic search for ultra-cool dwarfs. The study aims to systematically search for high proper motion objects using the newly released catalogue of epochal WISE data in order to identify new brown dwarf candidates in the solar neighborhood, estimate their spectral types, distances and spatial velocities. We used recently released unTimely catalogue of epochal detections in unWISE coadds to search for objects with high proper motions using simple motion detection algorithm. This method was used to identify objects with proper motions exceeding approximately 0.6 arcseconds per year. The identified objects were then cross-referenced with data from other large-scale sky surveys to further analyze their characteristics. The search yielded 3245 moving objects with significant proper motions, 32 of which had not been previously published. Among these, at least 15 were identified as reliable new brown dwarf candidates, with estimated distances closer than 50 parsecs and spectral types later than T0.</description>

      <title>ALMA detection of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in the atmosphere of Saturn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.10474v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the planetary atmosphere, hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is an important nitrogen (N)-bearing molecule that plays a key role in the formation of several biomolecules via chain reactions. The presence of HCN characterizes the stratospheric composition of the solar gas planets and exoplanets. For several years, many observations have failed to identify the rotational and vibrational emission lines of HCN from the atmosphere of Saturn using ground- and space-based radio telescopes. We present the successful detection of the rotational emission line of HCN from the atmosphere of Saturn using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) band 7. We detected the J = 4$-$3 transition line of the HCN from the eastern and western limbs of Saturn with $\geq5\sigma$ statistical significance. The derived abundances of HCN in the western and eastern limbs are 6.19 ppb and 2.90 ppb, respectively. We claim that HCN is formed in the atmosphere of Saturn via the photolysis of methane (CH$_{4}$) and ammonia (NH$_{3}$).</description>

Abstract: With a dynamical mass of $3 \, M_\mathrm{Jup}$, the recently discovered giant planet AF Lep b is the lowest-mass imaged planet with a direct mass measurement. Its youth and spectral type near the L/T transition make it a promising target to study the impact of clouds and atmospheric chemistry at low surface gravities. In this work, we present JWST/NIRCam imaging of AF Lep b. Across two epochs, we detect AF Lep b in F444W ($4.4 \, \mathrm{\mu m}$) with S/N ratios of $9.6$ and $8.7$, respectively. At the planet's separation of $320 \, \mathrm{mas}$ during the observations, the coronagraphic throughput is ${\approx}7\%$, demonstrating that NIRCam's excellent sensitivity persists down to small separations. The F444W photometry of AF Lep b affirms the presence of disequilibrium carbon chemistry and enhanced atmospheric metallicity. These observations also place deep limits on wider-separation planets in the system, ruling out $1.1 \, M_\mathrm{Jup}$ planets beyond $15.6 \, \mathrm{au}$ ($0.58$ arcsec), $1.1 \, M_\mathrm{Sat}$ planets beyond $27 \, \mathrm{au}$ ($1$ arcsec), and $2.8 \, M_\mathrm{Nep}$ planets beyond $67 \, \mathrm{au}$ ($2.5$ arcsec). We also present new Keck/NIRC2 $L'$ imaging of AF Lep b; combining this with the two epochs of F444W photometry and previous Keck $L'$ photometry provides limits on the long-term $3{-}5 \, \mathrm{\mu m}$ variability of AF Lep b on months-to-years timescales. AF Lep b is the closest-separation planet imaged with JWST to date, demonstrating that planets can be recovered well inside the nominal (50\% throughput) NIRCam coronagraph inner working angle.</description>

      <title>Water Evolution &amp; Inventories of Super-Earths Orbiting Late M Dwarfs</title>

Abstract: Super-Earths orbiting M-dwarf stars may be the most common habitable planets in the Universe. However, their habitability is threatened by intense irradiation from their host stars, which drives the escape of water to space and can lead to surface desiccation. We present simulation results of a box model of water cycling between interior and atmosphere and loss to space, for terrestrial planets of mass 1--8 $M_\oplus$ orbiting in the habitable zone of a late M-dwarf. Energy-limited loss decreases with planetary mass, while diffusion-limited loss increases with mass. Depending on where it orbits in the habitable zone, a 1 $M_\oplus$ planet that starts with 3--8 Earth Oceans can end up with an Earth-like surface of oceans and exposed continents; for an 8 $M_\oplus$ super-Earth, that range is 3--12 Earth Oceans. Planets initialized with more water end up as waterworlds with no exposed continents, while planets that start with less water have desiccated surfaces by 5 Gyr. Since the mantles of terrestrial planets can hold much more water than is currently present in Earth's atmosphere, none of our simulations result in Dune planets -- such planets may be less common than previously thought. Further, more water becomes sequestered within the mantle for larger planets. A super-Earth at the inner edge of the habitable zone tends to end up as either a waterworld or with a desiccated surface; only a narrow range of initial water inventory yields an Earth-like surface.</description>

      <title>Accreting companion occurrence rates using a new method to compute emission-line survey sensitivity: Application to the H-alpha Giant Accreting Protoplanet Survey (GAPlanetS)</title>

Abstract: A key scientific goal of exoplanet surveys is to characterize the underlying population of planets in the local galaxy. In particular, the properties of accreting protoplanets can inform the rates and physical processes of planet formation. We develop a novel method to compute sensitivity to protoplanets in emission-line direct-imaging surveys, enabling estimates of protoplanet population properties under various planetary accretion and formation theories. In this work, we specialize to the case of H-alpha and investigate three formation models governing the planetary-mass-to-mass-accretion-rate power law, and two accretion models that describe the scaling between total accretion luminosity and observable H-alpha line luminosity. We apply our method to the results of the Magellan Giant Accreting Protoplanet Survey (GAPlanetS) to place the first constraints on accreting companion occurrence rates in systems with transitional circumstellar disks. We compute the posterior probability for transitional disk systems to host an accreting companion (-8&lt; log MMdot MJ^2/yr &lt; -2) within 2 arcseconds (~200 au). Across accretion models, we find consistent accreting companion rates, with median and one-sigma credible intervals of 0.15 (+0.18, -0.10) and 0.19 (+0.23, -0.12). Our technique enables studying protoplanet populations under flexible assumptions about planet formation. This formalism provides the statistical underpinning necessary for protoplanet surveys to discriminate among formation and accretion theories for planets and brown dwarfs.</description>
