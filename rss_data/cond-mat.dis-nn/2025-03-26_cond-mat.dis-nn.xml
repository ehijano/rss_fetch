      <title>Life at the Boundary of Chemical Kinetics and Program Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a generic quantitative framework for studying dynamical processes that involve interactions of polymer sequences. Possible applications range from quantitative studies of the reaction kinetics of polymerization processes to explorations of the behavior of chemical implementations of computational -- including basic life-like -- processes. This way, we establish a bridge between thermodynamic and computational aspects of systems that are defined in terms of sequence interactions. As by-products of these investigations, we clarify some common confusion around the notion of ``autocatalysis'' and show quantitatively how a chemically implemented Turing machine can operate close to the Landauer bound.
  Using a Markov process model of polymer sequence composition and dynamical evolution of the Markov process's parameters via an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that arises when taking the double ``chemical'' many-particle limit as well as ``rarefied interactions'' limit, this approach enables -- for example -- accurate quantitative explorations of entropy generation in systems where computation is driven by relaxation to thermodynamic equilibrium. The computational framework internally utilizes the Scheme programming language's intrinsic continuation mechanisms to provide nondeterministic evaluation primitives that allow the user to specify example systems in straight purely functional code, making exploration of all possible relevant sequence composition constellations -- which would be otherwise tedious to write code for -- automatic and hidden from the user.
  A collection of fully worked out examples elucidate how this modeling approach is quantitatively related to both exact and approximate analytic approaches. These examples can also serve as starting points for further explorations.</description>

      <title>Topological effect on order-disorder transitions in U(1) sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: U(1) non-linear sigma models (NLSM) with a one-dimensional (1D) Berry phase are studied by a renormalization group theory. Order-disorder transition in U(1) NLSMs in $D \!\ (\ge 2)$-dimensional space ($d+1$-dimensional spacetime; $d\ge 1$) is instigated by the proliferation of vortex excitations, where the 1D Berry phase term confers finite phase factors upon those vortex excitations with finite projection in a subspace complementary to a topological direction with the 1D Berry phase. A destructive interference effect caused by the phase factors may help to develop an intermediate quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases, which has a divergent order-parameter correlation length along the topological direction, and a finite correlation length along the other directions. In order to explore such a possibility in $D=3$, we develop a perturbative renormalization group theory of a 3D model of vortex loops, in which loop segments interact via a $1/r$ Coulomb interaction. We derive renormalization group (RG) equations among vortex-loop fugacity, Berry phase term, and the Coulomb potential. Approximate analyses of the RG equations show that near an order-disorder transition point, vortex loops are anomalously elongated along the topological direction. Utilizing a duality mapping to a lattice model of a type-II superconductor under a magnetic field, we also argue that a global phase diagram of the 3D U(1) sigma model with 1D Berry phase must have the quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases.</description>

      <title>Relevance of spatial quenched disorder in the Diffusive Epidemic Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffusive epidemic process is an example of reaction-diffusion system where diffusion constants of healthy and infected particles determine the universality class of the absorbing phase transition. Introducing spatial quenched disorder in the contamination rates and the diffusion rates of each species leads to a rich phase diagram depending on the disorder distribution. Particularly, signature of different infinite disorder fixed points and lack of active phase are reported. The relevance of disorder is correctly predicted by the Harris criterion in light of the effective macroscopic diffusion rates. However, the effective disorder strength depends on which diffusion rate heterogeneities are introduced.</description>

      <title>Emergence of distinct exact mobility edges in a quasiperiodic chain</title>

Abstract: Mobility edges (MEs) constitute the energies separating the localized states from the extended ones in disordered systems. Going beyond this conventional definition, recent proposal suggests for an ME which separates the localized and multifractal states in certain quasiperiodic systems - dubbed as the anomalous mobility edges (AMEs). In this study, we propose an exactly solvable quasiperiodic system that hosts both the conventional and anomalous mobility edges under proper conditions. We show that with increase in quasiperiodic disorder strength, the system first undergoes a delocalization to localization transition through an ME of conventional type. Surprisingly, with further increase in disorder, we obtain that a major fraction of the localized states at the middle of the spectrum turn multifractal in nature. Such unconventional behavior in the spectrum results in two AMEs, which continue to exist even for stronger quasiperiodic disorder. We numerically obtain the signatures of the coexisting MEs complement it through analytical derivation using Avila's global theory. In the end we provide important signatures from the wavepacket dynamics.</description>

      <title>Exact quantum critical states with a superconducting quantum processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization physics features three fundamental types of eigenstates: extended, localized, and critical. Confirming the presence of critical states necessitates either advancing the analysis to the thermodynamic limit or identifying a universal mechanism which can rigorously determine these states. Here we report the unambiguous experimental realization of critical states, governed by a rigorous mechanism for exact quantum critical states, and further observe a generalized mechanism that quasiperiodic zeros in hopping couplings protect the critical states. Leveraging a superconducting quantum processor with up to 56 qubits, we implement a programmable mosaic model with tunable couplings and on-site potentials. By measuring time-evolved observables, we identify both delocalized dynamics and incommensurately distributed zeros in the couplings, which are the defining features of the critical states. We map the localized-to-critical phase transition and demonstrate that critical states persist until quasiperiodic zeros are removed by strong long-range couplings, highlighting a novel generalized mechanism discovered in this experiment and shown with rigorous theory. Finally, we resolve the energy-dependent transition between localized and critical states, revealing the presence of anomalous mobility edges.</description>

      <title>Communities in the Kuramoto Model: Dynamics and Detection via Path Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The behavior of multivariate dynamical processes is often governed by underlying structural connections that relate the components of the system. For example, brain activity which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges represent cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and, in particular, can be used to compute the lead matrix which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto stochastic block model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.</description>
