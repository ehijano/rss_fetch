      <title>Unveiling Mysteries of GdRu$_2$Si$_2$: The Impact of Interlayer Coupling on The Magnetic Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ has recently drawn significant attention as a centrosymmetric magnet capable of hosting a short period skyrmion square lattice (SkL) in the absence of Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction (DMI). In this system, Gd atoms are arranged on a square lattice forming 2D layers separated by the Ru-Si network in the out-of-plane direction. In the low T regime, the ground state for zero/smaller external magnetic field ($\vec{B}_\perp$) along the out-of-plane direction is a single helical state, characterized by one modulation vector $\vec{Q}$ along one of the in-plane directions of the square lattice. For some critical range of higher $\vec{B}_\perp$, the helical state transforms into a SkL state that can be viewed as the overlap of two helical states defined with $\vec{Q}$ vectors in two in-plane directions, with the same magnitude of $\vec{Q}$ as for the single helical state. So far in the literature, importance has been given to this in-plane $\vec{Q}$ vector in understanding the magnetic phases of the system, considering the out-of-plane magnetic coupling to be weak, which therefore has been ignored. Our calculation of the Gd-Gd magnetic exchange interactions ($J_{ij}$) however shows the strongest $J_{ij}$ to occur between second neighbour Gd atoms along the [111] body-diagonal direction of the unit cell. This along with the body-centred tetragonal structure of the Gd sublattice points to the presence of a hitherto ignored modulation vector, $\vec{Q}_{[111]}$, along the [111] direction in the helical ground state. Atomistic Spin Dynamics (ASD) simulations show the importance of this interaction. This interlayer modulation vector $\vec{Q}_{[111]}$, along with the intralayer $\vec{Q}_{[100]}$, determines the total magnetic ordering of the system. Our data shows that the magnetic phases in GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ are far more complex than what has been previously discussed.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Crystal Properties and Defects in CdZnTe Radiation Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CdZnTe-based detectors are highly valued because of their high spectral resolution, which is an essential feature for nuclear medical imaging. However, this resolution is compromised when there are substantial defects in the CdZnTe crystals. In this study, we present a learning-based approach to determine the spatially dependent bulk properties and defects in semiconductor detectors. This characterization allows us to mitigate and compensate for the undesired effects caused by crystal impurities. We tested our model with computer-generated noise-free input data, where it showed excellent accuracy, achieving an average RMSE of 0.43% between the predicted and the ground truth crystal properties. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the effect of noisy data on the accuracy of the model.</description>

      <title>Flexible Trilayer Cellulosic Paper Separators engineered with BaTiO$_3$ ferroelectric fillers for High Energy Density Sodium-ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design a full cell configuration having Na$_{3}$V$_{2}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{3}$ as cathode and pre-sodiated hard carbon as an anode with Cellulosic Paper Separators and compare the electrochemical performance of these ceramic-impregnated polymer-coated cellulose paper separators with commercial glass fiber separator. Notably, the paper-based multilayer separators provide desirable characteristics such as excellent electrolyte wettability, thermal stability up to 200\degree C, and ionic conductivity, which are essential for the efficient operation of SIBs. The cellulose separator is coated by a layer of polyvinylidene fluoride polymer, followed by a second layer of styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) polymer in which ferroelectric fillers BaTiO$_{3}$ are integrated, which interacts with the polymer hosts through Lewis acid-base interactions ion and improves the conduction mechanism for the Na$^{+}$ ions. The final lamination is performed by varying the SBR concentrations (0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 w/v\%). The incorporated polymer matrices improve the flexibility, adhesion and dispersion of the nanoparticles and affinity of the electrolyte to the electrode. The morphology of the paper separators shows the uniform interconnected fibers with the porous structure. Interestingly, we find that the paper separator with 0.75 w/v\% content of SBR exhibit decreased interfacial resistance and improved electrochemical performance, having retention of 62\% and nearly 100\% Coulombic efficiency up to 240 cycles, as compared to other concentrations. Moreover, we observe the energy density around 376 Wh kg$^{-1}$ (considering cathode weight), which found to be comparable to the commercially available glass fiber separator. Our results demonstrate the potential of these multilayer paper separators towards achieving sustainability and safety in energy storage systems.</description>

      <title>Generative Hierarchical Materials Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models trained at scale can now produce text, video, and more recently, scientific data such as crystal structures. In applications of generative approaches to materials science, and in particular to crystal structures, the guidance from the domain expert in the form of high-level instructions can be essential for an automated system to output candidate crystals that are viable for downstream research. In this work, we formulate end-to-end language-to-structure generation as a multi-objective optimization problem, and propose Generative Hierarchical Materials Search (GenMS) for controllable generation of crystal structures. GenMS consists of (1) a language model that takes high-level natural language as input and generates intermediate textual information about a crystal (e.g., chemical formulae), and (2) a diffusion model that takes intermediate information as input and generates low-level continuous value crystal structures. GenMS additionally uses a graph neural network to predict properties (e.g., formation energy) from the generated crystal structures. During inference, GenMS leverages all three components to conduct a forward tree search over the space of possible structures. Experiments show that GenMS outperforms other alternatives of directly using language models to generate structures both in satisfying user request and in generating low-energy structures. We confirm that GenMS is able to generate common crystal structures such as double perovskites, or spinels, solely from natural language input, and hence can form the foundation for more complex structure generation in near future.</description>

      <title>A general method for calibration of active scanning thermal probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) is a scanning probe technique aimed at quantitative characterization of local thermal properties at the length scale down to tens of nanometers. With many probe designs and approaches to interpretation of probe responses, there is a need for a universal framework, which would allow probe calibration and comparison of probe performance. Here, we have developed a calibration framework based on an abstracted, formal, probe model for active SThM probes. The calibration can be accomplished through measurements with two or three calibration samples. Requirements to calibration samples are described with examples of structures of suitable samples identified in published literature. A link to a published experimental work indirectly verifying the proposed procedure is provided. The calibration does not require knowledge of internal probe properties and yields a small and universal set of parameters that can be used to quantify thermal resistance presented to the probe by samples as well as to characterize active-mode SThM probes of any type and at any measurement frequency. We have illustrated how the probe calibration parameters can be used to guide probe design. We have also analyzed when the calibration approach can be used directly to measure thermal conductivity of unknown samples.</description>

      <title>Realization of giant elastocaloric cooling at cryogenic temperatures in TmVO$_4$ via a strain load/unload technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adiabatic elastocaloric effect relates changes in the strain that a material experiences to resulting changes in its temperature. While elastocaloric materials have been utilized for cooling in room temperature applications, the use of such materials for cryogenic cooling remains relatively unexplored. Here, we use a strain load/unload technique at low temperatures, similar to those employed at room-temperature, to demonstrate a large cooling effect in TmVO$_4$. For strain changes of $1.8 \cdot 10^{-3}$, the inferred cooling reaches approximately 50% of the material's starting temperature at 5 K, justifying the moniker "giant". Beyond establishing the suitability of this class of material for cryogenic elastocaloric cooling, these measurements also provide additional insight to the entropy landscape in the material as a function of strain and temperature, including the behavior proximate to the quadrupolar phase transition.</description>

      <title>Voltage Mining for (De)lithiation-stabilized Cathodes and a Machine Learning Model for Li-ion Cathode Voltage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in lithium-metal anodes have inspired interest in discovery of Li-free cathodes, most of which are natively found in their charged state. This is in contrast to today's commercial lithium-ion battery cathodes, which are more stable in their discharged state. In this study, we combine calculated cathode voltage information from both categories of cathode materials, covering 5577 and 2423 total unique structure pairs, respectively. The resulting voltage distributions with respect to the redox pairs and anion types for both classes of compounds emphasize design principles for high-voltage cathodes, which favor later Period 4 transition metals in their higher oxidation states and more electronegative anions like fluorine or polyaion groups. Generally, cathodes that are found in their charged, delithiated state are shown to exhibit voltages lower than those that are most stable in their lithiated state, in agreement with thermodynamic expectations. Deviations from this trend are found to originate from different anion distributions between redox pairs. In addition, a machine learning model for voltage prediction based on chemical formulae is constructed, and shows state-of-the-art performance when compared to two established composition-based ML models for materials properties predictions, Roost and CrabNet.</description>

      <title>Sub-nanometer-thick native sp2 carbon on oxidized diamond surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxygen-terminated diamond has a wide breadth of applications, which include stabilizing near-surface color centers, semiconductor devices, and biological sensors. Despite the vast literature on characterizing functionalization groups on diamond, the chemical composition on the shallowest portion of the surface (&lt; 1 nm) is challenging to probe with conventional techniques like XPS and FTIR. In this work, we demonstrate the use of angle-resolved XPS to probe the first ten nanometers of (100) single-crystalline diamond, showing the changes of the oxygen functional groups and the allotropes of carbon with respect to depth. With the use of consistent peak-fitting methods, the peak identities and relative peak binding energies were identified for sp2 carbon, ether, hydroxyl, carbonyl, and C-H groups. For the oxygen-terminated sample, we also quantified the thickness of the sp2 carbon layer situated on top of the bulk sp3 diamond bonded carbon to be 0.4 $\pm$ 0.1 nm, based on the analysis of the Auger electron spectra and D-parameter calculations. These results indicate that the majority of the oxygen is bonded to the sp2 carbon layer on the diamond, and not directly on the sp3 diamond bonded carbon.</description>

      <title>General Stacking Theory for Altermagnetism in Bilayer Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetism was recently proposed to be attainable in twisted antiferromagnetic bilayers providing an experimentally feasible approach to realize it in 2D materials. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism governing the appearance of altermagnetism in bilayer systems is still absent. In present letter, we address this gap by introducing a general stacking theory (GST) as a key condition for the emergence of altermagnetism in bilayer systems. The GST provides straightforward criteria to predict whether a bilayer demonstrates altermagnetic spin splitting, solely based on the layer groups of the composing monolayers. According to the GST, only seven point groups of bilayers facilitate the emergence of altermagnetism. It is revealed that, beyond the previously proposed antiferromagnetic twisted vdW stacking, altermagnetism can even emerge in bilayers formed through the symmetrically restricted direct stacking of two monolayers. By combining the GST and first-principles calculations, we present illustrative examples of bilayers demonstrating altermagnetism. Our work establishes a robust framework for designing diverse bilayer systems with altermagnetism, thereby opening up new avenues for both fundamental research and practical applications in this field.</description>

      <title>Comparison of intermediate-range order in GeO$_2$ glass: molecular dynamics using machine-learning interatomic potential vs.\ reverse Monte Carlo fitting to experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The short and intermediate-range order in GeO$_2$ glass are investigated by molecular dynamics using machine-learning interatomic potential trained on ab initio calculation data and compared with reverse Monte Carlo fitting of neutron diffraction data. To characterize the structural differences in each model, the total/partial structure factors, coordination number, ring size and shape distributions, and persistent homology analysis were performed. These results show that although the two approaches yield similar two-body correlations, they can lead to three-dimensional models with very different short and intermediate-range ordering. A clear difference was observed especially in the ring distributions; RMC models exhibit a broad distribution in the ring size distribution, while neural network potential molecular dynamics yield much narrower ring distributions. This confirms that the density functional approximation in the ab initio calculations determines the preferred network assembly more strictly than RMC with simple coordination constraints and neutron diffraction data with isotope substitution.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Implantation Damage and Point Defects with Multislice Electron Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion implantation is widely used to dope semiconductors for electronic device fabrication, but techniques to quantify point defects and induced damage are limited. While several techniques can measure dopant concentration profiles with high accuracy, none allow for simultaneous atomic resolution structural analysis. Here, we use multislice electron ptychography to quantify the damage induced by erbium implantation in a wide band gap semiconductor 4H-SiC over a 1,000 nm\textsuperscript{3} volume region. This damage extends further into the sample than expected from implantation simulations that do not consider crystallography. Further, the technique's sensitivity to dopants and vacancies is evaluated as a function of damage. As each reconstructed analysis volume contains approximately 10$^5$ atoms, sensitivity of 10\textsuperscript{18} cm\textsuperscript{-3} (in the order of 10 ppm) is demonstrated in the implantation tail region. After point defect identification, the local distortions surrounding \ch{Er_{Si}} and \ch{v_{Si}} defects are quantified. These results underscore the power of multislice electron ptychography to enable the investigation of point defects as a tool to guide the fabrication of future electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e exciton polaron engineering via twisted hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted hexagonal boron nitride (thBN) exhibits emergent ferroelectricity due to the formation of moir\'e superlattices with alternating AB and BA domains. These domains possess electric dipoles, leading to a periodic electrostatic potential that can be imprinted onto other 2D materials placed in its proximity. Here we demonstrate the remote imprinting of moir\'e patterns from twisted hexagonal boron nitride (thBN) onto monolayer MoSe2 and investigate the resulting changes in the exciton properties. We confirm the imprinting of moir\'e patterns on monolayer MoSe2 via proximity using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and hyperspectral photoluminescence (PL) mapping. By developing a technique to create large ferroelectric domain sizes ranging from 1 {\mu}m to 8.7 {\mu}m, we achieve unprecedented potential modulation of 387 +- 52 meV. We observe the formation of exciton polarons due to charge redistribution caused by the antiferroelectric moir\'e domains and investigate the optical property changes induced by the moir\'e pattern in monolayer MoSe2 by varying the moir\'e pattern size down to 110 nm. Our findings highlight the potential of twisted hBN as a platform for controlling the optical and electronic properties of 2D materials for optoelectronic and valleytronic applications.</description>

      <title>Combining Brillouin spectroscopy and machine learned interatomic potentials to probe mechanical properties of metal organic frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are of high fundamental and also practical relevance. A particularly intriguing technique for determining anisotropic elastic tensors is Brillouin scattering, which so far has rarely been used for highly complex materials like MOFs. In the present contribution, we apply this technique to study a newly synthesized MOF-type material, referred to as GUT2. We show that when combining the experiments with state-of-the-art simulations of elastic properties and phonon bands (based on machine-learned force fields and dispersion-corrected density-functional theory). This provides a comprehensive understanding of the experimental signals, which are correlated with the longitudinal and transverse sound velocities. Moreover, even when dealing with comparably small single crystals, which limit the range of accessible experimental data, combining the insights from simulations and experiments allows the determination of approximate values for the components of the elastic tensor of the studied material.</description>

      <title>Magnetic hardness of hexagonal and orthorhombic Fe$_{3}$C, Co$_{3}$C, (Fe-Co)$_{3}$C, and their alloys with boron, nitrogen, and transition metals: A first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we considered a large set of materials that are closely related to orthorhombic Fe$_3$C (cementite) with the aim of characterizing trends in their intrinsic magnetic properties and identifying alloys that are optimal for applications. A comprehensive analysis was conducted on the full concentration ranges of hexagonal ($\epsilon$) and orthorhombic ($\theta$) phases of (Fe-Co)$_3$C, (Fe-Co)$_3$(B-C), (Fe-Co)$_3$(C-N), and their alloys with 3$d$, 4$d$ and 5$d$ transition metals. The calculations were performed using the density functional theory implemented in the full-potential local-orbital code (FPLO). Calculated properties included formation energies, Curie temperatures, magnetic moments, magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies (MAE), and magnetic hardnesses. The considered compositions exhibit a range of magnetic properties, including soft, semi-hard, and hard magnetic. The materials most promising for hard-magnetic applications are orthorhombic Co$_3$C compound, together with selected Co-rich orthorhombic (Fe,Co)$_3$C and hexagonal (Fe,Co)$_3$C alloys. The calculation results do not indicate that substituting with transition metals increases the potential of the alloys for permanent magnet applications. A significant drawback of alloying orthorhombic $\theta$-Fe$_3$C (cementite) with transition metals is the notable decline in the Curie temperature. We found that a considerable proportion of the orthorhombic Co$_3$(B-C-N) alloys are magnetically hard, of which boron substitution raises the Curie temperature and improves stability. By mapping the dependence of MAE on the concentration of elements covering both the 3$d$ (from Fe to Co) and 2$p$ (from B, through C, to N) positions, we have demonstrated for the first time the near isoelectronic nature of MAE. The latter observation may be particularly useful in designing compositions of new magnetically hard materials.</description>

      <title>A Boltzmann statistical approach for the analysis of polarization states in mixed phase ferroelectric materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectrics are widely used for a broad array of technological applications due to their attractive electrical and electromechanical properties. In order to obtain large functional properties, material compositions are often designed to favor a coexistence of multiple ferroelectric phases. For such compositions, the macroscopically observed enhanced properties are variously attributed to easier domain switching and/or phase transition. Nevertheless, modelling of concurrent domain switching and phase transition in mixed phase ferroelectrics remains a challenging task. Here, a methodology is presented to quantitatively evaluate the volume fractions of different domain variants in a mixed phase ferroelectric under complex electromechanical loading. The methodology combines the phenomenology of Landau free energy of ferroelectric phases with Boltzmann statistical analysis, and is presented for Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 near morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). It is shown that specific grain orientation has a significant effect on how proximity to phase boundary affects microscopic phenomena, and consequently functional responses.</description>

      <title>Sub-cycle Nanotip Field Emission of Electrons Driven by Air Plasma Generated THz Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz pulses generated by two-color laser plasmas have reported peak field strengths exceeding MV/cm, and when illuminating metal nanotips the near-field enhancement at the tip apex should result in extremely high bunch charges and electron energies via sub-cycle cold field emission. Here, electron emission from tungsten nanotips driven by THz pulses generated by a long filament air-plasma are reported. Electron energies up to 1.1 keV and bunch charges up to 2x$10^5$ electrons per pulse were detected, well below values expected for peak field calculated via the time averaged Poynting vector. Investigations revealed a failure in the use of the time-averaged Poynting vector when applied to long filament THz pulses, due to spatio-temporal restructuring of the THz pulse in the focus. Accounting for this restructuring significantly reduces the field strength to approximately 160 ~kV/cm, consistent with the observed electron bunch charges, peak energies and their dependence on the tip position in the THz focus. Despite these findings, our results surpass previous THz plasma-driven electron generation by an order of magnitude in both electron energy and bunch charge and a path to increasing these by an additional order of magnitude by modification of the THz optics is proposed.</description>

      <title>Switchable Crystalline Islands in Super Lubricant Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expanding the performance of field effect devices is a key challenge of the ever-growing chip industry at the core of current technologies. A highly desired nonvolatile response in tiny multiferroic transistors is expected by electric field control of atomic movements rather than the typical electronic redistribution. Recently, such field effect control of structural transitions was established in commensurate stacking configurations of honeycomb van der Waals (vdW) polytypes by sliding narrow boundary dislocations between oppositely polarized domains. The interfacial ferroelectric response, however, relied on preexisting boundary strips between relatively large micron-scale domains, severely limiting practical implementations. Here, we report the robust switching of single-domain polytypes in nm-scale islands embedded in super lubricant vdW arrays. We etch cavities into a thin layered spacer and then encapsulate it with parallel functional flakes. The incommensurate flakes above and under the spacer sag and touch at each cavity to form uniform crystalline islands free from interlayer deformations. By imaging the polytypes' ferroelectric response, we observe reversible nucleation and annihilation of boundary strips and geometry-adaptable hysteresis loops. Using mechanical stress, we accurately position the boundary strip, modify the interlayer twist angle, and nucleate intermediate polar domain patterns. By precisely designing the size, shape, symmetry, and distribution of the islands in these Super Lubricant Arrays of Polytype (SLAP), we envision numerous device functionalities and SlideTronics applications. These range from ultra-sensitive detectors of atomic-scale shifts to nonvolatile multi-ferroic tunneling transistors with tunable coercive switching fields, and even elastically-coupled memory cells for neuromorphic architectures.</description>

      <title>Excitonic signatures of ferroelectric order in parallel-stacked MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacial ferroelectricity, prevalent in various parallel-stacked layered materials, allows switching of out-of-plane ferroelectric order by in-plane sliding of adjacent layers. Its resilience against doping potentially enables next-generation storage and logic devices. However, studies have been limited to indirect sensing or visualization of ferroelectricity. For transition metal dichalcogenides, there is little knowledge about the influence of ferroelectric order on their intrinsic valley and excitonic properties. Here, we report direct probing of ferroelectricity in few-layer 3R-MoS$_2$ using reflectance contrast spectroscopy. Contrary to a simple electrostatic perception, layer-hybridized excitons with out-of-plane electric dipole moment remain decoupled from ferroelectric ordering, while intralayer excitons with in-plane dipole orientation are sensitive to it. Ab initio calculations identify stacking-specific interlayer hybridization leading to this asymmetric response. Exploiting this sensitivity, we demonstrate optical readout and control of multi-state polarization with hysteretic switching in a field-effect device. Time-resolved Kerr ellipticity reveals a direct correspondence between spin-valley dynamics and stacking order.</description>

      <title>Water Desalination by Ferroelectric Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental aspect of physics of ferroelectric materials is the screening of uncompensated bound charges by the dissociative adsorption of ionic charges from the environment. The adsorption of ions can be especially strong when the ferroelectric undergoes the temperature induced transition from the paraelectric phase to the ferroelectric state. Here we demonstrate that the adsorption of ions and free radicals by the polar surface of ferroelectric nanoparticles can be very efficient in aqueous solutions due to the strong ferro-ionic coupling in the nanoparticles. Obtained results can be useful for the elaboration of alternative methods and tools for adsorption of the cations (Li+, K+, Na+, etc.), anions (Cl-, Br-, J-), and/or free radicals (CO-, NH4+, etc.) from aqueous solutions by the lead-free uniaxial ferroelectric nanoparticles. The results may become an alternative way for the environment-friendly cleaning of different aqueous solutions from ionic contamination as well as for the desalination of sea water using the natural temperature variations.</description>

      <title>Topological and Magnetic Properties of a Non-collinear Spin State on a Honeycomb Lattice in a Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Berry curvature and Chern number of a non-collinear spin state on a honeycomb lattice that evolves from coplanar to ferromagnetic with a magnetic field applied along the $z$ axis. The coplanar state is stabilized by nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic interactions, single-ion anisotropy along $z$, and Dzyalloshinskii-Moriya interactions between next-nearest neighbor sites. Below the critical field $H_c$ that aligns the spins, the magnetic unit cell contains $M=6$ sites and the spin dynamics contains six magnon subbands. Although the classical energy is degenerate wrt the twist angle $\phi $ between nearest-neighbor spins, the dependence of the free energy on $\phi $ at low temperatures is dominated by the magnon zero-point energy, which contains extremum at $\phi =\pi l/3$ for integer $l$. The only unique ground states GS($\phi )$ have $l=0$ or 1. For $H &lt; H_c'$, the zero-point energy has minima at even $l$ and the ground state is GS(0). For $H_c' &lt; H &lt; H_c$, the zero-point energy has minima at odd $l$ and the ground state is GS($\pi/3$). In GS(0), the magnon density-of-states exhibits five distinct phases with increasing field associated with the opening and closing of energy gaps between the two or three magnonic bands, each containing between 1 and 4 four magnon subbands. While the Berry curvature vanishes for the coplanar $\phi=0$ phase in zero field, the Berry curvature and Chern numbers exhibit signatures of the five phases at nonzero fields below $H_c'$. If $\phi \ne \pi l/3$, the Chern numbers of the two or three magnonic bands are non-integer. We also evaluate the inelastic neutron-scattering spectrum $S(\vk ,\omega )$ produced by the six magnon subbands in all five phases of GS(0) and in GS($\pi/3$).</description>

      <title>Development of an embedded-atom method potential of Ni-Mo alloys for electrocatalysis / surface compositional studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ni-Mo superalloys have emerged as materials of choice for a diverse array of applications owing to their superior mechanical properties, exceptional corrosion and oxidation resistance, electrocatalytic behavior, and surface stability. Understanding and optimizing the surface composition of Ni-Mo alloys is critical for enhancing their performance in practical applications. Traditional experimental surface analysis techniques, while informative, are often prohibitive in terms of cost and time. Likewise, theoretical approaches such as first-principle calculations demand substantial computational resources and it is difficult to simulate large structures. This study introduces an alternative approach utilizing hybrid Monte-Carlo / Molecular Dynamics (MC/MD) simulations to investigate the surface composition of Ni-Mo alloys. We report the development of an optimized Embedded-Atom Method (EAM) potential specifically for Ni-Mo alloys, carefully parameterized using empirical lattice constants and formation energies of elemental and face-centered cubic (FCC) Ni-Mo solid solution alloys. The reliability of the EAM potential is corroborated via the evaluation of equations of state, with a particular focus on reproducing structural properties. Utilizing this validated potential, MC/MD simulations were performed to understand the depth-wise variations in the compositions of Ni-Mo alloy nanoparticles and extended surfaces. These simulations reveal a preferential segregation of nickel on surface, and molybdenum in sub-surface layer. Due to this preferential segregation, it is imperative to consider surface segregation while tailoring the surface properties for targeted applications.</description>

      <title>A 2D T-carbon 2-(111) structure with tunable electric and optical properties via chemical decorations: a first-principles investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We proposed a new two-dimensional carbon material named 2-(111) planar T-carbon, which is obtained by slicing bulk T-carbon along its (111) crystallographic direction. 2-(111) planar T-carbon's optical and electrical properties can be engineered via surface decoration. Comparing the DFT phonon spectra of pristine and five decorated 2-(111) planar T-carbon obtained by first-principles calculations, we conclude that surface decoration presents a promising, effective, and feasible strategy to improve the structural stability of 2-(111) planar T-carbon. The calculated band structures and electronic properties show direct electronic band gap values between 0.17 eV (-O= decorated) and 2.21 eV (Hydrogenated). Chemical decoration also promises blue or red energy shifts in its optical properties.</description>

      <title>Twin branching in shape memory alloys: a 1D continuum model with energy dissipation effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a 1D continuum model of twin branching in shape memory alloys. The free energy of the branched microstructure comprises the interfacial and elastic strain energy contributions, both expressed in terms of the average twin spacing treated as a continuous function of the position. The total free energy is then minimized, and the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation is solved numerically using the finite element method. The model can be considered as a continuum counterpart of the recent discrete model of Seiner et al. (2020), and our results show a very good agreement with that model in the entire range of physically relevant parameters. Furthermore, our continuum setting facilitates incorporation of energy dissipation into the model. The effect of rate-independent dissipation on the evolution of the branched microstructure is thus studied. The results show that significant effects on the microstructure and energy of the system are expected only for relatively small domain sizes.</description>

Abstract: Although plasmons and phonons are the collective excitations that govern the low-energy physics of doped semiconductors, their nonadiabatic hybridization and mutual screening have not been studied from first principles. We achieve this goal by transforming the Dyson equation to the frequency-independent dynamical matrix of an equivalent damped oscillator. Calculations on doped GaAs and TiO2 agree well with available Raman data and await immediate experimental confirmation from infrared, neutron, electron-energy-loss, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic phonons in piezoelectric materials strongly couple to electrons through a macroscopic electric field. We show that this coupling leads to a momentum-dependent divergence of the Fan-Migdal electron linewidth. We then develop a self-consistent theory for calculating electron linewidths, which not only removes this piezoelectric divergence but also considerably modifies the linewidth in nonpiezoelectric, polar materials. Our predictions await immediate experimental confirmation, and this self-consistent method should be broadly used in interpreting various experiments on the electronic properties of real materials.</description>

      <title>Data-efficient and Interpretable Inverse Materials Design using a Disentangled Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse materials design has proven successful in accelerating novel material discovery. Many inverse materials design methods use unsupervised learning where a latent space is learned to offer a compact description of materials representations. A latent space learned this way is likely to be entangled, in terms of the target property and other properties of the materials. This makes the inverse design process ambiguous. Here, we present a semi-supervised learning approach based on a disentangled variational autoencoder to learn a probabilistic relationship between features, latent variables and target properties. This approach is data efficient because it combines all labelled and unlabelled data in a coherent manner, and it uses expert-informed prior distributions to improve model robustness even with limited labelled data. It is in essence interpretable, as the learnable target property is disentangled out of the other properties of the materials, and an extra layer of interpretability can be provided by a post-hoc analysis of the classification head of the model. We demonstrate this new approach on an experimental high-entropy alloy dataset with chemical compositions as input and single-phase formation as the single target property. While single property is used in this work, the disentangled model can be extended to customize for inverse design of materials with multiple target properties.</description>

      <title>Beyond designer's knowledge: Generating materials design hypotheses via large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials design often relies on human-generated hypotheses, a process inherently limited by cognitive constraints such as knowledge gaps and limited ability to integrate and extract knowledge implications, particularly when multidisciplinary expertise is required. This work demonstrates that large language models (LLMs), coupled with prompt engineering, can effectively generate non-trivial materials hypotheses by integrating scientific principles from diverse sources without explicit design guidance by human experts. These include design ideas for high-entropy alloys with superior cryogenic properties and halide solid electrolytes with enhanced ionic conductivity and formability. These design ideas have been experimentally validated in high-impact publications in 2023 not available in the LLM training data, demonstrating the LLM's ability to generate highly valuable and realizable innovative ideas not established in the literature. Our approach primarily leverages materials system charts encoding processing-structure-property relationships, enabling more effective data integration by condensing key information from numerous papers, and evaluation and categorization of numerous hypotheses for human cognition, both through the LLM. This LLM-driven approach opens the door to new avenues of artificial intelligence-driven materials discovery by accelerating design, democratizing innovation, and expanding capabilities beyond the designer's direct knowledge.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e Kramers-Weyl Fermions from Structural Chirality with Ideal Radial Spin Texture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that two-dimensional Kramers-Weyl fermions can be engineered in spin-orbit coupled twisted bilayers, where the chiral structure of these moir\'e systems breaks all mirror symmetries, confining Kramers-Weyl fermions to high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone under time reversal symmetry. Our theoretical analysis reveals a symmetry-enforced Weyl-like interlayer moir\'e coupling that universally ensures an ideal radial spin-texture at arbitrary twist angles, under $C_{nz}$ symmetry with n&gt;2. First principles density functional calculation confirm the realization of these fermions in twisted $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ bilayers, where flat bands and out-of-plane ferroelectric polarization in each layer guarantee two-dimensional Kramers-Weyl physics with perfectly ideal radial spin textures.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study on the crystal structure of a bilayer nickel-oxychloride Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ and analysis on the occurrence of possible unconventional superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity under high pressure with $T_c$ exceeding 80 K in a bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has led to a strong desire to realize similar high $T_c$ phenomena at ambient pressure. As one possible path toward realizing superconductivity at ambient pressure, we here propose to consider Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ as a possible candidate. In this study, we theoretically investigate the electronic structure of Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ and its structural stability. Our phonon calculation shows that this compound with the $I4/mmm$ tetragonal structure is dynamically stable even at ambient pressure. The characteristic crystal field in this compound lowers the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital energy, by which the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital becomes rather closer to the half-filling in Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ than La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. As a result, we find that superconductivity is enhanced even though a relatively strong orbital hybridization between the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ orbitals is somewhat detrimental for superconductivity. We also check the formation enthalpy, which shows that the high-pressure synthesis can be a good way to actually produce Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$. We find that Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ is a promising new candidate of bilayer-nickelate superconductors, which can possess even higher $T_c$ than pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, at ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Phase separation bursting and symmetry breaking inside an evaporating droplet; formation of a flower-like pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pattern formation inside a liquid phase is a phenomenon involved in many different aspects of life on our planet. The droplet form of a liquid that evaporates can reveal patterns that depend on the chemistry of the droplet and the physical parameters involved. We observed a flower-like deposition pattern of micrometer-sized particles as a result of the evaporation of a droplet containing salt and a non-ionic polymer. We show experimentally that the phase separation of the polymer due to the salting-out effect causes a strong entropic flow, which manifests as vortices. The flow is called phase separation bursting flow, which leads to the axial symmetry breaking and the formation of a radially aligned flower-like pattern. We foresee that understanding the observed flow can provide insights into the fluid physics aspects of phase separation and may have implications for technical applications.</description>

      <title>Topological Spin-Orbit Torque in Ferrimagnetic Weyl Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin-orbit torque (SOT) in a compensated ferrimagnetic Weyl semimetal, ${\rm Ti}_{2}{\rm MnAl}$, is studied by the linear response theory. We elucidate that the SOT driven by all the occupied electronic states is present in magnetic Weyl semimetal, unlike in conventional metallic magnets. Around the energy of the Weyl points, we find that such an SOT is dominant and almost independent of the disorder. The emergence of the SOT in ${\rm Ti}_{2}{\rm MnAl}$ can be understood from the structure of the mixed Berry curvature around the Weyl points, which is similar to that of the ordinary Berry curvature.</description>

      <title>Applying Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization in Chemistry: Open Challenges and Major Considerations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi fidelity Bayesian optimization (MFBO) leverages experimental and or computational data of varying quality and resource cost to optimize towards desired maxima cost effectively. This approach is particularly attractive for chemical discovery due to MFBO's ability to integrate diverse data sources. Here, we investigate the application of MFBO to accelerate the identification of promising molecules or materials. We specifically analyze the conditions under which lower fidelity data can enhance performance compared to single-fidelity problem formulations. We address two key challenges, selecting the optimal acquisition function, understanding the impact of cost, and data fidelity correlation. We then discuss how to assess the effectiveness of MFBO for chemical discovery.</description>

      <title>Nernst Plateau in the Quantum Limit of Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nernst effect, a transverse electric current induced by a temperature gradient, is a promising tool for revealing emergent phases of condensed matter. We find a Nernst coefficient plateau in low carrier density topological insulators, as a signature of 1D Weyl points in the quantum limit of the weak topological insulator. The plateau height is inversely proportional to the impurity density, suggesting a way to engineer infinitely large Nernst effects. The Nernst plateau also exists in strong topological insulators, at the bottom of the lowest Landau band. We show that these plateaus have been overlooked in the previous experiments and we highlight the experimental conditions to observe them. Our results may inspire more investigations of employing anomalous Nernst effect to identify emergent phases of condensed matter.</description>

      <title>Sound Wave Manipulation Based on Valley Acoustic Interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological acoustics provides new opportunities for materials with unprecedented functions. In this work, we report a design of topological valley acoustic interferometers by Y-shaped valley sonic crystals. By tight-bounding calculation and experimental demonstration, we successfully tune the acoustic energy partition rate by configuring the channel. An analytical theory proposed to explain the transmission property matches well with experimental observations. An additional {\pi} Berry phase is verified to accumulate circling along the shape-independent topological valley acoustic interferometer, unique in the pseudospin half systems. Based on the spectral oscillation originating from the accumulated dynamic phase and {\pi} Berry phase, a simplified method to measure acoustic valley interface dispersion is explored, which overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional fast Fourier transform method and improves the measuring efficiency by simply analyzing the peaks and dips of the measured transmission spectrum. Moreover, an effective approach to tuning its transmissions, as well as the spectral line shapes proposed and realized by the local geometry design of the interferometer, exhibits strong tunability under an unchanged physical mechanism. Our work opens an avenue to design future acoustic devices with the function of sound wave manipulation based on the physical mechanism of interference and Berry phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the fabrication and characterization of superconducting qubit components from titanium nitride (TiN) and aluminum nitride (AlN) layers to create Josephson junctions and superconducting resonators in an all-nitride architecture. Our methodology comprises a complete process flow for the fabrication of TiN/AlN/TiN junctions, characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), ellipsometry and DC electrical measurements. We evaluated the sputtering rates of AlN under varied conditions, the critical temperatures of TiN thin films for different sputtering environments, and the internal quality factors of TiN resonators in the few-GHz regime, fabricated from these films. Overall, this offered insights into the material properties critical to qubit performance. Measurements of the dependence of the critical current of the TiN / AlN / TiN junctions yielded values ranging from 150 ${\mu}$A to 2 ${\mu}$A, for AlN barrier thicknesses up to ca. 5 nm, respectively. Our findings demonstrate advances in the fabrication of nitride-based superconducting qubit components, which may find applications in quantum computing technologies based on novel materials.</description>

      <title>Low-Temperature Electron Transport in [110] and [100] Silicon Nanowires: A DFT - Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of very low temperature on the electron transport in a [110] and [100] axially aligned unstrained silicon nanowires (SiNWs) are investigated. A combination of semi-empirical 10-orbital tight-binding method, density functional theory (DFT), and Ensemble Monte Carlo (EMC) methods are used. Both acoustic and optical phonons are included in the electron-phonon scattering rate calculations covering both intra-subband and inter-subband events. A comparison with room temperature (300 K) characteristics shows that for both nanowires, the average electron steady-state drift velocity increases at least 2 times at relatively moderate electric fields and lower temperatures. Furthermore, the average drift velocity in [110] nanowires is 50 percent more than that of [100] nanowires, explained by the difference in their conduction subband effective mass. Transient average electron velocity suggests that there is a pronounced streaming electron motion at low temperature which is attributed to the reduced electron-phonon scattering rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tuneable electronic properties in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are essential to further their use in device applications. Here, we present a comprehensive scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy study of a doping-induced charge density wave (CDW) in semiconducting bulk 1T-ZrSe$_2$. We find that atomic impurities which locally shift the Fermi level ($E_F$) into the conduction band trigger a CDW reconstruction concomitantly to the opening of a gap at $E_F$. Our findings shed new light on earlier photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical studies of bulk 1T-ZrSe$_2$, and provide a local understanding of the electron-doping mediated CDW transition observed in semiconducting TMDs.</description>

      <title>Laser Activation of Single Group-IV Colour Centres in Diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-photon interfaces based on group-IV colour centres in diamond offer a promising platform for quantum networks. A key challenge in the field is realizing precise single-defect positioning and activation, which is crucial for scalable device fabrication. Here we address this problem by demonstrating a two-step fabrication method for tin vacancy (SnV-) centres that uses site-controlled ion implantation followed by local femtosecond laser annealing with in-situ spectral monitoring. The ion implantation is performed with sub-50 nm resolution and a dosage that is controlled from hundreds of ions down to single ions per site, limited by Poissonian statistics. Using this approach, we successfully demonstrate site-selective creation and modification of single SnV- centres. The technique opens a window onto materials tuning at the single defect level, and provides new insight into defect structures and dynamics during the annealing process. While demonstrated for SnV- centres, this versatile approach can be readily generalised to other implanted colour centres in diamond and wide-bandgap materials.</description>

Abstract: In this short article, we overview a concept of electronic toroidal multipoles, and their ordering with associated physical properties in non-magnetic and magnetic materials. The toroidal multipoles are introduced as microscopic electronic variables in view of symmetry. They are classified according to crystallographic and magnetic point groups, which allows us to discuss various possible cross correlations in a transparent and unified manner. The representative examples of toroidal orders and related phenomena, and the mutual relationship between these orders are given, with focusing on monopoles and dipoles. The concept of toroidal multipoles would promote future studies toward observations and identifications of unknown electronic phases and their related physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Phonons in stringlet-land and the boson peak</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solid materials that deviate from the harmonic crystal paradigm exhibit characteristic anomalies in the specific heat and vibrational density of states (VDOS) with respect to Debye's theory predictions. The boson peak (BP), a low-frequency excess in the VDOS over Debye law $g(\omega) \propto \omega^2$, is certainly the most famous among them; nevertheless, its origin is still subject of fierce debate. Recent simulation works provided strong evidence that localized one-dimensional string-like excitations (stringlets) might be the microscopic origin of the BP. In this work, we study the dynamics of acoustic phonons interacting with a bath of vibrating 1D stringlets with exponentially distributed size, as observed in simulations. We show that stringlets strongly renormalize the phonon propagator and naturally induce a BP anomaly in the vibrational density of states, corresponding to the emergence of a dispersionless BP flat mode. Additionally, phonon-stringlet interactions produce a strong enhancement of sound attenuation and a dip in the speed of sound near the BP frequency, consistent with experimental and simulation data. The qualitative trends of the BP frequency and intensity are predicted within the model and shown to be in good agreement with previous observations. In summary, our results substantiate with a simple theoretical model the recent simulation results by Hu and Tanaka claiming the origin of the BP from stringlet dynamics.</description>

      <title>Six magnetization plateau phases in a spin-1/2 distorted kagome antiferromagnet: application to $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17207v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recently discovered kagome antiferromagnet $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$ has attracted significant interest due to its unique kagome lattice structure and magnetic properties. The kagome lattice has three types of exchange interactions: one hexagonal coupling and two different triangular couplings. Previous studies have shown that its ground state is significantly different from that predicted for the undistorted kagome lattice, forming a coplanar spin state with a commensurate magnetic wave vector ${\mathbf Q}=(1/3,1/3)$.
  Two separate studies have proposed distinct sets of exchange interaction parameters for this compound.
  In this study, we investigate the ground state of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg kagome model with three types of nearest-neighbor exchange interactions under a magnetic field by exact diagonalization using the Lanczos method. We reveal that clear magnetization plateaus at $M/M_{\rm sat}$=1/3, 5/9, and 7/9 are present under both parameter sets, which are identified as magnon crystal states based on their spin structures.
  Our findings suggest that these plateaus could potentially be experimentally confirmed with magnetization measurements on $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$ under a magnetic field of approximately 300 T, achievable with state-of-the-art magnetic field generators. In order to get a deeper understanding of magnetism of $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$, we perform additional calculations by varying these interactions. Consequently, we discover additional plateau phases at $M/M_{\rm sat}$=1/3, 5/9, and 7/9, each distinctly different from the magnon crystal states.</description>

Abstract: The $GW$ approximation is a widely used method for computing electron addition and removal energies of molecules and solids. The computational effort of conventional $GW$ algorithms increases as $O(N^4)$ with the system size $N$, hindering the application of $GW$ to large and complex systems. Low-scaling $GW$ algorithms are currently very actively developed. Benchmark studies at the single-shot $G_0W_0$ level indicate excellent numerical precision for frontier quasiparticle energies, with mean absolute deviations $&lt;10$ meV between low-scaling and standard implementations for the widely used $GW100$ test set. A notable challenge for low-scaling $GW$ algorithms remains in achieving high precision for five molecules within the $GW100$ test set, namely O$_3$, BeO, MgO, BN, and CuCN, for which the deviations are in the range of several hundred meV at the $G_0W_0$ level. This is due to a spurious transfer of spectral weight from the quasiparticle to the satellite spectrum in $G_0W_0$ calculations, resulting in multi-pole features in the self-energy and spectral function, which low-scaling algorithms fail to describe. We show in this work that including eigenvalue self-consistency in the Green's function ($\text{ev}GW_0$) achieves a proper separation between satellite and quasiparticle peak, leading to a single solution of the quasiparticle equation with spectral weight close to one. $\text{ev}GW_0$ quasiparticles energies from low-scaling $GW$ closely align with reference calculations; the mean absolute error is only 12 meV for the five molecules. We thus demonstrate that low-scaling $GW$ with self-consistency in $G$ is well-suited for computing frontier quasiparticle energies.</description>
