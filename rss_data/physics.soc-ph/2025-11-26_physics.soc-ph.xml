      <title>Constructing a Unified Model of Community Formation in Community-Supported Agriculture: Insights from Consumer and Producer Pathways in Japan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) has been recognized globally as a promising framework that embeds agriculture within social relations, yet its diffusion remains limited in contexts such as Japan. Existing studies have largely focused on either consumer or producer participation in isolation, offering fragmented insights and leaving unexplored how their reciprocal processes jointly shape CSA communities. This study addresses this gap by integrating the trajectories of both groups into a comprehensive account of CSA community formation. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with ten CSA producers and ten consumers, we employed the Modified Grounded Theory Approach (M-GTA) to inductively theorize processes of participation and practice. The analysis showed that producers advance CSA through internal adjustments and sense-making to cope with uncertainties, while consumers are guided by life events, practical skills, and prior purchasing experiences toward participation. Synthesizing these insights, we propose a six-phase model of CSA community formation, dispersed interest, awareness, interest formation, motivation, practice, and co-creative continuation, that demonstrates how producers, consumers, and intermediaries interact across stages. The model highlights the pivotal role of key players in sustaining engagement and provides a new perspective for institutionalizing CSA as a durable component of sustainable food systems.</description>

      <title>Causal spillover effects of electric vehicle charging station placement on local businesses: a staggered adoption study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the economic impacts of the placement of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) is crucial for planning infrastructure systems that benefit the broader community. Theoretical models have been used to predict human behavior during charging events, however, these models have often neglected the complexity of trip patterns, and have underestimated the real-world impacts of such infrastructure on the local economy. In this paper, we design a quasi-experiment using mobile phone GPS location and EVCS deployment history data to analyze the causal impact of EVCS placement on visitation patterns to businesses. More specifically, we leverage the staggered placement of EVCSs in New York City and California Bay Area to match treated and control businesses that share similar characteristics including the business sector, location, and pre-treatment visitation count. By comparing three alternative matching strategies, we show that staggered adoption avoids selecting controls from non-treated clusters, and yields greater spatial overlap in dense urban areas. We find that EVCS installations significantly increase customer traffic, with effects concentrated in recreational venues in New York City and routine destinations such as groceries, pharmacies, and cafes in California Bay Area. Our results suggest that the economic spillovers of EVCSs vary across urban contexts and highlight the effectiveness of leveraging the staggered nature of adoption timings for evaluating infrastructure impacts in heterogeneous urban environments.</description>

      <title>Techno economic feasibility study of solar ORC in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar energy has enormous potential because there is a worldwide need to meet energy demands. Depleting non-renewable energy resources, increasing carbon emissions, and other environmental effects concern the scientific community to develop an alternative approach to electricity production. In this article, we present the study of a solar-powered Organic Rankine cycle considering Indian climatic conditions. Initially, we scrutinized seven working fluids and assessed their performance in the ORC at an evaporator pressure range of 9-30 bar and a mass flow rate range of 0.2 kg/s to 4.5 kg/s. For a fixed sink temperature of 298 K, we evaluate the system using four different power ratings of 2, 20, 50, and 100 kW based on four different source temperatures of 423 K, 403 K, 383 K, and 363 K. We estimate the system cost for each working fluid in each scenario separately. Our findings suggest that R 1233zd(E) is the optimum performing working fluid based on cost, cost-effectiveness, and environmental friendliness. We also notice that the estimated system scale cost is very competitive and could be a great alternative to the technologies already on the Indian market.</description>

      <title>Public opinion between rearmament and crisis of the nuclear taboo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines the changing relationship between the public and nuclear weapons in a context of increasing international insecurity. It discusses the erosion of the nuclear taboo, understood as a normative aversion to nuclear use. Standard surveys capture abstract and rational opinions, while experimental surveys place respondents in simulated strategic scenarios designed to evoke more emotional responses. The divergence between their results is explained by the fact that they measure two different objects: rational opinions and emotional attitudes. A nationally representative survey conducted in Italy in 2025 shows that 81 percent of respondents consider nuclear weapons fundamentally different from conventional weapons and always wrong to use. Among opponents, a distinction is drawn between deontologists and consequentialists. The article concludes by highlighting the importance of integrating affective and cognitive dimensions in the study of public opinion, as a contribution to countering the normalization of nuclear weapons in political discourse.</description>

      <title>Realistic gossip in Trust Game on networks: the GODS model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gossip has been shown to be a relatively efficient solution to problems of cooperation in reputation-based systems of exchange, but many studies don't conceptualize gossiping in a realistic way, often assuming near-perfect information or broadcast-like dynamics of its spread. To solve this problem, we developed an agent-based model that pairs realistic gossip processes with different variants of Trust Game. The results show that cooperators suffer when local interactions govern spread of gossip, because they cannot discriminate against defectors. Realistic gossiping increases the overall amount of resources, but is more likely to promote defection. Moreover, even partner selection through dynamic networks can lead to high payoff inequalities among agent types. Cooperators face a choice between outcompeting defectors and overall growth. By blending direct and indirect reciprocity with reputations we show that gossiping increases the efficiency of cooperation by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Projections of Earth's Technosphere: Strategies for Observing Technosignatures on Terrestrial Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for technosignatures -- remotely detectable evidence of extraterrestrial technology -- draws upon examples from the recent history of Earth as well as projections of Earth's technosphere. Facilities like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will significantly advance the feasibility of characterizing the atmospheres of habitable exoplanets at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, while other future mission concepts could extend this search to mid-infrared wavelengths. We draw upon a recently developed set of ten self-consistent scenarios for future Earth technospheres as analogs for extraterrestrial technospheres, which we use to outline a stepwise technosignature search strategy beginning with HWO and followed by other missions. We find that HWO could reveal elevated abundances of a CO$_2$ + NO$_2$ pair on planets with combustion and other large-scale industry, which could be observable in up to in eight of the ten scenarios. Follow-up radio observations could reveal narrow-band directed transmissions, which occurs in two of the scenarios. Further study by direct detection at mid-infrared wavelengths with the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) could reveal spectral features from industry, such as the combination of CO$_2$ + CFC-11/12 in four scenarios and CO$_2$ + CFC-11/12 + CF$_4$ in one scenario; two of these also include the N$_2$O + CH$_4$ + NH$_3$ triple from large-scale agriculture. Other mission concepts such as a Solar Gravitational Lens mission could reveal large-scale surface features in two scenarios that otherwise show no detectable technosignatures, while an interplanetary fly-by or probe mission would be the most conclusive way to reveal the presence of technology on terrestrial exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Finite-time consensus in a compromise process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A compromise process describes the evolution of opinions through binary interactions. Opinions are real numbers, and at each step, two randomly selected agents reach a compromise by averaging their pre-interaction opinions. We prove that if the number $N$ of agents is a power of two, then consensus emerges after a finite number of compromise events with probability one; otherwise, consensus cannot be reached in a finite number of steps, provided the initial opinions are in a general position. The number of steps required to reach consensus is random for $N=2^k$ with $k\geq 2$. We prove that the smallest number of steps is $k\cdot 2^{k-1}$ when the initial opinions are in a general position. For $N=4$, we determine the distribution of the number of steps. In particular, we show that it has a purely exponential tail and compute all cumulants.</description>

      <title>When heterogeneity drives hysteresis: Anticonformity in the multistate $q$-voter model on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discontinuous phase transitions are closely linked to tipping points, critical mass effects, and hysteresis, phenomena that have been confirmed empirically and recognized as highly important in social systems. The multistate $q$-voter model, an agent-based approach to simulate discrete decision-making and opinion dynamics, is particularly relevant in this context. Previous studies of the $q$-voter model with anticonformity on complete graphs uncovered a counterintuitive result. Changing the model formulation from the annealed (homogeneous agents with varying behavior) to quenched (heterogeneous agents with fixed behavior) produces discontinuous phase transitions. This is contrary to the common expectation that quenched heterogeneity smooths transitions. To test whether this effect is merely a mean-field artifact, we extend the analysis to random graphs. Using pair approximation and Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the phenomenon persists beyond the complete graph, specifically on random graphs and Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free networks. The novelty of our work is twofold: (i) we demonstrate for the first time that replacing the annealed with the quenched approach can change the type of phase transitions from continuous to discontinuous not only on complete graphs but also on sparser networks, and (ii) we provide pair-approximation results for the multistate $q$-voter model with competing conformity and anticonformity mechanisms, covering both quenched and annealed cases, which had previously been studied only in binary models.</description>

      <title>Friendship-paradox paradox: Do most people's friends really have more friends than they do?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13957v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical friendship paradox asserts that, on average, an individual's neighbors have a higher degree than the individual. This statement concerns network-level means and does not describe how often a typical node is locally dominated by its neighbors. Motivated by this distinction, we develop a framework that separates mean-based friendship paradox inequalities from two majority-type quantities: a global fraction measuring how many nodes have a degree smaller than the mean degree of their neighbors, and a local fraction based on hub centrality that measures how many nodes are dominated in a median-based sense. We show that neither fraction is constrained by the classical friendship paradox and that they can behave independently of each other. A simple example and two empirical networks illustrate how quadrant patterns in the joint distribution of a node's degree and its neighbors' degree determine the signs and magnitudes of the two fractions, and how left- or right-skewed degree distributions of neighboring nodes can yield opposite conclusions for mean-based and median-based comparisons. The resulting framework offers a clearer distinction between population averages and local majority relations and provides a foundation for future analyses of local advantage, disadvantage, and perception asymmetry in complex networks.</description>
