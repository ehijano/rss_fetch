      <title>Computing macroscopic reaction rates in reaction-diffusion systems using Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic reaction-diffusion models are employed to represent many complex physical, biological, societal, and ecological systems. The macroscopic reaction rates describing the large-scale kinetics in such systems are effective, scale-dependent parameters that need to be either measured experimentally or computed using a microscopic model. In a Monte Carlo simulation of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems, microscopic probabilities for specific events to happen serve as the input control parameters. Finding the functional dependence of emergent macroscopic rates on the microscopic probabilities is a difficult problem, and there is no systematic analytical way to achieve this goal. Therefore, we introduce a straightforward numerical method of using Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the macroscopic reaction rates by directly obtaining the count statistics of how many events occur per simulation time step. Our technique is first tested on well-understood fundamental examples, namely restricted birth processes, diffusion-limited two-particle coagulation, and two-species pair annihilation kinetics. Next we utilize the thus gained experience to investigate how the microscopic algorithmic probabilities become coarse-grained into effective macroscopic rates in more complex model systems such as the Lotka--Volterra model for predator-prey competition and coexistence, as well as the rock-paper-scissors or cyclic Lotka--Volterra model as well as its May--Leonard variant that capture population dynamics with cyclic dominance motifs. Thereby we achieve a deeper understanding of coarse-graining in spatially extended stochastic reaction systems and the nontrivial relationships between the associated microscopic and macroscopic model parameters. The proposed technique should generally provide a useful means to better fit Monte Carlo simulation results to experimental or observational data.</description>

      <title>Implantable silicon neural probes with nanophotonic phased arrays for single-lobe beam steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In brain activity mapping experiments using optogenetics, patterned illumination is crucial for deterministic and localized stimulation of neurons. However, due to optical scattering in brain tissue, light-emitting implantable devices are needed to bring precise patterned illumination to deep brain regions. A promising solution is silicon neural probes with integrated nanophotonic circuits that form tailored beam emission patterns without lenses. Here, we demonstrate neural probes with grating-based light emitters that generate a single steerable light beam across $&gt; 60\%$ of the steering range with $\ge 4$ dB of background suppression for optogenetic photostimulation. The light emitters, optimized for blue or amber light, combine end-fire optical phased arrays with slab gratings to suppress higher-order sidelobes.</description>

      <title>Analytical Characterization of Epileptic Dynamics in a Bistable System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders globally, affecting millions of individuals. Despite significant advancements, the precise mechanisms underlying this condition remain largely unknown, making accurately predicting and preventing epileptic seizures challenging. In this paper, we employ a bistable model, where a stable equilibrium and a stable limit cycle coexist, to describe epileptic dynamics. The equilibrium captures normal steady-state neural activity, while the stable limit cycle signifies seizure-like oscillations. The noise-driven switch from the equilibrium to the limit cycle characterizes the onset of seizures. The differences in the regions of attraction of these two stable states distinguish epileptic brain dynamics from healthy ones. We analytically construct the regions of attraction for both states. Further, using the notion of input-to-state stability, we theoretically show how the regions of attraction influence the stability of the system subject to external perturbations. Generalizing the bistable system into coupled networks, we also find the role of network parameters in shaping the regions of attraction. Our findings shed light on the intricate interplay between brain networks and epileptic activity, offering mechanistic insights into potential avenues for more predictable treatments.</description>

      <title>Synergy as the failure of distributivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A physical system is synergistic if it cannot be reduced to its constituents. Intuitively this is paraphrased into the common statement that 'the whole is greater than the sum of its parts'. In this manner, many basic parts in combination may give rise to some unexpected collective behavior. A paradigmatic example of such phenomenon is information. Several sources, which are already known individually, may provide some new knowledge when joined together. Here we take the trivial case of discrete random variables and explore whether and how it is possible to get more information out of lesser parts. Our approach is inspired by set theory as the fundamental description of part-whole relations. If taken unaltered, synergistic behavior is forbidden by the set theoretical axioms. Indeed, the union of sets cannot contain extra elements not found in any particular set. However, random variables are not a perfect analogy of sets. We formalise the distinction, finding a single broken axiom - union/intersection distributivity. Nevertheless, it remains possible to describe information using Venn-type diagrams. We directly connect the existence of synergy to the failure of distributivity for random variables. When compared to the partial information decomposition framework (PID), our technique fully reproduces previous results while resolving the self-contradictions that plagued them and providing additional constraints on the solutions. This opens the way towards quantifying emergence in large systems.</description>

      <title>Escape from a metastable state in non-Markovian population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the long-time dynamics in non-Markovian single-population stochastic models, where one or more reactions are modelled as a stochastic process with a fat-tailed non-exponential distribution of waiting times, mimicking long-term memory. We focus on three prototypical examples: genetic switching, population establishment and population extinction, all with non-exponential production rates. The system is studied in two regimes. In the first, the distribution of waiting times has a finite mean. Here, the system approaches a (quasi)stationary steady state at long times, and we develop a general WKB approach for these non-Markovian systems. We derive explicit results for the mean population size and mean escape time from the metastable state of the stochastic dynamics. In this realm, we reveal that for sufficiently strong memory, a memory-induced (meta)stable state can emerge in the system. In the second regime, the waiting time distribution is assumed to have an infinite mean. Here, for bistable systems we find two distinct scaling regimes, separated by an exponentially long time which may strongly depend on the initial conditions of the system.</description>

      <title>Correlation between Gyral Size, Brain Size, and Head Impact Risk across Mammalian Species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A study on primates has established that gyral size is largely independent of overall brain size. Building on this, and other research suggesting that brain gyrification may mitigate the effects of head impacts, our study aims to explore potential correlations between gyral size and the risk of head impact across a diverse range of mammalian species. Our findings corroborate the idea that gyral sizes are largely independent of brain sizes, especially among species with larger brains, thus extending this observation beyond primates. Preliminary evidence also suggests a correlation between an animal's gyral size and its lifestyle, particularly in terms of head-impact risk. For instance, goats, known for their headbutting behaviors, exhibit smaller gyral sizes. In contrast, species such as manatees and dugongs, which typically face lower risks of head impact, have lissencephalic brains. Additionally, we explore mechanisms that may explain how narrower gyral sizes could offer protective advantages against head impact. Finally, we discuss a possible trade-off associated with gyrencephaly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical physicists have been fascinated by the phenomena of life for more than a century. As we engage with more realistic descriptions of living systems, however, things get complicated. After reviewing different reactions to this complexity, I explore the optimization of information flow as a potentially general theoretical principle. The primary example is a genetic network guiding development of the fly embryo, but each idea also is illustrated by examples from neural systems. In each case, optimization makes detailed, largely parameter-free predictions that connect quantitatively with experiment</description>

      <title>Active osmotic-like pressure on permeable inclusions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a standard minimal active Brownian model to investigate the osmotic-like effective pressure generated by active fluids on fixed hollow inclusions. These inclusions are enclosed by a permeable (albeit nonflexible) membrane, and the interior and exterior regions of the inclusions have different particle motility strengths. We consider both rectangular and disklike inclusions and analyze the effects of various system parameters, such as excluded volume interaction between active particles, hardness of membrane and active particle density, on the effective pressure produced on the enclosing membrane. We focus on the range of intermediate to high motility strengths and analyze the effective pressure in the steady state. Our findings for the active pressure produced in the interior and exterior regions of the inclusion indicate that the pressure is higher in the region with lower motility due to the relatively stronger accumulation of active particles.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounds on Overshoot in SIR Models with Nonlinear Incidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01653v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We expand the calculation of the upper bound on epidemic overshoot in SIR models to account for nonlinear incidence. We lay out the general procedure and restrictions to perform the calculation analytically. We demonstrate the procedure by working through several examples and also numerically study what happens to the upper bound on overshoot when nonlinear incidence manifests in the form of epidemic dynamics over a contact network. We find that both steeper incidence terms and larger contact heterogeneity can increase the range of communicable diseases at which the overshoot remains a relatively large public health hazard.</description>
