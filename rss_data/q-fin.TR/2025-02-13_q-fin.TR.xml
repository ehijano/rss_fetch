      <title>Minimal Shortfall Strategies for Liquidation of a Basket of Stocks using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the ubiquitous problem of liquidating large quantities of highly correlated stocks, a task frequently encountered by institutional investors and proprietary trading firms. Traditional methods in this setting suffer from the curse of dimensionality, making them impractical for high-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose a novel method based on stochastic optimal control to optimally tackle this complex multidimensional problem. The proposed method minimizes the overall execution shortfall of highly correlated stocks using a reinforcement learning approach. We rigorously establish the convergence of our optimal trading strategy and present an implementation of our algorithm using intra-day market data.</description>

      <title>am-AMM: An Auction-Managed Automated Market Maker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03367v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated market makers (AMMs) have emerged as the dominant market mechanism for trading on decentralized exchanges implemented on blockchains. This paper presents a single mechanism that targets two important unsolved problems for AMMs: reducing losses to informed orderflow, and maximizing revenue from uninformed orderflow. The ``auction-managed AMM'' works by running a censorship-resistant onchain auction for the right to temporarily act as ``pool manager'' for a constant-product AMM. The pool manager sets the swap fee rate on the pool, and also receives the accrued fees from swaps. The pool manager can exclusively capture some arbitrage by trading against the pool in response to small price movements, and also can set swap fees incorporating price sensitivity of retail orderflow and adapting to changing market conditions, with the benefits from both ultimately accruing to liquidity providers. Liquidity providers can enter and exit the pool freely in response to changing rent, though they must pay a small fee on withdrawal. We prove that under certain assumptions, this AMM should have higher liquidity in equilibrium than any standard, fixed-fee AMM.</description>

      <title>TRADES: Generating Realistic Market Simulations with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Financial markets are complex systems characterized by high statistical noise, nonlinearity, and constant evolution. Thus, modeling them is extremely hard. We address the task of generating realistic and responsive Limit Order Book (LOB) market simulations, which are fundamental for calibrating and testing trading strategies, performing market impact experiments, and generating synthetic market data. Previous works lack realism, usefulness, and responsiveness of the generated simulations. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel TRAnsformer-based Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Engine for LOB Simulations (TRADES). TRADES generates realistic order flows conditioned on the state of the market, leveraging a transformer-based architecture that captures the temporal and spatial characteristics of high-frequency market data. There is a notable absence of quantitative metrics for evaluating generative market simulation models in the literature. To tackle this problem, we adapt the predictive score, a metric measured as an MAE, by training a stock price predictive model on synthetic data and testing it on real data. We compare TRADES with previous works on two stocks, reporting an x3.27 and x3.47 improvement over SoTA according to the predictive score, demonstrating that we generate useful synthetic market data for financial downstream tasks. We assess TRADES's market simulation realism and responsiveness, showing that it effectively learns the conditional data distribution and successfully reacts to an experimental agent, giving sprout to possible calibrations and evaluations of trading strategies and market impact experiments. We developed DeepMarket, the first open-source Python framework for market simulation with deep learning. Our repository includes a synthetic LOB dataset composed of TRADES's generates simulations. We release the code at github.com/LeonardoBerti00/DeepMarket.</description>
