      <title>Scalable In-context Ranking with Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05396v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context Ranking (ICR) is an emerging paradigm for Information Retrieval (IR), which leverages contextual understanding of LLMs by directly incorporating the task description, candidate documents, and the query into the model's input prompt and tasking the LLM to identify relevant document(s). While it is effective, efficiency is a significant challenge in this paradigm, especially as the candidate list grows due to quadratic/super-linear scaling of attention operation with context length. To this end, this paper first identifies inherent and exploitable structures in the attention of LLMs finetuned for ICR: (1) inter-document block sparsity: attention is dense within each document block but sparse across different documents in the context; and (2) query-document block relevance: the attention scores from certain query tokens to a document block in middle layers strongly correlate with that document's actual relevance. Motivated by these observations, we introduce BlockRank (Blockwise In-context Ranking), a novel method that adapts the attention operation in an LLM by (a) architecturally enforcing the observed inter-document block sparsity, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear without loss in performance, and (b) optimizing query-document block relevance for true relevant documents during fine-tuning using an auxiliary contrastive training objective, improving retrieval in attention. Experiments on BEIR, MSMarco and NQ with Mistral-7B demonstrate that BlockRank Mistral matches or outperforms existing SOTA listwise rankers and controlled fine-tuned baseline while being significantly more efficient at inference (4.7x for 100 MSMarco documents in context) and scaling gracefully to long-context shortlists, around 500 documents in-context (approximately 100K context length) within a second, presenting a scalable and effective solution for ICR.</description>

      <title>Automated Research Article Classification and Recommendation Using NLP and ML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the digital era, the exponential growth of scientific publications has made it increasingly difficult for researchers to efficiently identify and access relevant work. This paper presents an automated framework for research article classification and recommendation that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning. Using a large-scale arXiv.org dataset spanning more than three decades, we evaluate multiple feature extraction approaches (TF--IDF, Count Vectorizer, Sentence-BERT, USE, Mirror-BERT) in combination with diverse machine learning classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM, Na\"ive Bayes, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, and k-Nearest Neighbour). Our experiments show that Logistic Regression with TF--IDF consistently yields the best classification performance, achieving an accuracy of 69\%. To complement classification, we incorporate a recommendation module based on the cosine similarity of vectorized articles, enabling efficient retrieval of related research papers. The proposed system directly addresses the challenge of information overload in digital libraries and demonstrates a scalable, data-driven solution to support literature discovery.</description>

      <title>AgentDR Dynamic Recommendation with Implicit Item-Item Relations via LLM-based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent agent-based recommendation frameworks aim to simulate user behaviors by incorporating memory mechanisms and prompting strategies, but they struggle with hallucinating non-existent items and full-catalog ranking. Besides, a largely underexplored opportunity lies in leveraging LLMs'commonsense reasoning to capture user intent through substitute and complement relationships between items, which are usually implicit in datasets and difficult for traditional ID-based recommenders to capture. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-agent framework, AgenDR, which bridges LLM reasoning with scalable recommendation tools. Our approach delegates full-ranking tasks to traditional models while utilizing LLMs to (i) integrate multiple recommendation outputs based on personalized tool suitability and (ii) reason over substitute and complement relationships grounded in user history. This design mitigates hallucination, scales to large catalogs, and enhances recommendation relevance through relational reasoning. Through extensive experiments on three public grocery datasets, we show that our framework achieves superior full-ranking performance, yielding on average a twofold improvement over its underlying tools. We also introduce a new LLM-based evaluation metric that jointly measures semantic alignment and ranking correctness.</description>

      <title>Limitations of Current Evaluation Practices for Conversational Recommender Systems and the Potential of User Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research and development on conversational recommender systems (CRSs) critically depends on sound and reliable evaluation methodologies. However, the interactive nature of these systems poses significant challenges for automatic evaluation. This paper critically examines current evaluation practices and identifies two key limitations: the over-reliance on static test collections and the inadequacy of existing evaluation metrics. To substantiate this critique, we analyze real user interactions with nine existing CRSs and demonstrate a striking disconnect between self-reported user satisfaction and performance scores reported in prior literature. To address these limitations, this work explores the potential of user simulation to generate dynamic interaction data, offering a departure from static datasets. Furthermore, we propose novel evaluation metrics, based on a general reward/cost framework, designed to better align with real user satisfaction. Our analysis of different simulation approaches provides valuable insights into their effectiveness and reveals promising initial results, showing improved correlation with system rankings compared to human evaluation. While these findings indicate a significant step forward in CRS evaluation, we also identify areas for future research and refinement in both simulation techniques and evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>How public datasets constrain the development of diversity-aware news recommender systems, and what law could do about it</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: News recommender systems increasingly determine what news individuals see online. Over the past decade, researchers have extensively critiqued recommender systems that prioritise news based on user engagement. To offer an alternative, researchers have analysed how recommender systems could support the media's ability to fulfil its role in democratic society by recommending news based on editorial values, particularly diversity. However, there continues to be a large gap between normative theory on how news recommender systems should incorporate diversity, and technical literature that designs such systems. We argue that to realise diversity-aware recommender systems in practice, it is crucial to pay attention to the datasets that are needed to train modern news recommenders. We aim to make two main contributions. First, we identify the information a dataset must include to enable the development of the diversity-aware news recommender systems proposed in normative literature. Based on this analysis, we assess the limitations of currently available public datasets, and show what potential they do have to expand research into diversity-aware recommender systems. Second, we analyse why and how European law and policy can be used to provide researchers with structural access to the data they need to develop diversity-aware news recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Structured Knowledge: Advancing Triple Extraction from Regional Trade Agreements using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for the extraction of structured knowledge in the form of Subject-Predicate-Object triples. We apply the setup for the domain of Economics application. The findings can be applied to a wide range of scenarios, including the creation of economic trade knowledge graphs from natural language legal trade agreement texts. As a use case, we apply the model to regional trade agreement texts to extract trade-related information triples. In particular, we explore the zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot prompting techniques, incorporating positive and negative examples, and evaluate their performance based on quantitative and qualitative metrics. Specifically, we used Llama 3.1 model to process the unstructured regional trade agreement texts and extract triples. We discuss key insights, challenges, and potential future directions, emphasizing the significance of language models in economic applications.</description>

      <title>KEO: Knowledge Extraction on OMIn via Knowledge Graphs and RAG for Safety-Critical Aviation Maintenance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Knowledge Extraction on OMIn (KEO), a domain-specific knowledge extraction and reasoning framework with large language models (LLMs) in safety-critical contexts. Using the Operations and Maintenance Intelligence (OMIn) dataset, we construct a QA benchmark spanning global sensemaking and actionable maintenance tasks. KEO builds a structured Knowledge Graph (KG) and integrates it into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling more coherent, dataset-wide reasoning than traditional text-chunk RAG. We evaluate locally deployable LLMs (Gemma-3, Phi-4, Mistral-Nemo) and employ stronger models (GPT-4o, Llama-3.3) as judges. Experiments show that KEO markedly improves global sensemaking by revealing patterns and system-level insights, while text-chunk RAG remains effective for fine-grained procedural tasks requiring localized retrieval. These findings underscore the promise of KG-augmented LLMs for secure, domain-specific QA and their potential in high-stakes reasoning.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Legal Retrieval: An Action API for Querying the SAT-Graph RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG) addresses core limitations of standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the legal domain by providing a verifiable knowledge graph that models hierarchical structure, temporal evolution, and causal events of legal norms. However, a critical gap remains: how to reliably query this structured knowledge without sacrificing its deterministic properties. This paper introduces the SAT-Graph API, a formal query execution layer centered on canonical actions-atomic, composable, and auditable primitives that isolate probabilistic discovery from deterministic retrieval. These actions enable: (i) high-precision hybrid search; (ii) robust reference resolution; (iii) point-in-time version retrieval; and (iv) auditable causal tracing. We demonstrate how planner-guided agents can decompose complex queries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions. This two-layer architecture transforms retrieval from an opaque black box to a transparent, auditable process, directly addressing Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for high-stakes domains.</description>

      <title>Peeking inside the Black-Box: Reinforcement Learning for Explainable and Accurate Relation Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for relation extraction (RE) that enhances both accuracy and explainability. The framework has two key components: (i) a reasoning mechanism that formulates relation extraction as a series of text-processing steps inspired by cognitive science, and (ii) an optimization process driven by reinforcement learning (RL) with a novel reward function designed to improve both task accuracy and explanation quality. We call our approach CogRE. Our framework addresses the lack of supervision for language-based explanations in traditional RE by promoting outputs that include important relation keywords. These keywords are drawn from a high-quality dictionary that is automatically constructed using an LLM. We evaluate our approach for the task of one-shot RE using two LLMs and two RE datasets. Our experiments show that CogRE improves explanation quality by addressing two common failure patterns in one-shot RE: poor attention focus and limited one-shot learning capability. For example, our cognitive-structured reasoning with Qwen2.5-15B-Instruct on One-shot NYT29 achieves 24.65% F1, surpassing prior reasoning-based designs. Optimizing this approach with RL using our reward further improves performance by +23.46% (absolute). Finally, human evaluation shows that our best model generates relational keywords closely aligned with gold labels, increasing human explanation quality ratings by 54% (relative).</description>

      <title>Soft Reasoning Paths for Knowledge Graph Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reasoning paths are reliable information in knowledge graph completion (KGC) in which algorithms can find strong clues of the actual relation between entities. However, in real-world applications, it is difficult to guarantee that computationally affordable paths exist toward all candidate entities. According to our observation, the prediction accuracy drops significantly when paths are absent. To make the proposed algorithm more stable against the missing path circumstances, we introduce soft reasoning paths. Concretely, a specific learnable latent path embedding is concatenated to each relation to help better model the characteristics of the corresponding paths. The combination of the relation and the corresponding learnable embedding is termed a soft path in our paper. By aligning the soft paths with the reasoning paths, a learnable embedding is guided to learn a generalized path representation of the corresponding relation. In addition, we introduce a hierarchical ranking strategy to make full use of information about the entity, relation, path, and soft path to help improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the model. Extensive experimental results illustrate that our algorithm outperforms the compared state-of-the-art algorithms by a notable margin. The code will be made publicly available after the paper is officially accepted.</description>

      <title>Boosting Text-to-Chart Retrieval through Training with Synthesized Semantic Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charts are crucial for data analysis and decision-making.Text-to-chart retrieval systems have become increasingly important for Business Intelligence (BI), where users need to find relevant charts that match their analytical needs. These needs can be categorized into precise queries that are well-specified and fuzzy queries that are more exploratory -- both require understanding the semantics and context of the charts. However, existing text-to-chart retrieval solutions often fail to capture the semantic content and contextual information of charts, primarily due to the lack of comprehensive metadata (or semantic insights). To address this limitation, we propose a training data development pipeline that automatically synthesizes hierarchical semantic insights for charts, covering visual patterns (visual-oriented), statistical properties (statistics-oriented), and practical applications (task-oriented), which produces 207,498 semantic insights for 69,166 charts. Based on these, we train a CLIP-based model named ChartFinder to learn better representations of charts for text-to-chart retrieval. Our method leverages rich semantic insights during the training phase to develop a model that understands both visual and semantic aspects of charts.To evaluate text-to-chart retrieval performance, we curate the first benchmark, CRBench, for this task with 21,862 charts and 326 text queries from real-world BI applications, with ground-truth labels verified by the crowd workers.Experiments show that ChartFinder significantly outperforms existing methods in text-to-chart retrieval tasks across various settings. For precise queries, ChartFinder achieves up to 66.9% NDCG@10, which is 11.58% higher than state-of-the-art models. In fuzzy query tasks, our method also demonstrates consistent improvements, with an average increase of 5% across nearly all metrics.</description>

      <title>TranSUN: A Preemptive Paradigm to Eradicate Retransformation Bias Intrinsically from Regression Models in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13881v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regression models are crucial in recommender systems. However, retransformation bias problem has been conspicuously neglected within the community. While many works in other fields have devised effective bias correction methods, all of them are post-hoc cures externally to the model, facing practical challenges when applied to real-world recommender systems. Hence, we propose a preemptive paradigm to eradicate the bias intrinsically from the models via minor model refinement. Specifically, a novel TranSUN method is proposed with a joint bias learning manner to offer theoretically guaranteed unbiasedness under empirical superior convergence. It is further generalized into a novel generic regression model family, termed Generalized TranSUN (GTS), which not only offers more theoretical insights but also serves as a generic framework for flexibly developing various bias-free models. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods across data from various domains, which have been successfully deployed in two real-world industrial recommendation scenarios, i.e. product and short video recommendation scenarios in Guess What You Like business domain in the homepage of Taobao App (a leading e-commerce platform with DAU &gt; 300M), to serve the major online traffic.</description>

      <title>FedFlex: Federated Learning for Diverse Netflix Recommendations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The drive for personalization in recommender systems creates a tension between user privacy and the risk of "filter bubbles". Although federated learning offers a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving recommendations, its impact on diversity remains unclear. We introduce FedFlex, a two-stage framework that combines local, on-device fine-tuning of matrix factorization models (SVD and BPR) with a lightweight Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) re-ranking step to promote diversity. We conducted the first live user study of a federated recommender, collecting behavioral data and feedback during a two-week online deployment. Our results show that FedFlex successfully engages users, with BPR outperforming SVD in click-through rate. Re-ranking with MMR consistently improved ranking quality (nDCG) across both models, with statistically significant gains, particularly for BPR. Diversity effects varied: MMR increased coverage for both models and improved intra-list diversity for BPR, but slightly reduced it for SVD, suggesting different interactions between personalization and diversification across models. Our exit questionnaire responses indicated that most users expressed no clear preference between re-ranked and unprocessed lists, implying that increased diversity did not substantially reduce user satisfaction.</description>

      <title>GEM-Bench: A Benchmark for Ad-Injected Response Generation within Generative Engine Marketing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative Engine Marketing (GEM) is an emerging ecosystem for monetizing generative engines, such as LLM-based chatbots, by seamlessly integrating relevant advertisements into their responses. At the core of GEM lies the generation and evaluation of ad-injected responses. However, existing benchmarks are not specifically designed for this purpose, which limits future research. To address this gap, we propose GEM-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for ad-injected response generation in GEM. GEM-Bench includes three curated datasets covering both chatbot and search scenarios, a metric ontology that captures multiple dimensions of user satisfaction and engagement, and several baseline solutions implemented within an extensible multi-agent framework. Our preliminary results indicate that, while simple prompt-based methods achieve reasonable engagement such as click-through rate, they often reduce user satisfaction. In contrast, approaches that insert ads based on pre-generated ad-free responses help mitigate this issue but introduce additional overhead. These findings highlight the need for future research on designing more effective and efficient solutions for generating ad-injected responses in GEM. The benchmark and all related resources are publicly available at https://gem-bench.org/.</description>

      <title>Text Clustering as Classification with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text clustering serves as a fundamental technique for organizing and interpreting unstructured textual data, particularly in contexts where manual annotation is prohibitively costly. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their demonstrated effectiveness across a broad spectrum of NLP tasks, an emerging body of research has begun to explore their potential in the domain of text clustering. However, existing LLM-based approaches still rely on fine-tuned embedding models and sophisticated similarity metrics, rendering them computationally intensive and necessitating domain-specific adaptation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that reframes text clustering as a classification task by harnessing the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs. Our framework eliminates the need for fine-tuning embedding models or intricate clustering algorithms. It comprises two key steps: first, the LLM is prompted to generate a set of candidate labels based on the dataset and then merges semantically similar labels; second, it assigns the most appropriate label to each text sample. By leveraging the advanced natural language understanding and generalization capabilities of LLMs, the proposed approach enables effective clustering with minimal human intervention. Experimental results on diverse datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art embedding-based clustering techniques, while significantly reducing computational complexity and resource requirements. These findings underscore the transformative potential of LLMs in simplifying and enhancing text clustering tasks. We make our code available to the public for utilization at https://github.com/ECNU-Text-Computing/Text-Clustering-via-LLM. We also provide the supplementary Appendix within the repository.</description>

      <title>Improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely utilized to incorporate external knowledge into large language models, thereby enhancing factuality and reducing hallucinations in question-answering (QA) tasks. A standard RAG pipeline consists of several components, such as query rewriting, document retrieval, document filtering, and answer generation. However, these components are typically optimized separately through supervised fine-tuning, which can lead to misalignments between the objectives of individual components and the overarching aim of generating accurate answers. Although recent efforts have explored using reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize specific RAG components, these approaches often focus on simple pipelines with only two components or do not adequately address the complex interdependencies and collaborative interactions among the modules. To overcome these limitations, we propose treating the complex RAG pipeline with multiple components as a multi-agent cooperative task, in which each component can be regarded as an RL agent. Specifically, we present MMOA-RAG, Multi-Module joint Optimization Algorithm for RAG, which employs multi-agent reinforcement learning to harmonize all agents' goals toward a unified reward, such as the F1 score of the final answer. Experiments conducted on various QA benchmarks demonstrate that MMOA-RAG effectively boost the overall performance of the pipeline and outperforms existing baselines. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies validate the contributions of individual components and demonstrate MMOA-RAG can be adapted to different RAG pipelines and benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Epistemic Diversity and Knowledge Collapse in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04226v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to generate lexically, semantically, and stylistically homogenous texts. This poses a risk of knowledge collapse, where homogenous LLMs mediate a shrinking in the range of accessible information over time. Existing works on homogenization are limited by a focus on closed-ended multiple-choice setups or fuzzy semantic features, and do not look at trends across time and cultural contexts. To overcome this, we present a new methodology to measure epistemic diversity, i.e., variation in real-world claims in LLM outputs, which we use to perform a broad empirical study of LLM knowledge collapse. We test 27 LLMs, 155 topics covering 12 countries, and 200 prompt variations sourced from real user chats. For the topics in our study, we show that while newer models tend to generate more diverse claims, nearly all models are less epistemically diverse than a basic web search. We find that model size has a negative impact on epistemic diversity, while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has a positive impact, though the improvement from RAG varies by the cultural context. Finally, compared to a traditional knowledge source (Wikipedia), we find that country-specific claims reflect the English language more than the local one, highlighting a gap in epistemic representation</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning Using Graph Embeddings for Domain Adaptation of Language Models in the Process Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent trends in NLP utilize knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance pretrained language models by incorporating additional knowledge from the graph structures to learn domain-specific terminology or relationships between documents that might otherwise be overlooked. This paper explores how SciNCL, a graph-aware neighborhood contrastive learning methodology originally designed for scientific publications, can be applied to the process industry domain, where text logs contain crucial information about daily operations and are often structured as sparse KGs. Our experiments demonstrate that language models fine-tuned with triplets derived from graph embeddings (GE) outperform a state-of-the-art mE5-large text encoder by 9.8-14.3% (5.45-7.96p) on the proprietary process industry text embedding benchmark (PITEB) while having 3 times fewer parameters.</description>
