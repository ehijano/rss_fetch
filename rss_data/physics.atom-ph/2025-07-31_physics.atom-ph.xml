      <title>Protected quantum gates using qubit doublons in dynamical optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing represents a central challenge in modern science. Neutral atoms in optical lattices have emerged as a leading computing platform, with collisional gates offering a stable mechanism for quantum logic. However, previous experiments have treated ultracold collisions as a dynamically fine-tuned process, which obscures the underlying quantum- geometry and statistics crucial for realising intrinsically robust operations. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a purely geometric two-qubit swap gate by transiently populating qubit doublon states of fermionic atoms in a dynamical optical lattice. The presence of these doublon states, together with fermionic exchange anti-symmetry, enables a two-particle quantum holonomy -- a geometric evolution where dynamical phases are absent. This yields a gate mechanism that is intrinsically protected against fluctuations and inhomogeneities of the confining potentials. The resilience of the gate is further reinforced by time-reversal and chiral symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We experimentally validate this exceptional protection, achieving a loss-corrected amplitude fidelity of $99.91(7)\%$ measured across the entire system consisting of more than $17'000$ atom pairs. When combined with recently developed topological pumping methods for atom transport, our results pave the way for large-scale, highly connected quantum processors. This work introduces a new paradigm for quantum logic, transforming fundamental symmetries and quantum statistics into a powerful resource for fault-tolerant computation.</description>

      <title>Physical Emulation of Nonlinear Spin System Hamiltonians via Closed Loop Feedforward Control of a Collective Atomic Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent decades the field of quantum computation has seen remarkable development. While much progress has been made toward the realization of a fully digital, scalable, and fault tolerant quantum computer, there are still many essential challenges to overcome. In the interim, direct emulation of quantum systems of interest can fill an important gap not only for exploring fundamental questions about many-body physics and the quantum to classical transition, but also for potentially providing alternative methods to verify results from quantum simulations. In this work we will demonstrate a method utilizing closed loop control of the collective magnetic moment of an ensemble of cold neutral atoms via non-destructive measurements to emulate various spin system Hamiltonians. By modifying the feedback control law appropriately we are able to generate nonlinear dynamical behavior in the ensemble, allowing us to explore the physics of collective spin systems at mesoscopic scales. Moreover, controlling the number of atoms in the collective spin can potentially allow us to investigate these dynamics in the transition from fully quantum to the classical limit. In particular, we emulate two models: the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) Hamiltonian, and a closely related model, the Kicked Top. In the former case, we show that our system undergoes a symmetry-breaking phase transition in the expected parameter regime. In the latter, we explore two interesting aspects: the formation of chaos, and a dynamically driven time crystal phase. We will then discuss the advantages and limits of this approach.</description>

      <title>Proposal for realizing Heisenberg-type quantum-spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic-field dependence of the interaction between two Rydberg atoms, $|nS_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$ and $|(n+1)S_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$. In this setting, the effective spin-1/2 Hamiltonian takes the form of an {\it XXZ} model. We show that the anisotropy parameter of the {\it XXZ} model can be tuned by applying a magnetic field, and in particular, that it changes drastically near the F\"orster resonance points. Based on this result, we propose experimental realizations of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg-type quantum spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators, without relying on Floquet engineering. Our results provide guidance for future experiments of Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body phenomena emerging in the Heisenberg model.</description>

      <title>Non-periodic Boundary Conditions for Euler Class and Dynamical Signatures of Obstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the landscape of free-fermion phases has drastically been expanded in the last decades, recently novel multi-gap topological phases were proposed where groups of bands can acquire new invariants such as Euler class. As in conventional single-gap topologies, obstruction plays an inherent role that so far has only been incidentally addressed. We here systematically investigate the nuances of the relation between the non-Bravais lattice configurations and the Brillouin zone boundary conditions (BZBCs) for any number of dimensions. Clarifying the nomenclature, we provide a general periodictization recipe to obtain a gauge with an almost Brillouin-zone-periodic Bloch Hamiltonian both generally and upon imposing a reality condition on Hamiltonians for Euler class. Focusing on three-band $\mathcal{C}_2$ symmetric Euler systems in two dimensions as a guiding example, we present a procedure to enumerate the possible lattice configurations, and thus the unique BZBCs possibilities. We establish a comprehensive classification for the identified BZBC patterns according to the parity constraints they impose on the Euler invariant, highlighting how it extends to more bands and higher dimensions. Moreover, by building upon previous work utilizing Hopf maps, we illustrate physical consequences of non-trivial BZBCs in the quench dynamics of non-Bravais lattice Euler systems, reflecting the parity of the Euler invariant. We numerically confirm our results and corresponding observable signatures, and discuss possible experimental implementations. Our work presents a general framework to study the role of non-trivial boundary conditions and obstructions on multi-gap topology that can be employed for arbitrary number bands or in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>A High-Power Clock Laser Spectrally Tailored for High-Fidelity Quantum State Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Highly frequency-stable lasers are a ubiquitous tool for optical frequency metrology, precision interferometry, and quantum information science. While making a universally applicable laser is unrealistic, spectral noise can be tailored for specific applications. Here we report a high-power 698 nm clock laser with a maximum output of \SI{4}{W} and minimized frequency noise up to a few kHz Fourier frequency, together with long-term instability of $3.5 \times 10^{-17}$ at one to thousands of seconds. The laser frequency noise is precisely characterized with atom-based spectral analysis that employs a pulse sequence designed to suppress sensitivity to intensity noise. This method provides universally applicable tunability of the spectral response and analysis of quantum sensors over a wide frequency range. With the optimized laser system characterized by this technique, we achieve an average single-qubit Clifford gate fidelity of up to $F_1^2 = 0.99964(3)$ when simultaneously driving 3000 optical qubits with a homogeneous Rabi frequency ranging from \SI{10}{Hz} to $\sim$$\SI{1}{kHz}$. This result represents the highest single optical-qubit gate fidelity for large number of atoms.</description>
