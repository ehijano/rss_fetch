      <title>Higher-Order Fermion Interactions in BCS Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of higher-order fermionic deformations in multiflavor Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. Focusing specifically on the 6- and 8-fermion interactions, we show that these terms can have significant consequences on the dynamics of the system. In certain regions of parameter space, the theory continues to exhibit second-order phase transitions with mean-field critical exponents and the same critical temperature; however, the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap can deviate markedly from conventional BCS behavior. In other regions, the theory exhibits first-order phase transitions or second-order phase transitions with non-mean field exponents. We conclude by discussing potential phenomenological applications of these theories.</description>

      <title>Suppression of charge-density wave and superconductivity in a lithiated NbSe$_2$ monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an \textit{ab initio} investigation of the long-range charge density wave (CDW) order and superconducting properties of the pristine and lithiated NbSe$_2$ monolayer. Stable CDW structures are obtained through atomic reconstruction driven by soft-mode distortions and lithiation, respectively, lead to significant electronic modifications that suppress the CDW order. This suppression is attributed to anisotropic atomic distortions, along with a reduction in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level. As a result, the electron--phonon coupling strength is suppressed, particularly in the lithiated structure, due to reduced contributions from low-frequency phonons, primarily associated with in-plane Nb vibrations. Finally, we observe a sizable anisotropy in the superconducting gap on the Fermi surface, with a superconducting transition temperature of approximately 8~K in the distorted, and 4~K in the lithiated, CDW NbSe$_2$ monolayer.</description>

      <title>Spin-Valley Locking and Pure Spin-Triplet Superconductivity in Noncollinear Antiferromagnets Proximitized to Conventional Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconventional antiferromagnets with spin-split bands, such as noncollinear magnets and the recently discovered altermagnets, serve as new constituents to explore unconventional superconductivity. Here, we unveil a new type and previously unappreciated nature of spin-valley locking in noncollinear antiferromagnets and exploit this texture to achieve pure spin-triplet superconductivity. Using chiral antiferromagnetic kagome lattices (e.g., Mn$_3$Ge and Mn$_3$Ga) coupled to conventional $s$-wave superconductors as prototypical examples, we demonstrate that the antiferromagnetic chirality strongly favors spin-triplet pairing via superconducting proximity effect, while suppressing spin-singlet pairing in the antiferromagnets away from the interfaces. Crucially, such a long-sought spin-triplet superconducting state is established without invoking the prevailing mechanism of spin-orbit coupling or net magnetization. Furthermore, the spin-triplet supercurrent is resilient to both in-plane and out-of-plane Zeeman fields, which exhibits distinct superiority to Ising superconductivity, serving as a compelling experimental signature of the triplet pairing and spin-valley-locked texture.</description>

      <title>Material Loss Model Calibration for Tantalum Superconducting Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Material research is a key frontier in advancing superconducting qubit and circuit performance. In this work, we develop a simple and broadly applicable framework for accurately characterizing two-level system (TLS) loss using internal quality factor measurements of superconducting transmission line resonators over a range of temperatures and readout powers. We applied this method to a series of $\alpha$-Ta resonators that span a wide frequency range, thus providing a methodology for probing the loss mechanisms in the fabrication process of this emerging material for superconducting quantum circuits. We introduce an analytical model that captures the loss behavior without relying on numerical simulations, enabling straightforward interpretation and calibration. Additionally, our measurements reveal empirical frequency-dependent trends in key parameters of the model, suggesting contributions from mechanisms beyond the standard tunneling model of TLSs.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in RbH$_{12}$ at low pressures: an \emph{ab initio} study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-pressure polyhydrides are leading contenders for room temperature superconductivity. The next frontier lies in stabilizing them at ambient pressure, which would allow their practical applications. In this first-principles computational study, we investigate the potential for record-low pressure stabilization of binary superhydrides within the RbH$_{12}$ system including lattice quantum anharmonic effects in the calculations. %Within the pressure range of 0 to 100 GPa, we identify five competing phases. We identify five competing phases for the pressure range between 0 and 100 GPa. Incorporating anharmonic and quantum effects on ion dynamics, we find the $Immm$ and $P6_3/mmc$ phases to be the most probable, potentially metastable even at pressures as low as 10 GPa. Notably, all phases exhibit metallic properties, with critical temperatures between 50 and 100 K within the pressure range they are dynamically stable. These findings have the potential to inspire future experimental exploration of high-temperature superconductivity at low pressures in Rb-H binary compounds.</description>

      <title>Streamline controlled rectification of supercurrent in thin-film asymmetric weak links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examined the supercurrent diode effect (SDE) in mesoscopic superconducting weak links formed by asymmetric Dayem bridges. These planar metallic constrictions, which naturally exhibit Josephsonlike behavior, offer a fundamental platform for investigating nonreciprocal transport phenomena in a regime where the bridge width aligns with the superconducting coherence length. The foundational concept is inspired by the Tesla valve, a classical fluidic device that achieves flow rectification through interference and turbulence between fluid streams enabled by geometric asymmetry. Analogously, we demonstrate that spatial asymmetry within superconducting structures can result in rectification due to the polarity-dependent interaction between transport and screening currents. By implementing controlled geometric defects at the junction between the constriction and superconducting leads, we induce current crowding and disrupt spatial inversion symmetry, thus facilitating directional switching behavior. Experimental results indicate a linear-in-field rectification regime at low magnetic fields, driven by the interaction between transport and screening currents, which is succeeded by complex vortex dynamics within the superconducting banks at elevated fields. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations replicate significant features of the experimental observations and substantiate the influence of both screening currents and rearrangements of Abrikosov vortices. A comparative study across various geometries highlights the crucial role of defect shape and spatial confinement in determining the rectification efficiency, revealing a minimum threshold in bridge width below which crowding-induced SDE is significantly reduced. Our findings advocate for mesoscopic Dayem bridges as a flexible platform for designing and controlling superconducting diode functionalities.</description>

      <title>Designing lattice spin models and magnon gaps with supercurrents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling magnetic interactions at the level of individual spins is relevant for a variety of quantum applications, such as qubits, memory and sensor functionality. Finding ways to exert electrical control over spin interactions, with minimal energy dissipation, is a key objective in this endeavour. We show here that spin lattices and magnon gaps can be controlled with a supercurrent. Remarkably, a spin-polarized supercurrent makes the interaction between magnetic adatoms placed on the surface of a superconductor depend not only on their relative distance, but also on their absolute position in space. This property permits electric control over the interaction not only between two individual spins, but in fact over an entire spin lattice, allowing for non-collinear ground states and a practical arena to study the properties of different spin Hamiltonians. Moreover, we show that a supercurrent controls the magnon gap in antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic insulators. These results provide an accessible way to realize electrically controlled spin switching and magnon gaps without dissipative currents.</description>

      <title>Conformable Scaling and Critical Dynamics: A Unified Framework for Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the application of conformable derivatives to model critical phenomena near continuous phase transitions. By incorporating a deformation parameter into the differential structure, we derive unified expressions for thermodynamic observables such as heat capacity, magnetization, susceptibility, and coherence length, each exhibiting power-law behavior near the critical temperature. The conformable derivative framework naturally embeds scale invariance and critical slowing down into the dynamics without resorting to fully nonlocal fractional calculus. Modified Ginzburg-Landau equations are constructed to model superconducting transitions, leading to analytical expressions for the order parameter and London penetration depth. Experimental data from niobium confirm the model's applicability, showing excellent fits and capturing asymmetric scaling behavior around Tc. This work offers a bridge between classical mean-field theory and generalized scaling frameworks, with implications for both theoretical modeling and experimental analysis.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum lattice model: Polaritons, photons, and spin waves propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the propagation of quantum excitations in low-dimensional quantum systems is pivotal for advancing quantum technologies, including communication networks and quantum simulators. We propose a one-dimensional hybrid quantum lattice model comprising coupled cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) units. Each unit integrates a single-mode cavity that interacts with a two-level system (TLS), featuring direct coupling between adjacent TLLs. This configuration enables the coherent propagation of polaritons, spin waves, and photons, depending on the interplay between light-matter coupling and spin-spin interactions. Employing the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, we simulate the dynamics of various excitation configurations and analyze their transport characteristics using local observables. Our analysis reveals the importance of matching impedance and resonance conditions via system parameters for the propagation of different types of excitations or swapping the nature of excitations along the hybrid lattice. These findings offer insight into designing controllable quantum links and single-excitation swaps in low-dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <title>RECP pairing mechanisms and universality in the phase diagram of high-TC cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our novel strong pairing mechanism for high-T_{C} cuprates is introduced via a quantum-information theoretic language. It is based on the quantum entanglement and confinement (or measure of entanglement). There, the resonance concept comes in the form of the equality relations between the entanglement entropy of formations. This can be considered a generalization of Anderson's resonating valence bonds (RVB) theory where the crucial modification lies in the doping-dependent directed long-range entanglement and confinement pairing mechanisms rather than a local nearest neighbor (valence bond) of "directed dimer" configurational states forming the RVB. The RVB is really a two nearest "qubit" entanglement characterized by a constant pairing potential determined by a superexchange J. Because RVB is limited to nearest neighbor bonding, it is limited to singlet pairings and therefore lacks the flexibility of our new pairing mechanism which includes both the triplet and singlet pairings. We refer to our new theory as a resonating entanglement-confinement pair (RECP) theory. Based on RECP theory, we are able to give a conceptual, phenomenological, qualitative and comprehensive explanation of the whole phase diagram of high-T_{C} cuprates, both for hole-doped and electron-doped giving a universality feature of the hole-pairing mechanism in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Universal Diagnostic Criterion for Intrinsic Superconducting Diode Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrinsic superconducting diode effect (SDE) is distinguished from the Josephson diode effect (JDE) by its manifestation of nonreciprocal critical current phenomena within a monolithic superconductor, typically linked to finite-momentum Cooper pairing. The long-standing assumption that SDE requires co-breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries proves to be necessary but not sufficient. In this work, we propose a universal diagnostic criterion. Embodied in two concise inequalities, this criterion enables convenient and intuitive assessment of whether an intrinsic SDE can emerge in a given system without requiring extensive numerical calculations. Furthermore, our universal criterion provides explicit design guidelines for material systems exhibiting intrinsic SDE.</description>

      <title>Reviving the Search for Indium-Based Superconductors: Theoretical Prediction of Semimetallic Superconductivity in Cubic Nd$_3$In</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quest for materials that simultaneously exhibit superconductivity and non trivial topology has drawn significant attention in recent years, driven by their potential to host exotic quantum states. Their unique coexistence often leads to rich physics and potential applications in quantum technologies. Here, we predict cubic Nd$_3$In as an exceptional candidate in this class, combining strong-coupling superconductivity with distinctive topological features. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the strong-coupling superconductivity in Nd$_3$In arises primarily due to pronounced Fermi surface nesting, leading to an electron-phonon coupling constant of $\lambda = 1.39$. Our fully anisotropic Migdal--Eliashberg analysis yields a superconducting transition temperature $T_c \approx 14$ K at ambient pressure, increasing to 18 K under 15 GPa. Beyond superconductivity, Nd$_3$In is found to be a Weyl semimetal, as evidenced by the presence of Fermi arcs and nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants, confirming its topological nature. The combination of strong-coupling superconductivity and nontrivial topological states makes Nd$_3$In a promising candidate for quantum transport and topological quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent photon sources are key elements in different applications, ranging from quantum sensing to quantum computing. The possibility of designing and engineering superconducting circuits behaving like artificial atoms supports the realization of quantum optics protocols, including microwave photons generation. Here we propose and theoretically investigate a design that allows a tunable photon injection directly on-chip. Our approach enables control of the emission via an external knob while preserving, in principle, the stability and linewidth characteristics. This is achieved by replacing the conventional capacitive link between the source and the reservoir with a tunable coupler, with the advantage of avoiding direct dynamical manipulation of the photon source dynamics, providing pulsed control of the emission. We validate the dynamical control of the generated state under the effect of an external flux threading the tunable coupler and discuss the possibility of employing this scheme also in the context of multiple bosonic reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Spin bond order driven by extended repulsive interactions in doped graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the truncated-unity functional renormalization group (TUFRG) to study many-body instabilities of correlated electrons in graphene doped near the van Hove singularity (VHS). The system is described by an extended Hubbard model including several Coulomb repulsions between neighboring sites. With the repulsion parameters, which turn out to be suitable for low-energy consideration of graphene, we find a spin-bond-order phase in the vicinity of the VHS. This phase gives way to a spin-density-wave phase when involving a weak additional screening. The ground-state phase diagram is presented in the space of the doping level and the screening parameter. We describe in detail both of these spin-ordered states by using recently developed TUFRG + MF scheme, i.e., a combined approach of TUFRG and mean-field (MF) theory. The collinear states are energetically preferable in both cases of the spin bond order and the spin-density wave. But if the third-nearest-neighbor hopping is absent, these spin orders become chiral. The band structures of two collinear spin-ordered states are presented, revealing the metallic behavior of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For all collinear altermagnets, we sort out piezomagnetic free-energy invariants allowed in the nonrelativistic limit and relativistic piezomagnetic invariants bilinear in the N\'eel vector $\mathbf{L}$ and magnetization $\mathbf{M}$, which include strain-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The symmetry-allowed responses are fully determined by the nonrelativistic spin Laue group. In the nonrelativistic limit, two distinct mechanisms are discussed: the band-filling mechanism, which exists in metals and is illustrated using the simple two-dimensional Lieb lattice model, and the temperature-dependent exchange-driven mechanism, which is illustrated using first-principles calculations for transition-metal fluorides. The leading second-order nonrelativistic term in the strain-induced magnetization is also obtained for CrSb. Piezomagnetism due to the strain-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is calculated from first principles for transition-metal fluorides, MnTe, and CrSb. Finally, we discuss triplet superconducting correlations supported by altermagnets and protected by inversion rather than time-reversal symmetry. We apply the nonrelativistic classification of Cooper pairs to describe the interplay between strain and superconductivity in the two-dimensional Lieb lattice and in bulk rutile structures. We show that triplet superconductivity is, on average, unitary in an unstrained altermagnet, but becomes non-unitary under piezomagnetically active strain.</description>

Abstract: Antiferromagnetism and superconductivity are often viewed as competing orders in correlated electron systems. Here, we demonstrate that kinetic frustration in hole motion facilitates their coexistence within the square-lattice repulsive Hubbard model. Combining exact analytical solutions on tailored geometries with large-scale numerical simulations, we reveal a robust pairing mechanism: holes on opposite sublattices behave as if they carry opposite effective charges due to spin singlet formation from kinetic frustration. This emergent property suppresses phase separation and fosters a coherent $d$-wave superconducting channel embedded within a long-range antiferromagnetic background. Our findings establish a minimal yet broadly applicable framework for stabilizing strong-coupling superconductivity in doped Mott insulators.</description>
