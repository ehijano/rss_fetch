      <title>Feasibility of a co-designed online nutrition education program for people with multiple sclerosis</title>

Abstract: Objective: Diet quality is important for people with multiple sclerosis (MS), but conflicting online information causes them confusion. People with MS want evidence-based MS-specific information to help them make healthy dietary changes, and we co-designed an asynchronous, online nutrition education program (Eating Well with MS) with the MS community. Our aim was to determine the feasibility of Eating Well with MS. Methods: We used a single-arm pre-post design. The feasibility trial was a nine-week intervention with adults with confirmed MS. Feasibility outcomes: 1) demand (recruitment); 2) practicality (completion); 3) acceptability (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory: interest/enjoyment and value/usefulness subscales); and 4) limited efficacy testing (Diet Habits Questionnaire (DHQ); Critical Nutrition Literacy Tool (CNLT); Food Literacy Behaviour Checklist (FLBC)). Results: The recruitment target (n=70) was reached. 87% completed at least one module and 57% completed the full program (five modules). The median interest/enjoyment rating was 5 out of 7 and median value/usefulness rating was 6 out of 7 (where 7 = very true). Compared to pre-program, participants who completed any of the program had statistically significantly improved DHQ, CNLT, and FLBC scores. Conclusion: Eating Well with MS was well received by the MS community and improved their dietary behaviours; demonstrating feasibility. Our findings support the use of co-design methods when developing resources to improve dietary behaviours.</description>

      <title>Evaluating experiences in a digital nutrition education program for people with multiple sclerosis: a qualitative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex immune-mediated disease with no currently known cure. There is growing evidence to support the role of diet in reducing some of the symptoms and disease progression in MS, and we previously developed and tested the feasibility of a digital nutrition education program for people with MS. Objective The aim of this study was to explore factors that influenced engagement in the digital nutrition education program, including features influencing capability, opportunity, and motivation to change their dietary behaviours. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with people who MS who completed some or all of the program, until data saturation was reached. Interviews were analysed inductively using thematic analysis. Themes were deductively mapped against the COM-B behaviour change model. Results 16 interviews were conducted with participants who completed all (n=10) or some of the program (n=6). Four themes emerged: 1) Acquiring and validating nutrition knowledge; 2) Influence of time and social support; 3) Getting in early to improve health; and 4) Accounting for food literacy experiences. Discussion This is the first online nutrition program with suitable behavioural supports for people with MS. It highlights the importance of disease-specific and evidence-based nutrition education to support people with MS to make dietary changes. Acquiring nutrition knowledge, coupled with practical support mechanisms such as recipe booklets and goal-setting, emerged as crucial for facilitating engagement with the program. Conclusions When designing education programs for people with MS and other neurological conditions, healthcare professionals and program designers should consider flexible delivery and building peer support to address the needs and challenges faced by participants.</description>
