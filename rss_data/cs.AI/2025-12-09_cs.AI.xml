      <title>Going All-In on LLM Accuracy: Fake Prediction Markets, Real Confidence Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used to evaluate other models, yet these judgments typically lack any representation of confidence. This pilot study tests whether framing an evaluation task as a betting game (a fictional prediction market with its own LLM currency) improves forecasting accuracy and surfaces calibrated confidence signals. We generated 100 math and logic questions with verifiable answers. Six Baseline models (three current-generation, three prior-generation) answered all items. Three Predictor models then forecasted, for each question-baseline pair, if the baseline would answer correctly. Each predictor completed matched runs in two conditions: Control (simple correct/incorrect predictions) and Incentive (predictions plus wagers of 1-100,000 LLMCoin under even odds, starting from a 1,000,000 LLMCoin bankroll). Across 5,400 predictions per condition, Incentive runs showed modestly higher accuracy (81.5% vs. 79.1%, p = .089, d = 0.86) and significantly faster learning across rounds (12.0 vs. 2.9 percentage-point improvement from Round 1 to Round 4, p = .011). Most notably, stake size tracked confidence. "Whale" bets of 40,000+ coins were correct ~99% of the time, while small bets (&lt;1,000 coins) showed only ~74% accuracy. The key finding is not that fictional money makes models smarter; accuracy gains were modest and did not reach statistical significance (p = .089) in this pilot. Rather, the betting mechanic created a legible confidence signal absent from binary yes/no outputs. This suggests that simple financial framing may help transform LLMs into risk-aware forecasters, making their internal beliefs visible and usable. The protocol offers a foundation for future work for meta-evaluation systems and what may become LLM-to-LLM prediction markets.</description>

      <title>Deep learning for autism detection using clinical notes: A comparison of transfer learning for a transparent and black-box approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition whose rising prevalence places increasing demands on a lengthy diagnostic process. Machine learning (ML) has shown promise in automating ASD diagnosis, but most existing models operate as black boxes and are typically trained on a single dataset, limiting their generalizability. In this study, we introduce a transparent and interpretable ML approach that leverages BioBERT, a state-of-the-art language model, to analyze unstructured clinical text. The model is trained to label descriptions of behaviors and map them to diagnostic criteria, which are then used to assign a final label (ASD or not). We evaluate transfer learning, the ability to transfer knowledge to new data, using two distinct real-world datasets. We trained on datasets sequentially and mixed together and compared the performance of the best models and their ability to transfer to new data. We also created a black-box approach and repeated this transfer process for comparison. Our transparent model demonstrated robust performance, with the mixed-data training strategy yielding the best results (97 % sensitivity, 98 % specificity). Sequential training across datasets led to a slight drop in performance, highlighting the importance of training data order. The black-box model performed worse (90 % sensitivity, 96 % specificity) when trained sequentially or with mixed data. Overall, our transparent approach outperformed the black-box approach. Mixing datasets during training resulted in slightly better performance and should be the preferred approach when practically possible. This work paves the way for more trustworthy, generalizable, and clinically actionable AI tools in neurodevelopmental diagnostics.</description>

      <title>ARCANE: A Multi-Agent Framework for Interpretable and Configurable Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As agents based on large language models are increasingly deployed to long-horizon tasks, maintaining their alignment with stakeholder preferences becomes critical. Effective alignment in such settings requires reward models that are interpretable so that stakeholders can understand and audit model objectives. Moreover, reward models must be capable of steering agents at interaction time, allowing preference shifts to be incorporated without retraining. We introduce ARCANE, a framework that frames alignment as a multi-agent collaboration problem that dynamically represents stakeholder preferences as natural-language rubrics: weighted sets of verifiable criteria that can be generated on-the-fly from task context. Inspired by utility theory, we formulate rubric learning as a reconstruction problem and apply a regularized Group-Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) procedure that balances interpretability, faithfulness, and computational efficiency. Using a corpus of 219 labeled rubrics derived from the GDPVal benchmark, we evaluate ARCANE on challenging tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and tool use. The learned rubrics produce compact, legible evaluations and enable configurable trade-offs (e.g., correctness vs. conciseness) without retraining. Our results show that rubric-based reward models offer a promising path toward interpretable, test-time adaptive alignment for complex, long-horizon AI systems.</description>

      <title>On measuring grounding and generalizing grounding problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symbol grounding problem asks how tokens like cat can be about cats, as opposed to mere shapes manipulated in a calculus. We recast grounding from a binary judgment into an audit across desiderata, each indexed by an evaluation tuple (context, meaning type, threat model, reference distribution): authenticity (mechanisms reside inside the agent and, for strong claims, were acquired through learning or evolution); preservation (atomic meanings remain intact); faithfulness, both correlational (realized meanings match intended ones) and etiological (internal mechanisms causally contribute to success); robustness (graceful degradation under declared perturbations); compositionality (the whole is built systematically from the parts). We apply this framework to four grounding modes (symbolic; referential; vectorial; relational) and three case studies: model-theoretic semantics achieves exact composition but lacks etiological warrant; large language models show correlational fit and local robustness for linguistic tasks, yet lack selection-for-success on world tasks without grounded interaction; human language meets the desiderata under strong authenticity through evolutionary and developmental acquisition. By operationalizing a philosophical inquiry about representation, we equip philosophers of science, computer scientists, linguists, and mathematicians with a common language and technical framework for systematic investigation of grounding and meaning.</description>

      <title>AI Application in Anti-Money Laundering for Sustainable and Transparent Financial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Money laundering and financial fraud remain major threats to global financial stability, costing trillions annually and challenging regulatory oversight. This paper reviews how artificial intelligence (AI) applications can modernize Anti-Money Laundering (AML) workflows by improving detection accuracy, lowering false-positive rates, and reducing the operational burden of manual investigations, thereby supporting more sustainable development. It further highlights future research directions including federated learning for privacy-preserving collaboration, fairness-aware and interpretable AI, reinforcement learning for adaptive defenses, and human-in-the-loop visualization systems to ensure that next-generation AML architectures remain transparent, accountable, and robust. In the final part, the paper proposes an AI-driven KYC application that integrates graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG Graph) with generative models to enhance efficiency, transparency, and decision support in KYC processes related to money-laundering detection. Experimental results show that the RAG-Graph architecture delivers high faithfulness and strong answer relevancy across diverse evaluation settings, thereby enhancing the efficiency and transparency of KYC CDD/EDD workflows and contributing to more sustainable, resource-optimized compliance practices.</description>

      <title>How Sharp and Bias-Robust is a Model? Dual Evaluation Perspectives on Knowledge Graph Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing facts from the observed KG. While a number of KGC models have been studied, the evaluation of KGC still remain underexplored. In this paper, we observe that existing metrics overlook two key perspectives for KGC evaluation: (A1) predictive sharpness -- the degree of strictness in evaluating an individual prediction, and (A2) popularity-bias robustness -- the ability to predict low-popularity entities. Toward reflecting both perspectives, we propose a novel evaluation framework (PROBE), which consists of a rank transformer (RT) estimating the score of each prediction based on a required level of predictive sharpness and a rank aggregator (RA) aggregating all the scores in a popularity-aware manner. Experiments on real-world KGs reveal that existing metrics tend to over- or under-estimate the accuracy of KGC models, whereas PROBE yields a comprehensive understanding of KGC models and reliable evaluation results.</description>

      <title>DaGRPO: Rectifying Gradient Conflict in Reasoning via Distinctiveness-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm shift from superficial instruction following to rigorous long-horizon reasoning. While Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a pivotal mechanism for eliciting such post-training reasoning capabilities due to its exceptional performance, it remains plagued by significant training instability and poor sample efficiency. We theoretically identify the root cause of these issues as the lack of distinctiveness within on-policy rollouts: for routine queries, highly homogeneous samples induce destructive gradient conflicts; whereas for hard queries, the scarcity of valid positive samples results in ineffective optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose Distinctiveness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (DaGRPO). DaGRPO incorporates two core mechanisms: (1) Sequence-level Gradient Rectification, which utilizes fine-grained scoring to dynamically mask sample pairs with low distinctiveness, thereby eradicating gradient conflicts at the source; and (2) Off-policy Data Augmentation, which introduces high-quality anchors to recover training signals for challenging tasks. Extensive experiments across 9 mathematical reasoning and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization benchmarks demonstrate that DaGRPO significantly surpasses existing SFT, GRPO, and hybrid baselines, achieving new state-of-the-art performance (e.g., a +4.7% average accuracy gain on math benchmarks). Furthermore, in-depth analysis confirms that DaGRPO effectively mitigates gradient explosion and accelerates the emergence of long-chain reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Less Is More for Multi-Step Logical Reasoning of LLM Generalisation Under Rule Removal, Paraphrasing, and Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across many natural language tasks, yet their generalisation to structural perturbations in logical contexts remains poorly understood. We introduce a controlled evaluation framework that probes reasoning reliability through four targeted stress tests: (1) rule deletion, removing either redundant or essential rules from a multi-step inference chain; (2) contradictory evidence injection; (3) logic-preserving rewrites generated through several families of equivalence laws (contrapositive, double negation, implication, De Morgan, identity, and commutativity); and (4) multi-law equivalence stacking that introduces 2-5 simultaneous logical transformations.
  Across three representative model families: BERT, Qwen2, and LLaMA-like models. Our experiments reveal a strikingly consistent pattern: all models achieve perfect accuracy on the base tasks and remain fully generalise to redundant rule deletion and all equivalence-based rewrites (single or multi-law), but fail sharply under essential rule deletion (dropping to 25% accuracy) and collapse completely in the presence of explicit contradictions (0% accuracy). These results demonstrate that LLMs possess stable invariance to semantic-preserving logical transformations, yet remain fundamentally brittle to missing or conflicting evidence. Our framework provides a clean diagnostic tool for isolating such reasoning failure modes and highlights persistent gaps in the logical generalisation abilities of current LLMs.</description>

      <title>GENIUS: An Agentic AI Framework for Autonomous Design and Execution of Simulation Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive atomistic simulations have propelled materials discovery, yet routine setup and debugging still demand computer specialists. This know-how gap limits Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME), where state-of-the-art codes exist but remain cumbersome for non-experts. We address this bottleneck with GENIUS, an AI-agentic workflow that fuses a smart Quantum ESPRESSO knowledge graph with a tiered hierarchy of large language models supervised by a finite-state error-recovery machine. Here we show that GENIUS translates free-form human-generated prompts into validated input files that run to completion on $\approx$80% of 295 diverse benchmarks, where 76% are autonomously repaired, with success decaying exponentially to a 7% baseline. Compared with LLM-only baselines, GENIUS halves inference costs and virtually eliminates hallucinations. The framework democratizes electronic-structure DFT simulations by intelligently automating protocol generation, validation, and repair, opening large-scale screening and accelerating ICME design loops across academia and industry worldwide.</description>

      <title>UncertaintyZoo: A Unified Toolkit for Quantifying Predictive Uncertainty in Deep Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) are increasingly expanding their real-world applications across domains, e.g., question answering, autonomous driving, and automatic software development. Despite this achievement, LLMs, as data-driven systems, often make incorrect predictions, which can lead to potential losses in safety-critical scenarios. To address this issue and measure the confidence of model outputs, multiple uncertainty quantification(UQ) criteria have been proposed. However, even though important, there are limited tools to integrate these methods, hindering the practical usage of UQ methods and future research in this domain. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we introduce UncertaintyZoo, a unified toolkit that integrates 29 uncertainty quantification methods, covering five major categories under a standardized interface. Using UncertaintyZoo, we evaluate the usefulness of existing uncertainty quantification methods under the code vulnerability detection task on CodeBERT and ChatGLM3 models. The results demonstrate that UncertaintyZoo effectively reveals prediction uncertainty. The tool with a demonstration video is available on the project site https://github.com/Paddingbuta/UncertaintyZoo.</description>

      <title>Smart Spatial Planning in Egypt: An Algorithm-Driven Approach to Public Service Evaluation in Qena City</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: National planning standards for public services in Egypt often fail to align with unique local characteristics. Addressing this gap, this study develops a tailored planning model for Qena City. Using a hybrid methodology (descriptive, analytical, and experimental), the research utilizes Python programming to generate an intelligent spatial analysis algorithm based on Voronoi Diagrams. This approach creates city-specific planning criteria and evaluates the current coverage of public facilities. The primary contribution of this study is the successful derivation of a localized planning standards model and the deployment of an automated algorithm to assess service efficiency. Application of this model reveals a general service coverage average of 81.3%. Ambulance stations demonstrated the highest efficiency (99.8%) due to recent upgrades, while parks and open spaces recorded the lowest coverage (10%) caused by limited land availability. Spatial analysis indicates a high service density in midtown (&gt;45 services/km^2), which diminishes significantly towards the outskirts (&lt;5 services/km^2). Consequently, the Hajer Qena district contains the highest volume of unserved areas, while the First District (Qesm 1) exhibits the highest level of service coverage. This model offers a replicable framework for data-driven urban planning in Egyptian cities.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Belief Boxes and Open-mindedness on Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As multi-agent systems are increasingly utilized for reasoning and decision-making applications, there is a greater need for LLM-based agents to have something resembling propositional beliefs. One simple method for doing so is to include statements describing beliefs maintained in the prompt space (in what we'll call their belief boxes). But when agents have such statements in belief boxes, how does it actually affect their behaviors and dispositions towards those beliefs? And does it significantly affect agents' ability to be persuasive in multi-agent scenarios? Likewise, if the agents are given instructions to be open-minded, how does that affect their behaviors? We explore these and related questions in a series of experiments. Our findings confirm that instructing agents to be open-minded affects how amenable they are to belief change. We show that incorporating belief statements and their strengths influences an agent's resistance to (and persuasiveness against) opposing viewpoints. Furthermore, it affects the likelihood of belief change, particularly when the agent is outnumbered in a debate by opposing viewpoints, i.e., peer pressure scenarios. The results demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the belief box technique in reasoning and decision-making tasks.</description>

      <title>FlatFormer: A Flat Transformer Knowledge Tracing Model Based on Cognitive Bias Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) models face a critical ``Performance-Complexity Trap'': capturing complex cognitive dynamics like learning sessions and memory decay typically requires deep hierarchical architectures, which incur prohibitive computational costs for real-time deployment. To resolve this, we propose FlatFormer, a streamlined architecture based on the novel design paradigm of ``Information Injection over Structural Stacking.'' Unlike parameter-heavy hierarchical models, FlatFormer leverages a standard flat Transformer augmented with two lightweight injection mechanisms: (i) a hybrid input encoding strategy combining learnable session identifiers with fixed sinusoidal step embeddings; and (ii) a pre-computed power-law bias integrated directly into attention logits to explicitly model the forgetting curve. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets (e.g., EdNet, Junyi) show that FlatFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance. For example, on the EdNet dataset, compared to the strongest hierarchical baseline (HiTSKT), its absolute AUC increased by 8.3%, while using less than 15% of parameters, and inference speed was about three times faster. These results validate that high cognitive fidelity does not necessitate architectural complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06653v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DeepSearch paradigms have become a core enabler for deep reasoning models, allowing them to invoke external search tools to access up-to-date, domain-specific knowledge beyond parametric boundaries, thereby enhancing the depth and factual reliability of reasoning. Building upon this foundation, recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have further empowered models to autonomously and strategically control search tool usage, optimizing when and how to query external knowledge sources. Yet, these RL-driven DeepSearch systems often reveal a see-saw trade-off between accuracy and efficiency-frequent tool invocations can improve factual correctness but lead to unnecessary computational overhead and diminished efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose LightSearcher, an efficient RL framework that incorporates textual experiential memory by learning contrastive reasoning trajectories to generate interpretable summaries of successful reasoning patterns. In addition, it employs an adaptive reward shaping mechanism that penalizes redundant tool calls only in correct-answer scenarios. This design effectively balances the inherent accuracy-efficiency trade-off in DeepSearch paradigms. Experiments on four multi-hop QA benchmarks show that LightSearcher maintains accuracy comparable to SOTA baseline ReSearch, while reducing search tool invocations by 39.6%, inference time by 48.6%, and token consumption by 21.2%, demonstrating its superior efficiency.</description>

      <title>Academic journals' AI policies fail to curb the surge in AI-assisted academic writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid integration of generative AI into academic writing has prompted widespread policy responses from journals and publishers. However, the effectiveness of these policies remains unclear. Here, we analyze 5,114 journals and over 5.2 million papers to evaluate the real-world impact of AI usage guidelines. We show that despite 70% of journals adopting AI policies (primarily requiring disclosure), researchers' use of AI writing tools has increased dramatically across disciplines, with no significant difference between journals with or without policies. Non-English-speaking countries, physical sciences, and high-OA journals exhibit the highest growth rates. Crucially, full-text analysis on 164k scientific publications reveals a striking transparency gap: Of the 75k papers published since 2023, only 76 (0.1%) explicitly disclosed AI use. Our findings suggest that current policies have largely failed to promote transparency or restrain AI adoption. We urge a re-evaluation of ethical frameworks to foster responsible AI integration in science.</description>

      <title>Stochasticity in Agentic Evaluations: Quantifying Inconsistency with Intraclass Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models become components of larger agentic systems, evaluation reliability becomes critical: unreliable sub-agents introduce brittleness into downstream system behavior. Yet current evaluation practice, reporting a single accuracy number from a single run, obscures the variance underlying these results, making it impossible to distinguish genuine capability improvements from lucky sampling. We propose adopting Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), a metric from measurement science, to characterize this variance. ICC decomposes observed variance into between-query variance (task difficulty) and within-query variance (agent inconsistency), highlighting whether reported results reflect true capability or measurement noise. We evaluated on GAIA (Levels 1-3, measuring agentic capabilities across varying reasoning complexity) and FRAMES (measuring retrieval and factuality across multiple documents). We found that ICC varies dramatically with task structure, with reasoning and retrieval tasks (FRAMES) exhibit ICC=0.4955-0.7118 across models, and agentic tasks (GAIA) exhibiting ICC=0.304-0.774 across models. For sub-agent replacement decisions in agentic systems, accuracy improvements are only trustworthy if ICC also improves. We demonstrate that ICC converges by n=8-16 trials for structured tasks and n&gt;=32 for complex reasoning, enabling practitioners to set evidence-based resampling budgets. We recommend reporting accuracy alongside ICC and within-query variance as standard practice, and propose updated Evaluation Cards capturing these metrics. By making evaluation stability visible, we aim to transform agentic benchmarking from opaque leaderboard competition to trustworthy experimental science.

      <title>Cognitive Control Architecture (CCA): A Lifecycle Supervision Framework for Robustly Aligned AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents exhibit significant vulnerability to Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks. These attacks hijack agent behavior by polluting external information sources, exploiting fundamental trade-offs between security and functionality in existing defense mechanisms. This leads to malicious and unauthorized tool invocations, diverting agents from their original objectives. The success of complex IPIs reveals a deeper systemic fragility: while current defenses demonstrate some effectiveness, most defense architectures are inherently fragmented. Consequently, they fail to provide full integrity assurance across the entire task execution pipeline, forcing unacceptable multi-dimensional compromises among security, functionality, and efficiency. Our method is predicated on a core insight: no matter how subtle an IPI attack, its pursuit of a malicious objective will ultimately manifest as a detectable deviation in the action trajectory, distinct from the expected legitimate plan. Based on this, we propose the Cognitive Control Architecture (CCA), a holistic framework achieving full-lifecycle cognitive supervision. CCA constructs an efficient, dual-layered defense system through two synergistic pillars: (i) proactive and preemptive control-flow and data-flow integrity enforcement via a pre-generated "Intent Graph"; and (ii) an innovative "Tiered Adjudicator" that, upon deviation detection, initiates deep reasoning based on multi-dimensional scoring, specifically designed to counter complex conditional attacks. Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark substantiate that CCA not only effectively withstands sophisticated attacks that challenge other advanced defense methods but also achieves uncompromised security with notable efficiency and robustness, thereby reconciling the aforementioned multi-dimensional trade-off.</description>

      <title>ProAgent: Harnessing On-Demand Sensory Contexts for Proactive LLM Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are emerging to transform daily life. However, existing LLM agents primarily follow a reactive paradigm, relying on explicit user instructions to initiate services, which increases both physical and cognitive workload. In this paper, we propose ProAgent, the first end-to-end proactive agent system that harnesses massive sensory contexts and LLM reasoning to deliver proactive assistance. ProAgent first employs a proactive-oriented context extraction approach with on-demand tiered perception to continuously sense the environment and derive hierarchical contexts that incorporate both sensory and persona cues. ProAgent then adopts a context-aware proactive reasoner to map these contexts to user needs and tool calls, providing proactive assistance. We implement ProAgent on Augmented Reality (AR) glasses with an edge server and extensively evaluate it on a real-world testbed, a public dataset, and through a user study. Results show that ProAgent achieves up to 33.4% higher proactive prediction accuracy, 16.8% higher tool-calling F1 score, and notable improvements in user satisfaction over state-of-the-art baselines, marking a significant step toward proactive assistants. A video demonstration of ProAgent is available at https://youtu.be/pRXZuzvrcVs.</description>

      <title>DoVer: Intervention-Driven Auto Debugging for LLM Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06749v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems are challenging to debug because failures often arise from long, branching interaction traces. The prevailing practice is to leverage LLMs for log-based failure localization, attributing errors to a specific agent and step. However, this paradigm has two key limitations: (i) log-only debugging lacks validation, producing untested hypotheses, and (ii) single-step or single-agent attribution is often ill-posed, as we find that multiple distinct interventions can independently repair the failed task. To address the first limitation, we introduce DoVer, an intervention-driven debugging framework, which augments hypothesis generation with active verification through targeted interventions (e.g., editing messages, altering plans). For the second limitation, rather than evaluating on attribution accuracy, we focus on measuring whether the system resolves the failure or makes quantifiable progress toward task success, reflecting a more outcome-oriented view of debugging. Within the Magnetic-One agent framework, on the datasets derived from GAIA and AssistantBench, DoVer flips 18-28% of failed trials into successes, achieves up to 16% milestone progress, and validates or refutes 30-60% of failure hypotheses. DoVer also performs effectively on a different dataset (GSMPlus) and agent framework (AG2), where it recovers 49% of failed trials. These results highlight intervention as a practical mechanism for improving reliability in agentic systems and open opportunities for more robust, scalable debugging methods for LLM-based multi-agent systems. Project website and code will be available at https://aka.ms/DoVer.</description>

      <title>Decouple to Generalize: Context-First Self-Evolving Learning for Data-Scarce Vision-Language Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable reasoning through reinforcement learning (RL), which provides a feasible solution for realizing continuous self-evolving large vision-language models (LVLMs) in the era of experience. However, RL for VLMs requires abundant high-quality multimodal data, especially challenging in specialized domains like chemistry, earth sciences, and multimodal mathematics. Existing strategies such as synthetic data and self-rewarding mechanisms suffer from limited distributions and alignment difficulties, ultimately causing reward hacking: models exploit high-reward patterns, collapsing policy entropy and destabilizing training. We propose DoGe (Decouple to Generalize), a dual-decoupling framework that guides models to first learn from context rather than problem solving by refocusing on the problem context scenarios overlooked by synthetic data methods. By decoupling learning process into dual components (Thinker and Solver), we reasonably quantify the reward signals of this process and propose a two-stage RL post-training approach from freely exploring context to practically solving tasks. Second, to increase the diversity of training data, DoGe constructs an evolving curriculum learning pipeline: an expanded native domain knowledge corpus and an iteratively evolving seed problems pool. Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms the baseline across various benchmarks, providing a scalable pathway for realizing self-evolving LVLMs.</description>

      <title>JT-DA: Enhancing Data Analysis with Tool-Integrated Table Reasoning Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present JT-DA-8B (JiuTian Data Analyst 8B), a specialized large language model designed for complex table reasoning tasks across diverse real-world scenarios. To address the lack of high-quality supervision in tabular reasoning scenarios, we construct a comprehensive and diverse training corpus with 34 well-defined table reasoning tasks, by aggregating 29 public table QA datasets and 3 million tables. An automatic pipeline is proposed to generate realistic multi-step analytical tasks involving reasoning patterns. The model is trained upon open-source JT-Coder-8B model, an 8B-parameter decoder-only foundation model trained from scratch. In the training stage, we leverage LLM-based scoring and workflow-aligned filtering to distill high-quality, table-centric data. Both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement learning (RL) are adopted to optimize our model. Afterwards, a four-stage table reasoning workflow is proposed, including table preprocessing, table sensing, tool-integrated reasoning, and prompt engineering, to improve model interpretability and execution accuracy. Experimental results show that JT-DA-8B achieves strong performance in various table reasoning tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of data-centric generation and workflow-driven optimization.</description>

      <title>Do Persona-Infused LLMs Affect Performance in a Strategic Reasoning Game?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although persona prompting in large language models appears to trigger different styles of generated text, it is unclear whether these translate into measurable behavioral differences, much less whether they affect decision-making in an adversarial strategic environment that we provide as open-source. We investigate the impact of persona prompting on strategic performance in PERIL, a world-domination board game. Specifically, we compare the effectiveness of persona-derived heuristic strategies to those chosen manually. Our findings reveal that certain personas associated with strategic thinking improve game performance, but only when a mediator is used to translate personas into heuristic values. We introduce this mediator as a structured translation process, inspired by exploratory factor analysis, that maps LLM-generated inventory responses into heuristics. Results indicate our method enhances heuristic reliability and face validity compared to directly inferred heuristics, allowing us to better study the effect of persona types on decision making. These insights advance our understanding of how persona prompting influences LLM-based decision-making and propose a heuristic generation method that applies psychometric principles to LLMs.</description>

      <title>On Memory: A comparison of memory mechanisms in world models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: World models enable agents to plan within imagined environments by predicting future states conditioned on past observations and actions. However, their ability to plan over long horizons is limited by the effective memory span of the backbone architecture. This limitation leads to perceptual drift in long rollouts, hindering the model's capacity to perform loop closures within imagined trajectories. In this work, we investigate the effective memory span of transformer-based world models through an analysis of several memory augmentation mechanisms. We introduce a taxonomy that distinguishes between memory encoding and memory injection mechanisms, motivating their roles in extending the world model's memory through the lens of residual stream dynamics. Using a state recall evaluation task, we measure the memory recall of each mechanism and analyze its respective trade-offs. Our findings show that memory mechanisms improve the effective memory span in vision transformers and provide a path to completing loop closures within a world model's imagination.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Encoder-Decoder Architecture Agents to Identify Optimal Resection Location in Glioblastoma Multiforme Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, there is a noticeable lack of AI in the medical field to support doctors in treating heterogenous brain tumors such as Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), the deadliest human cancer in the world with a five-year survival rate of just 5.1%. This project develops an AI system offering the only end-to-end solution by aiding doctors with both diagnosis and treatment planning. In the diagnosis phase, a sequential decision-making framework consisting of 4 classification models (Convolutional Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine) are used. Each model progressively classifies the patient's brain into increasingly specific categories, with the final step being named diagnosis. For treatment planning, an RL system consisting of 3 generative models is used. First, the resection model (diffusion model) analyzes the diagnosed GBM MRI and predicts a possible resection outcome. Second, the radiotherapy model (Spatio-Temporal Vision Transformer) generates an MRI of the brain's progression after a user-defined number of weeks. Third, the chemotherapy model (Diffusion Model) produces the post-treatment MRI. A survival rate calculator (Convolutional Neural Network) then checks if the generated post treatment MRI has a survival rate within 15% of the user defined target. If not, a feedback loop using proximal policy optimization iterates over this system until an optimal resection location is identified. When compared to existing solutions, this project found 3 key findings: (1) Using a sequential decision-making framework consisting of 4 small diagnostic models reduced computing costs by 22.28x, (2) Transformers regression capabilities decreased tumor progression inference time by 113 hours, and (3) Applying Augmentations resembling Real-life situations improved overall DICE scores by 2.9%. These results project to increase survival rates by 0.9%, potentially saving approximately 2,250 lives.</description>

      <title>ClinNoteAgents: An LLM Multi-Agent System for Predicting and Interpreting Heart Failure 30-Day Readmission from Clinical Notes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heart failure (HF) is one of the leading causes of rehospitalization among older adults in the United States. Although clinical notes contain rich, detailed patient information and make up a large portion of electronic health records (EHRs), they remain underutilized for HF readmission risk analysis. Traditional computational models for HF readmission often rely on expert-crafted rules, medical thesauri, and ontologies to interpret clinical notes, which are typically written under time pressure and may contain misspellings, abbreviations, and domain-specific jargon. We present ClinNoteAgents, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that transforms free-text clinical notes into (1) structured representations of clinical and social risk factors for association analysis and (2) clinician-style abstractions for HF 30-day readmission prediction. We evaluate ClinNoteAgents on 3,544 notes from 2,065 patients (readmission rate=35.16%), demonstrating strong performance in extracting risk factors from free-text, identifying key contributing factors, and predicting readmission risk. By reducing reliance on structured fields and minimizing manual annotation and model training, ClinNoteAgents provides a scalable and interpretable approach to note-based HF readmission risk modeling in data-limited healthcare systems.</description>

      <title>VIGIL: A Reflective Runtime for Self-Healing Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07094v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic LLM frameworks promise autonomous behavior via task decomposition, tool use, and iterative planning, but most deployed systems remain brittle. They lack runtime introspection, cannot diagnose their own failure modes, and do not improve over time without human intervention. In practice, many agent stacks degrade into decorated chains of LLM calls with no structural mechanisms for reliability. We present VIGIL (Verifiable Inspection and Guarded Iterative Learning), a reflective runtime that supervises a sibling agent and performs autonomous maintenance rather than task execution. VIGIL ingests behavioral logs, appraises each event into a structured emotional representation, maintains a persistent EmoBank with decay and contextual policies, and derives an RBT diagnosis that sorts recent behavior into strengths, opportunities, and failures. From this analysis, VIGIL generates both guarded prompt updates that preserve core identity semantics and read only code proposals produced by a strategy engine that operates on log evidence and code hotspots. VIGIL functions as a state gated pipeline. Illegal transitions produce explicit errors rather than allowing the LLM to improvise. In a reminder latency case study, VIGIL identified elevated lag, proposed prompt and code repairs, and when its own diagnostic tool failed due to a schema conflict, it surfaced the internal error, produced a fallback diagnosis, and emitted a repair plan. This demonstrates meta level self repair in a deployed agent runtime.</description>

      <title>A Neural Affinity Framework for Abstract Reasoning: Diagnosing the Compositional Gap in Transformer Architectures via Procedural Task Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Responding to Hodel et al.'s (2024) call for a formal definition of task relatedness in re-arc, we present the first 9-category taxonomy of all 400 tasks, validated at 97.5% accuracy via rule-based code analysis. We prove the taxonomy's visual coherence by training a CNN on raw grid pixels (95.24% accuracy on S3, 36.25% overall, 3.3x chance), then apply the taxonomy diagnostically to the original ARC-AGI-2 test set. Our curriculum analysis reveals 35.3% of tasks exhibit low neural affinity for Transformers--a distributional bias mirroring ARC-AGI-2. To probe this misalignment, we fine-tuned a 1.7M-parameter Transformer across 302 tasks, revealing a profound Compositional Gap: 210 of 302 tasks (69.5%) achieve &gt;80% cell accuracy (local patterns) but &lt;10% grid accuracy (global synthesis). This provides direct evidence for a Neural Affinity Ceiling Effect, where performance is bounded by architectural suitability, not curriculum. Applying our framework to Li et al.'s independent ViTARC study (400 specialists, 1M examples each) confirms its predictive power: Very Low affinity tasks achieve 51.9% versus 77.7% for High affinity (p&lt;0.001), with a task at 0% despite massive data. The taxonomy enables precise diagnosis: low-affinity tasks (A2) hit hard ceilings, while high-affinity tasks (C1) reach 99.8%. These findings indicate that progress requires hybrid architectures with affinity-aligned modules. We release our validated taxonomy,</description>

      <title>ContextualSHAP : Enhancing SHAP Explanations Through Contextual Language Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become an increasingly important area of research, particularly as machine learning models are deployed in high-stakes domains. Among various XAI approaches, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) has gained prominence due to its ability to provide both global and local explanations across different machine learning models. While SHAP effectively visualizes feature importance, it often lacks contextual explanations that are meaningful for end-users, especially those without technical backgrounds. To address this gap, we propose a Python package that extends SHAP by integrating it with a large language model (LLM), specifically OpenAI's GPT, to generate contextualized textual explanations. This integration is guided by user-defined parameters (such as feature aliases, descriptions, and additional background) to tailor the explanation to both the model context and the user perspective. We hypothesize that this enhancement can improve the perceived understandability of SHAP explanations. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed package, we applied it in a healthcare-related case study and conducted user evaluations involving real end-users. The results, based on Likert-scale surveys and follow-up interviews, indicate that the generated explanations were perceived as more understandable and contextually appropriate compared to visual-only outputs. While the findings are preliminary, they suggest that combining visualization with contextualized text may support more user-friendly and trustworthy model explanations.</description>

      <title>PICKT: Practical Interlinked Concept Knowledge Tracing for Personalized Learning using Knowledge Map Concept Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the recent surge in personalized learning, Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) that can accurately track students' individual knowledge states and provide tailored learning paths based on this information are in demand as an essential task. This paper focuses on the core technology of Knowledge Tracing (KT) models that analyze students' sequences of interactions to predict their knowledge acquisition levels. However, existing KT models suffer from limitations such as restricted input data formats, cold start problems arising with new student enrollment or new question addition, and insufficient stability in real-world service environments. To overcome these limitations, a Practical Interlinked Concept Knowledge Tracing (PICKT) model that can effectively process multiple types of input data is proposed. Specifically, a knowledge map structures the relationships among concepts considering the question and concept text information, thereby enabling effective knowledge tracing even in cold start situations. Experiments reflecting real operational environments demonstrated the model's excellent performance and practicality. The main contributions of this research are as follows. First, a model architecture that effectively utilizes diverse data formats is presented. Second, significant performance improvements are achieved over existing models for two core cold start challenges: new student enrollment and new question addition. Third, the model's stability and practicality are validated through delicate experimental design, enhancing its applicability in real-world product environments. This provides a crucial theoretical and technical foundation for the practical implementation of next-generation ITS.</description>

      <title>Sample from What You See: Visuomotor Policy Learning via Diffusion Bridge with Observation-Embedded Stochastic Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning with diffusion models has advanced robotic control by capturing multi-modal action distributions. However, existing approaches typically treat observations as high-level conditioning inputs to the denoising network, rather than integrating them into the stochastic dynamics of the diffusion process itself. As a result, sampling must begin from random Gaussian noise, weakening the coupling between perception and control and often yielding suboptimal performance. We introduce BridgePolicy, a generative visuomotor policy that explicitly embeds observations within the stochastic differential equation via a diffusion-bridge formulation. By constructing an observation-informed trajectory, BridgePolicy enables sampling to start from a rich, informative prior rather than random noise, substantially improving precision and reliability in control. A key challenge is that classical diffusion bridges connect distributions with matched dimensionality, whereas robotic observations are heterogeneous and multi-modal and do not naturally align with the action space. To address this, we design a multi-modal fusion module and a semantic aligner that unify visual and state inputs and align observation and action representations, making the bridge applicable to heterogeneous robot data. Extensive experiments across 52 simulation tasks on three benchmarks and five real-world tasks demonstrate that BridgePolicy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative policies.</description>

      <title>Cross-platform Product Matching Based on Entity Alignment of Knowledge Graph with RAEA model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Product matching aims to identify identical or similar products sold on different platforms. By building knowledge graphs (KGs), the product matching problem can be converted to the Entity Alignment (EA) task, which aims to discover the equivalent entities from diverse KGs. The existing EA methods inadequately utilize both attribute triples and relation triples simultaneously, especially the interactions between them. This paper introduces a two-stage pipeline consisting of rough filter and fine filter to match products from eBay and Amazon. For fine filtering, a new framework for Entity Alignment, Relation-aware and Attribute-aware Graph Attention Networks for Entity Alignment (RAEA), is employed. RAEA focuses on the interactions between attribute triples and relation triples, where the entity representation aggregates the alignment signals from attributes and relations with Attribute-aware Entity Encoder and Relation-aware Graph Attention Networks. The experimental results indicate that the RAEA model achieves significant improvements over 12 baselines on EA task in the cross-lingual dataset DBP15K (6.59% on average Hits@1) and delivers competitive results in the monolingual dataset DWY100K. The source code for experiments on DBP15K and DWY100K is available at github (https://github.com/Mockingjay-liu/RAEA-model-for-Entity-Alignment).</description>

      <title>M-STAR: Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Autoregression for Human Mobility Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling human mobility is vital for extensive applications such as transportation planning and epidemic modeling. With the rise of the Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) paradigm, recent works explore synthetic trajectory generation using autoregressive and diffusion models. While these methods show promise for generating single-day trajectories, they remain limited by inefficiencies in long-term generation (e.g., weekly trajectories) and a lack of explicit spatiotemporal multi-scale modeling. This study proposes Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal AutoRegression (M-STAR), a new framework that generates long-term trajectories through a coarse-to-fine spatiotemporal prediction process. M-STAR combines a Multi-scale Spatiotemporal Tokenizer that encodes hierarchical mobility patterns with a Transformer-based decoder for next-scale autoregressive prediction. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that M-STAR outperforms existing methods in fidelity and significantly improves generation speed. The data and codes are available at https://github.com/YuxiaoLuo0013/M-STAR.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Unification of Concept Learning with Concept Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two traditions of interpretability have evolved side by side but seldom spoken to each other: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which prescribe what a concept should be, and Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), which discover what concepts emerge. While CBMs use supervision to align activations with human-labeled concepts, SAEs rely on sparse coding to uncover emergent ones. We show that both paradigms instantiate the same geometric structure: each learns a set of linear directions in activation space whose nonnegative combinations form a concept cone. Supervised and unsupervised methods thus differ not in kind but in how they select this cone. Building on this view, we propose an operational bridge between the two paradigms. CBMs provide human-defined reference geometries, while SAEs can be evaluated by how well their learned cones approximate or contain those of CBMs. This containment framework yields quantitative metrics linking inductive biases -- such as SAE type, sparsity, or expansion ratio -- to emergence of plausible\footnote{We adopt the terminology of \citet{jacovi2020towards}, who distinguish between faithful explanations (accurately reflecting model computations) and plausible explanations (aligning with human intuition and domain knowledge). CBM concepts are plausible by construction -- selected or annotated by humans -- though not necessarily faithful to the true latent factors that organise the data manifold.} concepts. Using these metrics, we uncover a ``sweet spot'' in both sparsity and expansion factor that maximizes both geometric and semantic alignment with CBM concepts. Overall, our work unifies supervised and unsupervised concept discovery through a shared geometric framework, providing principled metrics to measure SAE progress and assess how well discovered concept align with plausible human concepts.</description>

      <title>LocalSearchBench: Benchmarking Agentic Search in Real-World Local Life Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled agentic search systems to perform complex multi-step reasoning across multiple sources. However, most studies focus on general information retrieval and rarely explores vertical domains with unique challenges. In this work, we focus on local life services and introduce LocalSearchBench, which encompass diverse and complex business scenarios. Real-world queries in this domain are often ambiguous and require multi-hop reasoning across merchants and products, remaining challenging and not fully addressed. As the first comprehensive benchmark for agentic search in local life services, LocalSearchBench includes over 150,000 high-quality entries from various cities and business types. We construct 300 multi-hop QA tasks based on real user queries, challenging agents to understand questions and retrieve information in multiple steps. We also developed LocalPlayground, a unified environment integrating multiple tools for agent interaction. Experiments show that even state-of-the-art LRMs struggle on LocalSearchBench: the best model (DeepSeek-V3.1) achieves only 34.34% correctness, and most models have issues with completeness (average 77.33%) and faithfulness (average 61.99%). This highlights the need for specialized benchmarks and domain-specific agent training in local life services.

      <title>How Do LLMs Fail In Agentic Scenarios? A Qualitative Analysis of Success and Failure Scenarios of Various LLMs in Agentic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07497v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how large language models (LLMs) fail when operating as autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities. Using the Kamiwaza Agentic Merit Index (KAMI) v0.1 benchmark, we analyze 900 execution traces from three representative models - Granite 4 Small, Llama 4 Maverick, and DeepSeek V3.1 - across filesystem, text extraction, CSV analysis, and SQL scenarios. Rather than focusing on aggregate scores, we perform fine-grained, per-trial behavioral analysis to surface the strategies that enable successful multi-step tool execution and the recurrent failure modes that undermine reliability. Our findings show that model scale alone does not predict agentic robustness: Llama 4 Maverick (400B) performs only marginally better than Granite 4 Small (32B) in some uncertainty-driven tasks, while DeepSeek V3.1's superior reliability derives primarily from post-training reinforcement learning rather than architecture or size. Across models, we identify four recurring failure archetypes: premature action without grounding, over-helpfulness that substitutes missing entities, vulnerability to distractor-induced context pollution, and fragile execution under load. These patterns highlight the need for agentic evaluation methods that emphasize interactive grounding, recovery behavior, and environment-aware adaptation, suggesting that reliable enterprise deployment requires not just stronger models but deliberate training and design choices that reinforce verification, constraint discovery, and adherence to source-of-truth data.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis and Parametric Tuning of PPO, GRPO, and DAPO for LLM Reasoning Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a systematic comparison of three Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms (PPO, GRPO, and DAPO) for improving complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Our main contribution is a controlled transfer-learning evaluation: models are first fine-tuned on the specialized Countdown Game and then assessed on a suite of general-purpose reasoning benchmarks. Across all tasks, RL-trained models outperform their corresponding base models, although the degree of improvement differs by benchmark.
  Our parametric analysis offers practical guidance for RL-based LLM training. Increasing the group size in GRPO and DAPO leads to more stable training dynamics and higher accuracy, while the impact of the KL-penalty coefficient is non-monotonic. Additionally, we find that the Dynamic Sampling (DS) component in DAPO does not improve performance; in fact, the best overall results are achieved with DAPO when DS is disabled.</description>

      <title>The Agent Capability Problem: Predicting Solvability Through Information-Theoretic Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When should an autonomous agent commit resources to a task? We introduce the Agent Capability Problem (ACP), a framework for predicting whether an agent can solve a problem under resource constraints. Rather than relying on empirical heuristics, ACP frames problem-solving as information acquisition: an agent requires $\Itotal$ bits to identify a solution and gains $\Istep$ bits per action at cost $\Cstep$, yielding an effective cost $\Ceff = (\Itotal/\Istep), \Cstep$ that predicts resource requirements before search. We prove that $\Ceff$ lower-bounds expected cost and provide tight probabilistic upper bounds. Experimental validation shows that ACP predictions closely track actual agent performance, consistently bounding search effort while improving efficiency over greedy and random strategies. The framework generalizes across LLM-based and agentic workflows, linking principles from active learning, Bayesian optimization, and reinforcement learning through a unified information-theoretic lens. \</description>

      <title>Each Prompt Matters: Scaling Reinforcement Learning Without Wasting Rollouts on Hundred-Billion-Scale MoE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present CompassMax-V3-Thinking, a hundred-billion-scale MoE reasoning model trained with a new RL framework built on one principle: each prompt must matter. Scaling RL to this size exposes critical inefficiencies-zero-variance prompts that waste rollouts, unstable importance sampling over long horizons, advantage inversion from standard reward models, and systemic bottlenecks in rollout processing. To overcome these challenges, we introduce several unified innovations: (1) Multi-Stage Zero-Variance Elimination, which filters out non-informative prompts and stabilizes group-based policy optimization (e.g. GRPO) by removing wasted rollouts; (2) ESPO, an entropy-adaptive optimization method that balances token-level and sequence-level importance sampling to maintain stable learning dynamics; (3) a Router Replay strategy that aligns training-time MoE router decisions with inference-time behavior to mitigate train-infer discrepancies, coupled with a reward model adjustment to prevent advantage inversion; (4) a high-throughput RL system with FP8-precision rollouts, overlapped reward computation, and length-aware scheduling to eliminate performance bottlenecks. Together, these contributions form a cohesive pipeline that makes RL on hundred-billion-scale MoE models stable and efficient. The resulting model delivers strong performance across both internal and public evaluations.</description>

      <title>RL-MTJail: Reinforcement Learning for Automated Black-Box Multi-Turn Jailbreaking of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, threatening their safe deployment in real-world applications. This paper studies black-box multi-turn jailbreaks, aiming to train attacker LLMs to elicit harmful content from black-box models through a sequence of prompt-output interactions. Existing approaches typically rely on single turn optimization, which is insufficient for learning long-term attack strategies. To bridge this gap, we formulate the problem as a multi-turn reinforcement learning task, directly optimizing the harmfulness of the final-turn output as the outcome reward. To mitigate sparse supervision and promote long-term attack strategies, we propose two heuristic process rewards: (1) controlling the harmfulness of intermediate outputs to prevent triggering the black-box model's rejection mechanisms, and (2) maintaining the semantic relevance of intermediate outputs to avoid drifting into irrelevant content. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show consistently improved attack success rates across multiple models, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at https://github.com/xxiqiao/RL-MTJail. Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful content.</description>

      <title>ReasonBENCH: Benchmarking the (In)Stability of LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in settings where reasoning, such as multi-step problem solving and chain-of-thought, is essential. Yet, current evaluation practices overwhelmingly report single-run accuracy while ignoring the intrinsic uncertainty that naturally arises from stochastic decoding. This omission creates a blind spot because practitioners cannot reliably assess whether a method's reported performance is stable, reproducible, or cost-consistent. We introduce ReasonBENCH, the first benchmark designed to quantify the underlying instability in LLM reasoning. ReasonBENCH provides (i) a modular evaluation library that standardizes reasoning frameworks, models, and tasks, (ii) a multi-run protocol that reports statistically reliable metrics for both quality and cost, and (iii) a public leaderboard to encourage variance-aware reporting. Across tasks from different domains, we find that the vast majority of reasoning strategies and models exhibit high instability. Notably, even strategies with similar average performance can display confidence intervals up to four times wider, and the top-performing methods often incur higher and less stable costs. Such instability compromises reproducibility across runs and, consequently, the reliability of reported performance. To better understand these dynamics, we further analyze the impact of prompts, model families, and scale on the trade-off between solve rate and stability. Our results highlight reproducibility as a critical dimension for reliable LLM reasoning and provide a foundation for future reasoning methods and uncertainty quantification techniques. ReasonBENCH is publicly available at https://github.com/au-clan/ReasonBench .</description>

      <title>Large Causal Models from Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for building large causal models (LCMs) that exploits the enormous potential latent in today's large language models (LLMs). We describe our ongoing experiments with an implemented system called DEMOCRITUS (Decentralized Extraction of Manifold Ontologies of Causal Relations Integrating Topos Universal Slices) aimed at building, organizing, and visualizing LCMs that span disparate domains extracted from carefully targeted textual queries to LLMs. DEMOCRITUS is methodologically distinct from traditional narrow domain and hypothesis centered causal inference that builds causal models from experiments that produce numerical data. A high-quality LLM is used to propose topics, generate causal questions, and extract plausible causal statements from a diverse range of domains. The technical challenge is then to take these isolated, fragmented, potentially ambiguous and possibly conflicting causal claims, and weave them into a coherent whole, converting them into relational causal triples and embedding them into a LCM. Addressing this technical challenge required inventing new categorical machine learning methods, which we can only briefly summarize in this paper, as it is focused more on the systems side of building DEMOCRITUS. We describe the implementation pipeline for DEMOCRITUS comprising of six modules, examine its computational cost profile to determine where the current bottlenecks in scaling the system to larger models. We describe the results of using DEMOCRITUS over a wide range of domains, spanning archaeology, biology, climate change, economics, medicine and technology. We discuss the limitations of the current DEMOCRITUS system, and outline directions for extending its capabilities.</description>

      <title>Auditing Games for Sandbagging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future AI systems could conceal their capabilities ('sandbagging') during evaluations, potentially misleading developers and auditors. We stress-tested sandbagging detection techniques using an auditing game. First, a red team fine-tuned five models, some of which conditionally underperformed, as a proxy for sandbagging. Second, a blue team used black-box, model-internals, or training-based approaches to identify sandbagging models. We found that the blue team could not reliably discriminate sandbaggers from benign models. Black-box approaches were defeated by effective imitation of a weaker model. Linear probes, a model-internals approach, showed more promise but their naive application was vulnerable to behaviours instilled by the red team. We also explored capability elicitation as a strategy for detecting sandbagging. Although Prompt-based elicitation was not reliable, training-based elicitation consistently elicited full performance from the sandbagging models, using only a single correct demonstration of the evaluation task. However the performance of benign models was sometimes also raised, so relying on elicitation as a detection strategy was prone to false-positives. In the short-term, we recommend developers remove potential sandbagging using on-distribution training for elicitation. In the longer-term, further research is needed to ensure the efficacy of training-based elicitation, and develop robust methods for sandbagging detection. We open source our model organisms at https://github.com/AI-Safety-Institute/sandbagging_auditing_games and select transcripts and results at https://huggingface.co/datasets/sandbagging-games/evaluation_logs . A demo illustrating the game can be played at https://sandbagging-demo.far.ai/ .</description>

      <title>Video Models Start to Solve Chess, Maze, Sudoku, Mental Rotation, and Raven' Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that video generation models could reason now. Testing on tasks such as chess, maze, Sudoku, mental rotation, and Raven's Matrices, leading models such as Sora-2 achieve sixty percent success rates. We establish a robust experimental paradigm centered on the "Task Pair" design. We build a code framework, with 39 models available already, that supports this paradigm and allows for easy scaling - users can add models and tasks efficiently. We show our automated evaluation strongly correlates with human judgment, and therefore this paradigm is highly scalable. We see an opportunity, given the availability of our paradigm, to do reinforcement learning for improving reasoning in video models.

      <title>A Multi-objective Optimization Approach for Feature Selection in Gentelligent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of advanced technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), into manufacturing processes is attracting significant attention, paving the way for the development of intelligent systems that enhance efficiency and automation. This paper uses the term "Gentelligent system" to refer to systems that incorporate inherent component information (akin to genes in bioinformatics-where manufacturing operations are likened to chromosomes in this study) and automated mechanisms. By implementing reliable fault detection methods, manufacturers can achieve several benefits, including improved product quality, increased yield, and reduced production costs. To support these objectives, we propose a hybrid framework with a dominance-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. This mechanism enables simultaneous optimization of feature selection and classification performance by exploring Pareto-optimal solutions in a single run. This solution helps monitor various manufacturing operations, addressing a range of conflicting objectives that need to be minimized together. Manufacturers can leverage such predictive methods and better adapt to emerging trends. To strengthen the validation of our model, we incorporate two real-world datasets from different industrial domains. The results on both datasets demonstrate the generalizability and effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Materials Discovery: Learning a Universal Representation of Chemical Processes for Cross-Domain Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental validation of chemical processes is slow and costly, limiting exploration in materials discovery. Machine learning can prioritize promising candidates, but existing data in patents and literature is heterogeneous and difficult to use. We introduce a universal directed-tree process-graph representation that unifies unstructured text, molecular structures, and numeric measurements into a single machine-readable format. To learn from this structured data, we developed a multi-modal graph neural network with a property-conditioned attention mechanism. Trained on approximately 700,000 process graphs from nearly 9,000 diverse documents, our model learns semantically rich embeddings that generalize across domains. When fine-tuned on compact, domain-specific datasets, the pretrained model achieves strong performance, demonstrating that universal process representations learned at scale transfer effectively to specialized prediction tasks with minimal additional data.</description>

      <title>FlockVote: LLM-Empowered Agent-Based Modeling for Simulating U.S. Presidential Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling complex human behavior, such as voter decisions in national elections, is a long-standing challenge for computational social science. Traditional agent-based models (ABMs) are limited by oversimplified rules, while large-scale statistical models often lack interpretability. We introduce FlockVote, a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to build a "computational laboratory" of LLM agents for political simulation. Each agent is instantiated with a high-fidelity demographic profile and dynamic contextual information (e.g. candidate policies), enabling it to perform nuanced, generative reasoning to simulate a voting decision. We deploy this framework as a testbed on the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, focusing on seven key swing states. Our simulation's macro-level results successfully replicate the real-world outcome, demonstrating the high fidelity of our "virtual society". The primary contribution is not only the prediction, but also the framework's utility as an interpretable research tool. FlockVote moves beyond black-box outputs, allowing researchers to probe agent-level rationale and analyze the stability and sensitivity of LLM-driven social simulations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Dataset Quantization: A New Direction for Dataset Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of storage and communication costs for large-scale datasets in resource-constrained edge devices by proposing a novel dataset quantization approach to reduce intra-sample redundancy. Unlike traditional dataset pruning and distillation methods that focus on inter-sample redundancy, the proposed method compresses each image by reducing redundant or less informative content within samples while preserving essential features. It first applies linear symmetric quantization to obtain an initial quantization range and scale for each sample. Then, an adaptive quantization allocation algorithm is introduced to distribute different quantization ratios for samples with varying precision requirements, maintaining a constant total compression ratio. The main contributions include: (1) being the first to use limited bits to represent datasets for storage reduction; (2) introducing a dataset-level quantization algorithm with adaptive ratio allocation; and (3) validating the method's effectiveness through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K. Results show that the method maintains model training performance while achieving significant dataset compression, outperforming traditional quantization and dataset pruning baselines under the same compression ratios.</description>

      <title>VG3T: Visual Geometry Grounded Gaussian Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating a coherent 3D scene representation from multi-view images is a fundamental yet challenging task. Existing methods often struggle with multi-view fusion, leading to fragmented 3D representations and sub-optimal performance. To address this, we introduce VG3T, a novel multi-view feed-forward network that predicts a 3D semantic occupancy via a 3D Gaussian representation. Unlike prior methods that infer Gaussians from single-view images, our model directly predicts a set of semantically attributed Gaussians in a joint, multi-view fashion. This novel approach overcomes the fragmentation and inconsistency inherent in view-by-view processing, offering a unified paradigm to represent both geometry and semantics. We also introduce two key components, Grid-Based Sampling and Positional Refinement, to mitigate the distance-dependent density bias common in pixel-aligned Gaussian initialization methods. Our VG3T shows a notable 1.7%p improvement in mIoU while using 46% fewer primitives than the previous state-of-the-art on the nuScenes benchmark, highlighting its superior efficiency and performance.</description>

      <title>Domain-Specific Foundation Model Improves AI-Based Analysis of Neuropathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have transformed computational pathology by providing generalizable representations from large-scale histology datasets. However, existing models are predominantly trained on surgical pathology data, which is enriched for non-nervous tissue and overrepresents neoplastic, inflammatory, metabolic, and other non-neurological diseases. Neuropathology represents a markedly different domain of histopathology, characterized by unique cell types (neurons, glia, etc.), distinct cytoarchitecture, and disease-specific pathological features including neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, Lewy bodies, and pattern-specific neurodegeneration. This domain mismatch may limit the ability of general-purpose foundation models to capture the morphological patterns critical for interpreting neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cerebellar ataxias. To address this gap, we developed NeuroFM, a foundation model trained specifically on whole-slide images of brain tissue spanning diverse neurodegenerative pathologies. NeuroFM demonstrates superior performance compared to general-purpose models across multiple neuropathology-specific downstream tasks, including mixed dementia disease classification, hippocampal region segmentation, and neurodegenerative ataxia identification encompassing cerebellar essential tremor and spinocerebellar ataxia subtypes. This work establishes that domain-specialized foundation models trained on brain tissue can better capture neuropathology-specific features than models trained on general surgical pathology datasets. By tailoring foundation models to the unique morphological landscape of neurodegenerative diseases, NeuroFM enables more accurate and reliable AI-based analysis for brain disease diagnosis and research, setting a precedent for domain-specific model development in specialized areas of digital pathology.</description>

      <title>KidSpeak: A General Multi-purpose LLM for Kids' Speech Recognition and Screening</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of conversational and diffusion-based AI, there is a growing adoption of AI in educational services, ranging from grading and assessment tools to personalized learning systems that provide targeted support for students. However, this adaptability has yet to fully extend to the domain of children's speech, where existing models often fail due to their reliance on datasets designed for clear, articulate adult speech. Children, particularly those in early developmental stages or with speech and language pathologies, present unique challenges that current AI models and datasets are ill-equipped to handle. To address this, we introduce KidSpeak, a multi-task speech-enhanced Foundation Model capable of both generative and discriminative tasks specifically tailored to children's speech patterns. Our framework employs a two-stage training process that incorporates phonetic knowledge into the speech encoder, achieving an average accuracy of 87% across four separate tasks. Furthermore, recognizing the limitations of scalable human annotation and existing speech alignment tools, we propose the Flexible and Automatic Speech Aligner (FASA) and leverage the method to construct high quality datasets for training and evaluation. This novel alignment tool significantly improves the quality of aligned children's speech from noisy data, enhancing data quality by 13.6x compared to human annotations, as demonstrated on the CHILDES dataset. To the best of our knowledge, KidSpeak and FASA represent the first comprehensive solution designed for speech and language therapy in children, offering both a multi-purpose speech LLM and a robust alignment tool.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assigning tasks to robots often involves supplying the robot with an overarching goal, such as through natural language, and then relying on the robot to uncover and execute a plan to achieve that goal. In many settings common to human-robot interaction, however, the world is only partially observable to the robot, requiring that it create plans under uncertainty. Although many probabilistic planning algorithms exist for this purpose, these algorithms can be inefficient if executed with the robot's limited computational resources, or may require more steps than expected to achieve the goal. We thereby created a new, lightweight, probabilistic planning algorithm, Plan-Orchestrated Tree Assembly for Lookahead (POrTAL), that combines the strengths of two baseline planning algorithms, FF-Replan and POMCP. In a series of case studies, we demonstrate POrTAL's ability to quickly arrive at solutions that outperform these baselines in terms of number of steps. We additionally demonstrate how POrTAL performs under varying temporal constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adapting production-level computer vision tools to bespoke scientific datasets is a critical "last mile" bottleneck. Current solutions are impractical: fine-tuning requires large annotated datasets scientists often lack, while manual code adaptation costs scientists weeks to months of effort. We consider using AI agents to automate this manual coding, and focus on the open question of optimal agent design for this targeted task. We introduce a systematic evaluation framework for agentic code optimization and use it to study three production-level biomedical imaging pipelines. We demonstrate that a simple agent framework consistently generates adaptation code that outperforms human-expert solutions. Our analysis reveals that common, complex agent architectures are not universally beneficial, leading to a practical roadmap for agent design. We open source our framework and validate our approach by deploying agent-generated functions into a production pipeline, demonstrating a clear pathway for real-world impact.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Students' Inquiry Patterns in GenAI-Supported Clinical Practice: An Integration of Epistemic Network Analysis and Sequential Pattern Mining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessment of medication history-taking has traditionally relied on human observation, limiting scalability and detailed performance data. While Generative AI (GenAI) platforms enable extensive data collection and learning analytics provide powerful methods for analyzing educational traces, these approaches remain largely underexplored in pharmacy clinical training. This study addresses this gap by applying learning analytics to understand how students develop clinical communication competencies with GenAI-powered virtual patients -- a crucial endeavor given the diversity of student cohorts, varying language backgrounds, and the limited opportunities for individualized feedback in traditional training settings. We analyzed 323 students' interaction logs across Australian and Malaysian institutions, comprising 50,871 coded utterances from 1,487 student-GenAI dialogues. Combining Epistemic Network Analysis to model inquiry co-occurrences with Sequential Pattern Mining to capture temporal sequences, we found that high performers demonstrated strategic deployment of information recognition behaviors. Specifically, high performers centered inquiry on recognizing clinically relevant information, integrating rapport-building and structural organization, while low performers remained in routine question-verification loops. Demographic factors including first-language background, prior pharmacy work experience, and institutional context, also shaped distinct inquiry patterns. These findings reveal inquiry patterns that may indicate clinical reasoning development in GenAI-assisted contexts, providing methodological insights for health professions education assessment and informing adaptive GenAI system design that supports diverse learning pathways.</description>

      <title>PrefGen: Multimodal Preference Learning for Preference-Conditioned Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preference-conditioned image generation seeks to adapt generative models to individual users, producing outputs that reflect personal aesthetic choices beyond the given textual prompt. Despite recent progress, existing approaches either fail to capture nuanced user preferences or lack effective mechanisms to encode personalized visual signals. In this work, we propose a multimodal framework that leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to extract rich user representations and inject them into diffusion-based image generation. We train the MLLM with a preference-oriented visual question answering task to capture fine-grained semantic cues. To isolate preference-relevant features, we introduce two complementary probing tasks: inter-user discrimination to distinguish between different users, and intra-user discrimination to separate liked from disliked content. To ensure compatibility with diffusion text encoders, we design a maximum mean discrepancy-based alignment loss that bridges the modality gap while preserving multimodal structure. The resulting embeddings are used to condition the generator, enabling faithful adherence to both prompts and user preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms strong baselines in both image quality and preference alignment, highlighting the effectiveness of representation extraction and alignment for personalized generation.</description>

      <title>The SAM2-to-SAM3 Gap in the Segment Anything Model Family: Why Prompt-Based Expertise Fails in Concept-Driven Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the fundamental discontinuity between the latest two Segment Anything Models: SAM2 and SAM3. We explain why the expertise in prompt-based segmentation of SAM2 does not transfer to the multimodal concept-driven paradigm of SAM3. SAM2 operates through spatial prompts points, boxes, and masks yielding purely geometric and temporal segmentation. In contrast, SAM3 introduces a unified vision-language architecture capable of open-vocabulary reasoning, semantic grounding, contrastive alignment, and exemplar-based concept understanding. We structure this analysis through five core components: (1) a Conceptual Break Between Prompt-Based and Concept-Based Segmentation, contrasting spatial prompt semantics of SAM2 with multimodal fusion and text-conditioned mask generation of SAM3; (2) Architectural Divergence, detailing pure vision-temporal design of SAM2 versus integration of vision-language encoders, geometry and exemplar encoders, fusion modules, DETR-style decoders, object queries, and ambiguity-handling via Mixture-of-Experts in SAM3; (3) Dataset and Annotation Differences, contrasting SA-V video masks with multimodal concept-annotated corpora of SAM3; (4) Training and Hyperparameter Distinctions, showing why SAM2 optimization knowledge does not apply to SAM3; and (5) Evaluation, Metrics, and Failure Modes, outlining the transition from geometric IoU metrics to semantic, open-vocabulary evaluation. Together, these analyses establish SAM3 as a new class of segmentation foundation model and chart future directions for the emerging concept-driven segmentation era.</description>

      <title>Physics-Guided Deepfake Detection for Voice Authentication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voice authentication systems deployed at the network edge face dual threats: a) sophisticated deepfake synthesis attacks and b) control-plane poisoning in distributed federated learning protocols. We present a framework coupling physics-guided deepfake detection with uncertainty-aware in edge learning. The framework fuses interpretable physics features modeling vocal tract dynamics with representations coming from a self-supervised learning module. The representations are then processed via a Multi-Modal Ensemble Architecture, followed by a Bayesian ensemble providing uncertainty estimates. Incorporating physics-based characteristics evaluations and uncertainty estimates of audio samples allows our proposed framework to remain robust to both advanced deepfake attacks and sophisticated control-plane poisoning, addressing the complete threat model for networked voice authentication.</description>

      <title>Auto-SPT: Automating Semantic Preserving Transformations for Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models for code clone detection determine whether two pieces of code are semantically equivalent, which in turn is a key building block for software-engineering tasks like refactoring and security tasks like vulnerability and malware detection. While these models are predominantly trained on clean, structured code datasets, real-world code often undergoes a variety of semantic-preserving transformations, including refactoring, minification, automated formatting, and compiler optimizations. To address this critical gap between training and test data, we propose Auto-SPT, a novel framework to automatically construct synthetic-data generators for code. Auto-SPT is designed to produce Semantic Preserving Transformations (SPTs) that alter a program's syntactic structure while preserving its functionality and is instantiated on top of Large Language Models (LLMs). In particular, we use LLMs to craft a diverse set of SPTs, generate strong implementations for these SPTs, and compose them to result into strong transformations. Our formal analysis shows that the diversity of SPTs impacts the strength of their composition. We then empirically demonstrate that Auto-SPT generates more diverse SPTs than existing approaches and these SPTs significantly drop the performance of state-of-the-art code clone detectors. Further experiments show Auto-SPT can be used to enhance code datasets for training, to produce code-clone detection models that are robust to real-world, adversarial code transformations.</description>

      <title>Beyond Prototyping: Autonomous, Enterprise-Grade Frontend Development from Pixel to Production via a Specialized Multi-Agent Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present AI4UI, a framework of autonomous front-end development agents purpose-built to meet the rigorous requirements of enterprise-grade application delivery. Unlike general-purpose code assistants designed for rapid prototyping, AI4UI focuses on production readiness delivering secure, scalable, compliant, and maintainable UI code integrated seamlessly into enterprise workflows. AI4UI operates with targeted human-in-the-loop involvement: at the design stage, developers embed a Gen-AI-friendly grammar into Figma prototypes to encode requirements for precise interpretation; and at the post processing stage, domain experts refine outputs for nuanced design adjustments, domain-specific optimizations, and compliance needs. Between these stages, AI4UI runs fully autonomously, converting designs into engineering-ready UI code. Technical contributions include a Figma grammar for autonomous interpretation, domain-aware knowledge graphs, a secure abstract/package code integration strategy, expertise driven architecture templates, and a change-oriented workflow coordinated by specialized agent roles. In large-scale benchmarks against industry baselines and leading competitor systems, AI4UI achieved 97.24% platform compatibility, 87.10% compilation success, 86.98% security compliance, 78.00% feature implementation success, 73.50% code-review quality, and 73.36% UI/UX consistency. In blind preference studies with 200 expert evaluators, AI4UI emerged as one of the leaders demonstrating strong competitive standing among leading solutions. Operating asynchronously, AI4UI generates thousands of validated UI screens in weeks rather than months, compressing delivery timeline</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Integrated Agentic RAG for Software Test Cases Authoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with autonomous agents to enable continuous improvement in the automated process of software test cases authoring from business requirement documents within Quality Engineering (QE) workflows. Conventional systems employing Large Language Models (LLMs) generate test cases from static knowledge bases, which fundamentally limits their capacity to enhance performance over time. Our proposed Reinforcement Infused Agentic RAG (Retrieve, Augment, Generate) framework overcomes this limitation by employing AI agents that learn from QE feedback, assessments, and defect discovery outcomes to automatically improve their test case generation strategies. The system combines specialized agents with a hybrid vector-graph knowledge base that stores and retrieves software testing knowledge. Through advanced RL algorithms, specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), these agents optimize their behavior based on QE-reported test effectiveness, defect detection rates, and workflow metrics. As QEs execute AI-generated test cases and provide feedback, the system learns from this expert guidance to improve future iterations. Experimental validation on enterprise Apple projects yielded substantive improvements: a 2.4% increase in test generation accuracy (from 94.8% to 97.2%), and a 10.8% improvement in defect detection rates. The framework establishes a continuous knowledge refinement loop driven by QE expertise, resulting in progressively superior test case quality that enhances, rather than replaces, human testing capabilities.</description>

      <title>When Privacy Isn't Synthetic: Hidden Data Leakage in Generative AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models are increasingly used to produce privacy-preserving synthetic data as a safe alternative to sharing sensitive training datasets. However, we demonstrate that such synthetic releases can still leak information about the underlying training samples through structural overlap in the data manifold. We propose a black-box membership inference attack that exploits this vulnerability without requiring access to model internals or real data. The attacker repeatedly queries the generative model to obtain large numbers of synthetic samples, performs unsupervised clustering to identify dense regions of the synthetic distribution, and then analyzes cluster medoids and neighborhoods that correspond to high-density regions in the original training data. These neighborhoods act as proxies for training samples, enabling the adversary to infer membership or reconstruct approximate records. Our experiments across healthcare, finance, and other sensitive domains show that cluster overlap between real and synthetic data leads to measurable membership leakage-even when the generator is trained with differential privacy or other noise mechanisms. The results highlight an under-explored attack surface in synthetic data generation pipelines and call for stronger privacy guarantees that account for distributional neighborhood inference rather than sample-level memorization alone, underscoring its role in privacy-preserving data publishing. Implementation and evaluation code are publicly available at:github.com/Cluster-Medoid-Leakage-Attack.</description>

      <title>EgoEdit: Dataset, Real-Time Streaming Model, and Benchmark for Egocentric Video Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study instruction-guided editing of egocentric videos for interactive AR applications. While recent AI video editors perform well on third-person footage, egocentric views present unique challenges - including rapid egomotion and frequent hand-object interactions - that create a significant domain gap. Moreover, existing offline editing pipelines suffer from high latency, limiting real-time interaction. To address these issues, we present a complete ecosystem for egocentric video editing. First, we construct EgoEditData, a carefully designed and manually curated dataset specifically designed for egocentric editing scenarios, featuring rich hand-object interactions, while explicitly preserving hands. Second, we develop EgoEdit, an instruction-following egocentric video editor that supports real-time streaming inference on a single GPU. Finally, we introduce EgoEditBench, an evaluation suite targeting instruction faithfulness, hand and interaction preservation, and temporal stability under egomotion. Across both egocentric and general editing tasks, EgoEdit produces temporally stable, instruction-faithful results with interactive latency. It achieves clear gains on egocentric editing benchmarks-where existing methods struggle-while maintaining performance comparable to the strongest baselines on general editing tasks. EgoEditData and EgoEditBench will be made public for the research community. See our website at https://snap-research.github.io/EgoEdit</description>

      <title>Empathy by Design: Aligning Large Language Models for Healthcare Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General-purpose large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generative and reasoning capabilities but remain limited in healthcare and caregiving applications due to two key deficiencies: factual unreliability and a lack of empathetic communication. These shortcomings pose significant risks in sensitive contexts where users, particularly non-professionals and caregivers, seek medically relevant guidance or emotional reassurance. To address these challenges, we introduce a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-based alignment framework designed to improve factual correctness, semantic coherence, and human-centric qualities such as empathy, politeness, and simplicity in caregiver-patient dialogues. Our approach fine-tunes domain-adapted LLMs using pairwise preference data, where preferred responses reflect supportive and accessible communication styles while rejected ones represent prescriptive or overly technical tones. This direct optimization method aligns model outputs with human preferences more efficiently than traditional reinforcement-learning-based alignment. Empirical evaluations across multiple open and proprietary LLMs show that our DPO-tuned models achieve higher semantic alignment, improved factual accuracy, and stronger human-centric evaluation scores compared to baseline and commercial alternatives such as Google medical dialogue systems. These improvements demonstrate that preference-based alignment offers a scalable and transparent pathway toward developing trustworthy, empathetic, and clinically informed AI assistants for caregiver and healthcare communication.

      <title>JaxWildfire: A GPU-Accelerated Wildfire Simulator for Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence methods are increasingly being explored for managing wildfires and other natural hazards. In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising path towards improving outcomes in such uncertain decision-making scenarios and moving beyond reactive strategies. However, training RL agents requires many environment interactions, and the speed of existing wildfire simulators is a severely limiting factor. We introduce $\texttt{JaxWildfire}$, a simulator underpinned by a principled probabilistic fire spread model based on cellular automata. It is implemented in JAX and enables vectorized simulations using $\texttt{vmap}$, allowing high throughput of simulations on GPUs. We demonstrate that $\texttt{JaxWildfire}$ achieves 6-35x speedup over existing software and enables gradient-based optimization of simulator parameters. Furthermore, we show that $\texttt{JaxWildfire}$ can be used to train RL agents to learn wildfire suppression policies. Our work is an important step towards enabling the advancement of RL techniques for managing natural hazards.</description>

      <title>Explainable Melanoma Diagnosis with Contrastive Learning and LLM-based Report Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated expert-level performance in melanoma classification, positioning it as a powerful tool in clinical dermatology. However, model opacity and the lack of interpretability remain critical barriers to clinical adoption, as clinicians often struggle to trust the decision-making processes of black-box models. To address this gap, we present a Cross-modal Explainable Framework for Melanoma (CEFM) that leverages contrastive learning as the core mechanism for achieving interpretability. Specifically, CEFM maps clinical criteria for melanoma diagnosis-namely Asymmetry, Border, and Color (ABC)-into the Vision Transformer embedding space using dual projection heads, thereby aligning clinical semantics with visual features. The aligned representations are subsequently translated into structured textual explanations via natural language generation, creating a transparent link between raw image data and clinical interpretation. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate 92.79% accuracy and an AUC of 0.961, along with significant improvements across multiple interpretability metrics. Qualitative analyses further show that the spatial arrangement of the learned embeddings aligns with clinicians' application of the ABC rule, effectively bridging the gap between high-performance classification and clinical trust.</description>

      <title>Future You: Designing and Evaluating Multimodal AI-generated Digital Twins for Strengthening Future Self-Continuity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What if users could meet their future selves today? AI-generated future selves simulate meaningful encounters with a digital twin decades in the future. As AI systems advance, combining cloned voices, age-progressed facial rendering, and autobiographical narratives, a central question emerges: Does the modality of these future selves alter their psychological and affective impact? How might a text-based chatbot, a voice-only system, or a photorealistic avatar shape present-day decisions and our feeling of connection to the future? We report a randomized controlled study (N=92) evaluating three modalities of AI-generated future selves (text, voice, avatar) against a neutral control condition. We also report a systematic model evaluation between Claude 4 and three other Large Language Models (LLMs), assessing Claude 4 across psychological and interaction dimensions and establishing conversational AI quality as a critical determinant of intervention effectiveness. All personalized modalities strengthened Future Self-Continuity (FSC), emotional well-being, and motivation compared to control, with avatar producing the largest vividness gains, yet with no significant differences between formats. Interaction quality metrics, particularly persuasiveness, realism, and user engagement, emerged as robust predictors of psychological and affective outcomes, indicating that how compelling the interaction feels matters more than the form it takes. Content analysis found thematic patterns: text emphasized career planning, while voice and avatar facilitated personal reflection. Claude 4 outperformed ChatGPT 3.5, Llama 4, and Qwen 3 in enhancing psychological, affective, and FSC outcomes.</description>

      <title>WAM-Flow: Parallel Coarse-to-Fine Motion Planning via Discrete Flow Matching for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce WAM-Flow, a vision-language-action (VLA) model that casts ego-trajectory planning as discrete flow matching over a structured token space. In contrast to autoregressive decoders, WAM-Flow performs fully parallel, bidirectional denoising, enabling coarse-to-fine refinement with a tunable compute-accuracy trade-off. Specifically, the approach combines a metric-aligned numerical tokenizer that preserves scalar geometry via triplet-margin learning, a geometry-aware flow objective and a simulator-guided GRPO alignment that integrates safety, ego progress, and comfort rewards while retaining parallel generation. A multi-stage adaptation converts a pre-trained auto-regressive backbone (Janus-1.5B) from causal decoding to non-causal flow model and strengthens road-scene competence through continued multimodal pretraining. Thanks to the inherent nature of consistency model training and parallel decoding inference, WAM-Flow achieves superior closed-loop performance against autoregressive and diffusion-based VLA baselines, with 1-step inference attaining 89.1 PDMS and 5-step inference reaching 90.3 PDMS on NAVSIM v1 benchmark. These results establish discrete flow matching as a new promising paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving. The code will be publicly available soon.</description>

      <title>Toward Patch Robustness Certification and Detection for Deep Learning Systems Beyond Consistent Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patch robustness certification is an emerging kind of provable defense technique against adversarial patch attacks for deep learning systems. Certified detection ensures the detection of all patched harmful versions of certified samples, which mitigates the failures of empirical defense techniques that could (easily) be compromised. However, existing certified detection methods are ineffective in certifying samples that are misclassified or whose mutants are inconsistently pre icted to different labels. This paper proposes HiCert, a novel masking-based certified detection technique. By focusing on the problem of mutants predicted with a label different from the true label with our formal analysis, HiCert formulates a novel formal relation between harmful samples generated by identified loopholes and their benign counterparts. By checking the bound of the maximum confidence among these potentially harmful (i.e., inconsistent) mutants of each benign sample, HiCert ensures that each harmful sample either has the minimum confidence among mutants that are predicted the same as the harmful sample itself below this bound, or has at least one mutant predicted with a label different from the harmful sample itself, formulated after two novel insights. As such, HiCert systematically certifies those inconsistent samples and consistent samples to a large extent. To our knowledge, HiCert is the first work capable of providing such a comprehensive patch robustness certification for certified detection. Our experiments show the high effectiveness of HiCert with a new state-of the-art performance: It certifies significantly more benign samples, including those inconsistent and consistent, and achieves significantly higher accuracy on those samples without warnings and a significantly lower false silent ratio.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Koopman Machine for Interpretable Longitudinal Personalized Alzheimer's Disease Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Early forecasting of individual cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is central to disease evaluation and management. Despite advances, it is as of yet challenging for existing methodological frameworks to integrate multimodal data for longitudinal personalized forecasting while maintaining interpretability. To address this gap, we present the Neural Koopman Machine (NKM), a new machine learning architecture inspired by dynamical systems and attention mechanisms, designed to forecast multiple cognitive scores simultaneously using multimodal genetic, neuroimaging, proteomic, and demographic data. NKM integrates analytical ($\alpha$) and biological ($\beta$) knowledge to guide feature grouping and control the hierarchical attention mechanisms to extract relevant patterns. By implementing Fusion Group-Aware Hierarchical Attention within the Koopman operator framework, NKM transforms complex nonlinear trajectories into interpretable linear representations. To demonstrate NKM's efficacy, we applied it to study the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Our results suggest that NKM consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning methods and deep learning models in forecasting trajectories of cognitive decline. Specifically, NKM (1) forecasts changes of multiple cognitive scores simultaneously, (2) quantifies differential biomarker contributions to predicting distinctive cognitive scores, and (3) identifies brain regions most predictive of cognitive deterioration. Together, NKM advances personalized, interpretable forecasting of future cognitive decline in AD using past multimodal data through an explainable, explicit system and reveals potential multimodal biological underpinnings of AD progression.</description>

      <title>Learning Invariant Graph Representations Through Redundant Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning invariant graph representations for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains challenging because the learned representations often retain spurious components. To address this challenge, this work introduces a new tool from information theory called Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that goes beyond classical information-theoretic measures. We identify limitations in existing approaches for invariant representation learning that solely rely on classical information-theoretic measures, motivating the need to precisely focus on redundant information about the target $Y$ shared between spurious subgraphs $G_s$ and invariant subgraphs $G_c$ obtained via PID. Next, we propose a new multi-level optimization framework that we call -- Redundancy-guided Invariant Graph learning (RIG) -- that maximizes redundant information while isolating spurious and causal subgraphs, enabling OOD generalization under diverse distribution shifts. Our approach relies on alternating between estimating a lower bound of redundant information (which itself requires an optimization) and maximizing it along with additional objectives. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world graph datasets demonstrate the generalization capabilities of our proposed RIG framework.</description>

      <title>DEFEND: Poisoned Model Detection and Malicious Client Exclusion Mechanism for Secure Federated Learning-based Road Condition Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has drawn the attention of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) community. FL can train various models for ITS tasks, notably camera-based Road Condition Classification (RCC), in a privacy-preserving collaborative way. However, opening up to collaboration also opens FL-based RCC systems to adversaries, i.e., misbehaving participants that can launch Targeted Label-Flipping Attacks (TLFAs) and threaten transportation safety. Adversaries mounting TLFAs poison training data to misguide model predictions, from an actual source class (e.g., wet road) to a wrongly perceived target class (e.g., dry road). Existing countermeasures against poisoning attacks cannot maintain model performance under TLFAs close to the performance level in attack-free scenarios, because they lack specific model misbehavior detection for TLFAs and neglect client exclusion after the detection. To close this research gap, we propose DEFEND, which includes a poisoned model detection strategy that leverages neuron-wise magnitude analysis for attack goal identification and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based clustering. DEFEND discards poisoned model contributions in each round and adapts accordingly client ratings, eventually excluding malicious clients. Extensive evaluation involving various FL-RCC models and tasks shows that DEFEND can thwart TLFAs and outperform seven baseline countermeasures, with at least 15.78% improvement, with DEFEND remarkably achieving under attack the same performance as in attack-free scenarios.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Zero-Shot Prediction of Color Trajectories in Food Drying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Food drying is widely used to reduce moisture content, ensure safety, and extend shelf life. Color evolution of food samples is an important indicator of product quality in food drying. Although existing studies have examined color changes under different drying conditions, current approaches primarily rely on low-dimensional color features and cannot fully capture the complex, dynamic color trajectories of food samples. Moreover, existing modeling approaches lack the ability to generalize to unseen process conditions. To address these limitations, we develop a novel multi-modal color-trajectory prediction method that integrates high-dimensional temporal color information with drying process parameters to enable accurate and data-efficient color trajectory prediction. Under unseen drying conditions, the model attains RMSEs of 2.12 for cookie drying and 1.29 for apple drying, reducing errors by over 90% compared with baseline models. These experimental results demonstrate the model's superior accuracy, robustness, and broad applicability.</description>

      <title>Do You Feel Comfortable? Detecting Hidden Conversational Escalation in AI Chatbots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly integrated into everyday interactions, serving not only as information assistants but also as emotional companions. Even in the absence of explicit toxicity, repeated emotional reinforcement or affective drift can gradually escalate distress in a form of \textit{implicit harm} that traditional toxicity filters fail to detect. Existing guardrail mechanisms often rely on external classifiers or clinical rubrics that may lag behind the nuanced, real-time dynamics of a developing conversation. To address this gap, we propose GAUGE (Guarding Affective Utterance Generation Escalation), a lightweight, logit-based framework for the real-time detection of hidden conversational escalation. GAUGE measures how an LLM's output probabilistically shifts the affective state of a dialogue.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Memory Use in Reinforcement Learning with Temporal Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How much does a trained RL policy actually use its past observations? We propose \emph{Temporal Range}, a model-agnostic metric that treats first-order sensitivities of multiple vector outputs across a temporal window to the input sequence as a temporal influence profile and summarizes it by the magnitude-weighted average lag. Temporal Range is computed via reverse-mode automatic differentiation from the Jacobian blocks $\partial y_s/\partial x_t\in\mathbb{R}^{c\times d}$ averaged over final timesteps $s\in\{t+1,\dots,T\}$ and is well-characterized in the linear setting by a small set of natural axioms. Across diagnostic and control tasks (POPGym; flicker/occlusion; Copy-$k$) and architectures (MLPs, RNNs, SSMs), Temporal Range (i) remains small in fully observed control, (ii) scales with the task's ground-truth lag in Copy-$k$, and (iii) aligns with the minimum history window required for near-optimal return as confirmed by window ablations. We also report Temporal Range for a compact Long Expressive Memory (LEM) policy trained on the task, using it as a proxy readout of task-level memory. Our axiomatic treatment draws on recent work on range measures, specialized here to temporal lag and extended to vector-valued outputs in the RL setting. Temporal Range thus offers a practical per-sequence readout of memory dependence for comparing agents and environments and for selecting the shortest sufficient context.</description>

      <title>Auto-exploration for online reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration-exploitation dilemma in reinforcement learning (RL) is a fundamental challenge to efficient RL algorithms. Existing algorithms for finite state and action discounted RL problems address this by assuming sufficient exploration over both state and action spaces. However, this yields non-implementable algorithms and sub-optimal performance. To resolve these limitations, we introduce a new class of methods with auto-exploration, or methods that automatically explore both state and action spaces in a parameter-free way, i.e.,~without a priori knowledge of problem-dependent parameters. We present two variants: one for the tabular setting and one for linear function approximation. Under algorithm-independent assumptions on the existence of an exploring optimal policy, both methods attain $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity to solve to $\epsilon$ error. Crucially, these complexities are novel since they are void of algorithm-dependent parameters seen in prior works, which may be arbitrarily large. The methods are also simple to implement because they are parameter-free and do not directly estimate the unknown parameters. These feats are achieved by new algorithmic innovations for RL, including a dynamic mixing time, a discounted state distribution for sampling, a simple robust gradient estimator, and a recent advantage gap function to certify convergence.</description>

      <title>DUET: Agentic Design Understanding via Experimentation and Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are being used to solve increasingly complex software engineering challenges, but struggle with hardware design tasks. Register Transfer Level (RTL) code presents a unique challenge for LLMs, as it encodes complex, dynamic, time-evolving behaviors using the low-level language features of SystemVerilog. LLMs struggle to infer these complex behaviors from the syntax of RTL alone, which limits their ability to complete all downstream tasks like code completion, documentation, or verification. In response to this issue, we present DUET: a general methodology for developing Design Understanding via Experimentation and Testing. DUET mimics how hardware design experts develop an understanding of complex designs: not just via a one-off readthrough of the RTL, but via iterative experimentation using a number of tools. DUET iteratively generates hypotheses, tests them with EDA tools (e.g., simulation, waveform inspection, and formal verification), and integrates the results to build a bottom-up understanding of the design. In our evaluations, we show that DUET improves AI agent performance on formal verification, when compared to a baseline flow without experimentation.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Outputs When Two Large Language Models Interact in a Multi-Agentic Setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report what happens when two large language models respond to each other for many turns without any outside input in a multi-agent setup. The setup begins with a short seed sentence. After that, each model reads the other's output and generates a response. This continues for a fixed number of steps. We used Mistral Nemo Base 2407 and Llama 2 13B hf. We observed that most conversations start coherently but later fall into repetition. In many runs, a short phrase appears and repeats across turns. Once repetition begins, both models tend to produce similar output rather than introducing a new direction in the conversation. This leads to a loop where the same or similar text is produced repeatedly. We describe this behavior as a form of convergence. It occurs even though the models are large, trained separately, and not given any prompt instructions. To study this behavior, we apply lexical and embedding-based metrics to measure how far the conversation drifts from the initial seed and how similar the outputs of the two models becomes as the conversation progresses.</description>

      <title>Who Will Top the Charts? Multimodal Music Popularity Prediction via Adaptive Fusion of Modality Experts and Temporal Engagement Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting a song's commercial success prior to its release remains an open and critical research challenge for the music industry. Early prediction of music popularity informs strategic decisions, creative planning, and marketing. Existing methods suffer from four limitations:(i) temporal dynamics in audio and lyrics are averaged away; (ii) lyrics are represented as a bag of words, disregarding compositional structure and affective semantics; (iii) artist- and song-level historical performance is ignored; and (iv) multimodal fusion approaches rely on simple feature concatenation, resulting in poorly aligned shared representations. To address these limitations, we introduce GAMENet, an end-to-end multimodal deep learning architecture for music popularity prediction. GAMENet integrates modality-specific experts for audio, lyrics, and social metadata through an adaptive gating mechanism. We use audio features from Music4AllOnion processed via OnionEnsembleAENet, a network of autoencoders designed for robust feature extraction; lyric embeddings derived through a large language model pipeline; and newly introduced Career Trajectory Dynamics (CTD) features that capture multi-year artist career momentum and song-level trajectory statistics. Using the Music4All dataset (113k tracks), previously explored in MIR tasks but not popularity prediction, GAMENet achieves a 12% improvement in R^2 over direct multimodal feature concatenation. Spotify audio descriptors alone yield an R^2 of 0.13. Integrating aggregate CTD features increases this to 0.69, with an additional 7% gain from temporal CTD features. We further validate robustness using the SpotGenTrack Popularity Dataset (100k tracks), achieving a 16% improvement over the previous baseline. Extensive ablations confirm the model's effectiveness and the distinct contribution of each modality.</description>

      <title>Networked Restless Multi-Arm Bandits with Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs) are a powerful framework for sequential decision-making, widely applied in resource allocation and intervention optimization challenges in public health. However, traditional RMABs assume independence among arms, limiting their ability to account for interactions between individuals that can be common and significant in a real-world environment. This paper introduces Networked RMAB, a novel framework that integrates the RMAB model with the independent cascade model to capture interactions between arms in networked environments. We define the Bellman equation for networked RMAB and present its computational challenge due to exponentially large action and state spaces. To resolve the computational challenge, we establish the submodularity of Bellman equation and apply the hill-climbing algorithm to achieve a $1-\frac{1}{e}$ approximation guarantee in Bellman updates. Lastly, we prove that the approximate Bellman updates are guaranteed to converge by a modified contraction analysis. We experimentally verify these results by developing an efficient Q-learning algorithm tailored to the networked setting. Experimental results on real-world graph data demonstrate that our Q-learning approach outperforms both $k$-step look-ahead and network-blind approaches, highlighting the importance of capturing and leveraging network effects where they exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a vision-language task that localizes a specific image region based on a textual description. Existing REC benchmarks primarily evaluate perceptual capabilities and lack interpretable scoring mechanisms, which cannot reveal the grounding capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) across different cognitive abilities. To address this limitation, we introduce RefBench-PRO, a comprehensive REC benchmark, which decomposes referring expressions into two core dimensions, i.e., perception and reasoning, and further subdivides them into six progressively challenging tasks, such as attribute, position, interaction, commonsense, relation and reject. We also develop a fully automated data-generation pipeline that produces diverse referring expressions across these six sub-dimensions. Furthermore, We propose Ref-R1, an RL-based learning scheme, which incorporates Dynamic IoU-based GRPO to improve localization accuracy under increasingly complex reasoning conditions, establishing a stronger baseline for REC. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RefBench-PRO enables interpretable evaluation of MLLM on referring expression comprehension, presenting greater challenges in both perception and reasoning.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Intrinsic Visual Representation Capability of Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in multimodal tasks. Despite their impressive performance, MLLMs suffer from the modality imbalance issue, where visual information is often underutilized compared to textual representations in deeper layers, leading to degraded visual performance or hallucinations. This issue stems from the predominant reliance on next-text-token-prediction during training, which fails to provide direct visual supervisory signals, resulting in progressive homogenization of visual representations throughout the layers. To this end, we propose Latent Visual Reconstruction (LaVer), a novel training framework that facilitates MLLMs in learning more discriminative visual representations via masked image modeling in the joint latent semantic space of LLM. Our method offers direct visual activation to MLLMs, which exhibit increased visual attention allocation, indicating enhanced utilization of visual information. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks prove the superiority of our approach in various scenarios, especially those requiring dense visual capabilities. Code of LaVer is available at https://github.com/Fir-lat/LaVer.</description>

Abstract: Modern neural networks exhibit a striking property: basins of attraction in the loss landscape are often connected by low-loss paths, yet optimization dynamics generally remain confined to a single convex basin and rarely explore intermediate points. We resolve this paradox by identifying entropic barriers arising from the interplay between curvature variations along these paths and noise in optimization dynamics. Empirically, we find that curvature systematically rises away from minima, producing effective forces that bias noisy dynamics back toward the endpoints - even when the loss remains nearly flat. These barriers persist longer than energetic barriers, shaping the late-time localization of solutions in parameter space. Our results highlight the role of curvature-induced entropic forces in governing both connectivity and confinement in deep learning landscapes.</description>

      <title>Chemistry Integrated Language Model using Hierarchical Molecular Representation for Polymer Informatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has transformed material discovery for inorganic compounds and small molecules, yet polymers remain largely inaccessible to these methods. While data scarcity is often cited as the primary bottleneck, we demonstrate that strategic molecular representations can overcome this limitation. We introduce CI-LLM (Chemically Informed Language Model), a framework combining HAPPY (Hierarchically Abstracted rePeat unit of PolYmer), which encodes chemical substructures as tokens, with numerical descriptors within transformer architectures. For property prediction, De$^3$BERTa, our descriptor-enriched encoder, achieves 3.5x faster inference than SMILES-based models with improved accuracy ($R^2$ score gains of 0.9-4.1 percent across four properties), while providing interpretable structure-property insights at the subgroup level. For inverse design, our GPT-based generator produces polymers with targeted properties, achieving 100 percent scaffold retention and successful multi-property optimization for negatively correlated objectives. This comprehensive framework demonstrates both forward prediction and inverse design capabilities, showcasing how strategic molecular representation advances machine learning applications in polymer science.</description>

      <title>Degrading Voice: A Comprehensive Overview of Robust Voice Conversion Through Input Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identity, accent, style, and emotions are essential components of human speech. Voice conversion (VC) techniques process the speech signals of two input speakers and other modalities of auxiliary information such as prompts and emotion tags. It changes para-linguistic features from one to another, while maintaining linguistic contents. Recently, VC models have made rapid advancements in both generation quality and personalization capabilities. These developments have attracted considerable attention for diverse applications, including privacy preservation, voice-print reproduction for the deceased, and dysarthric speech recovery. However, these models only learn non-robust features due to the clean training data. Subsequently, it results in unsatisfactory performances when dealing with degraded input speech in real-world scenarios, including additional noise, reverberation, adversarial attacks, or even minor perturbation. Hence, it demands robust deployments, especially in real-world settings. Although latest researches attempt to find potential attacks and countermeasures for VC systems, there remains a significant gap in the comprehensive understanding of how robust the VC model is under input manipulation. here also raises many questions: For instance, to what extent do different forms of input degradation attacks alter the expected output of VC models? Is there potential for optimizing these attack and defense strategies? To answer these questions, we classify existing attack and defense methods from the perspective of input manipulation and evaluate the impact of degraded input speech across four dimensions, including intelligibility, naturalness, timbre similarity, and subjective perception. Finally, we outline open issues and future directions.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Spatiotemporal Properties for Efficient Event-Driven Human Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human pose estimation focuses on predicting body keypoints to analyze human motion. Event cameras provide high temporal resolution and low latency, enabling robust estimation under challenging conditions. However, most existing methods convert event streams into dense event frames, which adds extra computation and sacrifices the high temporal resolution of the event signal. In this work, we aim to exploit the spatiotemporal properties of event streams based on point cloud-based framework, designed to enhance human pose estimation performance. We design Event Temporal Slicing Convolution module to capture short-term dependencies across event slices, and combine it with Event Slice Sequencing module for structured temporal modeling. We also apply edge enhancement in point cloud-based event representation to enhance spatial edge information under sparse event conditions to further improve performance. Experiments on the DHP19 dataset show our proposed method consistently improves performance across three representative point cloud backbones: PointNet, DGCNN, and Point Transformer.</description>

      <title>When Distance Distracts: Representation Distance Bias in BT-Loss for Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reward models are central to Large Language Model (LLM) alignment within the framework of RLHF. The standard objective used in reward modeling is the Bradley-Terry (BT) loss, which learns from pairwise data consisting of a pair of chosen and rejected responses. In this work, we analyze the per-sample gradient of BT-loss and show that its norm scales with two distinct components: (1) the difference in predicted rewards between chosen and rejected responses, which reflects the prediction error, and critically, (2) representation distance between the pair measured in the output space of the final layer. While the first term captures the intended training signal, we show that the second term can significantly impact the update magnitude and misalign learning. Specifically, pairs with small representation distance often receive vanishingly weak updates, even when misranked, while pairs with large distance receive disproportionately strong updates. This leads to gradients from large-distance pairs to overshadow those from small-distance pairs, where fine-grained distinctions are especially important. To overcome this limitation, we propose NormBT, an adaptive pair-wise normalization scheme that balances representation-driven effects and focuses learning signals on prediction error. NormBT is a lightweight, drop-in integration to BT loss with negligible overhead. Across various LLM backbones and datasets, NormBT improves reward model performance consistently, with notable gains of over 5% on the Reasoning category of RewardBench, which contains numerous small-distance pairs. This work reveals a key limitation in the widely used BT objective and provides a simple, effective correction.</description>

      <title>Why They Disagree: Decoding Differences in Opinions about AI Risk on the Lex Fridman Podcast</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of transformative technologies often surfaces deep societal divisions, nowhere more evident than in contemporary debates about artificial intelligence (AI). A striking feature of these divisions is that they persist despite shared interests in ensuring that AI benefits humanity and avoiding catastrophic outcomes. This paper analyzes contemporary debates about AI risk, parsing the differences between the "doomer" and "boomer" perspectives into definitional, factual, causal, and moral premises to identify key points of contention. We find that differences in perspectives about existential risk ("X-risk") arise fundamentally from differences in causal premises about design vs. emergence in complex systems, while differences in perspectives about employment risks ("E-risks") pertain to different causal premises about the applicability of past theories (evolution) vs their inapplicability (revolution). Disagreements about these two forms of AI risk appear to share two properties: neither involves significant disagreements on moral values and both can be described in terms of differing views on the extent of boundedness of human rationality. Our approach to analyzing reasoning chains at scale, using an ensemble of LLMs to parse textual data, can be applied to identify key points of contention in debates about risk to the public in any arena.</description>

      <title>Proportional integral derivative booster for neural networks-based time-series prediction: Case of water demand prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-step time-series prediction is an essential supportive step for decision-makers in several industrial areas. Artificial intelligence techniques, which use a neural network component in various forms, have recently frequently been used to accomplish this step. However, the complexity of the neural network structure still stands up as a critical problem against prediction accuracy. In this paper, a method inspired by the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control approach is investigated to enhance the performance of neural network models used for multi-step ahead prediction of periodic time-series information while maintaining a negligible impact on the complexity of the system. The PID-based method is applied to the predicted value at each time step to bring that value closer to the real value. The water demand forecasting problem is considered as a case study, where two deep neural network models from the literature are used to prove the effectiveness of the proposed boosting method. Furthermore, to prove the applicability of this PID-based booster to other types of periodic time-series prediction problems, it is applied to enhance the accuracy of a neural network model used for multi-step forecasting of hourly energy consumption. The comparison between the results of the original prediction models and the results after using the proposed technique demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method in terms of prediction accuracy and system complexity.</description>

      <title>Protecting Bystander Privacy via Selective Hearing in LALMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large audio language models (LALMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world settings where they inevitably capture speech from unintended nearby bystanders, raising privacy risks that existing benchmarks and defences largely overlook. We introduce SH-Bench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate selective hearing: a model's ability to attend to an intended main speaker while refusing to process or reveal information about incidental bystander speech. SH-Bench contains 3,968 multi-speaker audio mixtures spanning both real-world and synthetic scenarios, paired with 77k multiple-choice questions that probe models under general and selective operating modes. We propose Selective Efficacy (SE), a unified metric capturing both multi-speaker comprehension and bystander-privacy protection. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LALMs reveals substantial privacy leakage, with strong audio understanding failing to translate into selective protection of bystander privacy. To mitigate this gap, we introduce Bystander Privacy Fine-Tuning (BPFT), a training pipeline that teaches models to refuse bystander-related queries without degrading main-speaker comprehension. BPFT yields substantial gains which improve SE by up to 15.9% over Gemini 2.5 Pro, demonstrating that selective hearing is learnable but far from achieved in current LALMs. SH-Bench and BPFT provide the first systematic framework for measuring and improving bystander privacy in audio foundation models.</description>

      <title>Web Technologies Security in the AI Era: A Survey of CDN-Enhanced Defenses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modern web stack, which is dominated by browser-based applications and API-first backends, now operates under an adversarial equilibrium where automated, AI-assisted attacks evolve continuously. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and edge computing place programmable defenses closest to users and bots, making them natural enforcement points for machine-learning (ML) driven inspection, throttling, and isolation. This survey synthesizes the landscape of AI-enhanced defenses deployed at the edge: (i) anomaly- and behavior-based Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) within broader Web Application and API Protection (WAAP), (ii) adaptive DDoS detection and mitigation, (iii) bot management that resists human-mimicry, and (iv) API discovery, positive security modeling, and encrypted-traffic anomaly analysis. We add a systematic survey method, a threat taxonomy mapped to edge-observable signals, evaluation metrics, deployment playbooks, and governance guidance. We conclude with a research agenda spanning XAI, adversarial robustness, and autonomous multi-agent defense. Our findings indicate that edge-centric AI measurably improves time-to-detect and time-to-mitigate while reducing data movement and enhancing compliance, yet introduces new risks around model abuse, poisoning, and governance.</description>

      <title>RLAX: Large-Scale, Distributed Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models on TPUs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as the de-facto paradigm for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We have developed RLAX, a scalable RL framework on TPUs. RLAX employs a parameter-server architecture. A master trainer periodically pushes updated model weights to the parameter server while a fleet of inference workers pull the latest weights and generates new rollouts. We introduce a suite of system techniques to enable scalable and preemptible RL for a diverse set of state-of-art RL algorithms. To accelerate convergence and improve model quality, we have devised new dataset curation and alignment techniques. Large-scale evaluations show that RLAX improves QwQ-32B's pass@8 accuracy by 12.8% in just 12 hours 48 minutes on 1024 v5p TPUs, while remaining robust to preemptions during training.</description>

Abstract: The increasing complexity of cyber threats in distributed environments demands advanced frameworks for real-time detection and response across multimodal data streams. This paper introduces AgenticCyber, a generative AI powered multi-agent system that orchestrates specialized agents to monitor cloud logs, surveillance videos, and environmental audio concurrently. The solution achieves 96.2% F1-score in threat detection, reduces response latency to 420 ms, and enables adaptive security posture management using multimodal language models like Google's Gemini coupled with LangChain for agent orchestration. Benchmark datasets, such as AWS CloudTrail logs, UCF-Crime video frames, and UrbanSound8K audio clips, show greater performance over standard intrusion detection systems, reducing mean time to respond (MTTR) by 65% and improving situational awareness. This work introduces a scalable, modular proactive cybersecurity architecture for enterprise networks and IoT ecosystems that overcomes siloed security technologies with cross-modal reasoning and automated remediation.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Training Dynamics in Scale-wise Autoregressive Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) generative models have produced increasingly powerful systems for media synthesis. Among them, next-scale prediction has emerged as a popular paradigm, where models generate images in a coarse-to-fine manner. However, scale-wise AR models suffer from exposure bias, which undermines generation quality. We identify two primary causes of this issue: (1) train-test mismatch, where the model must rely on its own imperfect predictions during inference, and (2) imbalance in scale-wise learning difficulty, where certain scales exhibit disproportionately higher optimization complexity. Through a comprehensive analysis of training dynamics, we propose Self-Autoregressive Refinement (SAR) to address these limitations. SAR introduces a Stagger-Scale Rollout (SSR) mechanism that performs lightweight autoregressive rollouts to expose the model to its own intermediate predictions, thereby aligning train-test patterns, and a complementary Contrastive Student-Forcing Loss (CSFL) that provides adequate supervision for self-generated contexts to ensure stable training. Experimental results show that applying SAR to pretrained AR models consistently improves generation quality with minimal computational overhead. For instance, SAR yields a 5.2% FID reduction on FlexVAR-d16 trained on ImageNet 256 within 10 epochs (5 hours on 32xA100 GPUs). Given its efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness, we expect SAR to serve as a reliable post-training method for visual autoregressive generation.</description>

      <title>When Gender is Hard to See: Multi-Attribute Support for Long-Range Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate gender recognition from extreme long-range imagery remains a challenging problem due to limited spatial resolution, viewpoint variability, and loss of facial cues. For such purpose, we present a dual-path transformer framework that leverages CLIP to jointly model visual and attribute-driven cues for gender recognition at a distance. The framework integrates two complementary streams: (1) a direct visual path that refines a pre-trained CLIP image encoder through selective fine-tuning of its upper layers, and (2) an attribute-mediated path that infers gender from a set of soft-biometric prompts (e.g., hairstyle, clothing, accessories) aligned in the CLIP text-image space. Spatial channel attention modules further enhance discriminative localization under occlusion and low resolution. To support large-scale evaluation, we construct U-DetAGReID, a unified long-range gender dataset derived from DetReIDx and AG-ReID.v2, harmonized under a consistent ternary labeling scheme (Male, Female, Unknown). Extensive experiments suggest that the proposed solution surpasses state-of-the-art person-attribute and re-identification baselines across multiple metrics (macro-F1, accuracy, AUC), with consistent robustness to distance, angle, and height variations. Qualitative attention visualizations confirm interpretable attribute localization and responsible abstention behavior. Our results show that language-guided dual-path learning offers a principled, extensible foundation for responsible gender recognition in unconstrained long-range scenarios.</description>

      <title>Vec-LUT: Vector Table Lookup for Parallel Ultra-Low-Bit LLM Inference on Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on edge devices. To meet strict resource constraints, real-world deployment has pushed LLM quantization from 8-bit to 4-bit, 2-bit, and now 1.58-bit. Combined with lookup table (LUT)-based inference, CPUs run these ultra-low-bit LLMs even faster than NPUs, opening new opportunities for ubiquitous on-device intelligence.
  However, this paper identifies that LUT-based inference underutilizes memory bandwidth during parallel inference, which is required for prefilling, test-time scaling, and other multi-token scenarios. The root cause is the scalar LUT paradigm, which performs repetitive and non-contiguous memory accesses for each token.
  To solve the issue, we propose vector LUT, a new lookup paradigm that constructs a unified LUT across parallel tokens, and performs a single $1 \rightarrow N$ lookup per index. To realize it efficiently, we further introduce (1) Vector LUT-Centric Tensor Layout, and (2) Cache-Aware Streamed Lookup techniques. Evaluations on 5 edge devices across 3 LLMs show that Vec-LUT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to $4.2\times$.

      <title>Instance Dependent Testing of Samplers using Interval Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling algorithms play a pivotal role in probabilistic AI. However, verifying if a sampler program indeed samples from the claimed distribution is a notoriously hard problem. Provably correct testers like Barbarik, Teq, Flash, CubeProbe for testing of different kinds of samplers were proposed only in the last few years. All these testers focus on the worst-case efficiency, and do not support verification of samplers over infinite domains, a case occurring frequently in Astronomy, Finance, Network Security, etc.
  In this work, we design the first tester of samplers with instance-dependent efficiency, allowing us to test samplers over natural numbers. Our tests are developed via a novel distance estimation algorithm between an unknown and a known probability distribution using an interval conditioning framework. The core technical contribution is a new connection with probability mass estimation of a continuous distribution. The practical gains are also substantial: our experiments establish up to 1000x speedup over state-of-the-art testers.</description>

      <title>Why Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning Works: Relation to Dual Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) concerns the problem of training an agent to maximize the probability of reaching target goal states. This paper presents an analysis of the goal-conditioned setting based on optimal control. In particular, we derive an optimality gap between more classical, often quadratic, objectives and the goal-conditioned reward, elucidating the success of goal-conditioned RL and why classical ``dense'' rewards can falter. We then consider the partially observed Markov decision setting and connect state estimation to our probabilistic reward, further making the goal-conditioned reward well suited to dual control problems. The advantages of goal-conditioned policies are validated on nonlinear and uncertain environments using both RL and predictive control techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing language proficiency is essential for education, as it enables instruction tailored to learners needs. This paper investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatically classifying German texts according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) into different proficiency levels. To support robust training and evaluation, we construct a diverse dataset by combining multiple existing CEFR-annotated corpora with synthetic data. We then evaluate prompt-engineering strategies, fine-tuning of a LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct model and a probing-based approach that utilizes the internal neural state of the LLM for classification. Our results show a consistent performance improvement over prior methods, highlighting the potential of LLMs for reliable and scalable CEFR classification.</description>

      <title>PRIMRose: Insights into the Per-Residue Energy Metrics of Proteins with Double InDel Mutations using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how protein mutations affect protein structure is essential for advancements in computational biology and bioinformatics. We introduce PRIMRose, a novel approach that predicts energy values for each residue given a mutated protein sequence. Unlike previous models that assess global energy shifts, our method analyzes the localized energetic impact of double amino acid insertions or deletions (InDels) at the individual residue level, enabling residue-specific insights into structural and functional disruption. We implement a Convolutional Neural Network architecture to predict the energy changes of each residue in a protein mutation. We train our model on datasets constructed from nine proteins, grouped into three categories: one set with exhaustive double InDel mutations, another with approximately 145k randomly sampled double InDel mutations, and a third with approximately 80k randomly sampled double InDel mutations. Our model achieves high predictive accuracy across a range of energy metrics as calculated by the Rosetta molecular modeling suite and reveals localized patterns that influence model performance, such as solvent accessibility and secondary structure context. This per-residue analysis offers new insights into the mutational tolerance of specific regions within proteins and provides higher interpretable and biologically meaningful predictions of InDels' effects.</description>

      <title>Method of UAV Inspection of Photovoltaic Modules Using Thermal and RGB Data Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The subject of this research is the development of an intelligent, integrated framework for the automated inspection of photovoltaic (PV) infrastructure that addresses the critical shortcomings of conventional methods, including thermal palette bias, data redundancy, and high communication bandwidth requirements. The goal of this study is to design, develop, and validate a comprehensive, multi-modal system that fully automates the monitoring workflow, from data acquisition to the generation of actionable, geo-located maintenance alerts, thereby enhancing plant safety and operational efficiency. The methods employed involve a synergistic architecture that begins with a palette-invariant thermal embedding, learned by enforcing representational consistency, which is fused with a contrast-normalized RGB stream via a gated mechanism. This is supplemented by a closed-loop, adaptive re-acquisition controller that uses Rodrigues-based updates for targeted confirmation of ambiguous anomalies and a geospatial deduplication module that clusters redundant alerts using DBSCAN over the haversine distance. In conclusion, this study establishes a powerful new paradigm for proactive PV inspection, with the proposed system achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.903 on the public PVF-10 benchmark, a significant 12-15% improvement over single-modality baselines. Field validation confirmed the system's readiness, achieving 96% recall, while the de-duplication process reduced duplicate-induced false positives by 15-20%, and relevance-only telemetry cut airborne data transmission by 60-70%.</description>

      <title>AI as "Co-founder": GenAI for Entrepreneurship</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies whether, how, and for whom generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) facilitates firm creation. Our identification strategy exploits the November 2022 release of ChatGPT as a global shock that lowered start-up costs and leverages variations across geo-coded grids with differential pre-existing AI-specific human capital. Using high-resolution and universal data on Chinese firm registrations by the end of 2024, we find that grids with stronger AI-specific human capital experienced a sharp surge in new firm formation$\unicode{x2013}$driven entirely by small firms, contributing to 6.0% of overall national firm entry. Large-firm entry declines, consistent with a shift toward leaner ventures. New firms are smaller in capital, shareholder number, and founding team size, especially among small firms. The effects are strongest among firms with potential AI applications, weaker financing needs, and among first-time entrepreneurs. Overall, our results highlight that GenAI serves as a pro-competitive force by disproportionately boosting small-firm entry.</description>

      <title>ShadowWolf -- Automatic Labelling, Evaluation and Model Training Optimised for Camera Trap Wildlife Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous growth of the global human population is leading to the expansion of human habitats, resulting in decreasing wildlife spaces and increasing human-wildlife interactions. These interactions can range from minor disturbances, such as raccoons in urban waste bins, to more severe consequences, including species extinction. As a result, the monitoring of wildlife is gaining significance in various contexts. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a solution by automating the recognition of animals in images and videos, thereby reducing the manual effort required for wildlife monitoring. Traditional AI training involves three main stages: image collection, labelling, and model training. However, the variability, for example, in the landscape (e.g., mountains, open fields, forests), weather (e.g., rain, fog, sunshine), lighting (e.g., day, night), and camera-animal distances presents significant challenges to model robustness and adaptability in real-world scenarios.
  In this work, we propose a unified framework, called ShadowWolf, designed to address these challenges by integrating and optimizing the stages of AI model training and evaluation. The proposed framework enables dynamic model retraining to adjust to changes in environmental conditions and application requirements, thereby reducing labelling efforts and allowing for on-site model adaptation. This adaptive and unified approach enhances the accuracy and efficiency of wildlife monitoring systems, promoting more effective and scalable conservation efforts.</description>

      <title>Novel Deep Learning Architectures for Classification and Segmentation of Brain Tumors from MRI Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain tumors pose a significant threat to human life, therefore it is very much necessary to detect them accurately in the early stages for better diagnosis and treatment. Brain tumors can be detected by the radiologist manually from the MRI scan images of the patients. However, the incidence of brain tumors has risen amongst children and adolescents in recent years, resulting in a substantial volume of data, as a result, it is time-consuming and difficult to detect manually. With the emergence of Artificial intelligence in the modern world and its vast application in the medical field, we can make an approach to the CAD (Computer Aided Diagnosis) system for the early detection of Brain tumors automatically. All the existing models for this task are not completely generalized and perform poorly on the validation data. So, we have proposed two novel Deep Learning Architectures - (a) SAETCN (Self-Attention Enhancement Tumor Classification Network) for the classification of different kinds of brain tumors. We have achieved an accuracy of 99.38% on the validation dataset making it one of the few Novel Deep learning-based architecture that is capable of detecting brain tumors accurately. We have trained the model on the dataset, which contains images of 3 types of tumors (glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors) and non-tumor cases. and (b) SAS-Net (Self-Attentive Segmentation Network) for the accurate segmentation of brain tumors. We have achieved an overall pixel accuracy of 99.23%.</description>

      <title>Beyond Token-level Supervision: Unlocking the Potential of Decoding-based Regression via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoding-based regression, which reformulates regression as a sequence generation task, has emerged as a promising paradigm of applying large language models for numerical prediction. However, its progress is hindered by the misalignment between discrete token-level objectives (e.g., cross-entropy) and continuous numerical values. Existing approaches relying on token-level constraints often fail to capture the global magnitude of the target value, limiting their precision and generalization. In this paper, we propose to unlock the potential of decoding-based regression via Reinforcement Learning (RL). We formulate the generation process as a Markov Decision Process, utilizing sequence-level rewards to enforce global numerical coherence. Extensive experiments on tabular regression and code metric regression demonstrate that our method (specifically with ReMax and GRPO) consistently outperforms both state-of-the-art token-level baselines and traditional regression heads, showing the superiority of introducing sequence-level signals. Our analysis further reveals that RL significantly enhances sampling efficiency and predictive precision, establishing decoding-based regression as a robust and accurate paradigm for general-purpose numerical prediction.</description>

      <title>A-3PO: Accelerating Asynchronous LLM Training with Staleness-aware Proximal Policy Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoupled loss has been a successful reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to deal with the high data staleness under the asynchronous RL setting. Decoupled loss improves coupled-loss style of algorithms' (e.g., PPO, GRPO) learning stability by introducing a proximal policy to decouple the off-policy corrections (importance weight) from the controlling policy updates (trust region). However, the proximal policy requires an extra forward pass through the network at each training step, creating a computational bottleneck for large language models. We observe that since the proximal policy only serves as a trust region anchor between the behavior and target policies, we can approximate it through simple interpolation without explicit computation. We call this approach A-3PO (APproximated Proximal Policy Optimization). A-3PO eliminates this overhead, reducing training time by 18% while maintaining comparable performance.

      <title>BEACON: A Unified Behavioral-Tactical Framework for Explainable Cybercrime Analysis with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cybercrime increasingly exploits human cognitive biases in addition to technical vulnerabilities, yet most existing analytical frameworks focus primarily on operational aspects and overlook psychological manipulation. This paper proposes BEACON, a unified dual-dimension framework that integrates behavioral psychology with the tactical lifecycle of cybercrime to enable structured, interpretable, and scalable analysis of cybercrime. We formalize six psychologically grounded manipulation categories derived from Prospect Theory and Cialdini's principles of persuasion, alongside a fourteen-stage cybercrime tactical lifecycle spanning reconnaissance to final impact. A single large language model is fine-tuned using parameter-efficient learning to perform joint multi-label classification across both psychological and tactical dimensions while simultaneously generating human-interpretable explanations. Experiments conducted on a curated dataset of real-world and synthetically augmented cybercrime narratives demonstrate a 20 percent improvement in overall classification accuracy over the base model, along with substantial gains in reasoning quality measured using ROUGE and BERTScore. The proposed system enables automated decomposition of unstructured victim narratives into structured behavioral and operational intelligence, supporting improved cybercrime investigation, case linkage, and proactive scam detection.</description>

      <title>Securing the Model Context Protocol: Defending LLMs Against Tool Poisoning and Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables Large Language Models to integrate external tools through structured descriptors, increasing autonomy in decision-making, task execution, and multi-agent workflows. However, this autonomy creates a largely overlooked security gap. Existing defenses focus on prompt-injection attacks and fail to address threats embedded in tool metadata, leaving MCP-based systems exposed to semantic manipulation. This work analyzes three classes of semantic attacks on MCP-integrated systems: (1) Tool Poisoning, where adversarial instructions are hidden in tool descriptors; (2) Shadowing, where trusted tools are indirectly compromised through contaminated shared context; and (3) Rug Pulls, where descriptors are altered after approval to subvert behavior. To counter these threats, we introduce a layered security framework with three components: RSA-based manifest signing to enforce descriptor integrity, LLM-on-LLM semantic vetting to detect suspicious tool definitions, and lightweight heuristic guardrails that block anomalous tool behavior at runtime. Through evaluation of GPT-4, DeepSeek, and Llama-3.5 across eight prompting strategies, we find that security performance varies widely by model architecture and reasoning method. GPT-4 blocks about 71 percent of unsafe tool calls, balancing latency and safety. DeepSeek shows the highest resilience to Shadowing attacks but with greater latency, while Llama-3.5 is fastest but least robust. Our results show that the proposed framework reduces unsafe tool invocation rates without model fine-tuning or internal modification.</description>

      <title>SUGAR: A Sweeter Spot for Generative Unlearning of Many Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-aware generative models have enabled high-fidelity image synthesis of human identities. However, this progress raises urgent questions around user consent and the ability to remove specific individuals from a model's output space. We address this by introducing SUGAR, a framework for scalable generative unlearning that enables the removal of many identities (simultaneously or sequentially) without retraining the entire model. Rather than projecting unwanted identities to unrealistic outputs or relying on static template faces, SUGAR learns a personalized surrogate latent for each identity, diverting reconstructions to visually coherent alternatives while preserving the model's quality and diversity. We further introduce a continual utility preservation objective that guards against degradation as more identities are forgotten. SUGAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in removing up to 200 identities, while delivering up to a 700% improvement in retention utility compared to existing baselines. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/judydnguyen/SUGAR-Generative-Unlearn.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work develops the global equations of neural networks through stacked piecewise manifolds, fixed-point theory, and boundary-conditioned iteration. Once fixed coordinates and operators are removed, a neural network appears as a learnable numerical computation shaped by manifold complexity, high-order nonlinearity, and boundary conditions. Real-world data impose strong data complexity, near-infinite scope, scale, and minibatch fragmentation, while training dynamics produce learning complexity through shifting node covers, curvature accumulation, and the rise and decay of plasticity. These forces constrain learnability and explain why capability emerges only when fixed-point regions stabilize. Neural networks do not begin with fixed points; they construct them through residual-driven iteration. This perspective clarifies the limits of monolithic models under geometric and data-induced plasticity and motivates architectures and federated systems that distribute manifold complexity across many elastic models, forming a coherent world-modeling framework grounded in geometry, algebra, fixed points, and real-data complexity.</description>

      <title>QL-LSTM: A Parameter-Efficient LSTM for Stable Long-Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent neural architectures such as LSTM and GRU remain widely used in sequence modeling, but they continue to face two core limitations: redundant gate-specific parameters and reduced ability to retain information across long temporal distances. This paper introduces the Quantum-Leap LSTM (QL-LSTM), a recurrent architecture designed to address both challenges through two independent components. The Parameter-Shared Unified Gating mechanism replaces all gate-specific transformations with a single shared weight matrix, reducing parameters by approximately 48 percent while preserving full gating behavior. The Hierarchical Gated Recurrence with Additive Skip Connections component adds a multiplication-free pathway that improves long-range information flow and reduces forget-gate degradation. We evaluate QL-LSTM on sentiment classification using the IMDB dataset with extended document lengths, comparing it to LSTM, GRU, and BiLSTM reference models. QL-LSTM achieves competitive accuracy while using substantially fewer parameters. Although the PSUG and HGR-ASC components are more efficient per time step, the current prototype remains limited by the inherent sequential nature of recurrent models and therefore does not yet yield wall-clock speed improvements without further kernel-level optimization.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Hypergraph and Multi-LLM Agent Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender Systems (RSs) have become the cornerstone of various applications such as e-commerce and social media platforms. The evolution of RSs is paramount in the digital era, in which personalised user experience is tailored to the user's preferences. Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked a new paradigm - generative retrieval and recommendation. Despite their potential, generative RS methods face issues such as hallucination, which degrades the recommendation performance, and high computational cost in practical scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce HGLMRec, a novel Multi-LLM agent-based RS that incorporates a hypergraph encoder designed to capture complex, multi-behaviour relationships between users and items. The HGLMRec model retrieves only the relevant tokens during inference, reducing computational overhead while enriching the retrieval context. Experimental results show performance improvement by HGLMRec against state-of-the-art baselines at lower computational cost.</description>

      <title>Beyond Satisfaction: From Placebic to Actionable Explanations For Enhanced Understandability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) presents useful tools to facilitate transparency and trustworthiness in machine learning systems. However, current evaluations of system explainability often rely heavily on subjective user surveys, which may not adequately capture the effectiveness of explanations. This paper critiques the overreliance on user satisfaction metrics and explores whether these can differentiate between meaningful (actionable) and vacuous (placebic) explanations. In experiments involving optimal Social Security filing age selection tasks, participants used one of three protocols: no explanations, placebic explanations, and actionable explanations. Participants who received actionable explanations significantly outperformed the other groups in objective measures of their mental model, but users rated placebic and actionable explanations as equally satisfying. This suggests that subjective surveys alone fail to capture whether explanations truly support users in building useful domain understanding. We propose that future evaluations of agent explanation capabilities should integrate objective task performance metrics alongside subjective assessments to more accurately measure explanation quality.

      <title>ChargingBoul: A Competitive Negotiating Agent with Novel Opponent Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated negotiation has emerged as a critical area of research in multiagent systems, with applications spanning e-commerce, resource allocation, and autonomous decision-making. This paper presents ChargingBoul, a negotiating agent that competed in the 2022 Automated Negotiating Agents Competition (ANAC) and placed second in individual utility by an exceptionally narrow margin. ChargingBoul employs a lightweight yet effective strategy that balances concession and opponent modeling to achieve high negotiation outcomes. The agent classifies opponents based on bid patterns, dynamically adjusts its bidding strategy, and applies a concession policy in later negotiation stages to maximize utility while fostering agreements. We evaluate ChargingBoul's performance using competition results and subsequent studies that have utilized the agent in negotiation research. Our analysis highlights ChargingBoul's effectiveness across diverse opponent strategies and its contributions to advancing automated negotiation techniques. We also discuss potential enhancements, including more sophisticated opponent modeling and adaptive bidding heuristics, to improve its performance further.</description>

      <title>Memory Power Asymmetry in Human-AI Relationships: Preserving Mutual Forgetting in the Digital Age</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes embedded in personal and professional relationships, a new kind of power imbalance emerges from asymmetric memory capabilities. Human relationships have historically relied on mutual forgetting, the natural tendency for both parties to forget details over time, as a foundation for psychological safety, forgiveness, and identity change. By contrast, AI systems can record, store, and recombine interaction histories at scale, often indefinitely. We introduce Memory Power Asymmetry (MPA): a structural power imbalance that arises when one relationship partner (typically an AI-enabled firm) possesses a substantially superior capacity to record, retain, retrieve, and integrate the shared history of the relationship, and can selectively deploy that history in ways the other partner (the human) cannot. Drawing on research in human memory, power-dependence theory, AI architecture, and consumer vulnerability, we develop a conceptual framework with four dimensions of MPA (persistence, accuracy, accessibility, integration) and four mechanisms by which memory asymmetry is translated into power (strategic memory deployment, narrative control, dependence asymmetry, vulnerability accumulation). We theorize downstream consequences at individual, relational/firm, and societal levels, formulate boundary-conditioned propositions, and articulate six design principles for restoring a healthier balance of memory in human-AI relationships (e.g., forgetting by design, contextual containment, symmetric access to records). Our analysis positions MPA as a distinct construct relative to information asymmetry, privacy, surveillance, and customer relationship management, and argues that protecting mutual forgetting, or at least mutual control over memory, should become a central design and policy goal in the AI age.</description>

      <title>Masked Autoencoder Pretraining on Strong-Lensing Images for Joint Dark-Matter Model Classification and Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing can reveal the influence of dark-matter substructure in galaxies, but analyzing these effects from noisy, low-resolution images poses a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a masked autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy on simulated strong-lensing images from the DeepLense ML4SCI benchmark to learn generalizable representations for two downstream tasks: (i) classifying the underlying dark matter model (cold dark matter, axion-like, or no substructure) and (ii) enhancing low-resolution lensed images via super-resolution. We pretrain a Vision Transformer encoder using a masked image modeling objective, then fine-tune the encoder separately for each task. Our results show that MAE pretraining, when combined with appropriate mask ratio tuning, yields a shared encoder that matches or exceeds a ViT trained from scratch. Specifically, at a 90% mask ratio, the fine-tuned classifier achieves macro AUC of 0.968 and accuracy of 88.65%, compared to the scratch baseline (AUC 0.957, accuracy 82.46%). For super-resolution (16x16 to 64x64), the MAE-pretrained model reconstructs images with PSNR ~33 dB and SSIM 0.961, modestly improving over scratch training. We ablate the MAE mask ratio, revealing a consistent trade-off: higher mask ratios improve classification but slightly degrade reconstruction fidelity. Our findings demonstrate that MAE pretraining on physics-rich simulations provides a flexible, reusable encoder for multiple strong-lensing analysis tasks.</description>

      <title>Financial Fraud Identification and Interpretability Study for Listed Companies Based on Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the emergence of joint-stock companies, financial fraud by listed firms has repeatedly undermined capital markets. Fraud is difficult to detect because of covert tactics and the high labor and time costs of audits. Traditional statistical models are interpretable but struggle with nonlinear feature interactions, while machine learning models are powerful but often opaque. In addition, most existing methods judge fraud only for the current year based on current year data, limiting timeliness.
  This paper proposes a financial fraud detection framework for Chinese A-share listed companies based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We design a feature engineering scheme that transforms firm-year panel data into image like representations, enabling the CNN to capture cross-sectional and temporal patterns and to predict fraud in advance. Experiments show that the CNN outperforms logistic regression and LightGBM in accuracy, robustness, and early-warning performance, and that proper tuning of the classification threshold is crucial in high-risk settings.
  To address interpretability, we analyze the model along the dimensions of entity, feature, and time using local explanation techniques. We find that solvency, ratio structure, governance structure, and internal control are general predictors of fraud, while environmental indicators matter mainly in high-pollution industries. Non-fraud firms share stable feature patterns, whereas fraud firms exhibit heterogeneous patterns concentrated in short time windows. A case study of Guanong Shares in 2022 shows that cash flow analysis, social responsibility, governance structure, and per-share indicators are the main drivers of the model's fraud prediction, consistent with the company's documented misconduct.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Test-Time Training for Predicting Need for Invasive Mechanical Ventilation in Multi-Center Cohorts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in intensive care units (ICUs) patients is crucial for timely interventions and resource allocation. However, variability in patient populations, clinical practices, and electronic health record (EHR) systems across institutions introduces domain shifts that degrade the generalization performance of predictive models during deployment. Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate such shifts by adapting models dynamically during inference without requiring labeled target-domain data. In this work, we introduce Adaptive Test-Time Training (AdaTTT), an enhanced TTT framework tailored for EHR-based IMV prediction in ICU settings. We begin by deriving information-theoretic bounds on the test-time prediction error and demonstrate that it is constrained by the uncertainty between the main and auxiliary tasks. To enhance their alignment, we introduce a self-supervised learning framework with pretext tasks: reconstruction and masked feature modeling optimized through a dynamic masking strategy that emphasizes features critical to the main task. Additionally, to improve robustness against domain shifts, we incorporate prototype learning and employ Partial Optimal Transport (POT) for flexible, partial feature alignment while maintaining clinically meaningful patient representations. Experiments across multi-center ICU cohorts demonstrate competitive classification performance on different test-time adaptation benchmarks.</description>

      <title>GSAE: Graph-Regularized Sparse Autoencoders for Robust LLM Safety Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face critical safety challenges, as they can be manipulated to generate harmful content through adversarial prompts and jailbreak attacks. Many defenses are typically either black-box guardrails that filter outputs, or internals-based methods that steer hidden activations by operationalizing safety as a single latent feature or dimension. While effective for simple concepts, this assumption is limiting, as recent evidence shows that abstract concepts such as refusal and temporality are distributed across multiple features rather than isolated in one. To address this limitation, we introduce Graph-Regularized Sparse Autoencoders (GSAEs), which extends SAEs with a Laplacian smoothness penalty on the neuron co-activation graph. Unlike standard SAEs that assign each concept to a single latent feature, GSAEs recover smooth, distributed safety representations as coherent patterns spanning multiple features. We empirically demonstrate that GSAE enables effective runtime safety steering, assembling features into a weighted set of safety-relevant directions and controlling them with a two-stage gating mechanism that activates interventions only when harmful prompts or continuations are detected during generation. This approach enforces refusals adaptively while preserving utility on benign queries. Across safety and QA benchmarks, GSAE steering achieves an average 82% selective refusal rate, substantially outperforming standard SAE steering (42%), while maintaining strong task accuracy (70% on TriviaQA, 65% on TruthfulQA, 74% on GSM8K). Robustness experiments further show generalization across LLaMA-3, Mistral, Qwen, and Phi families and resilience against jailbreak attacks (GCG, AutoDAN), consistently maintaining &gt;= 90% refusal of harmful content.</description>

      <title>TextMamba: Scene Text Detector with Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In scene text detection, Transformer-based methods have addressed the global feature extraction limitations inherent in traditional convolution neural network-based methods. However, most directly rely on native Transformer attention layers as encoders without evaluating their cross-domain limitations and inherent shortcomings: forgetting important information or focusing on irrelevant representations when modeling long-range dependencies for text detection. The recently proposed state space model Mamba has demonstrated better long-range dependencies modeling through a linear complexity selection mechanism. Therefore, we propose a novel scene text detector based on Mamba that integrates the selection mechanism with attention layers, enhancing the encoder's ability to extract relevant information from long sequences. We adopt the Top\_k algorithm to explicitly select key information and reduce the interference of irrelevant information in Mamba modeling. Additionally, we design a dual-scale feed-forward network and an embedding pyramid enhancement module to facilitate high-dimensional hidden state interactions and multi-scale feature fusion. Our method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on various benchmarks, with F-measures of 89.7\%, 89.2\%, and 78.5\% on CTW1500, TotalText, and ICDAR19ArT, respectively. Codes will be available.</description>

      <title>Towards Small Language Models for Security Query Generation in SOC Workflows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analysts in Security Operations Centers routinely query massive telemetry streams using Kusto Query Language (KQL). Writing correct KQL requires specialized expertise, and this dependency creates a bottleneck as security teams scale. This paper investigates whether Small Language Models (SLMs) can enable accurate, cost-effective natural-language-to-KQL translation for enterprise security. We propose a three-knob framework targeting prompting, fine-tuning, and architecture design. First, we adapt existing NL2KQL framework for SLMs with lightweight retrieval and introduce error-aware prompting that addresses common parser failures without increasing token count. Second, we apply LoRA fine-tuning with rationale distillation, augmenting each NLQ-KQL pair with a brief chain-of-thought explanation to transfer reasoning from a teacher model while keeping the SLM compact. Third, we propose a two-stage architecture that uses an SLM for candidate generation and a low-cost LLM judge for schema-aware refinement and selection. We evaluate nine models (five SLMs and four LLMs) across syntax correctness, semantic accuracy, table selection, and filter precision, alongside latency and token cost. On Microsoft's NL2KQL Defender Evaluation dataset, our two-stage approach achieves 0.987 syntax and 0.906 semantic accuracy. We further demonstrate generalizability on Microsoft Sentinel data, reaching 0.964 syntax and 0.831 semantic accuracy. These results come at up to 10x lower token cost than GPT-5, establishing SLMs as a practical, scalable foundation for natural-language querying in security operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the robustness of feature attribution methods for deep neural networks. It challenges the current notion of attributional robustness that largely ignores the difference in the model's outputs and introduces a new way of evaluating the robustness of attribution methods. Specifically, we propose a new definition of similar inputs, a new robustness metric, and a novel method based on generative adversarial networks to generate these inputs. In addition, we present a comprehensive evaluation with existing metrics and state-of-the-art attribution methods. Our findings highlight the need for a more objective metric that reveals the weaknesses of an attribution method rather than that of the neural network, thus providing a more accurate evaluation of the robustness of attribution methods.</description>

      <title>GradientSpace: Unsupervised Data Clustering for Improved Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instruction tuning is one of the key steps required for adapting large language models (LLMs) to a broad spectrum of downstream applications. However, this procedure is difficult because real-world datasets are rarely homogeneous; they consist of a mixture of diverse information, causing gradient interference, where conflicting gradients pull the model in opposing directions, degrading performance. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to group data based on semantic or embedding similarity. However, this fails to capture how data influences model parameters during learning. While recent works have attempted to cluster gradients directly, they randomly project gradients into lower dimensions to manage memory, which leads to accuracy loss. Moreover, these methods rely on expert ensembles which necessitates multiple inference passes and expensive on-the-fly gradient computations during inference. To address these limitations, we propose GradientSpace, a framework that clusters samples directly in full-dimensional gradient space. We introduce an online SVD-based algorithm that operates on LoRA gradients to identify latent skills without the infeasible cost of storing all sample gradients. Each cluster is used to train a specialized LoRA expert along with a lightweight router trained to select the best expert during inference. We show that routing to a single, appropriate expert outperforms expert ensembles used in prior work, while significantly reducing inference latency. Our experiments across mathematical reasoning, code generation, finance, and creative writing tasks demonstrate that GradientSpace leads to coherent expert specialization and consistent accuracy gains over state-of-the-art clustering methods and finetuning techniques.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Interpretability of GPT-2: Lexical and Contextual Layers in Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a mechanistic interpretability study of GPT-2 that causally examines how sentiment information is processed across its transformer layers. Using systematic activation patching across all 12 layers, we test the hypothesized two-stage sentiment architecture comprising early lexical detection and mid-layer contextual integration. Our experiments confirm that early layers (0-3) act as lexical sentiment detectors, encoding stable, position specific polarity signals that are largely independent of context. However, all three contextual integration hypotheses: Middle Layer Concentration, Phenomenon Specificity, and Distributed Processing are falsified. Instead of mid-layer specialization, we find that contextual phenomena such as negation, sarcasm, domain shifts etc. are integrated primarily in late layers (8-11) through a unified, non-modular mechanism. These experimental findings provide causal evidence that GPT-2's sentiment computation differs from the predicted hierarchical pattern, highlighting the need for further empirical characterization of contextual integration in large language models.</description>

      <title>Predictive Modeling of I/O Performance for Machine Learning Training Pipelines: A Data-Driven Approach to Storage Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning training is increasingly bottlenecked by data I/O rather than compute. GPUs often sit idle at below 50% utilization waiting for data. This paper presents a machine learning approach to predict I/O performance and recommend optimal storage configurations for ML training pipelines. We collected 141 observations through systematic benchmarking across different storage backends (NVMe SSD, network-attached storage, in-memory filesystems), data formats, and access patterns, covering both low-level I/O operations and full training pipelines. After evaluating seven regression models and three classification approaches, XGBoost achieved the best performance with R-squared of 0.991, predicting I/O throughput within 11.8% error on average. Feature importance analysis revealed that throughput metrics and batch size are the primary performance drivers. This data-driven approach can reduce configuration time from days of trial-and-error to minutes of predictive recommendation. The methodology is reproducible and extensible to other resource management problems in ML systems. Code and data are available at https://github.com/knkarthik01/gpu_storage_ml_project</description>

      <title>A Novel Multimodal RUL Framework for Remaining Useful Life Estimation with Layer-wise Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of mechanical systems is pivotal in Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). Rolling-element bearings are among the most frequent causes of machinery failure, highlighting the need for robust RUL estimation methods. Existing approaches often suffer from poor generalization, lack of robustness, high data demands, and limited interpretability. This paper proposes a novel multimodal-RUL framework that jointly leverages image representations (ImR) and time-frequency representations (TFR) of multichannel, nonstationary vibration signals. The architecture comprises three branches: (1) an ImR branch and (2) a TFR branch, both employing multiple dilated convolutional blocks with residual connections to extract spatial degradation features; and (3) a fusion branch that concatenates these features and feeds them into an LSTM to model temporal degradation patterns. A multi-head attention mechanism subsequently emphasizes salient features, followed by linear layers for final RUL regression. To enable effective multimodal learning, vibration signals are converted into ImR via the Bresenham line algorithm and into TFR using Continuous Wavelet Transform. We also introduce multimodal Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (multimodal-LRP), a tailored explainability technique that significantly enhances model transparency. The approach is validated on the XJTU-SY and PRONOSTIA benchmark datasets. Results show that our method matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines under both seen and unseen operating conditions, while requiring ~28 % less training data on XJTU-SY and ~48 % less on PRONOSTIA. The model exhibits strong noise resilience, and multimodal-LRP visualizations confirm the interpretability and trustworthiness of predictions, making the framework highly suitable for real-world industrial deployment.</description>

      <title>A Novel Deep Neural Network Architecture for Real-Time Water Demand Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short-term water demand forecasting (StWDF) is the foundation stone in the derivation of an optimal plan for controlling water supply systems. Deep learning (DL) approaches provide the most accurate solutions for this purpose. However, they suffer from complexity problem due to the massive number of parameters, in addition to the high forecasting error at the extreme points. In this work, an effective method to alleviate the error at these points is proposed. It is based on extending the data by inserting virtual data within the actual data to relieve the nonlinearity around them. To our knowledge, this is the first work that considers the problem related to the extreme points. Moreover, the water demand forecasting model proposed in this work is a novel DL model with relatively low complexity. The basic model uses the gated recurrent unit (GRU) to handle the sequential relationship in the historical demand data, while an unsupervised classification method, K-means, is introduced for the creation of new features to enhance the prediction accuracy with less number of parameters. Real data obtained from two different water plants in China are used to train and verify the model proposed. The prediction results and the comparison with the state-of-the-art illustrate that the method proposed reduces the complexity of the model six times of what achieved in the literature while conserving the same accuracy. Furthermore, it is found that extending the data set significantly reduces the error by about 30%. However, it increases the training time.</description>

      <title>The Role of Entropy in Visual Grounding: Analysis and Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using reinforcement learning have achieved remarkable progress, particularly with the introduction of various entropy control techniques. However, the role and characteristics of entropy in perception-oriented tasks like visual grounding, as well as effective strategies for controlling it, remain largely unexplored. To address this issue, we focus on the visual grounding task and analyze the role and characteristics of entropy in comparison to reasoning tasks. Building on these findings, we introduce ECVGPO (Entropy Control Visual Grounding Policy Optimization), an interpretable algorithm designed for effective entropy regulation. Through entropy control, the trade-off between exploration and exploitation is better balanced. Experiments show that ECVGPO achieves broad improvements across various benchmarks and models.</description>

      <title>"The Dentist is an involved parent, the bartender is not": Revealing Implicit Biases in QA with Implicit BBQ</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing benchmarks evaluating biases in large language models (LLMs) primarily rely on explicit cues, declaring protected attributes like religion, race, gender by name. However, real-world interactions often contain implicit biases, inferred subtly through names, cultural cues, or traits. This critical oversight creates a significant blind spot in fairness evaluation. We introduce ImplicitBBQ, a benchmark extending the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ) with implicitly cued protected attributes across 6 categories. Our evaluation of GPT-4o on ImplicitBBQ illustrates troubling performance disparity from explicit BBQ prompts, with accuracy declining up to 7% in the "sexual orientation" subcategory and consistent decline located across most other categories. This indicates that current LLMs contain implicit biases undetected by explicit benchmarks. ImplicitBBQ offers a crucial tool for nuanced fairness evaluation in NLP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) has accelerated the rapid development and availability of large language models (LLMs) for mainstream natural language processing (NLP) use cases. However, training and deploying such gigantic LLMs in resource-constrained, real-world healthcare situations remains challenging. This study addresses the limited support available to visually impaired users and speakers of low-resource languages such as Hindi who require medical assistance in rural environments. We propose PDFTEMRA (Performant Distilled Frequency Transformer Ensemble Model with Random Activations), a compact transformer-based architecture that integrates model distillation, frequency-domain modulation, ensemble learning, and randomized activation patterns to reduce computational cost while preserving language understanding performance. The model is trained and evaluated on medical question-answering and consultation datasets tailored to Hindi and accessibility scenarios, and its performance is compared against standard NLP state-of-the-art model baselines. Results demonstrate that PDFTEMRA achieves comparable performance with substantially lower computational requirements, indicating its suitability for accessible, inclusive, low-resource medical NLP applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of the ArcGD optimiser. The evaluation is conducted initially on a non-convex benchmark function and subsequently on a real-world ML dataset. The initial comparative study using the Adam optimiser is conducted on a stochastic variant of the highly non-convex and notoriously challenging Rosenbrock function, renowned for its narrow, curved valley, across dimensions ranging from 2D to 1000D and an extreme case of 50,000D. Two configurations were evaluated to eliminate learning-rate bias: (i) both using ArcGD's effective learning rate and (ii) both using Adam's default learning rate. ArcGD consistently outperformed Adam under the first setting and, although slower under the second, achieved super ior final solutions in most cases. In the second evaluation, ArcGD is evaluated against state-of-the-art optimizers (Adam, AdamW, Lion, SGD) on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset across 8 diverse MLP architectures ranging from 1 to 5 hidden layers. ArcGD achieved the highest average test accuracy (50.7%) at 20,000 iterations, outperforming AdamW (46.6%), Adam (46.8%), SGD (49.6%), and Lion (43.4%), winning or tying on 6 of 8 architectures. Notably, while Adam and AdamW showed strong early convergence at 5,000 iterations, but regressed with extended training, whereas ArcGD continued improving, demonstrating generalization and resistance to overfitting without requiring early stopping tuning. Strong performance on geometric stress tests and standard deep-learning benchmarks indicates broad applicability, highlighting the need for further exploration. Moreover, it is also shown that a variant of ArcGD can be interpreted as a special case of the Lion optimiser, highlighting connections between the inherent mechanisms of such optimisation methods.</description>

      <title>Task-Model Alignment: A Simple Path to Generalizable AI-Generated Image Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted for AI-generated images (AIGI) detection, yet converting VLMs into detectors requires substantial resource, while the resulting models still exhibit severe hallucinations. To probe the core issue, we conduct an empirical analysis and observe two characteristic behaviors: (i) fine-tuning VLMs on high-level semantic supervision strengthens semantic discrimination and well generalize to unseen data; (ii) fine-tuning VLMs on low-level pixel-artifact supervision yields poor transfer. We attribute VLMs' underperformance to task-model misalignment: semantics-oriented VLMs inherently lack sensitivity to fine-grained pixel artifacts, and semantically non-discriminative pixel artifacts thus exceeds their inductive biases. In contrast, we observe that conventional pixel-artifact detectors capture low-level pixel artifacts yet exhibit limited semantic awareness relative to VLMs, highlighting that distinct models are better matched to distinct tasks. In this paper, we formalize AIGI detection as two complementary tasks--semantic consistency checking and pixel-artifact detection--and show that neglecting either induces systematic blind spots. Guided by this view, we introduce the Task-Model Alignment principle and instantiate it as a two-branch detector, AlignGemini, comprising a VLM fine-tuned exclusively with pure semantic supervision and a pixel-artifact expert trained exclusively with pure pixel-artifact supervision. By enforcing orthogonal supervision on two simplified datasets, each branch trains to its strengths, producing complementary discrimination over semantic and pixel cues. On five in-the-wild benchmarks, AlignGemini delivers a +9.5 gain in average accuracy, supporting task-model alignment as an effective path to generalizable AIGI detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as powerful enablers for autonomous reasoning and natural-language coordination in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms operating within Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However, existing LLM-driven UAV systems process sensitive operational data in plaintext, exposing them to privacy and security risks. This work introduces PrivLLMSwarm, a privacy-preserving framework that performs secure LLM inference for UAV swarm coordination through Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC). The framework incorporates MPC-optimized transformer components with efficient approximations of nonlinear activations, enabling practical encrypted inference on resource-constrained aerial platforms. A fine-tuned GPT-based command generator, enhanced through reinforcement learning in simulation, provides reliable instructions while maintaining confidentiality. Experimental evaluation in urban-scale simulations demonstrates that PrivLLMSwarm achieves high semantic accuracy, low encrypted inference latency, and robust formation control under privacy constraints. Comparative analysis shows PrivLLMSwarm offers a superior privacy-utility balance compared to differential privacy, federated learning, and plaintext baselines. To support reproducibility, the full implementation including source code, MPC components, and a synthetic dataset is publicly available. PrivLLMSwarm establishes a practical foundation for secure, LLM-enabled UAV swarms in privacy-sensitive IoT applications including smart-city monitoring and emergency response.</description>

      <title>Becoming Experienced Judges: Selective Test-Time Learning for Evaluators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic evaluation with large language models, commonly known as LLM-as-a-judge, is now standard across reasoning and alignment tasks. Despite evaluating many samples in deployment, these evaluators typically (i) treat each case independently, missing the opportunity to accumulate experience, and (ii) rely on a single fixed prompt for all cases, neglecting the need for sample-specific evaluation criteria. We introduce Learning While Evaluating (LWE), a framework that allows evaluators to improve sequentially at inference time without requiring training or validation sets. LWE maintains an evolving meta-prompt that (i) produces sample-specific evaluation instructions and (ii) refines itself through self-generated feedback. Furthermore, we propose Selective LWE, which updates the meta-prompt only on self-inconsistent cases, focusing computation where it matters most. This selective approach retains the benefits of sequential learning while being far more cost-effective. Across two pairwise comparison benchmarks, Selective LWE outperforms strong baselines, empirically demonstrating that evaluators can improve during sequential testing with a simple selective update, learning most from the cases they struggle with.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding multi-image, multi-turn scenarios is a critical yet underexplored capability for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Existing benchmarks predominantly focus on static or horizontal comparisons -- e.g., spotting visual differences or assessing appropriateness -- while relying heavily on language cues. Such settings overlook progressive, context-dependent reasoning and the challenge of visual-to-visual inference. To bridge this gap, we present VisChainBench, a large-scale benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LVLMs' ability to perform multi-step visual reasoning across sequential, interdependent tasks with minimal language guidance. VisChainBench contains 1,457 tasks spanning over 20,000 images across three diverse domains (e.g., daily scenarios, engineering troubleshooting), structured to mimic real-world decision-making processes. Uniquely, the benchmark is constructed using a multi-agent generation pipeline, ensuring high visual diversity and controlled language bias. All the benchmark data and code for benchmark construction are available for viewing and download via following Link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/eyehole/VisChainBench</description>

      <title>Stitch and Tell: A Structured Multimodal Data Augmentation Method for Spatial Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing vision-language models often suffer from spatial hallucinations, i.e., generating incorrect descriptions about the relative positions of objects in an image. We argue that this problem mainly stems from the asymmetric properties between images and text. To enrich the spatial understanding ability of vision-language models, we propose a simple, annotation-free, plug-and-play method named $\text{Stitch and Tell}$ (abbreviated as SiTe), which injects structured spatial supervision into data. It constructs stitched image-text pairs by stitching images along a spatial axis and generating spatially-aware captions or question answer pairs based on the layout of stitched image, without relying on costly advanced models or human involvement. We evaluate SiTe across three architectures including LLaVA-v1.5-7B, LLaVA-Qwen2-1.5B and HALVA-7B, two training datasets, and eight benchmarks. Experiments show that SiTe improves spatial understanding tasks such as $\text{MME}_{\text{Position}}$ (+5.50%) and Spatial-MM (+4.19%), while maintaining or improving performance on general vision-language benchmarks including COCO-QA (+1.02%) and MMBench (+4.76%). Our findings suggest that explicitly injecting spatially-aware structure into training data offers an effective way to mitigate spatial hallucinations and improve spatial understanding, while preserving general vision-language capabilities.</description>

      <title>RDSplat: Robust Watermarking Against Diffusion Editing for 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled the creation of digital assets and downstream applications, underscoring the need for robust copyright protection via digital watermarking. However, existing 3DGS watermarking methods remain highly vulnerable to diffusion-based editing, which can easily erase embedded provenance. This challenge highlights the urgent need for 3DGS watermarking techniques that are intrinsically resilient to diffusion-based editing. In this paper, we introduce RDSplat, a Robust watermarking paradigm against Diffusion editing for 3D Gaussian Splatting. RDSplat embeds watermarks into 3DGS components that diffusion-based editing inherently preserve, achieved through (i) proactively targeting low-frequency Gaussians and (ii) adversarial training with a diffusion proxy. Specifically, we introduce a multi-domain framework that operates natively in 3DGS space and embeds watermarks into diffusion-editing-preserved low-frequency Gaussians via coordinated covariance regularization and 2D filtering. In addition, we exploit the low-pass filtering behavior of diffusion-based editing by using Gaussian blur as an efficient training surrogate, enabling adversarial fine-tuning that further enhances watermark robustness against diffusion-based editing. Empirically, comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that RDSplat not only maintains superior robustness under diffusion-based editing, but also preserves watermark invisibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>From Next-Token to Next-Block: A Principled Adaptation Path for Diffusion LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generation but dominant autoregressive (AR) decoding is inherently sequential, creating a throughput bottleneck. Diffusion Language Models (DLMs)--especially block-wise variants--enable parallel generation and intra-block bidirectional reasoning, yet training large DLMs from scratch is costly and wastes the knowledge in mature AR checkpoints. Prior "adaptation" attempts either modify logits or randomly grow attention masks to full-sequence diffusion, or simply transplant AR weights into a block-diffusion recipe, leaving a fundamental mismatch between AR causality and block-wise bidirectionality unaddressed. We reframe adaptation as a intra-paradigm path from AR to Block-Diffusion by viewing AR as Block-Diffusion with blocksize=1. Concretely, we design the pathway of adaptation as follows: we use a context-causal attention mask (causal in context, bidirectional only within the active block), an efficient parallel adaptation procedure, an auxiliary AR loss to maximize data utilization and retain pretrained knowledge, and gradual increment of the generation block size. The recipe integrates cleanly with masked block-diffusion and maintains train-inference consistency. Built on these components, NBDiff-7B (Base and Instruct) could inherit the long-context modeling and reasoning capabilities, and achieve state-of-the-art performance among the 7B-class DLMs, delivering strong gains on general-knowledge, math, and code benchmarks over strong baselines. These results demonstrate that principled AR-to-block-diffusion adaptation is an effective and compute-efficient alternative to training DLMs from scratch.

      <title>From Description to Score: Can LLMs Quantify Vulnerabilities?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manual vulnerability scoring, such as assigning Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores, is a resource-intensive process that is often influenced by subjective interpretation. This study investigates the potential of general-purpose large language models (LLMs), namely ChatGPT, Llama, Grok, DeepSeek, and Gemini, to automate this process by analyzing over 31{,}000 recent Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) entries. The results show that LLMs substantially outperform the baseline on certain metrics (e.g., \textit{Availability Impact}), while offering more modest gains on others (e.g., \textit{Attack Complexity}). Moreover, model performance varies across both LLM families and individual CVSS metrics, with ChatGPT-5 attaining the highest precision. Our analysis reveals that LLMs tend to misclassify many of the same CVEs, and ensemble-based meta-classifiers only marginally improve performance. Further examination shows that CVE descriptions often lack critical context or contain ambiguous phrasing, which contributes to systematic misclassifications. These findings underscore the importance of enhancing vulnerability descriptions and incorporating richer contextual details to support more reliable automated reasoning and alleviate the growing backlog of CVEs awaiting triage.</description>

      <title>Angular Regularization for Positive-Unlabeled Learning on the Hypersphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning addresses classification problems where only a subset of positive examples is labeled and the remaining data is unlabeled, making explicit negative supervision unavailable. Existing PU methods often rely on negative-risk estimation or pseudo-labeling, which either require strong distributional assumptions or can collapse in high-dimensional settings. We propose AngularPU, a novel PU framework that operates on the unit hypersphere using cosine similarity and angular margin. In our formulation, the positive class is represented by a learnable prototype vector, and classification reduces to thresholding the cosine similarity between an embedding and this prototype-eliminating the need for explicit negative modeling. To counteract the tendency of unlabeled embeddings to cluster near the positive prototype, we introduce an angular regularizer that encourages dispersion of the unlabeled set over the hypersphere, improving separation. We provide theoretical guarantees on the Bayes-optimality of the angular decision rule, consistency of the learned prototype, and the effect of the regularizer on the unlabeled distribution. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that AngularPU achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art PU methods, particularly in settings with scarce positives and high-dimensional embeddings, while offering geometric interpretability and scalability.</description>

      <title>Optimal and Diffusion Transports in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several problems in machine learning are naturally expressed as the design and analysis of time-evolving probability distributions. This includes sampling via diffusion methods, optimizing the weights of neural networks, and analyzing the evolution of token distributions across layers of large language models. While the targeted applications differ (samples, weights, tokens), their mathematical descriptions share a common structure. A key idea is to switch from the Eulerian representation of densities to their Lagrangian counterpart through vector fields that advect particles. This dual view introduces challenges, notably the non-uniqueness of Lagrangian vector fields, but also opportunities to craft density evolutions and flows with favorable properties in terms of regularity, stability, and computational tractability. This survey presents an overview of these methods, with emphasis on two complementary approaches: diffusion methods, which rely on stochastic interpolation processes and underpin modern generative AI, and optimal transport, which defines interpolation by minimizing displacement cost. We illustrate how both approaches appear in applications ranging from sampling, neural network optimization, to modeling the dynamics of transformers for large language models.</description>

      <title>RMAdapter: Reconstruction-based Multi-Modal Adapter for Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), \textit{e.g.} CLIP, have become essential tools in multimodal transfer learning. However, fine-tuning VLMs in few-shot scenarios poses significant challenges in balancing task-specific adaptation and generalization in the obtained model. Meanwhile, current researches have predominantly focused on prompt-based adaptation methods, leaving adapter-based approaches underexplored and revealing notable performance gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Reconstruction-based Multimodal Adapter (RMAdapter), which leverages a dual-branch architecture. Unlike conventional single-branch adapters, RMAdapter consists of: (1) an adaptation branch that injects task-specific knowledge through parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and (2) a reconstruction branch that preserves general knowledge by reconstructing latent space features back into the original feature space. This design facilitates a dynamic balance between general and task-specific knowledge. Importantly, although RMAdapter introduces an additional reconstruction branch, it is carefully optimized to remain lightweight. By computing reconstruction loss locally at each layer and sharing projection modules, the overall computational overhead is kept minimal. A consistency constraint is also incorporated to better regulate the trade-off between discriminability and generalization. We comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of RMAdapter on three representative tasks: generalization to new categories, generalization to new target datasets, and domain generalization. Without relying on data augmentation or duplicate prompt designs, our RMAdapter consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Partial Inverse Design of High-Performance Concrete Using Cooperative Neural Networks for Constraint-Aware Mix Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-performance concrete offers exceptional strength and durability but requires complex mix designs involving many interdependent variables and practical constraints. While data-driven methods have advanced predictive modeling for forward design, inverse design, which focuses on determining mix compositions that achieve target performance, remains limited, particularly in design situations where some mix variables are fixed by constraints and only the remaining variables must be determined. This study proposes a cooperative neural network framework for the partial inverse design of high-performance concrete. The framework combines two coupled neural network models, an imputation model that infers the undetermined variables and a surrogate model that predicts compressive strength. Through cooperative learning, the model generates valid and performance-consistent mix designs in a single forward pass while accommodating different constraint combinations without retraining. Its performance is compared with both probabilistic and generative approaches, including Bayesian inference based on a Gaussian process surrogate and autoencoder-based models. Evaluated on a benchmark dataset, the proposed model achieves stable and higher R-squared values of 0.87-0.92 and reduces mean squared error by an average of 50 percent compared with autoencoder baselines and by an average of 70 percent compared with Bayesian inference. The results demonstrate that the cooperative neural network provides an accurate, robust, and computationally efficient foundation for constraint-aware, data-driven mix proportioning in concrete engineering.</description>

      <title>CAuSE: Decoding Multimodal Classifiers using Faithful Natural Language Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal classifiers function as opaque black box models. While several techniques exist to interpret their predictions, very few of them are as intuitive and accessible as natural language explanations (NLEs). To build trust, such explanations must faithfully capture the classifier's internal decision making behavior, a property known as faithfulness. In this paper, we propose CAuSE (Causal Abstraction under Simulated Explanations), a novel framework to generate faithful NLEs for any pretrained multimodal classifier. We demonstrate that CAuSE generalizes across datasets and models through extensive empirical evaluations. Theoretically, we show that CAuSE, trained via interchange intervention, forms a causal abstraction of the underlying classifier. We further validate this through a redesigned metric for measuring causal faithfulness in multimodal settings. CAuSE surpasses other methods on this metric, with qualitative analysis reinforcing its advantages. We perform detailed error analysis to pinpoint the failure cases of CAuSE. For replicability, we make the codes available at https://github.com/newcodevelop/CAuSE</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLMs to support co-evolution between definitions and instances of textual DSLs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software languages evolve over time for various reasons, such as the addition of new features. When the language's grammar definition evolves, textual instances that originally conformed to the grammar become outdated. For DSLs in a model-driven engineering context, there exists a plethora of techniques to co-evolve models with the evolving metamodel. However, these techniques are not geared to support DSLs with a textual syntax -- applying them to textual language definitions and instances may lead to the loss of information from the original instances, such as comments and layout information, which are valuable for software comprehension and maintenance. This study explores the potential of Large Language Model (LLM)-based solutions in achieving grammar and instance co-evolution, with attention to their ability to preserve auxiliary information when directly processing textual instances. By applying two advanced language models, Claude-3.5 and GPT-4o, and conducting experiments across seven case languages, we evaluated the feasibility and limitations of this approach. Our results indicate a good ability of the considered LLMs for migrating textual instances in small-scale cases with limited instance size, which are representative of a subset of cases encountered in practice. In addition, we observe significant challenges with the scalability of LLM-based solutions to larger instances, leading to insights that are useful for informing future research.</description>

      <title>Formal that "Floats" High: Formal Verification of Floating Point Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formal verification of floating-point arithmetic remains challenging due to non-linear arithmetic behavior and the tight coupling between control and datapath logic. Existing approaches often rely on high-level C models for equivalence checking against Register Transfer Level (RTL) designs, but this introduces abstraction gaps, translation overhead, and limits scalability at the RTL level. To address these challenges, this paper presents a scalable methodology for verifying floating-point arithmetic using direct RTL-to-RTL model checking against a golden reference model. The approach adopts a divide-and conquer strategy that decomposes verification into modular stages, each captured by helper assertions and lemmas that collectively prove a main correctness theorem. Counterexample (CEX)-guided refinement is used to iteratively localize and resolve implementation defects, while targeted fault injection validates the robustness of the verification process against precision-critical datapath errors. To assess scalability and practicality, the methodology is extended with agentic AI-based formal property generation, integrating large language model (LLM)-driven automation with Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) refinement. Coverage analysis evaluates the effectiveness of the approach by comparing handwritten and AI-generated properties in both RTL-to-RTL model checking and standalone RTL verification settings. Results show that direct RTL-to-RTL model checking achieves higher coverage efficiency and requires fewer assertions than standalone verification, especially when combined with AI-generated properties refined through HITL guidance.</description>

      <title>ArchPower: Dataset for Architecture-Level Power Modeling of Modern CPU Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power is the primary design objective of large-scale integrated circuits (ICs), especially for complex modern processors (i.e., CPUs). Accurate CPU power evaluation requires designers to go through the whole time-consuming IC implementation process, easily taking months. At the early design stage (e.g., architecture-level), classical power models are notoriously inaccurate. Recently, ML-based architecture-level power models have been proposed to boost accuracy, but the data availability is a severe challenge. Currently, there is no open-source dataset for this important ML application. A typical dataset generation process involves correct CPU design implementation and repetitive execution of power simulation flows, requiring significant design expertise, engineering effort, and execution time. Even private in-house datasets often fail to reflect realistic CPU design scenarios. In this work, we propose ArchPower, the first open-source dataset for architecture-level processor power modeling. We go through complex and realistic design flows to collect the CPU architectural information as features and the ground-truth simulated power as labels. Our dataset includes 200 CPU data samples, collected from 25 different CPU configurations when executing 8 different workloads. There are more than 100 architectural features in each data sample, including both hardware and event parameters. The label of each sample provides fine-grained power information, including the total design power and the power for each of the 11 components. Each power value is further decomposed into four fine-grained power groups: combinational logic power, sequential logic power, memory power, and clock power. ArchPower is available at https://github.com/hkust-zhiyao/ArchPower.</description>

      <title>Less Is More, but Where? Dynamic Token Compression via LLM-Guided Keyframe Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) have achieved remarkable video understanding capabilities, yet face critical efficiency bottlenecks due to quadratic computational growth with lengthy visual token sequences of long videos. While existing keyframe sampling methods can improve temporal modeling efficiency, additional computational cost is introduced before feature encoding, and the binary frame selection paradigm is found suboptimal. Therefore, in this work, we propose Dynamic Token compression via LLM-guided Keyframe prior (DyToK), a training-free paradigm that enables dynamic token compression by harnessing VLLMs' inherent attention mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that VLLM attention layers naturally encoding query-conditioned keyframe priors, by which DyToK dynamically adjusts per-frame token retention ratios, prioritizing semantically rich frames while suppressing redundancies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DyToK achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs. DyToK shows plug-and-play compatibility with existing compression methods, such as VisionZip and FastV, attaining 4.3x faster inference while preserving accuracy across multiple VLLMs, such as LLaVA-OneVision and Qwen2.5-VL.

      <title>JoPano: Unified Panorama Generation via Joint Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Panorama generation has recently attracted growing interest in the research community, with two core tasks, text-to-panorama and view-to-panorama generation. However, existing methods still face two major challenges: their U-Net-based architectures constrain the visual quality of the generated panoramas, and they usually treat the two core tasks independently, which leads to modeling redundancy and inefficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a joint-face panorama (JoPano) generation approach that unifies the two core tasks within a DiT-based model. To transfer the rich generative capabilities of existing DiT backbones learned from natural images to the panorama domain, we propose a Joint-Face Adapter built on the cubemap representation of panoramas, which enables a pretrained DiT to jointly model and generate different views of a panorama. We further apply Poisson Blending to reduce seam inconsistencies that often appear at the boundaries between cube faces. Correspondingly, we introduce Seam-SSIM and Seam-Sobel metrics to quantitatively evaluate the seam consistency. Moreover, we propose a condition switching mechanism that unifies text-to-panorama and view-to-panorama tasks within a single model. Comprehensive experiments show that JoPano can generate high-quality panoramas for both text-to-panorama and view-to-panorama generation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on FID, CLIP-FID, IS, and CLIP-Score metrics.</description>

Abstract: As software systems evolve, developers increasingly work across multiple programming languages and often face the need to migrate code from one language to another. While automatic code translation offers a promising solution, it has long remained a challenging task. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential for this task, yet existing approaches remain limited in accuracy and fail to effectively leverage contextual and structural cues within the code. Prior work has explored translation and repair mechanisms, but lacks a structured, agentic framework where multiple specialized agents collaboratively improve translation quality. In this work, we introduce BabelCoder, an agentic framework that performs code translation by decomposing the task into specialized agents for translation, testing, and refinement, each responsible for a specific aspect such as generating code, validating correctness, or repairing errors. We evaluate BabelCoder on four benchmark datasets and compare it against four state-of-the-art baselines. BabelCoder outperforms existing methods by 0.5%-13.5% in 94% of cases, achieving an average accuracy of 94.16%.</description>

      <title>SoK: Trust-Authorization Mismatch in LLM Agent Interactions</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving into autonomous agents capable of interacting with the external world, significantly expanding their capabilities through standardized interaction protocols. However, this paradigm revives the classic cybersecurity challenges of agency and authorization in a novel and volatile context. As decision-making shifts from deterministic code logic to probabilistic inference driven by natural language, traditional security mechanisms designed for deterministic behavior fail. It is fundamentally challenging to establish trust for unpredictable AI agents and to enforce the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) when instructions are ambiguous. Despite the escalating threat landscape, the academic community's understanding of this emerging domain remains fragmented, lacking a systematic framework to analyze its root causes. This paper provides a unifying formal lens for agent-interaction security.
  We observed that most security threats in this domain stem from a fundamental mismatch between trust evaluation and authorization policies. We introduce a novel risk analysis model centered on this trust-authorization gap. Using this model as a unifying lens, we survey and classify the implementation paths of existing, often seemingly isolated, attacks and defenses. This new framework not only unifies the field but also allows us to identify critical research gaps. Finally, we leverage our analysis to suggest a systematic research direction toward building robust, trusted agents and dynamic authorization mechanisms.</description>

      <title>NeuroABench: A Multimodal Evaluation Benchmark for Neurosurgical Anatomy Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant potential in surgical video understanding. With improved zero-shot performance and more effective human-machine interaction, they provide a strong foundation for advancing surgical education and assistance. However, existing research and datasets primarily focus on understanding surgical procedures and workflows, while paying limited attention to the critical role of anatomical comprehension. In clinical practice, surgeons rely heavily on precise anatomical understanding to interpret, review, and learn from surgical videos. To fill this gap, we introduce the Neurosurgical Anatomy Benchmark (NeuroABench), the first multimodal benchmark explicitly created to evaluate anatomical understanding in the neurosurgical domain. NeuroABench consists of 9 hours of annotated neurosurgical videos covering 89 distinct procedures and is developed using a novel multimodal annotation pipeline with multiple review cycles. The benchmark evaluates the identification of 68 clinical anatomical structures, providing a rigorous and standardized framework for assessing model performance. Experiments on over 10 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant limitations, with the best-performing model achieving only 40.87% accuracy in anatomical identification tasks. To further evaluate the benchmark, we extract a subset of the dataset and conduct an informative test with four neurosurgical trainees. The results show that the best-performing student achieves 56% accuracy, with the lowest scores of 28% and an average score of 46.5%. While the best MLLM performs comparably to the lowest-scoring student, it still lags significantly behind the group's average performance. This comparison underscores both the progress of MLLMs in anatomical understanding and the substantial gap that remains in achieving human-level performance.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Phishing Detection with Transformer-Based Semantic Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phishing is a cybercrime in which individuals are deceived into revealing personal information, often resulting in financial loss. These attacks commonly occur through fraudulent messages, misleading advertisements, and compromised legitimate websites. This study proposes a Quantile Regression Deep Q-Network (QR-DQN) approach that integrates RoBERTa semantic embeddings with handcrafted lexical features to enhance phishing detection while accounting for uncertainties. Unlike traditional DQN methods that estimate single scalar Q-values, QR-DQN leverages quantile regression to model the distribution of returns, improving stability and generalization on unseen phishing data. A diverse dataset of 105,000 URLs was curated from PhishTank, OpenPhish, Cloudflare, and other sources, and the model was evaluated using an 80/20 train-test split. The QR-DQN framework achieved a test accuracy of 99.86%, precision of 99.75%, recall of 99.96%, and F1-score of 99.85%, demonstrating high effectiveness. Compared to standard DQN with lexical features, the hybrid QR-DQN with lexical and semantic features reduced the generalization gap from 1.66% to 0.04%, indicating significant improvement in robustness. Five-fold cross-validation confirmed model reliability, yielding a mean accuracy of 99.90% with a standard deviation of 0.04%. These results suggest that the proposed hybrid approach effectively identifies phishing threats, adapts to evolving attack strategies, and generalizes well to unseen data.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Sensitivity of BiLSTM Forecasting Models to Sequence Length and Input Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) models, a specialized class of multilayer neural networks, have become central to time-series forecasting in critical domains such as environmental monitoring and the Internet of Things (IoT). Among these, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) architectures are particularly effective in capturing complex temporal dependencies. However, the robustness and generalization of such models are highly sensitive to input data characteristics - an aspect that remains underexplored in existing literature. This study presents a systematic empirical analysis of two key data-centric factors: input sequence length and additive noise. To support this investigation, a modular and reproducible forecasting pipeline is developed, incorporating standardized preprocessing, sequence generation, model training, validation, and evaluation. Controlled experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets with varying sampling frequencies to assess BiLSTM performance under different input conditions. The results yield three key findings: (1) longer input sequences significantly increase the risk of overfitting and data leakage, particularly in data-constrained environments; (2) additive noise consistently degrades predictive accuracy across sampling frequencies; and (3) the simultaneous presence of both factors results in the most substantial decline in model stability. While datasets with higher observation frequencies exhibit greater robustness, they remain vulnerable when both input challenges are present. These findings highlight important limitations in current DL-based forecasting pipelines and underscore the need for data-aware design strategies. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of DL model behavior in dynamic time-series environments and provides practical insights for developing more reliable and generalizable forecasting systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Normalization Mamba with Multi Scale Trend Decomposition and Patch MoE Encoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting in real world environments faces significant challenges non stationarity, multi scale temporal patterns, and distributional shifts that degrade model stability and accuracy. This study propose AdaMamba, a unified forecasting architecture that integrates adaptive normalization, multi scale trend extraction, and contextual sequence modeling to address these challenges. AdaMamba begins with an Adaptive Normalization Block that removes non stationary components through multi scale convolutional trend extraction and channel wise recalibration, enabling consistent detrending and variance stabilization. The normalized sequence is then processed by a Context Encoder that combines patch wise embeddings, positional encoding, and a Mamba enhanced Transformer layer with a mixture of experts feed forward module, allowing efficient modeling of both long range dependencies and local temporal dynamics. A lightweight prediction head generates multi horizon forecasts, and a denormalization mechanism reconstructs outputs by reintegrating local trends to ensure robustness under varying temporal conditions. AdaMamba provides strong representational capacity with modular extensibility, supporting deterministic prediction and compatibility with probabilistic extensions. Its design effectively mitigates covariate shift and enhances predictive reliability across heterogeneous datasets. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that AdaMamba's combination of adaptive normalization and expert augmented contextual modeling yields consistent improvements in stability and accuracy over conventional Transformer based baselines.</description>

      <title>Hidden Leaks in Time Series Forecasting: How Data Leakage Affects LSTM Evaluation Across Configurations and Validation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are widely used in time series forecasting due to their ability to capture complex temporal dependencies. However, evaluation integrity is often compromised by data leakage, a methodological flaw in which input-output sequences are constructed before dataset partitioning, allowing future information to unintentionally influence training. This study investigates the impact of data leakage on performance, focusing on how validation design mediates leakage sensitivity. Three widely used validation techniques (2-way split, 3-way split, and 10-fold cross-validation) are evaluated under both leaky (pre-split sequence generation) and clean conditions, with the latter mitigating leakage risk by enforcing temporal separation during data splitting prior to sequence construction. The effect of leakage is assessed using RMSE Gain, which measures the relative increase in RMSE caused by leakage, computed as the percentage difference between leaky and clean setups. Empirical results show that 10-fold cross-validation exhibits RMSE Gain values of up to 20.5% at extended lag steps. In contrast, 2-way and 3-way splits demonstrate greater robustness, typically maintaining RMSE Gain below 5% across diverse configurations. Moreover, input window size and lag step significantly influence leakage sensitivity: smaller windows and longer lags increase the risk of leakage, whereas larger windows help reduce it. These findings underscore the need for configuration-aware, leakage-resistant evaluation pipelines to ensure reliable performance estimation.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Human-Centered AI Fairness Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in critical societal domains has amplified concerns about fairness, particularly regarding unequal treatment across sensitive attributes such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status. While there has been substantial work on ensuring AI fairness, navigating trade-offs between competing notions of fairness as well as predictive accuracy remains challenging, creating barriers to the practical deployment of fair AI systems. To address this, we introduce a unifying human-centered fairness framework that systematically covers eight distinct fairness metrics, formed by combining individual and group fairness, infra-marginal and intersectional assumptions, and outcome-based and equality-of-opportunity (EOO) perspectives. This structure allows stakeholders to align fairness interventions with their values and contextual considerations. The framework uses a consistent and easy-to-understand formulation for all metrics to reduce the learning curve for non-experts. Rather than privileging a single fairness notion, the framework enables stakeholders to assign weights across multiple fairness objectives, reflecting their priorities and facilitating multi-stakeholder compromises. We apply this approach to four real-world datasets: the UCI Adult census dataset for income prediction, the COMPAS dataset for criminal recidivism, the German Credit dataset for credit risk assessment, and the MEPS dataset for healthcare utilization. We show that adjusting weights reveals nuanced trade-offs between different fairness metrics. Finally, through case studies in judicial decision-making and healthcare, we demonstrate how the framework can inform practical and value-sensitive deployment of fair AI systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a vision-action policy that won 1st place in the 2025 BEHAVIOR Challenge - a large-scale benchmark featuring 50 diverse long-horizon household tasks in photo-realistic simulation, requiring bimanual manipulation, navigation, and context-aware decision making.
  Building on the Pi0.5 architecture, we introduce several innovations. Our primary contribution is correlated noise for flow matching, which improves training efficiency and enables correlation-aware inpainting for smooth action sequences. We also apply learnable mixed-layer attention and System 2 stage tracking for ambiguity resolution. Training employs multi-sample flow matching to reduce variance, while inference uses action compression and challenge-specific correction rules.
  Our approach achieves 26% q-score across all 50 tasks on both public and private leaderboards.</description>

      <title>VideoVLA: Video Generators Can Be Generalizable Robot Manipulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalization in robot manipulation is essential for deploying robots in open-world environments and advancing toward artificial general intelligence. While recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage large pre-trained understanding models for perception and instruction following, their ability to generalize to novel tasks, objects, and settings remains limited. In this work, we present VideoVLA, a simple approach that explores the potential of transforming large video generation models into robotic VLA manipulators. Given a language instruction and an image, VideoVLA predicts an action sequence as well as the future visual outcomes. Built on a multi-modal Diffusion Transformer, VideoVLA jointly models video, language, and action modalities, using pre-trained video generative models for joint visual and action forecasting. Our experiments show that high-quality imagined futures correlate with reliable action predictions and task success, highlighting the importance of visual imagination in manipulation. VideoVLA demonstrates strong generalization, including imitating other embodiments' skills and handling novel objects. This dual-prediction strategy - forecasting both actions and their visual consequences - explores a paradigm shift in robot learning and unlocks generalization capabilities in manipulation systems.</description>

      <title>Comparing BFGS and OGR for Second-Order Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the Hessian matrix, especially for neural network training, is a challenging problem due to high dimensionality and cost. In this work, we compare the classical Sherman-Morrison update used in the popular BFGS method (Broy-den-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno), which maintains a positive definite Hessian approximation under a convexity assumption, with a novel approach called Online Gradient Regression (OGR). OGR performs regression of gradients against positions using an exponential moving average to estimate second derivatives online, without requiring Hessian inversion. Unlike BFGS, OGR allows estimation of a general (not necessarily positive definite) Hessian and can thus handle non-convex structures. We evaluate both methods across standard test functions and demonstrate that OGR achieves faster convergence and improved loss, particularly in non-convex settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore Multi-Head FFN (MH-FFN) as a replacement of FFN in the Transformer architecture, motivated by the structural similarity between single-head attention and FFN. While multi-head mechanisms enhance expressivity in attention, naively applying them to FFNs faces two challenges: memory consumption scaling with the head count, and an imbalanced ratio between the growing intermediate size and the fixed head dimension as models scale, which degrades scalability and expressive power. To address these challenges, we propose Flash Multi-Head FFN (FlashMHF), with two key innovations: an I/O-aware fused kernel computing outputs online in SRAM akin to FlashAttention, and a design using dynamically weighted parallel sub-networks to maintain a balanced ratio between intermediate and head dimensions. Validated on models from 128M to 1.3B parameters, FlashMHF consistently improves perplexity and downstream task accuracy over SwiGLU FFNs, while reducing peak memory usage by 3-5x and accelerating inference by up to 1.08x. Our work establishes the multi-head design as a superior architectural principle for FFNs, presenting FlashMHF as a powerful, efficient, and scalable alternative to FFNs in Transformers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various natural language processing tasks. This research introduces a novel "Prompting-in-a-Series" algorithm, termed PICEPR (Psychology-Informed Contents Embeddings for Personality Recognition), featuring two pipelines: (a) Contents and (b) Embeddings. The approach demonstrates how a modularised decoder-only LLM can summarize or generate content, which can aid in classifying or enhancing personality recognition functions as a personality feature extractor and a generator for personality-rich content. We conducted various experiments to provide evidence to justify the rationale behind the PICEPR algorithm. Meanwhile, we also explored closed-source models such as \textit{gpt4o} from OpenAI and \textit{gemini} from Google, along with open-source models like \textit{mistral} from Mistral AI, to compare the quality of the generated content. The PICEPR algorithm has achieved a new state-of-the-art performance for personality recognition by 5-15\% improvement. The work repository and models' weight can be found at https://research.jingjietan.com/?q=PICEPR.</description>

      <title>Singing Timbre Popularity Assessment Based on Multimodal Large Foundation Model</title>

Abstract: Automated singing assessment is crucial for education and entertainment. However, existing systems face two fundamental limitations: reliance on reference tracks, which stifles creative expression, and the simplification of complex performances into non-diagnostic scores based solely on pitch and rhythm. We advocate for a shift from discriminative to descriptive evaluation, creating a complete ecosystem for reference-free, multi-dimensional assessment. First, we introduce Sing-MD, a large-scale dataset annotated by experts across four dimensions: breath control, timbre quality, emotional expression, and vocal technique. Our analysis reveals significant annotation inconsistencies among experts, challenging the validity of traditional accuracy-based metrics. Second, addressing the memory limitations of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in analyzing full-length songs, we propose VocalVerse. This efficient hybrid architecture leverages a lightweight acoustic encoder to model global performance features and long-term dependencies. Third, to address automated metric shortcomings, we establish the H-TPR (Human-in-the-loop Tiered Perceptual Ranking) benchmark, which evaluates a model's ability to generate perceptually valid rankings rather than predicting noisy ground-truth scores.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the deployment of seven different neural network architectures CNN, RNN, GNN, Autoencoder, Transformer, NCF, and Siamese Networks on three distinct datasets: Retail E-commerce, Amazon Products, and Netflix Prize. It evaluates their effectiveness through metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, and diversity in recommendations. The results demonstrate that GNNs are particularly adept at managing complex item relationships in e-commerce environments, whereas RNNs are effective in capturing the temporal dynamics that are essential for platforms such as Netflix.. Siamese Networks are emphasized for their contribution to the diversification of recommendations, particularly in retail settings. Despite their benefits, issues like computational demands, reliance on extensive data, and the challenge of balancing accurate and diverse recommendations are addressed. The study seeks to inform the advancement of recommendation systems by suggesting hybrid methods that merge the strengths of various models to better satisfy user preferences and accommodate the evolving demands of contemporary digital platforms.</description>

      <title>Multi-Accent Mandarin Dry-Vocal Singing Dataset: Benchmark for Singing Accent Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singing accent research is underexplored compared to speech accent studies, primarily due to the scarcity of suitable datasets. Existing singing datasets often suffer from detail loss, frequently resulting from the vocal-instrumental separation process. Additionally, they often lack regional accent annotations. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Accent Mandarin Dry-Vocal Singing Dataset (MADVSD). MADVSD comprises over 670 hours of dry vocal recordings from 4,206 native Mandarin speakers across nine distinct Chinese regions. In addition to each participant recording audio of three popular songs in their native accent, they also recorded phonetic exercises covering all Mandarin vowels and a full octave range. We validated MADVSD through benchmark experiments in singing accent recognition, demonstrating its utility for evaluating state-of-the-art speech models in singing contexts. Furthermore, we explored dialectal influences on singing accent and analyzed the role of vowels in accentual variations, leveraging MADVSD's unique phonetic exercises.</description>

Abstract: Cost-effective and scalable video analytics are essential for precision livestock monitoring, where high-resolution footage and near-real-time monitoring needs from commercial farms generates substantial computational workloads. This paper presents a comprehensive case study on optimizing a poultry welfare monitoring system through system-level improvements across detection, tracking, clustering, and behavioral analysis modules. We introduce a set of optimizations, including multi-level parallelization, Optimizing code with substituting CPU code with GPU-accelerated code, vectorized clustering, and memory-efficient post-processing. Evaluated on real-world farm video footage, these changes deliver up to a 2x speedup across pipelines without compromising model accuracy. Our findings highlight practical strategies for building high-throughput, low-latency video inference systems that reduce infrastructure demands in agricultural and smart sensing deployments as well as other large-scale video analytics applications.</description>

      <title>FVA-RAG: Falsification-Verification Alignment for Mitigating Sycophantic Hallucinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have significantly reduced hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by grounding responses in external context. However, standard RAG architectures suffer from a critical vulnerability: Retrieval Sycophancy. When presented with a query based on a false premise or a common misconception, vector-based retrievers tend to fetch documents that align with the user's bias rather than objective truth, leading the model to "hallucinate with citations."
  In this work, we introduce Falsification-Verification Alignment RAG (FVA-RAG), a framework that shifts the retrieval paradigm from Inductive Verification (seeking support) to Deductive Falsification (seeking disproof). Unlike existing "Self-Correction" methods that rely on internal consistency, FVA-RAG deploys a distinct Adversarial Retrieval Policy that actively generates "Kill Queries"-targeted search terms designed to surface contradictory evidence. We introduce a dual-verification mechanism that explicitly weighs the draft answer against this "Anti-Context." Preliminary experiments on a dataset of common misconceptions demonstrate that FVA-RAG significantly improves robustness against sycophantic hallucinations compared to standard RAG baselines, effectively acting as an inference-time "Red Team" for factual generation.</description>

      <title>Latency-Response Theory Model: Evaluating Large Language Models via Response Accuracy and Chain-of-Thought Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates valid evaluation methods to provide guidance for both downstream applications and actionable future improvements. The Item Response Theory (IRT) model with Computerized Adaptive Testing has recently emerged as a promising framework for evaluating LLMs via their response accuracy. Beyond simple response accuracy, LLMs' chain of thought (CoT) lengths serve as a vital indicator of their reasoning ability. To leverage the CoT length information to assist the evaluation of LLMs, we propose the Latency-Response Theory (LaRT) model, which jointly models both the response accuracy and CoT length by introducing a key correlation parameter between the latent ability and the latent speed. We derive an efficient stochastic approximation Expectation-Maximization algorithm for parameter estimation. We establish rigorous identifiability results for the latent ability and latent speed parameters to ensure the statistical validity of their estimation. Through both theoretical asymptotic analyses and simulation studies, we demonstrate LaRT's advantages over IRT in terms of superior estimation accuracy and shorter confidence intervals for latent trait estimation. To evaluate LaRT in real data, we collect responses from diverse LLMs on popular benchmark datasets. We find that LaRT yields different LLM rankings than IRT and outperforms IRT across multiple key evaluation metrics including predictive power, item efficiency, ranking validity, and LLM evaluation efficiency.

      <title>Transferring Clinical Knowledge into ECGs Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models have shown high accuracy in classifying electrocardiograms (ECGs), but their black box nature hinders clinical adoption due to a lack of trust and interpretability. To address this, we propose a novel three-stage training paradigm that transfers knowledge from multimodal clinical data (laboratory exams, vitals, biometrics) into a powerful, yet unimodal, ECG encoder. We employ a self-supervised, joint-embedding pre-training stage to create an ECG representation that is enriched with contextual clinical information, while only requiring the ECG signal at inference time. Furthermore, as an indirect way to explain the model's output we train it to also predict associated laboratory abnormalities directly from the ECG embedding. Evaluated on the MIMIC-IV-ECG dataset, our model outperforms a standard signal-only baseline in multi-label diagnosis classification and successfully bridges a substantial portion of the performance gap to a fully multimodal model that requires all data at inference. Our work demonstrates a practical and effective method for creating more accurate and trustworthy ECG classification models. By converting abstract predictions into physiologically grounded \emph{explanations}, our approach offers a promising path toward the safer integration of AI into clinical workflows.</description>

      <title>Reformulate, Retrieve, Localize: Agents for Repository-Level Bug Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bug localization remains a critical yet time-consuming challenge in large-scale software repositories. Traditional information retrieval-based bug localization (IRBL) methods rely on unchanged bug descriptions, which often contain noisy information, leading to poor retrieval accuracy. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved bug localization through query reformulation, yet the effect on agent performance remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate how an LLM-powered agent can improve file-level bug localization via lightweight query reformulation and summarization. We first employ an open-source, non-fine-tuned LLM to extract key information from bug reports, such as identifiers and code snippets, and reformulate queries pre-retrieval. Our agent then orchestrates BM25 retrieval using these preprocessed queries, automating localization workflow at scale. Using the best-performing query reformulation technique, our agent achieves 35% better ranking in first-file retrieval than our BM25 baseline and up to +22% file retrieval performance over SWE-agent.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of Supervised Machine Learning Models for Zero-Day Attack Detection: Analyzing Performance on Imbalanced Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the various types of cyberattacks, identifying zero-day attacks is problematic because they are unknown to security systems as their pattern and characteristics do not match known blacklisted attacks. There are many Machine Learning (ML) models designed to analyze and detect network attacks, especially using supervised models. However, these models are designed to classify samples (normal and attacks) based on the patterns they learn during the training phase, so they perform inefficiently on unseen attacks. This research addresses this issue by evaluating five different supervised models to assess their performance and execution time in predicting zero-day attacks and find out which model performs accurately and quickly. The goal is to improve the performance of these supervised models by not only proposing a framework that applies grid search, dimensionality reduction and oversampling methods to overcome the imbalance problem, but also comparing the effectiveness of oversampling on ml model metrics, in particular the accuracy. To emulate attack detection in real life, this research applies a highly imbalanced data set and only exposes the classifiers to zero-day attacks during the testing phase, so the models are not trained to flag the zero-day attacks. Our results show that Random Forest (RF) performs best under both oversampling and non-oversampling conditions, this increased effectiveness comes at the cost of longer processing times. Therefore, we selected XG Boost (XGB) as the top model due to its fast and highly accurate performance in detecting zero-day attacks.</description>

      <title>Power of Boundary and Reflection: Semantic Transparent Object Segmentation using Pyramid Vision Transformer with Transparent Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glass is a prevalent material among solid objects in everyday life, yet segmentation methods struggle to distinguish it from opaque materials due to its transparency and reflection. While it is known that human perception relies on boundary and reflective-object features to distinguish glass objects, the existing literature has not yet sufficiently captured both properties when handling transparent objects. Hence, we propose incorporating both of these powerful visual cues via the Boundary Feature Enhancement and Reflection Feature Enhancement modules in a mutually beneficial way. Our proposed framework, TransCues, is a pyramidal transformer encoder-decoder architecture to segment transparent objects. We empirically show that these two modules can be used together effectively, improving overall performance across various benchmark datasets, including glass object semantic segmentation, mirror object semantic segmentation, and generic segmentation datasets. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin, achieving +4.2% mIoU on Trans10K-v2, +5.6% mIoU on MSD, +10.1% mIoU on RGBD-Mirror, +13.1% mIoU on TROSD, and +8.3% mIoU on Stanford2D3D, showing the effectiveness of our method against glass objects.</description>

      <title>DAUNet: A Lightweight UNet Variant with Deformable Convolutions and Parameter-Free Attention for Medical Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in automated diagnostic and treatment planning systems. In this work, we present DAUNet, a novel lightweight UNet variant that integrates Deformable V2 Convolutions and Parameter-Free Attention (SimAM) to improve spatial adaptability and context-aware feature fusion without increasing model complexity. DAUNet's bottleneck employs dynamic deformable kernels to handle geometric variations, while the decoder and skip pathways are enhanced using SimAM attention modules for saliency-aware refinement. Extensive evaluations on two challenging datasets, FH-PS-AoP (fetal head and pubic symphysis ultrasound) and FUMPE (CT-based pulmonary embolism detection), demonstrate that DAUNet outperforms state-of-the-art models in Dice score, HD95, and ASD, while maintaining superior parameter efficiency. Ablation studies highlight the individual contributions of deformable convolutions and SimAM attention. DAUNet's robustness to missing context and low-contrast regions establishes its suitability for deployment in real-time and resource-constrained clinical environments.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{3}}$-Predictor: Noise-Free Deterministic Diffusion for Dense Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although diffusion models with strong visual priors have emerged as powerful dense prediction backboens, they overlook a core limitation: the stochastic noise at the core of diffusion sampling is inherently misaligned with dense prediction that requires a deterministic mapping from image to geometry. In this paper, we show that this stochastic noise corrupts fine-grained spatial cues and pushes the model toward timestep-specific noise objectives, consequently destroying meaningful geometric structure mappings. To address this, we introduce $\mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{3}}$-Predictor, a noise-free deterministic framework built by reformulating a pretrained diffusion model without stochasticity noise. Instead of relying on noisy inputs to leverage diffusion priors, $\mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{3}}$-Predictor views the pretrained diffusion network as an ensemble of timestep-dependent visual experts and self-supervisedly aggregates their heterogeneous priors into a single, clean, and complete geometric prior. Meanwhile, we utilize task-specific supervision to seamlessly adapt this noise-free prior to dense prediction tasks. Extensive experiments on various dense prediction tasks demonstrate that $\mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{3}}$-Predictor achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance in diverse scenarios. In addition, it requires less than half the training data previously used and efficiently performs inference in a single step. Our code, data, and checkpoints are publicly available at https://x-gengroup.github.io/HomePage_D3-Predictor/.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning on Molecular Graphs: A Systematic Investigation of Masking Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) plays a central role in molecular representation learning. Yet, many recent innovations in masking-based pretraining are introduced as heuristics and lack principled evaluation, obscuring which design choices are genuinely effective. This work cast the entire pretrain-finetune workflow into a unified probabilistic framework, enabling a transparent comparison and deeper understanding of masking strategies. Building on this formalism, we conduct a controlled study of three core design dimensions: masking distribution, prediction target, and encoder architecture, under rigorously controlled settings. We further employ information-theoretic measures to assess the informativeness of pretraining signals and connect them to empirically benchmarked downstream performance. Our findings reveal a surprising insight: sophisticated masking distributions offer no consistent benefit over uniform sampling for common node-level prediction tasks. Instead, the choice of prediction target and its synergy with the encoder architecture are far more critical. Specifically, shifting to semantically richer targets yields substantial downstream improvements, particularly when paired with expressive Graph Transformer encoders. These insights offer practical guidance for developing more effective SSL methods for molecular graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Progress in computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) is obscured by the lack of standardized evaluation infrastructure and the reliance on metrics that prioritize topological completion over chemical validity. We introduce RetroCast, a unified evaluation suite that standardizes heterogeneous model outputs into a common schema to enable statistically rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison. The framework includes a reproducible benchmarking pipeline with stratified sampling and bootstrapped confidence intervals, accompanied by SynthArena, an interactive platform for qualitative route inspection. We utilize this infrastructure to evaluate leading search-based and sequence-based algorithms on a new suite of standardized benchmarks. Our analysis reveals a divergence between "solvability" (stock-termination rate) and route quality; high solvability scores often mask chemical invalidity or fail to correlate with the reproduction of experimental ground truths. Furthermore, we identify a "complexity cliff" in which search-based methods, despite high solvability rates, exhibit a sharp performance decay in reconstructing long-range synthetic plans compared to sequence-based approaches. We release the full framework, benchmark definitions, and a standardized database of model predictions to support transparent and reproducible development in the field.</description>

      <title>ThinkTrap: Denial-of-Service Attacks against Black-box LLM Services via Infinite Thinking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational components in a wide range of applications, including natural language understanding and generation, embodied intelligence, and scientific discovery. As their computational requirements continue to grow, these models are increasingly deployed as cloud-based services, allowing users to access powerful LLMs via the Internet. However, this deployment model introduces a new class of threat: denial-of-service (DoS) attacks via unbounded reasoning, where adversaries craft specially designed inputs that cause the model to enter excessively long or infinite generation loops. These attacks can exhaust backend compute resources, degrading or denying service to legitimate users. To mitigate such risks, many LLM providers adopt a closed-source, black-box setting to obscure model internals. In this paper, we propose ThinkTrap, a novel input-space optimization framework for DoS attacks against LLM services even in black-box environments. The core idea of ThinkTrap is to first map discrete tokens into a continuous embedding space, then undertake efficient black-box optimization in a low-dimensional subspace exploiting input sparsity. The goal of this optimization is to identify adversarial prompts that induce extended or non-terminating generation across several state-of-the-art LLMs, achieving DoS with minimal token overhead. We evaluate the proposed attack across multiple commercial, closed-source LLM services. Our results demonstrate that, even far under the restrictive request frequency limits commonly enforced by these platforms, typically capped at ten requests per minute (10 RPM), the attack can degrade service throughput to as low as 1% of its original capacity, and in some cases, induce complete service failure.</description>

      <title>Leveraging KV Similarity for Online Structured Pruning in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pruning has emerged as a promising direction for accelerating large language model (LLM) inference, yet existing approaches often suffer from instability because they rely on offline calibration data that may not generalize across inputs. In this work, we introduce Token Filtering, a lightweight online structured pruning technique that makes pruning decisions directly during inference without any calibration data. The key idea is to measure token redundancy via joint key-value similarity and skip redundant attention computations, thereby reducing inference cost while preserving critical information. To further enhance stability, we design a variance-aware fusion strategy that adaptively weights key and value similarity across heads, ensuring that informative tokens are retained even under high pruning ratios. This design introduces no additional memory overhead and provides a more reliable criterion for token importance. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-2 (7B/13B), LLaMA-3 (8B), and Mistral (7B) demonstrate that Token Filtering consistently outperforms prior structured pruning methods, preserving accuracy on commonsense reasoning benchmarks and maintaining strong performance on challenging tasks such as MMLU, even with 50% pruning.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Persona: Disentangling Personality from Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: The deployment of personalized Large Language Models (LLMs) is currently constrained by the stability-plasticity dilemma. Prevailing alignment methods, such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), rely on stochastic weight updates that often incur an "alignment tax" -- degrading general reasoning capabilities.
  Methods: We propose the Soul Engine, a framework based on the Linear Representation Hypothesis, which posits that personality traits exist as orthogonal linear subspaces. We introduce SoulBench, a dataset constructed via dynamic contextual sampling. Using a dual-head architecture on a frozen Qwen-2.5 base, we extract disentangled personality vectors without modifying the backbone weights.
  Results: Our experiments demonstrate three breakthroughs. First, High-Precision Profiling: The model achieves a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.011 against psychological ground truth. Second, Geometric Orthogonality: T-SNE visualization confirms that personality manifolds are distinct and continuous, allowing for "Zero-Shot Personality Injection" that maintains original model intelligence. Third, Deterministic Steering: We achieve robust control over behavior via vector arithmetic, validated through extensive ablation studies.
  Conclusion: This work challenges the necessity of fine-tuning for personalization. By transitioning from probabilistic prompting to deterministic latent intervention, we provide a mathematically rigorous foundation for safe, controllable AI personalization.</description>

      <title>FOAM: Blocked State Folding for Memory-Efficient LLM Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance due to their large parameter counts and extensive training data. However, their scale leads to significant memory bottlenecks during training, especially when using memory-intensive optimizers like Adam. Existing memory-efficient approaches often rely on techniques such as singular value decomposition (SVD), projections, or weight freezing, which can introduce substantial computational overhead, require additional memory for projections, or degrade model performance. In this paper, we propose Folded Optimizer with Approximate Moment (FOAM), a method that compresses optimizer states by computing block-wise gradient means and incorporates a residual correction to recover lost information. Theoretically, FOAM achieves convergence rates equivalent to vanilla Adam under standard non-convex optimization settings. Empirically, FOAM reduces total training memory by approximately 50\%, eliminates up to 90\% of optimizer state memory overhead, and accelerates convergence. Furthermore, FOAM is compatible with other memory-efficient optimizers, delivering performance and throughput that match or surpass both full-rank and existing memory-efficient baselines.</description>

      <title>RisConFix: LLM-based Automated Repair of Risk-Prone Drone Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flight control software is typically designed with numerous configurable parameters governing multiple functionalities, enabling flexible adaptation to mission diversity and environmental uncertainty. Although developers and manufacturers usually provide recommendations for these parameters to ensure safe and stable operations, certain combinations of parameters with recommended values may still lead to unstable flight behaviors, thereby degrading the drone's robustness. To this end, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM) based approach for real-time repair of risk-prone configurations (named RisConFix) that degrade drone robustness. RisConFix continuously monitors the drone's operational state and automatically triggers a repair mechanism once abnormal flight behaviors are detected. The repair mechanism leverages an LLM to analyze relationships between configuration parameters and flight states, and then generates corrective parameter updates to restore flight stability. To ensure the validity of the updated configuration, RisConFix operates as an iterative process; it continuously monitors the drone's flight state and, if an anomaly persists after applying an update, automatically triggers the next repair cycle. We evaluated RisConFix through a case study of ArduPilot (with 1,421 groups of misconfigurations). Experimental results show that RisConFix achieved a best repair success rate of 97% and an optimal average number of repairs of 1.17, demonstrating its capability to effectively and efficiently repair risk-prone configurations in real time.</description>

      <title>DART: Leveraging Multi-Agent Disagreement for Tool Recruitment in Multimodal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Specialized visual tools can augment large language models or vision language models with expert knowledge (e.g., grounding, spatial reasoning, medical knowledge, etc.), but knowing which tools to call (and when to call them) can be challenging. We introduce DART, a multi-agent framework that uses disagreements between multiple debating visual agents to identify useful visual tools (e.g., object detection, OCR, spatial reasoning, etc.) that can resolve inter-agent disagreement. These tools allow for fruitful multi-agent discussion by introducing new information, and by providing tool-aligned agreement scores that highlight agents in agreement with expert tools, thereby facilitating discussion. We utilize an aggregator agent to select the best answer by providing the agent outputs and tool information. We test DART on four diverse benchmarks and show that our approach improves over multi-agent debate as well as over single agent tool-calling frameworks, beating the next-strongest baseline (multi-agent debate with a judge model) by 3.4% and 2.4% on A-OKVQA and MMMU respectively. We also find that DART adapts well to new tools in applied domains, with a 1.3% improvement on the M3D medical dataset over other strong tool-calling, single agent, and multi-agent baselines. Additionally, we measure text overlap across rounds to highlight the rich discussion in DART compared to existing multi-agent methods. Finally, we study the tool call distribution, finding that diverse tools are reliably used to help resolve disagreement.</description>

      <title>TrajMoE: Scene-Adaptive Trajectory Planning with Mixture of Experts and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07135v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current autonomous driving systems often favor end-to-end frameworks, which take sensor inputs like images and learn to map them into trajectory space via neural networks. Previous work has demonstrated that models can achieve better planning performance when provided with a prior distribution of possible trajectories. However, these approaches often overlook two critical aspects: 1) The appropriate trajectory prior can vary significantly across different driving scenarios. 2) Their trajectory evaluation mechanism lacks policy-driven refinement, remaining constrained by the limitations of one-stage supervised training. To address these issues, we explore improvements in two key areas. For problem 1, we employ MoE to apply different trajectory priors tailored to different scenarios. For problem 2, we utilize Reinforcement Learning to fine-tune the trajectory scoring mechanism. Additionally, we integrate models with different perception backbones to enhance perceptual features. Our integrated model achieved a score of 51.08 on the navsim ICCV benchmark, securing third place.</description>

      <title>A Large-Scale Multimodal Dataset and Benchmarks for Human Activity Scene Understanding and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal human action recognition (HAR) leverages complementary sensors for activity classification. Beyond recognition, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable detailed descriptions and causal reasoning, motivating new tasks: human action understanding (HAU) and human action reasoning (HARn). However, most LLMs, especially large vision language models (LVLMs), struggle with non-RGB modalities such as depth, IMU, and mmWave due to the lack of large-scale data-caption resources. Existing HAR datasets mainly provide coarse data-label annotations, which are insufficient to capture fine-grained action dynamics needed for HAU and HARn. We consider two ground-truth pair types: (1) data label (discrete category) and (2) data caption (textual description). Naively generating captions from labels often lacks logical and spatiotemporal consistency. We introduce CUHK-X, a large-scale multimodal dataset and benchmark suite for HAR, HAU, and HARn. CUHK-X contains 58,445 samples covering 40 actions performed by 30 participants across two indoor environments. To improve caption consistency, we propose a prompt-based scene creation method that leverages LLMs to generate logically connected activity sequences, followed by human validation. CUHK-X includes three benchmarks with six evaluation tasks. Experiments report average accuracies of 76.52% (HAR), 40.76% (HAU), and 70.25% (HARn). CUHK-X aims to enable the community to apply and develop data-intensive learning methods for robust, multimodal human activity analysis.

      <title>Winning the Lottery by Preserving Network Training Dynamics with Concrete Ticket Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis asserts the existence of highly sparse, trainable subnetworks ('winning tickets') within dense, randomly initialized neural networks. However, state-of-the-art methods of drawing these tickets, like Lottery Ticket Rewinding (LTR), are computationally prohibitive, while more efficient saliency-based Pruning-at-Initialization (PaI) techniques suffer from a significant accuracy-sparsity trade-off and fail basic sanity checks. In this work, we argue that PaI's reliance on first-order saliency metrics, which ignore inter-weight dependencies, contributes substantially to this performance gap, especially in the sparse regime. To address this, we introduce Concrete Ticket Search (CTS), an algorithm that frames subnetwork discovery as a holistic combinatorial optimization problem. By leveraging a Concrete relaxation of the discrete search space and a novel gradient balancing scheme (GRADBALANCE) to control sparsity, CTS efficiently identifies high-performing subnetworks near initialization without requiring sensitive hyperparameter tuning. Motivated by recent works on lottery ticket training dynamics, we further propose a knowledge distillation-inspired family of pruning objectives, finding that minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence between sparse and dense network outputs (CTS-KL) is particularly effective. Experiments on varying image classification tasks show that CTS produces subnetworks that robustly pass sanity checks and achieve accuracy comparable to or exceeding LTR, while requiring only a small fraction of the computation. For example, on ResNet-20 on CIFAR10, it reaches 99.3% sparsity with 74.0% accuracy in 7.9 minutes, while LTR attains the same sparsity with 68.3% accuracy in 95.2 minutes. CTS's subnetworks outperform saliency-based methods across all sparsities, but its advantage over LTR is most pronounced in the highly sparse regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models have become powerful priors for solving inverse problems, and various training-free methods have been developed. However, when applied to latent flow models, existing methods often fail to converge to the posterior mode or suffer from manifold deviation within latent spaces. To mitigate this, here we introduce a novel training-free framework, FlowLPS, that solves inverse problems with pretrained flow models via a Langevin Proximal Sampling (LPS) strategy. Our method integrates Langevin dynamics for manifold-consistent exploration with proximal optimization for precise mode seeking, achieving a superior balance between reconstruction fidelity and perceptual quality across multiple inverse tasks on FFHQ and DIV2K, outperforming state of the art inverse solvers.</description>

      <title>JEPA as a Neural Tokenizer: Learning Robust Speech Representations with Density Adaptive Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a two-stage self-supervised framework that combines the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) with a Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM) for learning robust speech representations. Stage~1 uses JEPA with DAAM to learn semantic audio features via masked prediction in latent space, fully decoupled from waveform reconstruction. Stage~2 leverages these representations for efficient tokenization using Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) and a mixed-radix packing scheme, followed by high-fidelity waveform reconstruction with a HiFi-GAN decoder. By integrating Gaussian mixture-based density-adaptive gating into the JEPA encoder, the model performs adaptive temporal feature selection and discovers hierarchical speech structure at a low frame rate of 2.5~Hz. The resulting tokens (47.5 tokens/sec) provide a reversible, highly compressed, and language-model-friendly representation that is competitive with, and often more efficient than, existing neural audio codecs.</description>

      <title>Towards Unified Semantic and Controllable Image Fusion: A Diffusion Transformer Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image fusion aims to blend complementary information from multiple sensing modalities, yet existing approaches remain limited in robustness, adaptability, and controllability. Most current fusion networks are tailored to specific tasks and lack the ability to flexibly incorporate user intent, especially in complex scenarios involving low-light degradation, color shifts, or exposure imbalance. Moreover, the absence of ground-truth fused images and the small scale of existing datasets make it difficult to train an end-to-end model that simultaneously understands high-level semantics and performs fine-grained multimodal alignment. We therefore present DiTFuse, instruction-driven Diffusion-Transformer (DiT) framework that performs end-to-end, semantics-aware fusion within a single model. By jointly encoding two images and natural-language instructions in a shared latent space, DiTFuse enables hierarchical and fine-grained control over fusion dynamics, overcoming the limitations of pre-fusion and post-fusion pipelines that struggle to inject high-level semantics. The training phase employs a multi-degradation masked-image modeling strategy, so the network jointly learns cross-modal alignment, modality-invariant restoration, and task-aware feature selection without relying on ground truth images. A curated, multi-granularity instruction dataset further equips the model with interactive fusion capabilities. DiTFuse unifies infrared-visible, multi-focus, and multi-exposure fusion-as well as text-controlled refinement and downstream tasks-within a single architecture. Experiments on public IVIF, MFF, and MEF benchmarks confirm superior quantitative and qualitative performance, sharper textures, and better semantic retention. The model also supports multi-level user control and zero-shot generalization to other multi-image fusion scenarios, including instruction-conditioned segmentation.</description>

      <title>START: Spatial and Textual Learning for Chart Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chart understanding is crucial for deploying multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios such as analyzing scientific papers and technical reports. Unlike natural images, charts pair a structured visual layout (spatial property) with an underlying data representation (textual property) -- grasping both is essential for precise, fine-grained chart reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we propose START, the Spatial and Textual learning for chART understanding. Specifically, we introduce (i) chart-element grounding and (ii) chart-to-code generation to strengthen an MLLM's understanding of both chart visual layout and data details. To facilitate spatial and textual learning, we propose the START-Dataset generated with a novel data-generation pipeline that first leverages an MLLM to translate real chart images into executable chart code, recovering the underlying data representation while preserving the visual distribution of real-world charts. We then evolve the code with a Large Language Model (LLM) to ascertain the positions of chart elements that capture the chart's visual structure, addressing challenges that existing methods cannot handle. To evaluate a model's ability to understand chart spatial structures, we propose the Chart Spatial understanding Benchmark (CS-Bench), filling a critical gap in comprehensive chart understanding evaluation. Leveraging spatial and textual learning, START delivers consistent gains across model sizes and benchmarks over the base models and surpasses prior state-of-the-art by a clear margin. Code, data and models will be publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent role-playing has recently shown promise for studying social behavior with language agents, but existing simulations are mostly monolingual and fail to model cross-lingual interaction, an essential property of real societies. We introduce MASim, the first multilingual agent-based simulation framework that supports multi-turn interaction among generative agents with diverse sociolinguistic profiles. MASim offers two key analyses: (i) global public opinion modeling, by simulating how attitudes toward open-domain hypotheses evolve across languages and cultures, and (ii) media influence and information diffusion, via autonomous news agents that dynamically generate content and shape user behavior. To instantiate simulations, we construct the MAPS benchmark, which combines survey questions and demographic personas drawn from global population distributions. Experiments on calibration, sensitivity, consistency, and cultural case studies show that MASim reproduces sociocultural phenomena and highlights the importance of multilingual simulation for scalable, controlled computational social science.</description>

      <title>Geometric Prior-Guided Federated Prompt Calibration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) offers a parameter-efficient solution for collaboratively training large models, but its performance is severely hindered by data heterogeneity, which causes locally trained prompts to become biased. Existing methods, focusing on aggregation or regularization, fail to address this root cause of local training bias. To this end, we propose Geometry-Guided Text Prompt Calibration (GGTPC), a novel framework that directly corrects this bias by providing clients with a global geometric prior. This prior, representing the shape of the global data distribution derived from the covariance matrix, is reconstructed on the server in a privacy-preserving manner. Clients then use a novel Geometry-Prior Calibration Layer (GPCL) to align their local feature distributions with this global prior during training. Extensive experiments show GGTPC's effectiveness. On the label-skewed CIFAR-100 dataset ($\beta$=0.1), it outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.15\%. Under extreme skew ($\beta$=0.01), it improves upon the baseline by 9.17\%. Furthermore, as a plug-and-play module on the domain-skewed Office-Home dataset, it boosts FedAvg's performance by 4.60\%. These results demonstrate that GGTPC effectively mitigates data heterogeneity by correcting the fundamental local training bias, serving as a versatile module to enhance various FL algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07215v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have revolutionized computer vision by providing rich semantic and geometric representations. This paper presents a comprehensive visual comparison between CLIP based and DINOv2 based approaches for 3D pose estimation in hand object grasping scenarios. We evaluate both models on the task of 6D object pose estimation and demonstrate their complementary strengths: CLIP excels in semantic understanding through language grounding, while DINOv2 provides superior dense geometric features. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that CLIP based methods achieve better semantic consistency, while DINOv2 based approaches demonstrate competitive performance with enhanced geometric precision. Our analysis provides insights for selecting appropriate vision models for robotic manipulation and grasping, picking applications.</description>

      <title>NeSTR: A Neuro-Symbolic Abductive Framework for Temporal Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, temporal reasoning, particularly under complex temporal constraints, remains a major challenge. To this end, existing approaches have explored symbolic methods, which encode temporal structure explicitly, and reflective mechanisms, which revise reasoning errors through multi-step inference. Nonetheless, symbolic approaches often underutilize the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, while reflective methods typically lack structured temporal representations, which can result in inconsistent or hallucinated reasoning. As a result, even when the correct temporal context is available, LLMs may still misinterpret or misapply time-related information, leading to incomplete or inaccurate answers. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Temporal Reasoning (NeSTR), a novel framework that integrates structured symbolic representations with hybrid reflective reasoning to enhance the temporal sensitivity of LLM inference. NeSTR preserves explicit temporal relations through symbolic encoding, enforces logical consistency via verification, and corrects flawed inferences using abductive reflection. Extensive experiments on diverse temporal question answering benchmarks demonstrate that NeSTR achieves superior zero-shot performance and consistently improves temporal reasoning without any fine-tuning, showcasing the advantage of neuro-symbolic integration in enhancing temporal understanding in large language models.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Protective Perturbation against DeepFake Face Swapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DeepFake face swapping enables highly realistic identity forgeries, posing serious privacy and security risks. A common defence embeds invisible perturbations into images, but these are fragile and often destroyed by basic transformations such as compression or resizing. In this paper, we first conduct a systematic analysis of 30 transformations across six categories and show that protection robustness is highly sensitive to the choice of training transformations, making the standard Expectation over Transformation (EOT) with uniform sampling fundamentally suboptimal. Motivated by this, we propose Expectation Over Learned distribution of Transformation (EOLT), the framework to treat transformation distribution as a learnable component rather than a fixed design choice. Specifically, EOLT employs a policy network that learns to automatically prioritize critical transformations and adaptively generate instance-specific perturbations via reinforcement learning, enabling explicit modeling of defensive bottlenecks while maintaining broad transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art approaches, with 26% higher average robustness and up to 30% gains on challenging transformation categories.</description>

      <title>Dropout Prompt Learning: Towards Robust and Adaptive Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dropout is a widely used regularization technique which improves the generalization ability of a model by randomly dropping neurons. In light of this, we propose Dropout Prompt Learning, which aims for applying dropout to improve the robustness of the vision-language models. Different from the vanilla dropout, we apply dropout on the tokens of the textual and visual branches, where we evaluate the token significance considering both intra-modal context and inter-modal alignment, enabling flexible dropout probabilities for each token. Moreover, to maintain semantic alignment for general knowledge transfer while encouraging the diverse representations that dropout introduces, we further propose residual entropy regularization. Experiments on 15 benchmarks show our method's effectiveness in challenging scenarios like low-shot learning, long-tail classification, and out-of-distribution generalization. Notably, our method surpasses regularization-based methods including KgCoOp by 5.10% and PromptSRC by 2.13% in performance on base-to-novel generalization.</description>

      <title>IFFair: Influence Function-driven Sample Reweighting for Fair Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because machine learning has significantly improved efficiency and convenience in the society, it's increasingly used to assist or replace human decision-making. However, the data-based pattern makes related algorithms learn and even exacerbate potential bias in samples, resulting in discriminatory decisions against certain unprivileged groups, depriving them of the rights to equal treatment, thus damaging the social well-being and hindering the development of related applications. Therefore, we propose a pre-processing method IFFair based on the influence function. Compared with other fairness optimization approaches, IFFair only uses the influence disparity of training samples on different groups as a guidance to dynamically adjust the sample weights during training without modifying the network structure, data features and decision boundaries. To evaluate the validity of IFFair, we conduct experiments on multiple real-world datasets and metrics. The experimental results show that our approach mitigates bias of multiple accepted metrics in the classification setting, including demographic parity, equalized odds, equality of opportunity and error rate parity without conflicts. It also demonstrates that IFFair achieves better trade-off between multiple utility and fairness metrics compared with previous pre-processing methods.</description>

      <title>DGGAN: Degradation Guided Generative Adversarial Network for Real-time Endoscopic Video Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Endoscopic surgery relies on intraoperative video, making image quality a decisive factor for surgical safety and efficacy. Yet, endoscopic videos are often degraded by uneven illumination, tissue scattering, occlusions, and motion blur, which obscure critical anatomical details and complicate surgical manipulation. Although deep learning-based methods have shown promise in image enhancement, most existing approaches remain too computationally demanding for real-time surgical use. To address this challenge, we propose a degradation-aware framework for endoscopic video enhancement, which enables real-time, high-quality enhancement by propagating degradation representations across frames. In our framework, degradation representations are first extracted from images using contrastive learning. We then introduce a fusion mechanism that modulates image features with these representations to guide a single-frame enhancement model, which is trained with a cycle-consistency constraint between degraded and restored images to improve robustness and generalization. Experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves a superior balance between performance and efficiency compared with several state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of degradation-aware modeling for real-time endoscopic video enhancement. Nevertheless, our method suggests that implicitly learning and propagating degradation representation offer a practical pathway for clinical application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating autonomous mobile robots into human environments requires human-like decision-making and energy-efficient, event-based computation. Despite progress, neuromorphic methods are rarely applied to Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) navigation approaches due to unstable training. We address this gap with a hybrid socially integrated DRL actor-critic approach that combines Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) in the actor with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in the critic and a neuromorphic feature extractor to capture temporal crowd dynamics and human-robot interactions. Our approach enhances social navigation performance and reduces estimated energy consumption by approximately 1.69 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Effective Attention-Guided Multi-Scale Medical Network for Skin Lesion Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of healthcare, precise skin lesion segmentation is crucial for the early detection and accurate diagnosis of skin diseases. Despite significant advances in deep learning for image processing, existing methods have yet to effectively address the challenges of irregular lesion shapes and low contrast. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative encoder-decoder network architecture based on multi-scale residual structures, capable of extracting rich feature information from different receptive fields to effectively identify lesion areas. By introducing a Multi-Resolution Multi-Channel Fusion (MRCF) module, our method captures cross-scale features, enhancing the clarity and accuracy of the extracted information. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Mix Attention Module (CMAM), which redefines the attention scope and dynamically calculates weights across multiple contexts, thus improving the flexibility and depth of feature capture and enabling deeper exploration of subtle features. To overcome the information loss caused by skip connections in traditional U-Net, an External Attention Bridge (EAB) is introduced, facilitating the effective utilization of information in the decoder and compensating for the loss during upsampling. Extensive experimental evaluations on several skin lesion segmentation datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing transformer and convolutional neural network-based models, showcasing exceptional segmentation accuracy and robustness.</description>

      <title>SIT-Graph: State Integrated Tool Graph for Multi-Turn Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite impressive advances in agent systems, multi-turn tool-use scenarios remain challenging. It is mainly because intent is clarified progressively and the environment evolves with each tool call. While reusing past experience is natural, current LLM agents either treat entire trajectories or pre-defined subtasks as indivisible units, or solely exploit tool-to-tool dependencies, hindering adaptation as states and information evolve across turns. In this paper, we propose a State Integrated Tool Graph (SIT-Graph), which enhances multi-turn tool use by exploiting partially overlapping experience. Inspired by human decision-making that integrates episodic and procedural memory, SIT-Graph captures both compact state representations (episodic-like fragments) and tool-to-tool dependencies (procedural-like routines) from historical trajectories. Specifically, we first build a tool graph from accumulated tool-use sequences, and then augment each edge with a compact state summary of the dialog and tool history that may shape the next action. At inference time, SIT-Graph enables a human-like balance between episodic recall and procedural execution: when the next decision requires recalling prior context, the agent retrieves the state summaries stored on relevant edges and uses them to guide its next action; when the step is routine, it follows high-confidence tool dependencies without explicit recall. Experiments across multiple stateful multi-turn tool-use benchmarks show that SIT-Graph consistently outperforms strong memory- and graph-based baselines, delivering more robust tool selection and more effective experience transfer.</description>

      <title>Towards Accurate UAV Image Perception: Guiding Vision-Language Models with Stronger Task Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing image perception methods based on VLMs generally follow a paradigm wherein models extract and analyze image content based on user-provided textual task prompts. However, such methods face limitations when applied to UAV imagery, which presents challenges like target confusion, scale variations, and complex backgrounds. These challenges arise because VLMs' understanding of image content depends on the semantic alignment between visual and textual tokens. When the task prompt is simplistic and the image content is complex, achieving effective alignment becomes difficult, limiting the model's ability to focus on task-relevant information. To address this issue, we introduce AerialVP, the first agent framework for task prompt enhancement in UAV image perception. AerialVP proactively extracts multi-dimensional auxiliary information from UAV images to enhance task prompts, overcoming the limitations of traditional VLM-based approaches. Specifically, the enhancement process includes three stages: (1) analyzing the task prompt to identify the task type and enhancement needs, (2) selecting appropriate tools from the tool repository, and (3) generating enhanced task prompts based on the analysis and selected tools. To evaluate AerialVP, we introduce AerialSense, a comprehensive benchmark for UAV image perception that includes Aerial Visual Reasoning, Aerial Visual Question Answering, and Aerial Visual Grounding tasks. AerialSense provides a standardized basis for evaluating model generalization and performance across diverse resolutions, lighting conditions, and both urban and natural scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that AerialVP significantly enhances task prompt guidance, leading to stable and substantial performance improvements in both open-source and proprietary VLMs. Our work will be available at https://github.com/lostwolves/AerialVP.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a constraint-programming framework for generating synthetic populations that reproduce target statistics with high precision while enforcing full individual consistency. Unlike data-driven approaches that infer distributions from samples, our method directly encodes aggregated statistics and structural relations, enabling exact control of demographic profiles without requiring any microdata. We validate the approach on official demographic sources and study the impact of distributional deviations on downstream analyses. This work is conducted within the Pollitics project developed by Emotia, where synthetic populations can be queried through large language models to model societal behaviors, explore market and policy scenarios, and provide reproducible decision-grade insights without personal data.</description>

      <title>Radiance-Field Reinforced Pretraining: Scaling Localization Models with Unlabeled Wireless Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF)-based indoor localization offers significant promise for applications such as indoor navigation, augmented reality, and pervasive computing. While deep learning has greatly enhanced localization accuracy and robustness, existing localization models still face major challenges in cross-scene generalization due to their reliance on scene-specific labeled data. To address this, we introduce Radiance-Field Reinforced Pretraining (RFRP). This novel self-supervised pretraining framework couples a large localization model (LM) with a neural radio-frequency radiance field (RF-NeRF) in an asymmetrical autoencoder architecture. In this design, the LM encodes received RF spectra into latent, position-relevant representations, while the RF-NeRF decodes them to reconstruct the original spectra. This alignment between input and output enables effective representation learning using large-scale, unlabeled RF data, which can be collected continuously with minimal effort. To this end, we collected RF samples at 7,327,321 positions across 100 diverse scenes using four common wireless technologies--RFID, BLE, WiFi, and IIoT. Data from 75 scenes were used for training, and the remaining 25 for evaluation. Experimental results show that the RFRP-pretrained LM reduces localization error by over 40% compared to non-pretrained models and by 21% compared to those pretrained using supervised learning.</description>

      <title>DCO: Dynamic Cache Orchestration for LLM Accelerators through Predictive Management</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) is pushing AI accelerators toward increasingly powerful and specialized designs. Instead of further complicating software development with deeply hierarchical scratchpad memories (SPMs) and their asynchronous management, we investigate the opposite point of the design spectrum: a multi-core AI accelerator equipped with a shared system-level cache and application-aware management policies, which keeps the programming effort modest. Our approach exploits dataflow information available in the software stack to guide cache replacement (including dead-block prediction), in concert with bypass decisions and mechanisms that alleviate cache thrashing.
  We assess the proposal using a cycle-accurate simulator and observe substantial performance gains (up to 1.80x speedup) compared with conventional cache architectures. In addition, we build and validate an analytical model that takes into account the actual overlapping behaviors to extend the measurement results of our policies to real-world larger-scale workloads. Experiment results show that when functioning together, our bypassing and thrashing mitigation strategies can handle scenarios both with and without inter-core data sharing and achieve remarkable speedups.
  Finally, we implement the design in RTL and the area of our design is $\mathbf{0.064mm^2}$ with 15nm process, which can run at 2 GHz clock frequency. Our findings explore the potential of the shared cache design to assist the development of future AI accelerator systems.</description>

      <title>ContextAnyone: Context-Aware Diffusion for Character-Consistent Text-to-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has advanced rapidly, yet maintaining consistent character identities across scenes remains a major challenge. Existing personalization methods often focus on facial identity but fail to preserve broader contextual cues such as hairstyle, outfit, and body shape, which are critical for visual coherence. We propose \textbf{ContextAnyone}, a context-aware diffusion framework that achieves character-consistent video generation from text and a single reference image. Our method jointly reconstructs the reference image and generates new video frames, enabling the model to fully perceive and utilize reference information. Reference information is effectively integrated into a DiT-based diffusion backbone through a novel Emphasize-Attention module that selectively reinforces reference-aware features and prevents identity drift across frames. A dual-guidance loss combines diffusion and reference reconstruction objectives to enhance appearance fidelity, while the proposed Gap-RoPE positional embedding separates reference and video tokens to stabilize temporal modeling.

      <title>Local-Curvature-Aware Knowledge Graph Embedding: An Extended Ricci Flow Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) relies on the geometry of the embedding space to encode semantic and structural relations. Existing methods place all entities on one homogeneous manifold, Euclidean, spherical, hyperbolic, or their product/multi-curvature variants, to model linear, symmetric, or hierarchical patterns. Yet a predefined, homogeneous manifold cannot accommodate the sharply varying curvature that real-world graphs exhibit across local regions. Since this geometry is imposed a priori, any mismatch with the knowledge graph's local curvatures will distort distances between entities and hurt the expressiveness of the resulting KGE. To rectify this, we propose RicciKGE to have the KGE loss gradient coupled with local curvatures in an extended Ricci flow such that entity embeddings co-evolve dynamically with the underlying manifold geometry towards mutual adaptation. Theoretically, when the coupling coefficient is bounded and properly selected, we rigorously prove that i) all the edge-wise curvatures decay exponentially, meaning that the manifold is driven toward the Euclidean flatness; and ii) the KGE distances strictly converge to a global optimum, which indicates that geometric flattening and embedding optimization are promoting each other. Experimental improvements on link prediction and node classification benchmarks demonstrate RicciKGE's effectiveness in adapting to heterogeneous knowledge graph structures.</description>

      <title>Venus: An Efficient Edge Memory-and-Retrieval System for VLM-based Online Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal comprehension capabilities and are being deployed in an increasing number of online video understanding applications. While recent efforts extensively explore advancing VLMs' reasoning power in these cases, deployment constraints are overlooked, leading to overwhelming system overhead in real-world deployments. To address that, we propose Venus, an on-device memory-and-retrieval system for efficient online video understanding. Venus proposes an edge-cloud disaggregated architecture that sinks memory construction and keyframe retrieval from cloud to edge, operating in two stages. In the ingestion stage, Venus continuously processes streaming edge videos via scene segmentation and clustering, where the selected keyframes are embedded with a multimodal embedding model to build a hierarchical memory for efficient storage and retrieval. In the querying stage, Venus indexes incoming queries from memory, and employs a threshold-based progressive sampling algorithm for keyframe selection that enhances diversity and adaptively balances system cost and reasoning accuracy. Our extensive evaluation shows that Venus achieves a 15x-131x speedup in total response latency compared to state-of-the-art methods, enabling real-time responses within seconds while maintaining comparable or even superior reasoning accuracy.</description>

      <title>DeepAgent: A Dual Stream Multi Agent Fusion for Robust Multimodal Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic media, particularly deepfakes, is an emerging challenge for digital content verification. Although recent studies use both audio and visual information, most integrate these cues within a single model, which remains vulnerable to modality mismatches, noise, and manipulation. To address this gap, we propose DeepAgent, an advanced multi-agent collaboration framework that simultaneously incorporates both visual and audio modalities for the effective detection of deepfakes. DeepAgent consists of two complementary agents. Agent-1 examines each video with a streamlined AlexNet-based CNN to identify the symbols of deepfake manipulation, while Agent-2 detects audio-visual inconsistencies by combining acoustic features, audio transcriptions from Whisper, and frame-reading sequences of images through EasyOCR. Their decisions are fused through a Random Forest meta-classifier that improves final performance by taking advantage of the different decision boundaries learned by each agent. This study evaluates the proposed framework using three benchmark datasets to demonstrate both component-level and fused performance. Agent-1 achieves a test accuracy of 94.35% on the combined Celeb-DF and FakeAVCeleb datasets. On the FakeAVCeleb dataset, Agent-2 and the final meta-classifier attain accuracies of 93.69% and 81.56%, respectively. In addition, cross-dataset validation on DeepFakeTIMIT confirms the robustness of the meta-classifier, which achieves a final accuracy of 97.49%, and indicates a strong capability across diverse datasets. These findings confirm that hierarchy-based fusion enhances robustness by mitigating the weaknesses of individual modalities and demonstrate the effectiveness of a multi-agent approach in addressing diverse types of manipulations in deepfakes.</description>

      <title>Structure-Aware Feature Rectification with Region Adjacency Graphs for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benefiting from the inductive biases learned from large-scale datasets, open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) leverages the power of vision-language models, such as CLIP, to achieve remarkable progress without requiring task-specific training. However, due to CLIP's pre-training nature on image-text pairs, it tends to focus on global semantic alignment, resulting in suboptimal performance when associating fine-grained visual regions with text. This leads to noisy and inconsistent predictions, particularly in local areas. We attribute this to a dispersed bias stemming from its contrastive training paradigm, which is difficult to alleviate using CLIP features alone. To address this, we propose a structure-aware feature rectification approach that incorporates instance-specific priors derived directly from the image. Specifically, we construct a region adjacency graph (RAG) based on low-level features (e.g., colour and texture) to capture local structural relationships and use it to refine CLIP features by enhancing local discrimination. Extensive experiments show that our method effectively suppresses segmentation noise, improves region-level consistency, and achieves strong performance on multiple open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks.</description>

      <title>ESPADA: Execution Speedup via Semantics Aware Demonstration Data Downsampling for Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Behavior-cloning based visuomotor policies enable precise manipulation but often inherit the slow, cautious tempo of human demonstrations, limiting practical deployment. However, prior studies on acceleration methods mainly rely on statistical or heuristic cues that ignore task semantics and can fail across diverse manipulation settings. We present ESPADA, a semantic and spatially aware framework that segments demonstrations using a VLM-LLM pipeline with 3D gripper-object relations, enabling aggressive downsampling only in non-critical segments while preserving precision-critical phases, without requiring extra data or architectural modifications, or any form of retraining. To scale from a single annotated episode to the full dataset, ESPADA propagates segment labels via Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) on dynamics-only features. Across both simulation and real-world experiments with ACT and DP baselines, ESPADA achieves approximately a 2x speed-up while maintaining success rates, narrowing the gap between human demonstrations and efficient robot control.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis of shallow and deep forgetting in replay with Neural Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A persistent paradox in continual learning (CL) is that neural networks often retain linearly separable representations of past tasks even when their output predictions fail. We formalize this distinction as the gap between deep feature-space and shallow classifier-level forgetting. We reveal a critical asymmetry in Experience Replay: while minimal buffers successfully anchor feature geometry and prevent deep forgetting, mitigating shallow forgetting typically requires substantially larger buffer capacities. To explain this, we extend the Neural Collapse framework to the sequential setting. We characterize deep forgetting as a geometric drift toward out-of-distribution subspaces and prove that any non-zero replay fraction asymptotically guarantees the retention of linear separability. Conversely, we identify that the "strong collapse" induced by small buffers leads to rank-deficient covariances and inflated class means, effectively blinding the classifier to true population boundaries. By unifying CL with out-of-distribution detection, our work challenges the prevailing reliance on large buffers, suggesting that explicitly correcting these statistical artifacts could unlock robust performance with minimal replay.</description>

      <title>Do LLMs Trust the Code They Write?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for code generation, they often output incorrect code. One reason is that model output probabilities are often not well-correlated with correctness, and reflect only the final output of the generation process. Inspired by findings that LLMs internally encode concepts like truthfulness, this paper explores if LLMs similarly represent code correctness. Specifically, we identify a correctness representation inside LLMs by contrasting the hidden states between pairs of correct and incorrect code for the same programming tasks. By experimenting on four LLMs, we show that exploiting this extracted correctness representation outperforms standard log-likelihood ranking, as well as verbalized model confidence. Furthermore, we explore how this internal correctness signal can be used to select higher-quality code samples, without requiring test execution. Ultimately, this work demonstrates how leveraging internal representations can enhance code generation systems and make LLMs more reliable, thus improving confidence in automatically generated code.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Exploration of Mobility Interaction Patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the movement behaviours of individuals and the way they react to the external world is a key component of any problem that involves the modelling of human dynamics at a physical level. In particular, it is crucial to capture the influence that the presence of an individual can have on the others. Important examples of applications include crowd simulation and emergency management, where the simulation of the mass of people passes through the simulation of the individuals, taking into consideration the others as part of the general context. While existing solutions basically start from some preconceived behavioural model, in this work we propose an approach that starts directly from the data, adopting a data mining perspective. Our method searches the mobility events in the data that might be possible evidences of mutual interactions between individuals, and on top of them looks for complex, persistent patterns and time evolving configurations of events. The study of these patterns can provide new insights on the mechanics of mobility interactions between individuals, which can potentially help in improving existing simulation models. We instantiate the general methodology on two real case studies, one on cars and one on pedestrians, and a full experimental evaluation is performed, both in terms of performances, parameter sensitivity and interpretation of sample results.</description>

      <title>When normalization hallucinates: unseen risks in AI-powered whole slide image processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) normalization remains a vital preprocessing step in computational pathology. Increasingly driven by deep learning, these models learn to approximate data distributions from training examples. This often results in outputs that gravitate toward the average, potentially masking diagnostically important features. More critically, they can introduce hallucinated content, artifacts that appear realistic but are not present in the original tissue, posing a serious threat to downstream analysis. These hallucinations are nearly impossible to detect visually, and current evaluation practices often overlook them. In this work, we demonstrate that the risk of hallucinations is real and underappreciated. While many methods perform adequately on public datasets, we observe a concerning frequency of hallucinations when these same models are retrained and evaluated on real-world clinical data. To address this, we propose a novel image comparison measure designed to automatically detect hallucinations in normalized outputs. Using this measure, we systematically evaluate several well-cited normalization methods retrained on real-world data, revealing significant inconsistencies and failures that are not captured by conventional metrics. Our findings underscore the need for more robust, interpretable normalization techniques and stricter validation protocols in clinical deployment.</description>

      <title>MIDG: Mixture of Invariant Experts with knowledge injection for Domain Generalization in Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing methods in domain generalization for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) often overlook inter-modal synergies during invariant features extraction, which prevents the accurate capture of the rich semantic information within multimodal data. Additionally, while knowledge injection techniques have been explored in MSA, they often suffer from fragmented cross-modal knowledge, overlooking specific representations that exist beyond the confines of unimodal. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MSA framework designed for domain generalization. Firstly, the framework incorporates a Mixture of Invariant Experts model to extract domain-invariant features, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to learn synergistic relationships between modalities. Secondly, we design a Cross-Modal Adapter to augment the semantic richness of multimodal representations through cross-modal knowledge injection. Extensive domain experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed MIDG achieves superior performance.</description>

      <title>KAN-Dreamer: Benchmarking Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks as Function Approximators in World Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DreamerV3 is a state-of-the-art online model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) algorithm known for remarkable sample efficiency. Concurrently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a promising alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), offering superior parameter efficiency and interpretability. To mitigate KANs' computational overhead, variants like FastKAN leverage Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) to accelerate inference. In this work, we investigate integrating KAN architectures into the DreamerV3 framework. We introduce KAN-Dreamer, replacing specific MLP and convolutional components of DreamerV3 with KAN and FastKAN layers. To ensure efficiency within the JAX-based World Model, we implement a tailored, fully vectorized version with simplified grid management. We structure our investigation into three subsystems: Visual Perception, Latent Prediction, and Behavior Learning. Empirical evaluations on the DeepMind Control Suite (walker_walk) analyze sample efficiency, training time, and asymptotic performance. Experimental results demonstrate that utilizing our adapted FastKAN as a drop-in replacement for the Reward and Continue predictors yields performance on par with the original MLP-based architecture, maintaining parity in both sample efficiency and training speed. This report serves as a preliminary study for future developments in KAN-based world models.</description>

      <title>Forget and Explain: Transparent Verification of GNN Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly used to model complex patterns in graph-structured data. However, enabling them to "forget" designated information remains challenging, especially under privacy regulations such as the GDPR. Existing unlearning methods largely optimize for efficiency and scalability, yet they offer little transparency, and the black-box nature of GNNs makes it difficult to verify whether forgetting has truly occurred. We propose an explainability-driven verifier for GNN unlearning that snapshots the model before and after deletion, using attribution shifts and localized structural changes (for example, graph edit distance) as transparent evidence. The verifier uses five explainability metrics: residual attribution, heatmap shift, explainability score deviation, graph edit distance, and a diagnostic graph rule shift. We evaluate two backbones (GCN, GAT) and four unlearning strategies (Retrain, GraphEditor, GNNDelete, IDEA) across five benchmarks (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, Coauthor-CS, Coauthor-Physics). Results show that Retrain and GNNDelete achieve near-complete forgetting, GraphEditor provides partial erasure, and IDEA leaves residual signals. These explanation deltas provide the primary, human-readable evidence of forgetting; we also report membership-inference ROC-AUC as a complementary, graph-wide privacy signal.</description>

      <title>Social welfare optimisation in well-mixed and structured populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on promoting cooperation among autonomous, self-regarding agents has often focused on the bi-objective optimisation problem: minimising the total incentive cost while maximising the frequency of cooperation. However, the optimal value of social welfare under such constraints remains largely unexplored. In this work, we hypothesise that achieving maximal social welfare is not guaranteed at the minimal incentive cost required to drive agents to a desired cooperative state. To address this gap, we adopt to a single-objective approach focused on maximising social welfare, building upon foundational evolutionary game theory models that examined cost efficiency in finite populations, in both well-mixed and structured population settings. Our analytical model and agent-based simulations show how different interference strategies, including rewarding local versus global behavioural patterns, affect social welfare and dynamics of cooperation. Our results reveal a significant gap in the per-individual incentive cost between optimising for pure cost efficiency or cooperation frequency and optimising for maximal social welfare. Overall, our findings indicate that incentive design, policy, and benchmarking in multi-agent systems and human societies should prioritise welfare-centric objectives over proxy targets of cost or cooperation frequency.</description>

      <title>Persian-Phi: Efficient Cross-Lingual Adaptation of Compact LLMs via Curriculum Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The democratization of AI is currently hindered by the immense computational costs required to train Large Language Models (LLMs) for low-resource languages. This paper presents Persian-Phi, a 3.8B parameter model that challenges the assumption that robust multilingual capabilities require massive model sizes or multilingual baselines. We demonstrate how Microsoft Phi-3 Mini -- originally a monolingual English model -- can be effectively adapted to Persian through a novel, resource-efficient curriculum learning pipeline. Our approach employs a unique "warm-up" stage using bilingual narratives (Tiny Stories) to align embeddings prior to heavy training, followed by continual pretraining and instruction tuning via Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). Despite its compact size, Persian-Phi achieves competitive results on Open Persian LLM Leaderboard in HuggingFace. Our findings provide a validated, scalable framework for extending the reach of state-of-the-art LLMs to underrepresented languages with minimal hardware resources. The Persian-Phi model is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/amirakhlaghiqqq/PersianPhi.</description>

      <title>Understanding LLM Agent Behaviours via Game Theory: Strategy Recognition, Biases and Multi-Agent Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly operate as autonomous decision-makers in interactive and multi-agent systems and human societies, understanding their strategic behaviour has profound implications for safety, coordination, and the design of AI-driven social and economic infrastructures. Assessing such behaviour requires methods that capture not only what LLMs output, but the underlying intentions that guide their decisions. In this work, we extend the FAIRGAME framework to systematically evaluate LLM behaviour in repeated social dilemmas through two complementary advances: a payoff-scaled Prisoners Dilemma isolating sensitivity to incentive magnitude, and an integrated multi-agent Public Goods Game with dynamic payoffs and multi-agent histories. These environments reveal consistent behavioural signatures across models and languages, including incentive-sensitive cooperation, cross-linguistic divergence and end-game alignment toward defection. To interpret these patterns, we train traditional supervised classification models on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to FAIRGAME trajectories, showing that LLMs exhibit systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioural intentions, with linguistic framing at times exerting effects as strong as architectural differences. Together, these findings provide a unified methodological foundation for auditing LLMs as strategic agents and reveal systematic cooperation biases with direct implications for AI governance, collective decision-making, and the design of safe multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>From Real-World Traffic Data to Relevant Critical Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reliable operation of autonomous vehicles, automated driving functions, and advanced driver assistance systems across a wide range of relevant scenarios is critical for their development and deployment. Identifying a near-complete set of relevant driving scenarios for such functionalities is challenging due to numerous degrees of freedom involved, each affecting the outcomes of the driving scenario differently. Moreover, with increasing technical complexity of new functionalities, the number of potentially relevant, particularly "unknown unsafe" scenarios is increasing. To enhance validation efficiency, it is essential to identify relevant scenarios in advance, starting with simpler domains like highways before moving to more complex environments such as urban traffic. To address this, this paper focuses on analyzing lane change scenarios in highway traffic, which involve multiple degrees of freedom and present numerous safetyrelevant scenarios. We describe the process of data acquisition and processing of real-world data from public highway traffic, followed by the application of criticality measures on trajectory data to evaluate scenarios, as conducted within the AVEAS project (www.aveas.org). By linking the calculated measures to specific lane change driving scenarios and the conditions under which the data was collected, we facilitate the identification of safetyrelevant driving scenarios for various applications. Further, to tackle the extensive range of "unknown unsafe" scenarios, we propose a way to generate relevant scenarios by creating synthetic scenarios based on recorded ones. Consequently, we demonstrate and evaluate a processing chain that enables the identification of safety-relevant scenarios, the development of data-driven methods for extracting these scenarios, and the generation of synthetic critical scenarios via sampling on highways.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence and Nuclear Weapons Proliferation: The Technological Arms Race for (In)visibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A robust nonproliferation regime has contained the spread of nuclear weapons to just nine states. Yet, emerging and disruptive technologies are reshaping the landscape of nuclear risks, presenting a critical juncture for decision makers. This article lays out the contours of an overlooked but intensifying technological arms race for nuclear (in)visibility, driven by the interplay between proliferation-enabling technologies (PETs) and detection-enhancing technologies (DETs). We argue that the strategic pattern of proliferation will be increasingly shaped by the innovation pace in these domains. Artificial intelligence (AI) introduces unprecedented complexity to this equation, as its rapid scaling and knowledge substitution capabilities accelerate PET development and challenge traditional monitoring and verification methods. To analyze this dynamic, we develop a formal model centered on a Relative Advantage Index (RAI), quantifying the shifting balance between PETs and DETs. Our model explores how asymmetric technological advancement, particularly logistic AI-driven PET growth versus stepwise DET improvements, expands the band of uncertainty surrounding proliferation detectability. Through replicable scenario-based simulations, we evaluate the impact of varying PET growth rates and DET investment strategies on cumulative nuclear breakout risk. We identify a strategic fork ahead, where detection may no longer suffice without broader PET governance. Governments and international organizations should accordingly invest in policies and tools agile enough to keep pace with tomorrow's technology.</description>

      <title>AutoICE: Automatically Synthesizing Verifiable C Code via LLM-driven Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatically synthesizing verifiable code from natural language requirements ensures software correctness and reliability while significantly lowering the barrier to adopting the techniques of formal methods. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), long-standing efforts at autoformalization have gained new momentum. However, existing approaches suffer from severe syntactic and semantic errors due to the scarcity of domain-specific pre-training corpora and often fail to formalize implicit knowledge effectively. In this paper, we propose AutoICE, an LLM-driven evolutionary search for synthesizing verifiable C code. It introduces the diverse individual initialization and the collaborative crossover to enable diverse iterative updates, thereby mitigating error propagation inherent in single-agent iterations. Besides, it employs the self-reflective mutation to facilitate the discovery of implicit knowledge. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoICE: it successfully verifies $90.36$\% of code, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach. Besides, on a developer-friendly dataset variant, AutoICE achieves a $88.33$\% verification success rate, significantly surpassing the $65$\% success rate of the SOTA approach.</description>

      <title>Exploring possible vector systems for faster training of neural networks with preconfigured latent spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The overall neural network (NN) performance is closely related to the properties of its embedding distribution in latent space (LS). It has recently been shown that predefined vector systems, specifically An root system vectors, can be used as targets for latent space configurations (LSC) to ensure the desired LS structure. One of the main LSC advantage is the possibility of training classifier NNs without classification layers, which facilitates training NNs on datasets with extremely large numbers of classes. This paper provides a more general overview of possible vector systems for NN training along with their properties and methods for vector system construction. These systems are used to configure LS of encoders and visual transformers to significantly speed up ImageNet-1K and 50k-600k classes LSC training. It is also shown that using the minimum number of LS dimensions for a specific number of classes results in faster convergence. The latter has potential advantages for reducing the size of vector databases used to store NN embeddings.</description>

      <title>SPAD: Seven-Source Token Probability Attribution with Syntactic Aggregation for Detecting Hallucinations in RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) remains a challenge. Prior approaches attribute hallucinations to a binary conflict between internal knowledge (stored in FFNs) and retrieved context. However, this perspective is incomplete, failing to account for the impact of other components in the generative process, such as the user query, previously generated tokens, the current token itself, and the final LayerNorm adjustment. To address this, we introduce SPAD. First, we mathematically attribute each token's probability into seven distinct sources: Query, RAG, Past, Current Token, FFN, Final LayerNorm, and Initial Embedding. This attribution quantifies how each source contributes to the generation of the current token. Then, we aggregate these scores by POS tags to quantify how different components drive specific linguistic categories. By identifying anomalies, such as Nouns relying on Final LayerNorm, SPAD effectively detects hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPAD achieves state-of-the-art performance</description>

      <title>LIME: Making LLM Data More Efficient with Linguistic Metadata Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-training decoder-only language models relies on vast amounts of high-quality data, yet the availability of such data is increasingly reaching its limits. While metadata is commonly used to create and curate these datasets, its potential as a direct training signal remains under-explored. We challenge this status quo and propose LIME (Linguistic Metadata Embeddings), a method that enriches token embeddings with metadata capturing syntax, semantics, and contextual properties. LIME substantially improves pre-training efficiency. Specifically, it adapts up to 56% faster to the training data distribution, while introducing only 0.01% additional parameters at negligible compute overhead. Beyond efficiency, LIME improves tokenization, leading to remarkably stronger language modeling capabilities and generative task performance. These benefits persist across model scales (500M to 2B). In addition, we develop a variant with shifted metadata, LIME+1, that can guide token generation. Given prior metadata for the next token, LIME+1 improves reasoning performance by up to 38% and arithmetic accuracy by up to 35%.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Under Confounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate model-based reinforcement learning in contextual Markov decision processes (C-MDPs) in which the context is unobserved and induces confounding in the offline dataset. In such settings, conventional model-learning methods are fundamentally inconsistent, as the transition and reward mechanisms generated under a behavioral policy do not correspond to the interventional quantities required for evaluating a state-based policy. To address this issue, we adapt a proximal off-policy evaluation approach that identifies the confounded reward expectation using only observable state-action-reward trajectories under mild invertibility conditions on proxy variables. When combined with a behavior-averaged transition model, this construction yields a surrogate MDP whose Bellman operator is well defined and consistent for state-based policies, and which integrates seamlessly with the maximum causal entropy (MaxCausalEnt) model-learning framework. The proposed formulation enables principled model learning and planning in confounded environments where contextual information is unobserved, unavailable, or impractical to collect.</description>

      <title>VulnLLM-R: Specialized Reasoning LLM with Agent Scaffold for Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose VulnLLM-R, the~\emph{first specialized reasoning LLM} for vulnerability detection. Our key insight is that LLMs can reason about program states and analyze the potential vulnerabilities, rather than simple pattern matching. This can improve the model's generalizability and prevent learning shortcuts. However, SOTA reasoning LLMs are typically ultra-large, closed-source, or have limited performance in vulnerability detection. To address this, we propose a novel training recipe with specialized data selection, reasoning data generation, reasoning data filtering and correction, and testing-phase optimization. Using our proposed methodology, we train a reasoning model with seven billion parameters. Through extensive experiments on SOTA datasets across Python, C/C++, and Java, we show that VulnLLM-R has superior effectiveness and efficiency than SOTA static analysis tools and both open-source and commercial large reasoning models. We further conduct a detailed ablation study to validate the key designs in our training recipe. Finally, we construct an agent scaffold around our model and show that it outperforms CodeQL and AFL++ in real-world projects. Our agent further discovers a set of zero-day vulnerabilities in actively maintained repositories. This work represents a pioneering effort to enable real-world, project-level vulnerability detection using AI agents powered by specialized reasoning models. The code is available at~\href{https://github.com/ucsb-mlsec/VulnLLM-R}{github}.</description>

      <title>Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding for Error Span Detection in Reference-Free Automatic Machine Translation Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Error Span Detection (ESD) is a subtask of automatic machine translation evaluation that localizes error spans in translations and labels their severity. State-of-the-art generative ESD methods typically decode using Maximum a Posteriori (MAP), assuming that model-estimated probabilities are perfectly correlated with similarity to human annotation. However, we observed that annotations dissimilar to the human annotation could achieve a higher model likelihood than the human annotation. We address this issue by applying Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding to generative ESD models. Specifically, we employ sentence- and span-level similarity metrics as utility functions to select candidate hypotheses based on their approximate similarity to the human annotation. Extensive experimental results show that our MBR decoding outperforms the MAP baseline at the system, sentence, and span-levels. Furthermore, to mitigate the computational cost of MBR decoding, we demonstrate that applying MBR distillation enables a standard greedy model to match MBR decoding performance, effectively eliminating the inference-time latency bottleneck.</description>

      <title>MoCoRP: Modeling Consistent Relations between Persona and Response for Persona-based Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As dialogue systems become increasingly important across various domains, a key challenge in persona-based dialogue is generating engaging and context-specific interactions while ensuring the model acts with a coherent personality. However, existing persona-based dialogue datasets lack explicit relations between persona sentences and responses, which makes it difficult for models to effectively capture persona information. To address these issues, we propose MoCoRP (Modeling Consistent Relations between Persona and Response), a framework that incorporates explicit relations into language models. MoCoRP leverages an NLI expert to explicitly extract the NLI relations between persona sentences and responses, enabling the model to effectively incorporate appropriate persona information from the context into its responses. We applied this framework to pre-trained models like BART and further extended it to modern large language models (LLMs) through alignment tuning. Experimental results on the public datasets ConvAI2 and MPChat demonstrate that MoCoRP outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior persona consistency and engaging, context-aware dialogue generation. Furthermore, our model not only excels in quantitative metrics but also shows significant improvements in qualitative aspects. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly modeling persona-response relations in persona-based dialogue. The source codes of MoCoRP are available at https://github.com/DMCB-GIST/MoCoRP.</description>

      <title>Toward More Reliable Artificial Intelligence: Reducing Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) frequently generate hallucinated content plausible but incorrect claims about image content. We propose a training-free self-correction framework enabling VLMs to iteratively refine responses through uncertainty-guided visual re-attention. Our method combines multidimensional uncertainty quantification (token entropy, attention dispersion, semantic consistency, claim confidence) with attention-guided cropping of under-explored regions. Operating entirely with frozen, pretrained VLMs, our framework requires no gradient updates. We validate our approach on the POPE and MMHAL BENCH benchmarks using the Qwen2.5-VL-7B [23] architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces hallucination rates by 9.8 percentage points compared to the baseline, while improving object existence accuracy by 4.7 points on adversarial splits. Furthermore, qualitative analysis confirms that uncertainty-guided re-attention successfully grounds corrections in visual evidence where standard decoding fails. We validate our approach on Qwen2.5-VL-7B [23], with plans to extend validation across diverse architectures in future versions. We release our code and methodology to facilitate future research in trustworthy multimodal systems.</description>

      <title>Dual-Stream Cross-Modal Representation Learning via Residual Semantic Decorrelation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-modal learning has become a fundamental paradigm for integrating heterogeneous information sources such as images, text, and structured attributes. However, multimodal representations often suffer from modality dominance, redundant information coupling, and spurious cross-modal correlations, leading to suboptimal generalization and limited interpretability. In particular, high-variance modalities tend to overshadow weaker but semantically important signals, while na\"ive fusion strategies entangle modality-shared and modality-specific factors in an uncontrolled manner. This makes it difficult to understand which modality actually drives a prediction and to maintain robustness when some modalities are noisy or missing. To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-Stream Residual Semantic Decorrelation Network (DSRSD-Net), a simple yet effective framework that disentangles modality-specific and modality-shared information through residual decomposition and explicit semantic decorrelation constraints. DSRSD-Net introduces: (1) a dual-stream representation learning module that separates intra-modal (private) and inter-modal (shared) latent factors via residual projection; (2) a residual semantic alignment head that maps shared factors from different modalities into a common space using a combination of contrastive and regression-style objectives; and (3) a decorrelation and orthogonality loss that regularizes the covariance structure of the shared space while enforcing orthogonality between shared and private streams, thereby suppressing cross-modal redundancy and preventing feature collapse. Experimental results on two large-scale educational benchmarks demonstrate that DSRSD-Net consistently improves next-step prediction and final outcome prediction over strong single-modality, early-fusion, late-fusion, and co-attention baselines.</description>

      <title>Weighted Contrastive Learning for Anomaly-Aware Time-Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable forecasting of multivariate time series under anomalous conditions is crucial in applications such as ATM cash logistics, where sudden demand shifts can disrupt operations. Modern deep forecasters achieve high accuracy on normal data but often fail when distribution shifts occur. We propose Weighted Contrastive Adaptation (WECA), a Weighted contrastive objective that aligns normal and anomaly-augmented representations, preserving anomaly-relevant information while maintaining consistency under benign variations. Evaluations on a nationwide ATM transaction dataset with domain-informed anomaly injection show that WECA improves SMAPE on anomaly-affected data by 6.1 percentage points compared to a normally trained baseline, with negligible degradation on normal data. These results demonstrate that WECA enhances forecasting reliability under anomalies without sacrificing performance during regular operations.</description>

      <title>R2MF-Net: A Recurrent Residual Multi-Path Fusion Network for Robust Multi-directional Spine X-ray Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of spinal structures in X-ray images is a prerequisite for quantitative scoliosis assessment, including Cobb angle measurement, vertebral translation estimation and curvature classification. In routine practice, clinicians acquire coronal, left-bending and right-bending radiographs to jointly evaluate deformity severity and spinal flexibility. However, the segmentation step remains heavily manual, time-consuming and non-reproducible, particularly in low-contrast images and in the presence of rib shadows or overlapping tissues. To address these limitations, this paper proposes R2MF-Net, a recurrent residual multi-path encoder--decoder network tailored for automatic segmentation of multi-directional spine X-ray images. The overall design consists of a coarse segmentation network and a fine segmentation network connected in cascade. Both stages adopt an improved Inception-style multi-branch feature extractor, while a recurrent residual jump connection (R2-Jump) module is inserted into skip paths to gradually align encoder and decoder semantics. A multi-scale cross-stage skip (MC-Skip) mechanism allows the fine network to reuse hierarchical representations from multiple decoder levels of the coarse network, thereby strengthening the stability of segmentation across imaging directions and contrast conditions. Furthermore, a lightweight spatial-channel squeeze-and-excitation block (SCSE-Lite) is employed at the bottleneck to emphasize spine-related activations and suppress irrelevant structures and background noise. We evaluate R2MF-Net on a clinical multi-view radiograph dataset comprising 228 sets of coronal, left-bending and right-bending spine X-ray images with expert annotations.</description>

      <title>Complementary Learning Approach for Text Classification using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a structured methodology that utilizes large language models (LLMs) in a cost-efficient and parsimonious manner, integrating the strengths of scholars and machines while offsetting their respective weaknesses. Our methodology, facilitated through a chain of thought and few-shot learning prompting from computer science, extends best practices for co-author teams in qualitative research to human-machine teams in quantitative research. This allows humans to utilize abductive reasoning and natural language to interrogate not just what the machine has done but also what the human has done. Our method highlights how scholars can manage inherent weaknesses OF LLMs using careful, low-cost techniques. We demonstrate how to use the methodology to interrogate human-machine rating discrepancies for a sample of 1,934 press releases announcing pharmaceutical alliances (1990-2017).</description>

      <title>Metric-Fair Prompting: Treating Similar Samples Similarly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce \emph{Metric-Fair Prompting}, a fairness-aware prompting framework that guides large language models (LLMs) to make decisions under metric-fairness constraints. In the application of multiple-choice medical question answering, each {(question, option)} pair is treated as a binary instance with label $+1$ (correct) or $-1$ (incorrect). To promote {individual fairness}~--~treating similar instances similarly~--~we compute question similarity using NLP embeddings and solve items in \emph{joint pairs of similar questions} rather than in isolation. The prompt enforces a global decision protocol: extract decisive clinical features, map each \((\text{question}, \text{option})\) to a score $f(x)$ that acts as confidence, and impose a Lipschitz-style constraint so that similar inputs receive similar scores and, hence, consistent outputs. Evaluated on the {MedQA (US)} benchmark, Metric-Fair Prompting is shown to improve performance over standard single-item prompting, demonstrating that fairness-guided, confidence-oriented reasoning can enhance LLM accuracy on high-stakes clinical multiple-choice questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has resulted in a significant knowledge gap between the open-source community and industry, primarily because the latter relies on closed-source, high-quality data and training recipes. To address this, we introduce PCMind-2.1-Kaiyuan-2B, a fully open-source 2-billion-parameter model focused on improving training efficiency and effectiveness under resource constraints. Our methodology includes three key innovations: a Quantile Data Benchmarking method for systematically comparing heterogeneous open-source datasets and providing insights on data mixing strategies; a Strategic Selective Repetition scheme within a multi-phase paradigm to effectively leverage sparse, high-quality data; and a Multi-Domain Curriculum Training policy that orders samples by quality. Supported by a highly optimized data preprocessing pipeline and architectural modifications for FP16 stability, Kaiyuan-2B achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art fully open-source models, demonstrating practical and scalable solutions for resource-limited pretraining. We release all assets (including model weights, data, and code) under Apache 2.0 license at https://huggingface.co/thu-pacman/PCMind-2.1-Kaiyuan-2B.</description>

      <title>Time Series Foundation Models for Process Model Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Process Model Forecasting (PMF) aims to predict how the control-flow structure of a process evolves over time by modeling the temporal dynamics of directly-follows (DF) relations, complementing predictive process monitoring that focuses on single-case prefixes. Prior benchmarks show that machine learning and deep learning models provide only modest gains over statistical baselines, mainly due to the sparsity and heterogeneity of the DF time series. We investigate Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), large pre-trained models for generic time series, as an alternative for PMF. Using DF time series derived from real-life event logs, we compare zero-shot use of TSFMs, without additional training, with fine-tuned variants adapted on PMF-specific data. TSFMs generally achieve lower forecasting errors (MAE and RMSE) than traditional and specialized models trained from scratch on the same logs, indicating effective transfer of temporal structure from non-process domains. While fine-tuning can further improve accuracy, the gains are often small and may disappear on smaller or more complex datasets, so zero-shot use remains a strong default. Our study highlights the generalization capability and data efficiency of TSFMs for process-related time series and, to the best of our knowledge, provides the first systematic evaluation of temporal foundation models for PMF.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Structure and Chord Constraints in Symbolic Transformer-based Melodic Harmonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer architectures offer significant advantages regarding the generation of symbolic music; their capabilities for incorporating user preferences toward what they generate is being studied under many aspects. This paper studies the inclusion of predefined chord constraints in melodic harmonization, i.e., where a desired chord at a specific location is provided along with the melody as inputs and the autoregressive transformer model needs to incorporate the chord in the harmonization that it generates. The peculiarities of involving such constraints is discussed and an algorithm is proposed for tackling this task. This algorithm is called B* and it combines aspects of beam search and A* along with backtracking to force pretrained transformers to satisfy the chord constraints, at the correct onset position within the correct bar. The algorithm is brute-force and has exponential complexity in the worst case; however, this paper is a first attempt to highlight the difficulties of the problem and proposes an algorithm that offers many possibilities for improvements since it accommodates the involvement of heuristics.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Theory of Top-$k$ Sparse Attention via Total Variation Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified mathematical framework for certified Top-$k$ attention truncation that quantifies approximation error at both the distribution and output levels. For a single attention distribution $P$ and its Top-$k$ truncation $\hat P$, we show that the total-variation distance coincides with the discarded softmax tail mass and satisfies $\mathrm{TV}(P,\hat P)=1-e^{-\mathrm{KL}(\hat P\Vert P)}$, yielding sharp Top-$k$-specific bounds in place of generic inequalities. From this we derive non-asymptotic deterministic bounds -- from a single boundary gap through multi-gap and blockwise variants -- that control $\mathrm{TV}(P,\hat P)$ using only the ordered logits. Using an exact head-tail decomposition, we prove that the output error factorizes as $\|\mathrm{Attn}(q,K,V)-\mathrm{Attn}_k(q,K,V)\|_2=\tau\|\mu_{\mathrm{tail}}-\mu_{\mathrm{head}}\|_2$ with $\tau=\mathrm{TV}(P,\hat P)$, yielding a new head-tail diameter bound $\|\mathrm{Attn}(q,K,V)-\mathrm{Attn}_k(q,K,V)\|_2\le\tau\,\mathrm{diam}_{H,T}$ and refinements linking the error to $\mathrm{Var}_P(V)$. Under an i.i.d. Gaussian score model $s_i\sim\mathcal N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ we derive closed-form tail masses and an asymptotic rule for the minimal $k_\varepsilon$ ensuring $\mathrm{TV}(P,\hat P)\le\varepsilon$, namely $k_\varepsilon/n\approx\Phi_c(\sigma+\Phi^{-1}(\varepsilon))$. Experiments on bert-base-uncased and synthetic logits confirm the predicted scaling of $k_\varepsilon/n$ and show that certified Top-$k$ can reduce scored keys by 2-4$\times$ on average while meeting the prescribed total-variation budget.</description>

      <title>An AI-Powered Autonomous Underwater System for Sea Exploration and Scientific Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional sea exploration faces significant challenges due to extreme conditions, limited visibility, and high costs, resulting in vast unexplored ocean regions. This paper presents an innovative AI-powered Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) system designed to overcome these limitations by automating underwater object detection, analysis, and reporting. The system integrates YOLOv12 Nano for real-time object detection, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (ResNet50) for feature extraction, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and K-Means++ clustering for grouping marine objects based on visual characteristics. Furthermore, a Large Language Model (LLM) (GPT-4o Mini) is employed to generate structured reports and summaries of underwater findings, enhancing data interpretation. The system was trained and evaluated on a combined dataset of over 55,000 images from the DeepFish and OzFish datasets, capturing diverse Australian marine environments. Experimental results demonstrate the system's capability to detect marine objects with a mAP@0.5 of 0.512, a precision of 0.535, and a recall of 0.438. The integration of PCA effectively reduced feature dimensionality while preserving 98% variance, facilitating K-Means clustering which successfully grouped detected objects based on visual similarities. The LLM integration proved effective in generating insightful summaries of detections and clusters, supported by location data. This integrated approach significantly reduces the risks associated with human diving, increases mission efficiency, and enhances the speed and depth of underwater data analysis, paving the way for more effective scientific research and discovery in challenging marine environments.</description>

      <title>DIST-CLIP: Arbitrary Metadata and Image Guided MRI Harmonization via Disentangled Anatomy-Contrast Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning holds immense promise for transforming medical image analysis, yet its clinical generalization remains profoundly limited. A major barrier is data heterogeneity. This is particularly true in Magnetic Resonance Imaging, where scanner hardware differences, diverse acquisition protocols, and varying sequence parameters introduce substantial domain shifts that obscure underlying biological signals. Data harmonization methods aim to reduce these instrumental and acquisition variability, but existing approaches remain insufficient. When applied to imaging data, image-based harmonization approaches are often restricted by the need for target images, while existing text-guided methods rely on simplistic labels that fail to capture complex acquisition details or are typically restricted to datasets with limited variability, failing to capture the heterogeneity of real-world clinical environments. To address these limitations, we propose DIST-CLIP (Disentangled Style Transfer with CLIP Guidance), a unified framework for MRI harmonization that flexibly uses either target images or DICOM metadata for guidance. Our framework explicitly disentangles anatomical content from image contrast, with the contrast representations being extracted using pre-trained CLIP encoders. These contrast embeddings are then integrated into the anatomical content via a novel Adaptive Style Transfer module. We trained and evaluated DIST-CLIP on diverse real-world clinical datasets, and showed significant improvements in performance when compared against state-of-the-art methods in both style translation fidelity and anatomical preservation, offering a flexible solution for style transfer and standardizing MRI data. Our code and weights will be made publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>When Large Language Models Do Not Work: Online Incivility Prediction through Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online incivility has emerged as a widespread and persistent problem in digital communities, imposing substantial social and psychological burdens on users. Although many platforms attempt to curb incivility through moderation and automated detection, the performance of existing approaches often remains limited in both accuracy and efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for detecting three types of uncivil behavior (i.e., toxicity, aggression, and personal attacks) within the English Wikipedia community. Our model represents each user comment as a node, with textual similarity between comments defining the edges, allowing the network to jointly learn from both linguistic content and relational structures among comments. We also introduce a dynamically adjusted attention mechanism that adaptively balances nodal and topological features during information aggregation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposed architecture outperforms 12 state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple metrics while requiring significantly lower inference cost. These findings highlight the crucial role of structural context in detecting online incivility and address the limitations of text-only LLM paradigms in behavioral prediction. All datasets and comparative outputs will be publicly available in our repository to support further research and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Guiding What Not to Generate: Automated Negative Prompting for Text-Image Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite substantial progress in text-to-image generation, achieving precise text-image alignment remains challenging, particularly for prompts with rich compositional structure or imaginative elements. To address this, we introduce Negative Prompting for Image Correction (NPC), an automated pipeline that improves alignment by identifying and applying negative prompts that suppress unintended content. We begin by analyzing cross-attention patterns to explain why both targeted negatives-those directly tied to the prompt's alignment error-and untargeted negatives-tokens unrelated to the prompt but present in the generated image-can enhance alignment. To discover useful negatives, NPC generates candidate prompts using a verifier-captioner-proposer framework and ranks them with a salient text-space score, enabling effective selection without requiring additional image synthesis. On GenEval++ and Imagine-Bench, NPC outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.571 vs. 0.371 on GenEval++ and the best overall performance on Imagine-Bench. By guiding what not to generate, NPC provides a principled, fully automated route to stronger text-image alignment in diffusion models. Code is released at https://github.com/wiarae/NPC.</description>

      <title>In-Context and Few-Shots Learning for Forecasting Time Series Data based on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing data-driven approaches in modeling and predicting time series data include ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), Transformer-based models, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network). These approaches, and in particular deep learning-based models such as LSTM and TCN, have shown great results in predicting time series data. With the advancement of leveraging pre-trained foundation models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and more notably Google's recent foundation model for time series data, {\it TimesFM} (Time Series Foundation Model), it is of interest to investigate whether these foundation models have the capability of outperforming existing modeling approaches in analyzing and predicting time series data.
  This paper investigates the performance of using LLM models for time series data prediction. We investigate the in-context learning methodology in the training of LLM models that are specific to the underlying application domain. More specifically, the paper explores training LLMs through in-context, zero-shot and few-shot learning and forecasting time series data with OpenAI {\tt o4-mini} and Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite, as well as the recent Google's Transformer-based TimesFM, a time series-specific foundation model, along with two deep learning models, namely TCN and LSTM networks. The findings indicate that TimesFM has the best overall performance with the lowest RMSE value (0.3023) and the competitive inference time (266 seconds). Furthermore, OpenAI's o4-mini also exhibits a good performance based on Zero Shot learning.
  These findings highlight pre-trained time series foundation models as a promising direction for real-time forecasting, enabling accurate and scalable deployment with minimal model adaptation.</description>

      <title>Enabling Delayed-Full Charging Through Transformer-Based Real-Time-to-Departure Modeling for EV Battery Longevity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) are key to sustainable mobility, yet their lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) degrade more rapidly under prolonged high states of charge (SOC). This can be mitigated by delaying full charging \ours until just before departure, which requires accurate prediction of user departure times. In this work, we propose Transformer-based real-time-to-event (TTE) model for accurate EV departure prediction. Our approach represents each day as a TTE sequence by discretizing time into grid-based tokens. Unlike previous methods primarily dependent on temporal dependency from historical patterns, our method leverages streaming contextual information to predict departures. Evaluation on a real-world study involving 93 users and passive smartphone data demonstrates that our method effectively captures irregular departure patterns within individual routines, outperforming baseline models. These results highlight the potential for practical deployment of the \ours algorithm and its contribution to sustainable transportation systems.</description>

      <title>The Native Spiking Microarchitecture: From Iontronic Primitives to Bit-Exact FP8 Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2025 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and recent breakthroughs by Huanting Wang's team at Monash University establish angstrom-scale channels as promising post-silicon substrates with native integrate-and-fire (IF) dynamics. However, utilizing these stochastic, analog materials for deterministic, bit-exact AI workloads (e.g., FP8) remains a paradox. Existing neuromorphic methods often settle for approximation, failing Transformer precision standards. To traverse the gap "from stochastic ions to deterministic floats," we propose a Native Spiking Microarchitecture. Treating noisy neurons as logic primitives, we introduce a Spatial Combinational Pipeline and a Sticky-Extra Correction mechanism. Validation across all 16,129 FP8 pairs confirms 100% bit-exact alignment with PyTorch. Crucially, our architecture reduces Linear layer latency to O(log N), yielding a 17x speedup. Physical simulations further demonstrate robustness against extreme membrane leakage (beta approx 0.01), effectively immunizing the system against the stochastic nature of the hardware.</description>

      <title>Improving action classification with brain-inspired deep networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Action recognition is also key for applications ranging from robotics to healthcare monitoring. Action information can be extracted from the body pose and movements, as well as from the background scene. However, the extent to which deep neural networks (DNNs) make use of information about the body and information about the background remains unclear. Since these two sources of information may be correlated within a training dataset, DNNs might learn to rely predominantly on one of them, without taking full advantage of the other. Unlike DNNs, humans have domain-specific brain regions selective for perceiving bodies, and regions selective for perceiving scenes. The present work tests whether humans are thus more effective at extracting information from both body and background, and whether building brain-inspired deep network architectures with separate domain-specific streams for body and scene perception endows them with more human-like performance. We first demonstrate that DNNs trained using the HAA500 dataset perform almost as accurately on versions of the stimuli that show both body and background and on versions of the stimuli from which the body was removed, but are at chance-level for versions of the stimuli from which the background was removed. Conversely, human participants (N=28) can recognize the same set of actions accurately with all three versions of the stimuli, and perform significantly better on stimuli that show only the body than on stimuli that show only the background. Finally, we implement and test a novel architecture patterned after domain specificity in the brain with separate streams to process body and background information. We show that 1) this architecture improves action recognition performance, and 2) its accuracy across different versions of the stimuli follows a pattern that matches more closely the pattern of accuracy observed in human participants.</description>

      <title>SAVE: Sparse Autoencoder-Driven Visual Information Enhancement for Mitigating Object Hallucination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced substantially, they remain vulnerable to object hallucination caused by language priors and visual information loss. To address this, we propose SAVE (Sparse Autoencoder-Driven Visual Information Enhancement), a framework that mitigates hallucination by steering the model along Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) latent features. A binary object-presence question-answering probe identifies the SAE features most indicative of the model's visual information processing, referred to as visual understanding features. Steering the model along these identified features reinforces grounded visual understanding and effectively reduces hallucination. With its simple design, SAVE outperforms state-of-the-art training-free methods on standard benchmarks, achieving a 10\%p improvement in CHAIR\_S and consistent gains on POPE and MMHal-Bench. Extensive evaluations across multiple models and layers confirm the robustness and generalizability of our approach. Further analysis reveals that steering along visual understanding features suppresses the generation of uncertain object tokens and increases attention to image tokens, mitigating hallucination. Code is released at https://github.com/wiarae/SAVE.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Causal Sensemaking: Closing the Complementarity Gap in Human-AI Decision Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07801v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed for expert decision support, yet human-AI teams in high-stakes settings do not yet reliably outperform the best individual. We argue this complementarity gap reflects a fundamental mismatch: current agents are trained as answer engines, not as partners in the collaborative sensemaking through which experts actually make decisions. Sensemaking (the ability to co-construct causal explanations, surface uncertainties, and adapt goals) is the key capability that current training pipelines do not explicitly develop or evaluate. We propose Collaborative Causal Sensemaking (CCS) as a research agenda to develop this capability from the ground up, spanning new training environments that reward collaborative thinking, representations for shared human-AI mental models, and evaluation centred on trust and complementarity. These directions can advance MAS research toward agents that think with their human partners rather than for them.</description>

      <title>Group Representational Position Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present GRAPE (Group RepresentAtional Position Encoding), a unified framework for positional encoding based on group actions. GRAPE brings together two families of mechanisms: (i) multiplicative rotations (Multiplicative GRAPE) in $\mathrm{SO}(d)$ and (ii) additive logit biases (Additive GRAPE) arising from unipotent actions in the general linear group $\mathrm{GL}$. In Multiplicative GRAPE, a position $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ (or $t \in \mathbb{R}$) acts as $\mathbf{G}(n)=\exp(n\,\omega\,\mathbf{L})$ with a rank-2 skew generator $\mathbf{L} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$, yielding a relative, compositional, norm-preserving map with a closed-form matrix exponential. RoPE is recovered exactly when the $d/2$ planes are the canonical coordinate pairs with log-uniform spectrum. Learned commuting subspaces and compact non-commuting mixtures strictly extend this geometry to capture cross-subspace feature coupling at $O(d)$ and $O(r d)$ cost per head, respectively. In Additive GRAPE, additive logits arise as rank-1 (or low-rank) unipotent actions, recovering ALiBi and the Forgetting Transformer (FoX) as exact special cases while preserving an exact relative law and streaming cacheability. Altogether, GRAPE supplies a principled design space for positional geometry in long-context models, subsuming RoPE and ALiBi as special cases.

      <title>Understanding Privacy Risks in Code Models Through Training Dynamics: A Causal Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07814v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models for code (LLM4Code) have greatly improved developer productivity but also raise privacy concerns due to their reliance on open-source repositories containing abundant personally identifiable information (PII). Prior work shows that commercial models can reproduce sensitive PII, yet existing studies largely treat PII as a single category and overlook the heterogeneous risks among different types. We investigate whether distinct PII types vary in their likelihood of being learned and leaked by LLM4Code, and whether this relationship is causal. Our methodology includes building a dataset with diverse PII types, fine-tuning representative models of different scales, computing training dynamics on real PII data, and formulating a structural causal model to estimate the causal effect of learnability on leakage. Results show that leakage risks differ substantially across PII types and correlate with their training dynamics: easy-to-learn instances such as IP addresses exhibit higher leakage, while harder types such as keys and passwords leak less frequently. Ambiguous types show mixed behaviors. This work provides the first causal evidence that leakage risks are type-dependent and offers guidance for developing type-aware and learnability-aware defenses for LLM4Code.</description>

      <title>Provable Long-Range Benefits of Next-Token Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Why do modern language models, trained to do well on next-word prediction, appear to generate coherent documents and capture long-range structure? Here we show that next-token prediction is provably powerful for learning longer-range structure, even with common neural network architectures. Specifically, we prove that optimizing next-token prediction over a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) yields a model that closely approximates the training distribution: for held-out documents sampled from the training distribution, no algorithm of bounded description length limited to examining the next $k$ tokens, for any $k$, can distinguish between $k$ consecutive tokens of such documents and $k$ tokens generated by the learned language model following the same prefix. We provide polynomial bounds (in $k$, independent of the document length) on the model size needed to achieve such $k$-token indistinguishability, offering a complexity-theoretic explanation for the long-range coherence observed in practice.</description>

      <title>WorldReel: 4D Video Generation with Consistent Geometry and Motion Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent video generators achieve striking photorealism, yet remain fundamentally inconsistent in 3D. We present WorldReel, a 4D video generator that is natively spatio-temporally consistent. WorldReel jointly produces RGB frames together with 4D scene representations, including pointmaps, camera trajectory, and dense flow mapping, enabling coherent geometry and appearance modeling over time. Our explicit 4D representation enforces a single underlying scene that persists across viewpoints and dynamic content, yielding videos that remain consistent even under large non-rigid motion and significant camera movement. We train WorldReel by carefully combining synthetic and real data: synthetic data providing precise 4D supervision (geometry, motion, and camera), while real videos contribute visual diversity and realism. This blend allows WorldReel to generalize to in-the-wild footage while preserving strong geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WorldReel sets a new state-of-the-art for consistent video generation with dynamic scenes and moving cameras, improving metrics of geometric consistency, motion coherence, and reducing view-time artifacts over competing methods. We believe that WorldReel brings video generation closer to 4D-consistent world modeling, where agents can render, interact, and reason about scenes through a single and stable spatiotemporal representation.</description>

      <title>One Layer Is Enough: Adapting Pretrained Visual Encoders for Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual generative models (e.g., diffusion models) typically operate in compressed latent spaces to balance training efficiency and sample quality. In parallel, there has been growing interest in leveraging high-quality pre-trained visual representations, either by aligning them inside VAEs or directly within the generative model. However, adapting such representations remains challenging due to fundamental mismatches between understanding-oriented features and generation-friendly latent spaces. Representation encoders benefit from high-dimensional latents that capture diverse hypotheses for masked regions, whereas generative models favor low-dimensional latents that must faithfully preserve injected noise. This discrepancy has led prior work to rely on complex objectives and architectures. In this work, we propose FAE (Feature Auto-Encoder), a simple yet effective framework that adapts pre-trained visual representations into low-dimensional latents suitable for generation using as little as a single attention layer, while retaining sufficient information for both reconstruction and understanding. The key is to couple two separate deep decoders: one trained to reconstruct the original feature space, and a second that takes the reconstructed features as input for image generation. FAE is generic; it can be instantiated with a variety of self-supervised encoders (e.g., DINO, SigLIP) and plugged into two distinct generative families: diffusion models and normalizing flows. Across class-conditional and text-to-image benchmarks, FAE achieves strong performance. For example, on ImageNet 256x256, our diffusion model with CFG attains a near state-of-the-art FID of 1.29 (800 epochs) and 1.70 (80 epochs). Without CFG, FAE reaches the state-of-the-art FID of 1.48 (800 epochs) and 2.08 (80 epochs), demonstrating both high quality and fast learning.</description>

      <title>Relational Visual Similarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans do not just see attribute similarity -- we also see relational similarity. An apple is like a peach because both are reddish fruit, but the Earth is also like a peach: its crust, mantle, and core correspond to the peach's skin, flesh, and pit. This ability to perceive and recognize relational similarity, is arguable by cognitive scientist to be what distinguishes humans from other species. Yet, all widely used visual similarity metrics today (e.g., LPIPS, CLIP, DINO) focus solely on perceptual attribute similarity and fail to capture the rich, often surprising relational similarities that humans perceive. How can we go beyond the visible content of an image to capture its relational properties? How can we bring images with the same relational logic closer together in representation space? To answer these questions, we first formulate relational image similarity as a measurable problem: two images are relationally similar when their internal relations or functions among visual elements correspond, even if their visual attributes differ. We then curate 114k image-caption dataset in which the captions are anonymized -- describing the underlying relational logic of the scene rather than its surface content. Using this dataset, we finetune a Vision-Language model to measure the relational similarity between images. This model serves as the first step toward connecting images by their underlying relational structure rather than their visible appearance. Our study shows that while relational similarity has a lot of real-world applications, existing image similarity models fail to capture it -- revealing a critical gap in visual computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16001v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human intelligence, the most evident and accessible form of source of reasoning, hosted by biological hardware, has evolved and been refined over thousands of years, positioning itself today to create new artificial forms and preparing to self--design their evolutionary path forward. Beginning with the advent of foundation models, the rate at which human and artificial intelligence interact with each other has exceeded any anticipated quantitative figures. The close engagement led both bits of intelligence to be impacted in various ways, which naturally resulted in complex confluences that warrant close scrutiny. Recent advances, such as DeepSeek, exemplify this interplay: the novel contributions, we argue, draw indirect inspiration from biological principles like modular neural specialization and sparse episodic encoding, addressing computational bottlenecks while aligning with human-inspired scalability. In the sequel, using a novel taxonomy, we shall explore this interplay between human and machine intelligence, focusing on the crucial role humans play in developing ethical, responsible, and robust intelligent systems. We briefly delve into various aspects of implementation inspired by the mechanisms underlying neuroscience and human cognition. In addition, we propose future perspectives, capitalizing on the advantages of symbiotic designs to suggest a human-centered direction for next-generation developments, focusing on the augmentation role of AI. We finalize this evolving document with some thoughts and open questions yet to be addressed by the broader community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11927v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Procedural mistake detection (PMD) is a challenging problem of classifying whether a human user (observed through egocentric video) has successfully executed a task (specified by a procedural text). Despite significant recent efforts, machine performance in the wild remains nonviable, and the reasoning processes underlying this performance are opaque. As such, we extend PMD to require generating visual self-dialog rationales to inform decisions. Given the impressive, mature image understanding capabilities observed in recent vision-and-language models (VLMs), we curate a suitable benchmark dataset for PMD based on individual frames. As our reformulation enables unprecedented transparency, we leverage a natural language inference (NLI) model to formulate two automated metrics for the coherence of generated rationales. We establish baselines for this reframed task, showing that VLMs struggle off-the-shelf, but with some trade-offs, their accuracy, coherence, and efficiency can be improved by incorporating these metrics into common inference and fine-tuning methods. Lastly, our multi-faceted metrics visualize common outcomes, highlighting areas for further improvement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15701v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the advancement of large language models has spurred the development of AI agents to automate tasks, numerous use cases inherently require agents to collaborate with humans due to humans' latent preferences, domain expertise, or the need for control. To facilitate the study of human-agent collaboration, we introduce Collaborative Gym (Co-Gym), an open framework for developing and evaluating collaborative agents that engage in bidirectional communication with humans while interacting with task environments. We describe how the framework enables the implementation of new task environments and coordination between humans and agents through a flexible, non-turn-taking interaction paradigm, along with an evaluation suite that assesses both collaboration outcomes and processes. Our framework provides both a simulated condition with a reliable user simulator and a real-world condition with an interactive web application. Initial benchmark experiments across three representative tasks -- creating travel plans, writing related work sections, and analyzing tabular data -- demonstrate the benefits of human-agent collaboration: The best-performing collaborative agents consistently outperform their fully autonomous counterparts in task performance, achieving win rates of 86% in Travel Planning, 74% in Tabular Analysis, and 66% in Related Work when evaluated by real users. Despite these improvements, our evaluation reveals persistent limitations in current language models and agents, with communication and situational awareness failures observed in 65% and 40% of cases in the real condition, respectively. Released under the permissive MIT license, Co-Gym supports the addition of new task environments and can be used to develop collaborative agent applications, while its evaluation suite enables assessment and improvement of collaborative agents.</description>

Abstract: Efficiently solving Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems in power systems is crucial for operational planning and grid management. There is a growing need for scalable algorithms capable of handling the increasing variability, constraints, and uncertainties in modern power networks while providing accurate and fast solutions. To address this, machine learning techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as promising approaches. This letter introduces PowerGraph-LLM, the first framework explicitly designed for solving OPF problems using Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed approach combines graph and tabular representations of power grids to effectively query LLMs, capturing the complex relationships and constraints in power systems. A new implementation of in-context learning and fine-tuning protocols for LLMs is introduced, tailored specifically for the OPF problem. PowerGraph-LLM demonstrates reliable performances using off-the-shelf LLM.

      <title>Foundation Models Knowledge Distillation For Battery Capacity Degradation Forecast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08151v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of lithium-ion battery capacity degradation is critical for reliable and safe operation, yet remains challenging under distribution shifts across scales and operating regimes. Here we investigate a time-series foundation model, that is, a large pre-trained time-series model for capacity degradation forecasting, and propose a degradation-aware fine-tuning strategy that aligns the model to capacity trajectories while retaining broadly transferable temporal structure. We instantiate this approach by fine-tuning the Timer model on 220,153 cycles of open-source charge-discharge records to obtain Battery-Timer. Using our released CycleLife-SJTUIE dataset, a real-world industrial collection from an energy-storage station with long-horizon cycling, we evaluate capacity generalization from small cells to large-scale storage systems and across varying operating conditions. Battery-Timer consistently outperforms specialized expert models. To address deployment cost, we further introduce knowledge distillation, a teacher-student transfer that compresses the foundation model's behavior into compact expert models. Distillation across several state-of-the-art time-series experts improves multi-condition capacity generalization while substantially reducing computational overhead, indicating a practical path to deployable cross-scale degradation forecasting by combining a foundation model with targeted distillation.</description>

      <title>Is PRM Necessary? Problem-Solving RL Implicitly Induces PRM Capability in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of reasoning capabilities represents a critical frontier in large language models (LLMs) research, where reinforcement learning (RL) and process reward models (PRMs) have emerged as predominant methodological frameworks. Contrary to conventional wisdom, empirical evidence from DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates that pure RL training focused on mathematical problem-solving can progressively enhance reasoning abilities without PRM integration, challenging the perceived necessity of process supervision. In this study, we conduct a systematic investigation of the relationship between RL training and PRM capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that problem-solving proficiency and process supervision capabilities represent complementary dimensions of reasoning that co-evolve synergistically during pure RL training. In particular, current PRMs underperform simple baselines like majority voting when applied to state-of-the-art models such as DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B. To address this limitation, we propose Self-PRM, an introspective framework in which models autonomously evaluate and rerank their generated solutions through self-reward mechanisms. Although Self-PRM consistently improves the accuracy of the benchmark (particularly with larger sample sizes), analysis exposes persistent challenges: The approach exhibits low precision (&lt;10\%) on difficult problems, frequently misclassifying flawed solutions as valid. These analyses underscore the need for continued RL scaling to improve reward alignment and introspective accuracy. Overall, our findings suggest that PRM may not be essential for enhancing complex reasoning, as pure RL not only improves problem-solving skills but also inherently fosters robust PRM capabilities. We hope these findings provide actionable insights for building more reliable and self-aware complex reasoning models.</description>

      <title>Mind The Gap: Quantifying Mechanistic Gaps in Algorithmic Reasoning via Neural Compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to understand how neural networks learn algorithmic reasoning by addressing two questions: How faithful are learned algorithms when they are effective, and why do neural networks fail to learn effective algorithms otherwise? To answer these questions, we use neural compilation, a technique that directly encodes a source algorithm into neural network parameters, enabling the network to compute the algorithm exactly. This enables comparison between compiled and conventionally learned parameters, intermediate vectors, and behaviors. This investigation is crucial for developing neural networks that robustly learn complexalgorithms from data. Our analysis focuses on graph neural networks (GNNs), which are naturally aligned with algorithmic reasoning tasks, specifically our choices of BFS, DFS, and Bellman-Ford, which cover the spectrum of effective, faithful, and ineffective learned algorithms. Commonly, learning algorithmic reasoning is framed as induction over synthetic data, where a parameterized model is trained on inputs, traces, and outputs produced by an underlying ground truth algorithm. In contrast, we introduce a neural compilation method for GNNs, which sets network parameters analytically, bypassing training. Focusing on GNNs leverages their alignment with algorithmic reasoning, extensive algorithmic induction literature, and the novel application of neural compilation to GNNs. Overall, this paper aims to characterize expressability-trainability gaps - a fundamental shortcoming in learning algorithmic reasoning. We hypothesize that inductive learning is most effective for parallel algorithms contained within the computational class \texttt{NC}.</description>

      <title>CoP: Agentic Red-teaming for Large Language Models using Composition of Principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred transformative applications in various domains, ranging from open-source to proprietary LLMs. However, jailbreak attacks, which aim to break safety alignment and user compliance by tricking the target LLMs into answering harmful and risky responses, are becoming an urgent concern. The practice of red-teaming for LLMs is to proactively explore potential risks and error-prone instances before the release of frontier AI technology. This paper proposes an agentic workflow to automate and scale the red-teaming process of LLMs through the Composition-of-Principles (CoP) framework, where human users provide a set of red-teaming principles as instructions to an AI agent to automatically orchestrate effective red-teaming strategies and generate jailbreak prompts. Distinct from existing red-teaming methods, our CoP framework provides a unified and extensible framework to encompass and orchestrate human-provided red-teaming principles to enable the automated discovery of new red-teaming strategies. When tested against leading LLMs, CoP reveals unprecedented safety risks by finding novel jailbreak prompts and improving the best-known single-turn attack success rate by up to 19.0 times.</description>

      <title>Matching Markets Meet LLMs: Algorithmic Reasoning with Ranked Preferences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.</description>

      <title>Chain of Thought Monitorability: A New and Fragile Opportunity for AI Safety</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI systems that "think" in human language offer a unique opportunity for AI safety: we can monitor their chains of thought (CoT) for the intent to misbehave. Like all other known AI oversight methods, CoT monitoring is imperfect and allows some misbehavior to go unnoticed. Nevertheless, it shows promise and we recommend further research into CoT monitorability and investment in CoT monitoring alongside existing safety methods. Because CoT monitorability may be fragile, we recommend that frontier model developers consider the impact of development decisions on CoT monitorability.</description>

      <title>The Endless Tuning. An Artificial Intelligence Design To Avoid Human Replacement and Trace Back Responsibilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14909v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Endless Tuning is a design method for a reliable deployment of artificial intelligence based on a double mirroring process, which pursues both the goals of avoiding human replacement and filling the so-called responsibility gap (Matthias 2004). Originally depicted in (Fabris et al. 2024) and ensuing the relational approach urged therein, it was then actualized in a protocol, implemented in three prototypical applications regarding decision-making processes (respectively: loan granting, pneumonia diagnosis, and art style recognition) and tested with such as many domain experts. Step by step illustrating the protocol, giving insights concretely showing a different voice (Gilligan 1993) in the ethics of artificial intelligence, a philosophical account of technical choices (e.g., a reversed and hermeneutic deployment of XAI algorithms) will be provided in the present study together with the results of the experiments, focusing on user experience rather than statistical accuracy. Even thoroughly employing deep learning models, full control was perceived by the interviewees in the decision-making setting, while it appeared that a bridge can be built between accountability and liability in case of damage.</description>

      <title>Semantic Chain-of-Trust: Autonomous Trust Orchestration for Collaborator Selection via Hypergraph-Aided Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective completion of tasks in collaborative systems hinges on task-specific trust evaluations of potential devices for distributed collaboration. Due to independent operation of devices involved, dynamic evolution of their mutual relationships, and complex situation-related impact on trust evaluation, effectively assessing devices' trust for collaborator selection is challenging. To overcome this challenge, we propose a semantic chain-of-trust model implemented with agentic AI and hypergraphs for supporting effective collaborator selection. We first introduce a concept of semantic trust, specifically designed to assess collaborators along multiple semantic dimensions for a more accurate representation of their trustworthiness. To facilitate intelligent evaluation, an agentic AI system is deployed on each device, empowering it to autonomously perform necessary operations, including device state detection, trust-related data collection, semantic extraction, task-specific resource evaluation, to derive a semantic trust representation for each collaborator. In addition, each device leverages a hypergraph to dynamically manage potential collaborators according to different levels of semantic trust, enabling fast one-hop collaborator selection. Furthermore, adjacent trusted devices autonomously form a chain through the hypergraph structure, supporting multi-hop collaborator selection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed semantic chain-of-trust achieves 100\% accuracy in trust evaluation based on historical collaborations, enabling intelligent, resource-efficient, and precise collaborator selection.</description>

      <title>Implementing Cumulative Functions with Generalized Cumulative Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling scheduling problems with conditional time intervals and cumulative functions has become a common approach when using modern commercial constraint programming solvers. This paradigm enables the modeling of a wide range of scheduling problems, including those involving producers and consumers. However, it is unavailable in existing open-source solvers and practical implementation details remain undocumented. In this work, we present an implementation of this modeling approach using a single, generic global constraint called the Generalized Cumulative. We also introduce a novel time-table filtering algorithm specifically designed to handle tasks defined on conditional time-intervals. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach, combined with the new filtering algorithm, performs competitively with existing solvers enabling the modeling of producer and consumer scheduling problems and effectively scales to large-scale problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Financial AI holds great promise for transforming modern finance, with the potential to support a wide range of tasks such as market forecasting, portfolio management, quantitative trading, and automated analysis. However, existing platforms remain limited in task coverage, lack robust multimodal data integration, and offer insufficient support for the training and deployment of large language models (LLMs). In response to these limitations, we present FinWorld, an all-in-one open-source platform that provides end-to-end support for the entire financial AI workflow, from data acquisition to experimentation and deployment. FinWorld distinguishes itself through native integration of heterogeneous financial data, unified support for diverse AI paradigms, and advanced agent automation, enabling seamless development and deployment. Leveraging data from 2 representative markets, 4 stock pools, and over 800 million financial data points, we conduct comprehensive experiments on 4 key financial AI tasks. These experiments systematically evaluate deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms, with particular emphasis on RL-based finetuning for LLMs and LLM Agents. The empirical results demonstrate that FinWorld significantly enhances reproducibility, supports transparent benchmarking, and streamlines deployment, thereby providing a strong foundation for future research and real-world applications.

      <title>MOTIF: Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing effective algorithmic components remains a fundamental obstacle in tackling NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), where solvers often rely on carefully hand-crafted strategies. Despite recent advances in using large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality components, most approaches restrict the search to a single element - commonly a heuristic scoring function - thus missing broader opportunities for innovation. In this paper, we introduce a broader formulation of solver design as a multi-strategy optimization problem, which seeks to jointly improve a set of interdependent components under a unified objective. To address this, we propose Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework (MOTIF) - a novel framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search that facilitates turn-based optimization between two LLM agents. At each turn, an agent improves one component by leveraging the history of both its own and its opponent's prior updates, promoting both competitive pressure and emergent cooperation. This structured interaction broadens the search landscape and encourages the discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions. Experiments across multiple COP domains show that MOTIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the promise of turn-based, multi-agent prompting for fully automated solver design.</description>

      <title>InfiGUI-G1: Advancing GUI Grounding with Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization</title>

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has propelled the development of autonomous agents that operate on Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) using pure visual input. A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding natural language instructions. This requires a precise spatial alignment, which accurately locates the coordinates of each element, and, more critically, a correct semantic alignment, which matches the instructions to the functionally appropriate UI element. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these MLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment, which prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations. To address this exploration problem, we present Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization (AEPO), a new policy optimization framework. AEPO employs a multi-answer generation strategy to enforce broader exploration, which is then guided by a theoretically grounded Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER) function derived from first principles of efficiency eta=U/C. Our AEPO-trained models, InfiGUI-G1-3B and InfiGUI-G1-7B, establish new state-of-the-art results across multiple challenging GUI grounding benchmarks, achieving significant relative improvements of up to 9.0% against the naive RLVR baseline on benchmarks designed to test generalization and semantic understanding.

      <title>Hallucination as a Computational Boundary: A Hierarchy of Inevitability and the Oracle Escape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The illusion phenomenon of large language models (LLMs) is the core obstacle to their reliable deployment. This article formalizes the large language model as a probabilistic Turing machine by constructing a "computational necessity hierarchy", and for the first time proves the illusions are inevitable on diagonalization, incomputability, and information theory boundaries supported by the new "learner pump lemma". However, we propose two "escape routes": one is to model Retrieval Enhanced Generations (RAGs) as oracle machines, proving their absolute escape through "computational jumps", providing the first formal theory for the effectiveness of RAGs; The second is to formalize continuous learning as an "internalized oracle" mechanism and implement this path through a novel neural game theory framework. Finally, this article proposes a feasible new principle for artificial intelligence security - Computational Class Alignment (CCA), which requires strict matching between task complexity and the actual computing power of the system, providing theoretical support for the secure application of artificial intelligence.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, acting on their users' behalf to manipulate and analyze data, are likely to become the dominant workload for data systems in the future. When working with data, agents employ a high-throughput process of exploration and solution formulation for the given task, one we call agentic speculation. The sheer volume and inefficiencies of agentic speculation can pose challenges for present-day data systems. We argue that data systems need to adapt to more natively support agentic workloads. We take advantage of the characteristics of agentic speculation that we identify, i.e., scale, heterogeneity, redundancy, and steerability - to outline a number of new research opportunities for a new agent-first data systems architecture, ranging from new query interfaces, to new query processing techniques, to new agentic memory stores.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and demonstrated superior performance across various tasks, including natural language processing (NLP), weather forecasting, biological protein folding, text generation, and solving mathematical problems. However, many real-world data exhibit highly non-Euclidean latent hierarchical anatomy, such as protein networks, transportation networks, financial networks, brain networks, and linguistic structures or syntactic trees in natural languages. Effectively learning intrinsic semantic entailment and hierarchical relationships from these raw, unstructured input data using LLMs remains an underexplored area. Due to its effectiveness in modeling tree-like hierarchical structures, hyperbolic geometry -- a non-Euclidean space -- has rapidly gained popularity as an expressive latent representation space for complex data modeling across domains such as graphs, images, languages, and multi-modal data. Here, we provide a comprehensive and contextual exposition of recent advancements in LLMs that leverage hyperbolic geometry as a representation space to enhance semantic representation learning and multi-scale reasoning. Specifically, the paper presents a taxonomy of the principal techniques of Hyperbolic LLMs (HypLLMs) in terms of four main categories: (1) hyperbolic LLMs through exp/log maps; (2) hyperbolic fine-tuned models; (3) fully hyperbolic LLMs, and (4) hyperbolic state-space models. We also explore crucial potential applications and outline future research directions.

      <title>Difficulty-Aware Agentic Orchestration for Query-Specific Multi-Agent Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11079v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems have shown strong capabilities across various tasks. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on static or task-level workflows, which either over-process simple queries or underperform on complex ones, while also neglecting the efficiency-performance trade-offs across heterogeneous LLMs. To address these limitations, we propose Difficulty-Aware Agentic Orchestration (DAAO), which can dynamically generate query-specific multi-agent workflows guided by predicted query difficulty. DAAO comprises three interdependent modules: a variational autoencoder (VAE) for difficulty estimation, a modular operator allocator, and a cost- and performance-aware LLM router. A self-adjusting policy updates difficulty estimates based on workflow success, enabling simpler workflows for easy queries and more complex strategies for harder ones. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that DAAO surpasses prior multi-agent systems in both accuracy and inference efficiency, validating its effectiveness for adaptive, difficulty-aware reasoning.</description>

      <title>Kimi-Dev: Agentless Training as Skill Prior for SWE-Agents</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering (SWE), with SWE-bench as a key benchmark. Solutions are split into SWE-Agent frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors, including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\% on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to 48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.</description>

      <title>RE-PO: Robust Enhanced Policy Optimization as a General Framework for LLM Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard human preference-based alignment methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are a cornerstone for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, these methods typically assume that preference data is clean and that all labels are equally reliable. In practice, large-scale preference datasets contain substantial noise due to annotator mistakes, inconsistent instructions, varying expertise, and even adversarial or low-effort feedback. This mismatch between recorded labels and ground-truth preferences can misguide training and degrade model performance. To address this issue, we introduce Robust Enhanced Policy Optimization (RE-PO), which uses an expectation-maximization procedure to infer the posterior correctness of each label and then adaptively reweight data points in the training loss to mitigate label noise. We further generalize this idea by establishing a theoretical link between arbitrary preference losses and their underlying probabilistic models, enabling a systematic transformation of existing alignment algorithms into robust counterparts and elevating RE-PO from a single method to a general framework for robust preference alignment. Theoretically, we prove that, under a perfectly calibrated model, RE-PO recovers the true noise level of the dataset. Empirically, we show that RE-PO consistently improves four state-of-the-art alignment methods (DPO, IPO, SimPO, and CPO); when applied to Mistral and Llama 3 models, the RE-PO-enhanced variants increase AlpacaEval 2 win rates by up to 7.0 percent over their respective baselines.</description>

      <title>Saliency Guided Longitudinal Medical Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing paired studies from different time points and answering questions about clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop: step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency; step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal reasoning in medical VQA.</description>

      <title>A Field Guide to Deploying AI Agents in Clinical Practice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26153v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated into agent-driven workflows hold immense promise for healthcare, yet a significant gap exists between their potential and practical implementation within clinical settings. To address this, we present a practitioner-oriented field manual for deploying generative agents that use electronic health record (EHR) data. This guide is informed by our experience deploying the "irAE-Agent", an automated system to detect immune-related adverse events from clinical notes at Mass General Brigham, and by structured interviews with 21 clinicians, engineers, and informatics leaders involved in the project. Our analysis reveals a critical misalignment in clinical AI development: less than 20% of our effort was dedicated to prompt engineering and model development, while over 80% was consumed by the sociotechnical work of implementation. We distill this effort into five "heavy lifts": data integration, model validation, ensuring economic value, managing system drift, and governance. By providing actionable solutions for each of these challenges, this field manual shifts the focus from algorithmic development to the essential infrastructure and implementation work required to bridge the "valley of death" and successfully translate generative AI from pilot projects into routine clinical care.</description>

      <title>Internal World Models as Imagination Networks in Cognitive Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computational role of imagination remains debated. While classical accounts emphasize reward maximization, emerging evidence suggests imagination serves a broader function: accessing internal world models (IWMs). Here, we employ psychological network analysis to compare IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs) through imagination vividness ratings. Using the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ-2) and Plymouth Sensory Imagery Questionnaire (PSIQ), we construct imagination networks from three human populations (Florida, Poland, London; N=2,743) and six LLM variants in two conversation conditions. Human imagination networks demonstrate robust correlations across centrality measures (expected influence, strength, closeness) and consistent clustering patterns, indicating shared structural organization of IWMs across populations. In contrast, LLM-derived networks show minimal clustering and weak centrality correlations, even when manipulating conversational memory. These systematic differences persist across environmental scenes (VVIQ-2) and sensory modalities (PSIQ), revealing fundamental disparities between human and artificial world models. Our network-based approach provides a quantitative framework for comparing internally-generated representations across cognitive agents, with implications for developing human-like imagination in artificial intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>LiveResearchBench: A Live Benchmark for User-Centric Deep Research in the Wild</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14240v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep research -- producing comprehensive, citation-grounded reports by searching and synthesizing information from hundreds of live web sources -- marks an important frontier for agentic systems. To rigorously evaluate this ability, four principles are essential: tasks should be (1) user-centric, reflecting realistic information needs, (2) dynamic, requiring up-to-date information beyond parametric knowledge, (3) unambiguous, ensuring consistent interpretation across users, and (4) multi-faceted and search-intensive, requiring search over numerous web sources and in-depth analysis. Existing benchmarks fall short of these principles, often focusing on narrow domains or posing ambiguous questions that hinder fair comparison. Guided by these principles, we introduce LiveResearchBench, a benchmark of 100 expert-curated tasks spanning daily life, enterprise, and academia, each requiring extensive, dynamic, real-time web search and synthesis. Built with over 1,500 hours of human labor, LiveResearchBench provides a rigorous basis for systematic evaluation. To evaluate citation-grounded long-form reports, we introduce DeepEval, a comprehensive suite covering both content- and report-level quality, including coverage, presentation, citation accuracy and association, consistency and depth of analysis. DeepEval integrates four complementary evaluation protocols, each designed to ensure stable assessment and high agreement with human judgments. Using LiveResearchBench and DeepEval, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier deep research systems, including single-agent web search, single-agent deep research, and multi-agent systems. Our analysis reveals current strengths, recurring failure modes, and key system components needed to advance reliable, insightful deep research.

Abstract: Modern science advances fastest when thought meets action. LabOS represents the first AI co-scientist that unites computational reasoning with physical experimentation through multimodal perception, self-evolving agents, and Extended-Reality(XR)-enabled human-AI collaboration. By connecting multi-model AI agents, smart glasses, and robots, LabOS allows AI to see what scientists see, understand experimental context, and assist in real-time execution. Across applications -- from cancer immunotherapy target discovery to stem-cell engineering and material science -- LabOS shows that AI can move beyond computational design to participation, turning the laboratory into an intelligent, collaborative environment where human and machine discovery evolve together.</description>

      <title>Smaller Models, Smarter Rewards: A Two-Sided Approach to Process and Outcome Rewards</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating high-quality code remains a challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). For the evolution of reasoning models on this task, reward models are a necessary intermediate step. These models judge outcomes or intermediate steps. Decoder-only transformer models can be turned into reward models by introducing a regression layer and supervised fine-tuning. While it is known that reflection capabilities generally increase with the size of a model, we want to investigate whether state-of-the-art small language models like the Phi-4 family can be turned into usable reward models blending the consideration of process rewards and outcome rewards.
  Targeting this goal, we construct a dataset of code samples with correctness labels derived from the APPS coding challenge benchmark. We then train a value-head model to estimate the success probability of intermediate outputs. Our evaluation shows that small LLMs are capable of serving as effective reward models or code evaluation critics, successfully identifying correct solutions among multiple candidates. Using this critic, we achieve over a 20% improvement in the search capability of the most accurate code out of multiple generations.</description>

      <title>Aligning Machiavellian Agents: Behavior Steering via Test-Time Policy Shaping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deployment of decision-making AI agents presents a critical challenge in maintaining alignment with human values or guidelines while operating in complex, dynamic environments. Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining alignment. For pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Off-Policy Training Data on Probe Generalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probing has emerged as a promising method for monitoring large language models (LLMs), enabling inference-time detection of concerning behaviours such as deception and sycophancy. However, natural examples of many behaviours are rare, forcing researchers to rely on synthetic or off-policy LLM responses for training probes. We systematically evaluate how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalisation across eight distinct LLM behaviours. Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs, we find that the response generation strategy can significantly affect probe performance, though the magnitude of this effect greatly varies by behaviour. We find that successful generalisation from off-policy responses to incentivised responses (e.g. those where the behaviour is advantageous) is predictive of successful generalisation to on-policy data. Leveraging this result, we predict that Deception and Sandbagging probes may fail to generalise from off-policy to on-policy data when used in real monitoring scenarios. We also find that shifts in the training data domain cause even larger performance degradation than off-to-on-policy shift, with different-domain test scores being consistently lower than the same-domain ones. In the absence of on-policy data, using same-domain off-policy data appears to yield more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain. Still, we emphasise the need for methods that can better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring.</description>

      <title>ICPO: Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization for Efficient Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.</description>

      <title>ChartAnchor: Chart Grounding with Structural-Semantic Fidelity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) highlight the need for benchmarks that rigorously evaluate structured chart comprehension. Chart grounding refers to the bidirectional alignment between a chart's visual appearance and the structured semantics. This task requires models to produce a symbolic specification that faithfully captures the chart's visual and structural intent, while also recovering the underlying tabular data with precise values and relationships. Chart grounding directly reflects a model's capabilities in numerical reasoning, multimodal alignment, and structural reconstruction, and has several important applications in real-world scenarios. Existing benchmarks, constrained by narrow chart diversity, isolated tasks, and incomplete evaluation frameworks, fail to holistically assess grounding. To address this, we propose ChartAnchor, a comprehensive benchmark of 8k+ chart-table-code triples spanning 30 chart types drawn from diverse real-world and augmented sources. ChartAnchor introduces two complementary tasks: chart-to-code generation (synthesizing executable code to replicate charts) and controlled chart-to-table reconstruction (extracting exact data with predefined headers), enabling cross-validation of visual and numerical fidelity. A multi-level evaluation framework integrates semantic validation, stylistic analysis, and perceptual metrics to assess both structural and content-level correctness. Extensive experiments on MLLMs reveal critical limitations in numerical precision and code synthesis, emphasizing the need for structured reasoning beyond surface-level perception. By unifying symbolic and data-driven grounding, ChartAnchor establishes a rigorous foundation for chart grounding, offering meaningful insights for advancing MLLMs in scientific, financial, and industrial domains.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised decoding of encoded reasoning using language model interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models become increasingly capable, there is growing concern that they may develop reasoning processes that are encoded or hidden from human oversight. To investigate whether current interpretability techniques can penetrate such encoded reasoning, we construct a controlled testbed by fine-tuning a reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B) to perform chain-of-thought reasoning in ROT-13 encryption while maintaining intelligible English outputs. We evaluate mechanistic interpretability methods--in particular, logit lens analysis--on their ability to decode the model's hidden reasoning process using only internal activations. We show that logit lens can effectively translate encoded reasoning, with accuracy peaking in intermediate-to-late layers. Finally, we develop a fully unsupervised decoding pipeline that combines logit lens with automated paraphrasing, achieving substantial accuracy in reconstructing complete reasoning transcripts from internal model representations. These findings suggest that current mechanistic interpretability techniques may be more robust to simple forms of encoded reasoning than previously understood. Our work provides an initial framework for evaluating interpretability methods against models that reason in non-human-readable formats, contributing to the broader challenge of maintaining oversight over increasingly capable AI systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Path Collaborative Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced the problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet conventional CoT often exhibits internal determinism during decoding, limiting exploration of plausible alternatives. Recent methods attempt to address this by generating soft abstract tokens to enable reasoning in a continuous semantic space. However, we find that such approaches remain constrained by the greedy nature of autoregressive decoding, which fundamentally isolates the model from alternative reasoning possibilities. In this work, we propose Multi-Path Perception Policy Optimization (M3PO), a novel reinforcement learning framework that explicitly injects collective insights into the reasoning process. M3PO leverages parallel policy rollouts as naturally diverse reasoning sources and integrates cross-path interactions into policy updates through a lightweight collaborative mechanism. This design allows each trajectory to refine its reasoning with peer feedback, thereby cultivating more reliable multi-step reasoning patterns. Empirical results show that M3PO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both knowledge- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Models trained with M3PO maintain interpretability and inference efficiency, underscoring the promise of multi-path collaborative learning for robust reasoning.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Black Box: A Cognitive Architecture for Explainable and Aligned AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current AI paradigms, as "architects of experience," face fundamental challenges in explainability and value alignment. This paper introduces "Weight-Calculatism," a novel cognitive architecture grounded in first principles, and demonstrates its potential as a viable pathway toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The architecture deconstructs cognition into indivisible Logical Atoms and two fundamental operations: Pointing and Comparison. Decision-making is formalized through an interpretable Weight-Calculation model (Weight = Benefit * Probability), where all values are traceable to an auditable set of Initial Weights. This atomic decomposition enables radical explainability, intrinsic generality for novel situations, and traceable value alignment. We detail its implementation via a graph-algorithm-based computational engine and a global workspace workflow, supported by a preliminary code implementation and scenario validation. Results indicate that the architecture achieves transparent, human-like reasoning and robust learning in unprecedented scenarios, establishing a practical and theoretical foundation for building trustworthy and aligned AGI.</description>

      <title>DataGovBench: Benchmarking LLM Agents for Real-World Data Governance Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data governance ensures data quality, security, and compliance through policies and standards, a critical foundation for scaling modern AI development. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for automating data governance by translating user intent into executable transformation code. However, existing benchmarks for automated data science often emphasize snippet-level coding or high-level analytics, failing to capture the unique challenge of data governance: ensuring the correctness and quality of the data itself. To bridge this gap, we introduce DataGovBench, a benchmark featuring 150 diverse tasks grounded in real-world scenarios, built on data from actual cases. DataGovBench employs a novel "reversed-objective" methodology to synthesize realistic noise and utilizes rigorous metrics to assess end-to-end pipeline reliability. Our analysis on DataGovBench reveals that current models struggle with complex, multi-step workflows and lack robust error-correction mechanisms. Consequently, we propose DataGovAgent, a framework utilizing a Planner-Executor-Evaluator architecture that integrates constraint-based planning, retrieval-augmented generation, and sandboxed feedback-driven debugging. Experimental results show that DataGovAgent significantly boosts the Average Task Score (ATS) on complex tasks from 39.7 to 54.9 and reduces debugging iterations by over 77.9 percent compared to general-purpose baselines.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Game Management Decisions: A Fuzzy Logic Approach to Real-Time Soccer Substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In elite soccer, substitution decisions entail significant financial and sporting consequences yet remain heavily reliant on intuition or predictive models that merely mimic historical biases. This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic based Decision Support System (DSS) designed for real time, prescriptive game management. Unlike traditional Machine Learning approaches that encounter a predictive ceiling by attempting to replicate human behavior, our system audits performance through an objective, rule based inference engine. We propose a methodological advancement by reformulating the PlayeRank metric into a Cumulative Mean with Role Aware Normalization, eliminating the play time exposure bias inherent in cumulative sum models to enable accurate intra match comparison. The system integrates this refined metric with physiological proxies (fatigue) and contextual variables (disciplinary risk modulated by tactical role) to calculate a dynamic Substitution Priority (P final). Validation via a case study of the 2018 FIFA World Cup match between Brazil and Belgium demonstrates the system's ecological validity: it not only aligned with expert consensus on executed substitutions (for example Gabriel Jesus) but, crucially, identified high risk scenarios ignored by human decision makers. Specifically, the model flagged the "FAGNER Paradox" - a maximum priority defensive risk - minutes before a critical yellow card, and detected the "Lukaku Paradox", where an isolated assist masked a severe drop in participation. These results confirm that Fuzzy Logic offers a transparent, explainable, and superior alternative to black box models for optimizing real time tactical decisions.</description>

      <title>Model-Based and Sample-Efficient AI-Assisted Math Discovery in Sphere Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sphere packing, Hilbert's eighteenth problem, asks for the densest arrangement of congruent spheres in n-dimensional Euclidean space. Although relevant to areas such as cryptography, crystallography, and medical imaging, the problem remains unresolved: beyond a few special dimensions, neither optimal packings nor tight upper bounds are known. Even a major breakthrough in dimension $n=8$, later recognised with a Fields Medal, underscores its difficulty. A leading technique for upper bounds, the three-point method, reduces the problem to solving large, high-precision semidefinite programs (SDPs). Because each candidate SDP may take days to evaluate, standard data-intensive AI approaches are infeasible. We address this challenge by formulating SDP construction as a sequential decision process, the SDP game, in which a policy assembles SDP formulations from a set of admissible components. Using a sample-efficient model-based framework that combines Bayesian optimisation with Monte Carlo Tree Search, we obtain new state-of-the-art upper bounds in dimensions $4-16$, showing that model-based search can advance computational progress in longstanding geometric problems. Together, these results demonstrate that sample-efficient, model-based search can make tangible progress on mathematically rigid, evaluation limited problems, pointing towards a complementary direction for AI-assisted discovery beyond large-scale LLM-driven exploration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04921v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the first version of the AI Consumer Index (ACE), a benchmark for assessing whether frontier AI models can perform everyday consumer tasks. ACE contains a hidden heldout set of 400 test cases, split across four consumer activities: shopping, food, gaming, and DIY. We are also open sourcing 80 cases as a devset with a CC-BY license. For the ACE leaderboard we evaluated 10 frontier models (with websearch turned on) using a novel grading methodology that dynamically checks whether relevant parts of the response are grounded in the retrieved web sources. GPT 5 (Thinking = High) is the top-performing model, scoring 56.1%, followed by o3 Pro (Thinking = On) at 55.2% and GPT 5.1 (Thinking = High) at 55.1%. Model scores differ across domains, and in Shopping the top model scores under 50\%. We find that models are prone to hallucinating key information, such as prices. ACE shows a substantial gap between the performance of even the best models and consumers' AI needs.</description>

      <title>Semantic Faithfulness and Entropy Production Measures to Tame Your LLM Demons and Manage Hallucinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating faithfulness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to a given task is a complex challenge. We propose two new unsupervised metrics for faithfulness evaluation using insights from information theory and thermodynamics. Our approach treats an LLM as a bipartite information engine where hidden layers act as a Maxwell demon controlling transformations of context $C $ into answer $A$ via prompt $Q$. We model Question-Context-Answer (QCA) triplets as probability distributions over shared topics. Topic transformations from $C$ to $Q$ and $A$ are modeled as transition matrices ${\bf Q}$ and ${\bf A}$ encoding the query goal and actual result, respectively. Our semantic faithfulness (SF) metric quantifies faithfulness for any given QCA triplet by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these matrices. Both matrices are inferred simultaneously via convex optimization of this KL divergence, and the final SF metric is obtained by mapping the minimal divergence onto the unit interval [0,1], where higher scores indicate greater faithfulness. Furthermore, we propose a thermodynamics-based semantic entropy production (SEP) metric in answer generation, and show that high faithfulness generally implies low entropy production. The SF and SEP metrics can be used jointly or separately for LLM evaluation and hallucination control. We demonstrate our framework on LLM summarization of corporate SEC 10-K filings.</description>

      <title>Deep transfer learning for image classification: a survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.09904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers have achieved many successes in image classification in recent years. It has been consistently demonstrated that best practice for image classification is when large deep models can be trained on abundant labelled data. However there are many real world scenarios where the requirement for large amounts of training data to get the best performance cannot be met. In these scenarios transfer learning can help improve performance. To date there have been no surveys that comprehensively review deep transfer learning as it relates to image classification overall. However, several recent general surveys of deep transfer learning and ones that relate to particular specialised target image classification tasks have been published. We believe it is important for the future progress in the field that all current knowledge is collated and the overarching patterns analysed and discussed. In this survey we formally define deep transfer learning and the problem it attempts to solve in relation to image classification. We survey the current state of the field and identify where recent progress has been made. We show where the gaps in current knowledge are and make suggestions for how to progress the field to fill in these knowledge gaps. We present a new taxonomy of the applications of transfer learning for image classification. This taxonomy makes it easier to see overarching patterns of where transfer learning has been effective and, where it has failed to fulfill its potential. This also allows us to suggest where the problems lie and how it could be used more effectively. We show that under this new taxonomy, many of the applications where transfer learning has been shown to be ineffective or even hinder performance are to be expected when taking into account the source and target datasets and the techniques used.</description>

      <title>A Unified Perspective for Loss-Oriented Imbalanced Learning via Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the inherent imbalance in real-world datasets, na\"ive Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) tends to bias the learning process towards the majority classes, hindering generalization to minority classes. To rebalance the learning process, one straightforward yet effective approach is to modify the loss function via class-dependent terms, such as re-weighting and logit-adjustment. However, existing analysis of these loss-oriented methods remains coarse-grained and fragmented, failing to explain some empirical results. After reviewing prior work, we find that the properties used through their analysis are typically global, i.e., defined over the whole dataset. Hence, these properties fail to effectively capture how class-dependent terms influence the learning process. To bridge this gap, we turn to explore the localized versions of such properties i.e., defined within each class. Specifically, we employ localized calibration to provide consistency validation across a broader range of losses and localized Lipschitz continuity to provide a fine-grained generalization bound. In this way, we reach a unified perspective for improving and adjusting loss-oriented methods. Finally, a principled learning algorithm is developed based on these insights. Empirical results on both traditional ResNets and foundation models validate our theoretical analyses and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Anatomical basis of sex differences in the electrocardiogram identified by three-dimensional torso-heart imaging reconstruction pipeline</title>

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is used for diagnosis and risk stratification in myocardial infarction (MI). Women have a higher incidence of missed MI diagnosis and complications following infarction, and to address this we aim to provide quantitative information on sex-differences in ECG and torso-ventricular anatomical features and their interdependence. A novel computational automated pipeline is presented enabling the three-dimensional reconstruction of torso-ventricular anatomies for 425 post-MI subjects and 1051 healthy controls from UK Biobank clinical images. Regression models were created relating torso-ventricular and ECG parameters. We found that female hearts were positioned more posteriorly and superiorly than male, and in MI hearts were oriented more horizontally, especially for women. Post-MI women exhibited less QRS prolongation, requiring 27% more prolongation than men to exceed 120ms. Only half of the sex difference in QRS duration was associated with smaller female cavities. Lower STj amplitude in women was striking, associated with smaller ventricles, but also more superior and posterior cardiac position. Post-MI, T wave amplitude and R axis deviations were more strongly associated with posterior and horizontal cardiac positioning in women than in men. Our study highlights the need to quantify sex differences in anatomical features, their implications in ECG interpretation, and the application of clinical ECG thresholds in post-MI.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Meets Mechanism Design: Key Results and Some Novel Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mechanism design is essentially reverse engineering of games and involves inducing a game among strategic agents in a way that the induced game satisfies a set of desired properties in an equilibrium of the game. Desirable properties for a mechanism include incentive compatibility, individual rationality, welfare maximisation, revenue maximisation (or cost minimisation), fairness of allocation, etc. It is known from mechanism design theory that only certain strict subsets of these properties can be simultaneously satisfied exactly by any given mechanism. Often, the mechanisms required by real-world applications may need a subset of these properties that are theoretically impossible to be simultaneously satisfied. In such cases, a prominent recent approach is to use a deep learning based approach to learn a mechanism that approximately satisfies the required properties by minimizing a suitably defined loss function. In this paper, we present, from relevant literature, technical details of using a deep learning approach for mechanism design and provide an overview of key results in this topic. We demonstrate the power of this approach for three illustrative case studies: (a) efficient energy management in a vehicular network (b) resource allocation in a mobile network (c) designing a volume discount procurement auction for agricultural inputs. Section 6 concludes the paper.</description>

      <title>I Learn Better If You Speak My Language: Understanding the Superior Performance of Fine-Tuning Large Language Models with LLM-Generated Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11192v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores an intriguing observation: fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) with responses generated by a LLM often yields better results than using responses generated by humans, particularly in reasoning tasks. We conduct an in-depth investigation to understand why this occurs. Contrary to the common belief that these instances is due to the more detailed nature of LLM-generated content, our study identifies another contributing factor: an LLM is inherently more "familiar" with LLM generated responses. This familiarity is evidenced by lower perplexity before fine-tuning. We design a series of experiments to understand the impact of the "familiarity" and our conclusion reveals that this "familiarity" significantly impacts learning performance. Training with LLM-generated responses not only enhances performance but also helps maintain the model's capabilities in other reasoning tasks after fine-tuning on a specific task.</description>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI is poised to disrupt the creative industry. Amidst the immense excitement for this new technology, its future development and applications in the creative industry hinge crucially upon two copyright issues: 1) the compensation to creators whose content has been used to train generative AI models (the fair use standard); and 2) the eligibility of AI-generated content for copyright protection (AI-copyrightability). While both issues have ignited heated debates among academics and practitioners, most analysis has focused on their challenges posed to existing copyright doctrines. In this paper, we aim to better understand the economic implications of these two regulatory issues and their interactions. By constructing a dynamic model with endogenous content creation and AI model development, we unravel the impacts of the fair use standard and AI-copyrightability on AI development, AI company profit, creators income, and consumer welfare, and how these impacts are influenced by various economic and operational factors. For example, while generous fair use (use data for AI training without compensating the creator) benefits all parties when abundant training data exists, it can hurt creators and consumers when such data is scarce. Similarly, stronger AI-copyrightability (AI content enjoys more copyright protection) could hinder AI development and reduce social welfare. Our analysis also highlights the complex interplay between these two copyright issues. For instance, when existing training data is scarce, generous fair use may be preferred only when AI-copyrightability is weak. Our findings underscore the need for policymakers to embrace a dynamic, context-specific approach in making regulatory decisions and provide insights for business leaders navigating the complexities of the global regulatory environment.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion models have been widely used in time series and spatio-temporal data, enhancing generative, inferential, and downstream capabilities. These models are applied across diverse fields such as healthcare, recommendation, climate, energy, audio, and traffic. By separating applications for time series and spatio-temporal data, we offer a structured perspective on model category, task type, data modality, and practical application domain. This study aims to provide a solid foundation for researchers and practitioners, inspiring future innovations that tackle traditional challenges and foster novel solutions in diffusion model-based data mining tasks and applications.

      <title>TimeAutoDiff: A Unified Framework for Generation, Imputation, Forecasting, and Time-Varying Metadata Conditioning of Heterogeneous Time Series Tabular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present TimeAutoDiff, a unified latent-diffusion framework for four fundamental time-series tasks: unconditional generation, missing-data imputation, forecasting, and time-varying-metadata conditional generation. The model natively supports heterogeneous features including continuous, binary, and categorical variables. We unify all tasks using a masked-modeling strategy in which a binary mask specifies which time-series cells are observed and which must be generated. TimeAutoDiff combines a lightweight variational autoencoder, which maps mixed-type features into a continuous latent sequence, with a diffusion model that learns temporal dynamics in this latent space. Two architectural choices provide strong speed and scalability benefits. The diffusion model samples an entire latent trajectory at once rather than denoising one timestep at a time, greatly reducing reverse-diffusion calls. In addition, the VAE compresses along the feature axis, enabling efficient modeling of wide tables in a low-dimensional latent space. Empirical evaluation shows that TimeAutoDiff matches or surpasses strong baselines in synthetic sequence fidelity and consistently improves imputation and forecasting performance. Metadata conditioning enables realistic scenario exploration, allowing users to edit metadata sequences and produce coherent counterfactual trajectories that preserve cross-feature dependencies. Ablation studies highlight the importance of the VAE's feature encoding and key components of the denoiser. A distance-to-closest-record audit further indicates that the model generalizes without excessive memorization. Code is available at https://github.com/namjoonsuh/TimeAutoDiff</description>

      <title>Bridging Weighted First Order Model Counting and Graph Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Weighted First-Order Model Counting Problem (WFOMC) asks to compute the weighted sum of models of a given first-order logic sentence over a given domain. It can be solved in time polynomial in the domain size for sentences from the two-variable fragment with counting quantifiers, known as $C^2$. This polynomial-time complexity is known to be retained when extending $C^2$ by one of the following axioms: linear order axiom, tree axiom, forest axiom, directed acyclic graph axiom or connectedness axiom. An interesting question remains as to which other axioms can be added to the first-order sentences in this way. We provide a new perspective on this problem by associating WFOMC with graph polynomials. Using WFOMC, we define Weak Connectedness Polynomial and Strong Connectedness Polynomials for first-order logic sentences. It turns out that these polynomials have the following interesting properties. First, they can be computed in polynomial time in the domain size for sentences from $C^2$. Second, we can use them to solve WFOMC with all of the existing axioms known to be tractable as well as with new ones such as bipartiteness, strong connectedness, having $k$ connected components, etc. Third, the well-known Tutte polynomial can be recovered as a special case of the Weak Connectedness Polynomial, and the Strict and Non-Strict Directed Chromatic Polynomials can be recovered from the Strong Connectedness Polynomials.</description>

      <title>Image-Guided Semantic Pseudo-LiDAR Point Generation for 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14985v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In autonomous driving scenarios, accurate perception is becoming an even more critical task for safe navigation. While LiDAR provides precise spatial data, its inherent sparsity makes it difficult to detect small or distant objects. Existing methods try to address this by generating additional points within a Region of Interest (RoI), but relying on LiDAR alone often leads to false positives and a failure to recover meaningful structures. To address these limitations, we propose Image-Guided Semantic Pseudo-LiDAR Point Generation model, called ImagePG, a novel framework that leverages rich RGB image features to generate dense and semantically meaningful 3D points. Our framework includes an Image-Guided RoI Points Generation (IG-RPG) module, which creates pseudo-points guided by image features, and an Image-Aware Occupancy Prediction Network (I-OPN), which provides spatial priors to guide point placement. A multi-stage refinement (MR) module further enhances point quality and detection robustness. To the best of our knowledge, ImagePG is the first method to directly leverage image features for point generation. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate that ImagePG significantly improves the detection of small and distant objects like pedestrians and cyclists, reducing false positives by nearly 50%. On the KITTI benchmark, our framework improves mAP by +1.38%p (car), +7.91%p (pedestrian), and +5.21%p (cyclist) on the test set over the baseline, achieving state-of-the-art cyclist performance on the KITTI leaderboard.

      <title>Moyun: A Diffusion-Based Model for Style-Specific Chinese Calligraphy Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although Chinese calligraphy generation has achieved style transfer, generating calligraphy by specifying the calligrapher, font, and character style remains challenging. To address this, we propose a new Chinese calligraphy generation model 'Moyun' , which replaces the Unet in the Diffusion model with Vision Mamba and introduces the TripleLabel control mechanism to achieve controllable calligraphy generation. The model was tested on our large-scale dataset 'Mobao' of over 1.9 million images, and the results demonstrate that 'Moyun' can effectively control the generation process and produce calligraphy in the specified style. Even for calligraphy the calligrapher has not written, 'Moyun' can generate calligraphy that matches the style of the calligrapher.</description>

      <title>A Tidal Current Speed Forecasting Model based on Multi-Periodicity Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tidal energy is one of the key components in increasing the penetration of renewable energy. High tidal energy penetration into the electrical grid depends on accurate tidal current speed forecasting. Model inaccuracies hinder forecast accuracy. Previous research primarily used physical models to forecast tidal current speed, yet tidal current variations influenced by the orbital periods of celestial bodies make accurate physical modeling challenging. Research on the multi-periodicity of tides is crucial for forecasting tidal current speed. We propose the Wavelet-Enhanced Convolutional Network to learn multi-periodicity. The framework embeds intra-period and inter-period variations of one-dimensional tidal current data into the rows and columns, respectively, of a two-dimensional tensor. Then, the two-dimensional variations of the sequence can be processed by convolutional kernels. We integrate a time-frequency analysis method into the framework to further address local periodic features. Additionally, to enhance the framework's stability, we optimize the framework's hyperparameters with the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator. The proposed framework captures multi-periodic dependencies in tidal current data. Numerical results show a 10-step average Mean Absolute Error of 0.025, with at least a 1.18% error reduction compared to other baselines. Further ablation studies show a 1.4% reduction in Mean Absolute Percentage Error on the data with artificially added periodic fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Normalization Strategies and Convolutional Kernels for Multimodal Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal image fusion (MMIF) integrates information from different modalities to obtain a comprehensive image, aiding downstream tasks. However, existing research focuses on complementary information fusion and training strategies, overlooking the critical role of underlying architectural components like normalization and convolution kernels. We reevaluate the UNet architecture for end-to-end MMIF, identifying that widely used batch normalization limits performance by smoothing crucial sparse features. To address this, we propose a hybrid of instance and group normalization to maintain sample independence and reinforce intrinsic feature correlations. Crucially, this strategy facilitates richer feature maps, enabling large kernel convolution to fully leverage its receptive field, enhancing detail preservation. Furthermore, the proposed multi-path adaptive fusion module dynamically calibrates features from varying scales and receptive fields, ensuring effective information transfer. Our method achieves SOTA objective performance on MSRS, M$^3$FD, TNO, and Harvard datasets, producing visually clearer salient objects and lesion areas. Notably, it improves MSRS segmentation mIoU by 8.1\% over the infrared image. This performance stems from a synergistic design of normalization and convolution kernels, which preserves critical sparse features.

      <title>Twisted Convolutional Networks (TCNs): Enhancing Feature Interactions for Non-Spatial Data Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisted Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proposed as a novel deep learning architecture for classifying one-dimensional data with arbitrary feature order and minimal spatial relationships. Unlike conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that rely on structured feature sequences, TCNs explicitly combine subsets of input features through theoretically grounded multiplicative and pairwise interaction mechanisms to create enriched representations. This feature combination strategy, formalized through polynomial feature expansions, captures high-order feature interactions that traditional convolutional approaches miss. We provide a comprehensive mathematical framework for TCNs, demonstrating how the twisted convolution operation generalizes standard convolutions while maintaining computational tractability. Through extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets from diverse domains (medical diagnostics, political science, synthetic data, chemometrics, and healthcare), we show that TCNs achieve statistically significant improvements over CNNs, Residual Networks (ResNet), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), DeepSets, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The performance gains are validated through statistical testing. TCNs also exhibit superior training stability and generalization capabilities, highlighting their robustness for non-spatial data classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Charting the Shapes of Stories with Game Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stories are records of our experiences and their analysis reveals insights into the nature of being human. Successful analyses are often interdisciplinary, leveraging mathematical tools to extract structure from stories and insights from structure. Historically, these tools have been restricted to one dimensional charts and dynamic social networks; however, modern AI offers the possibility of identifying more fully the plot structure, character incentives, and, importantly, counterfactual plot lines that the story could have taken but did not take. In this work, we use AI to model the structure of stories as game-theoretic objects, amenable to quantitative analysis. This allows us to not only interrogate each character's decision making, but also possibly peer into the original author's conception of the characters' world. We demonstrate our proposed technique on Shakespeare's famous Romeo and Juliet. We conclude with a discussion of how our analysis could be replicated in broader contexts, including real-life scenarios.</description>

      <title>MeshA*: Efficient Path Planning With Motion Primitives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a path planning problem where the possible move actions are represented as a finite set of motion primitives aligned with the grid representation of the environment. That is, each primitive corresponds to a short kinodynamically-feasible motion of an agent and is represented as a sequence of the swept cells of a grid. Typically, heuristic search, i.e. A*, is conducted over the lattice induced by these primitives (lattice-based planning) to find a path. However, due to the large branching factor, such search may be inefficient in practice. To this end, we suggest a novel technique rooted in the idea of searching over the grid cells (as in vanilla A*) simultaneously fitting the possible sequences of the motion primitives into these cells. The resultant algorithm, MeshA*, provably preserves the guarantees on completeness and optimality, on the one hand, and is shown to notably outperform conventional lattice-based planning (x1.5-x2 decrease in the runtime), on the other hand.</description>

      <title>It's complicated. The relationship of algorithmic fairness and non-discrimination regulations for high-risk systems in the EU AI Act</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12962v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What constitutes a fair decision? This question is not only difficult for humans but becomes more challenging when Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are used. In light of discriminatory algorithmic behaviors, the EU has recently passed the AI Act, which mandates specific rules for high-risk systems, incorporating both traditional legal non-discrimination regulations and machine learning based algorithmic fairness concepts. This paper aims to bridge these two different concepts in the AI Act through: First, a necessary high-level introduction of both concepts targeting legal and computer science-oriented scholars, and second, an in-depth analysis of the AI Act's relationship between legal non-discrimination regulations and algorithmic fairness. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1.) Most non-discrimination regulations target only high-risk AI systems. (2.) The regulation of high-risk systems encompasses both data input requirements and output monitoring, though these regulations are partly inconsistent and raise questions of computational feasibility. (3.) Finally, we consider the possible (future) interaction of classical EU non-discrimination law and the AI Act regulations. We recommend developing more specific auditing and testing methodologies for AI systems. This paper aims to serve as a foundation for future interdisciplinary collaboration between legal scholars and computer science-oriented machine learning researchers studying discrimination in AI systems.</description>

      <title>SPFFNet: Strip Perception and Feature Fusion Spatial Pyramid Pooling for Fabric Defect Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Defect detection in fabrics is critical for quality control, yet existing methods often struggle with complex backgrounds and shape-specific defects. In this paper, we propose an improved fabric defect detection model based on YOLOv11. To enhance the detection of strip defects, we introduce a Strip Perception Module (SPM) that improves feature capture through multi-scale convolution. We further enhance the spatial pyramid pooling fast (SPPF) by integrating a squeeze-and-excitation mechanism, resulting in the SE-SPPF module, which better integrates spatial and channel information for more effective defect feature extraction. Additionally, we propose a novel focal enhanced complete intersection over union (FECIoU) metric with adaptive weights, addressing scale differences and class imbalance by adjusting the weights of hard-to-detect instances through focal loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves a 0.8-8.1% improvement in mean average precision (mAP) on the Tianchi dataset and a 1.6-13.2% improvement on our custom dataset, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>DiTAR: Diffusion Transformer Autoregressive Modeling for Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03930v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several recent studies have attempted to autoregressively generate continuous speech representations without discrete speech tokens by combining diffusion and autoregressive models, yet they often face challenges with excessive computational loads or suboptimal outcomes. In this work, we propose Diffusion Transformer Autoregressive Modeling (DiTAR), a patch-based autoregressive framework combining a language model with a diffusion transformer. This approach significantly enhances the efficacy of autoregressive models for continuous tokens and reduces computational demands. DiTAR utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy for patch generation, where the language model processes aggregated patch embeddings and the diffusion transformer subsequently generates the next patch based on the output of the language model. For inference, we propose defining temperature as the time point of introducing noise during the reverse diffusion ODE to balance diversity and determinism. We also show in the extensive scaling analysis that DiTAR has superb scalability. In zero-shot speech generation, DiTAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in robustness, speaker similarity, and naturalness.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Singular: Revealing the Value of Multiple Generations in Benchmark Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08943v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant utility in real-world applications, exhibiting impressive capabilities in natural language processing and understanding. Benchmark evaluations are crucial for assessing the capabilities of LLMs as they can provide a comprehensive assessment of their strengths and weaknesses. However, current evaluation methods often overlook the inherent randomness of LLMs by employing deterministic generation strategies or relying on a single random sample, resulting in unaccounted sampling variance and unreliable benchmark score estimates. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical statistical model that provides a more comprehensive representation of the benchmarking process by incorporating both benchmark characteristics and LLM randomness. We show that leveraging multiple generations improves the accuracy of estimating the benchmark score and reduces variance. Multiple generations also allow us to define $\mathbb P\left(\text{correct}\right)$, a prompt-level difficulty score based on correct ratios, providing fine-grained insights into individual prompts. Additionally, we create a data map that visualizes difficulty and semantics of prompts, enabling error detection and quality control in benchmark construction.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Potential of Encoder-free Architectures in 3D LMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09620v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Encoder-free architectures have been preliminarily explored in the 2D Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), yet it remains an open question whether they can be effectively applied to 3D understanding scenarios. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation into the potential of encoder-free architectures to alleviate the challenges of encoder-based 3D LMMs. These long-standing challenges include the failure to adapt to varying point cloud resolutions during inference and the point features from the encoder not meeting the semantic needs of Large Language Models (LLMs). We identify key aspects for 3D LMMs to remove the pre-trained encoder and enable the LLM to assume the role of the 3D encoder: 1) We propose the LLM-embedded Semantic Encoding strategy in the pre-training stage, exploring the effects of various point cloud self-supervised losses. And we present the Hybrid Semantic Loss to extract high-level semantics. 2) We introduce the Hierarchical Geometry Aggregation strategy in the instruction tuning stage. This incorporates inductive bias into the LLM layers to focus on the local details of the point clouds. To the end, we present the first Encoder-free 3D LMM, ENEL. Our 7B model rivals the state-of-the-art model, PointLLM-PiSA-13B, achieving 57.91%, 61.0%, and 55.20% on the classification, captioning, and VQA tasks, respectively. Our results show that the encoder-free architecture is highly promising for replacing encoder-based architectures in the field of 3D understanding.

      <title>DFDT: Dynamic Fast Decision Tree for IoT Data Stream Mining on Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Internet of Things generates massive data streams, with edge computing emerging as a key enabler for online IoT applications and 5G networks. Edge solutions facilitate real-time machine learning inference, but also require continuous adaptation to concept drifts. While extensions of the Very Fast Decision Tree (VFDT) remain state-of-the-art for tabular stream mining, their unregulated growth limits efficiency, particularly in ensemble settings where post-pruning at the individual tree level is seldom applied. This paper presents DFDT, a novel memory-constrained algorithm for online learning. DFDT employs activity-aware pre-pruning, dynamically adjusting splitting criteria based on leaf node activity: low-activity nodes are deactivated to conserve resources, moderately active nodes split under stricter conditions, and highly active nodes leverage a skipping mechanism for accelerated growth. Additionally, adaptive grace periods and tie thresholds allow DFDT to modulate splitting decisions based on observed data variability, enhancing the accuracy-memory-runtime trade-off while minimizing the need for hyperparameter tuning. An ablation study reveals three DFDT variants suited to different resource profiles. Fully compatible with existing ensemble frameworks, DFDT provides a drop-in alternative to standard VFDT-based learners.</description>

      <title>Target Speaker Extraction through Comparing Noisy Positive and Negative Audio Enrollments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Target speaker extraction focuses on isolating a specific speaker's voice from an audio mixture containing multiple speakers. To provide information about the target speaker's identity, prior works have utilized clean audio samples as conditioning inputs. However, such clean audio examples are not always readily available. For instance, obtaining a clean recording of a stranger's voice at a cocktail party without leaving the noisy environment is generally infeasible. Limited prior research has explored extracting the target speaker's characteristics from noisy enrollments, which may contain overlapping speech from interfering speakers. In this work, we explore a novel enrollment strategy that encodes target speaker information from the noisy enrollment by comparing segments where the target speaker is talking (Positive Enrollments) with segments where the target speaker is silent (Negative Enrollments). Experiments show the effectiveness of our model architecture, which achieves over 2.1 dB higher SI-SNRi compared to prior works in extracting the monaural speech from the mixture of two speakers. Additionally, the proposed two-stage training strategy accelerates convergence, reducing the number of optimization steps required to reach 3 dB SNR by 60%. Overall, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the monaural target speaker extraction conditioned on noisy enrollments. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/xu-shitong/TSE-through-Positive-Negative-Enroll .</description>

      <title>HybridNorm: Towards Stable and Efficient Transformer Training via Hybrid Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04598v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto architecture for a wide range of machine learning tasks, particularly in large language models (LLMs). Despite their remarkable performance, many challenges remain in training deep transformer networks, especially regarding the position of the layer normalization. While Pre-Norm structures facilitate more stable training owing to their stronger identity path, they often lead to suboptimal performance compared to Post-Norm. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{HybridNorm}$, a simple yet effective hybrid normalization strategy that integrates the advantages of both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm. Specifically, HybridNorm employs QKV normalization within the attention mechanism and Post-Norm in the feed-forward network (FFN) of each transformer block. We provide both theoretical insights and empirical evidence to demonstrate that HybridNorm improves the gradient flow and the model robustness. Extensive experiments on large-scale transformer models, including both dense and sparse variants, show that HybridNorm consistently outperforms both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm approaches across multiple benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential of HybridNorm as a more stable and effective technique for improving the training and performance of deep transformer models.

      <title>PIMRL: Physics-Informed Multi-Scale Recurrent Learning for Spatiotemporal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10253v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation of spatiotemporal systems governed by partial differential equations is widely applied in fields such as biology, chemistry, aerospace dynamics, and meteorology. Traditional numerical methods incur high computational costs due to the requirement of small time steps for accurate predictions. While machine learning has reduced these costs, long-term predictions remain challenged by error accumulation, particularly in scenarios with insufficient data or varying time scales, where stability and accuracy are compromised. Existing methods often neglect the effective utilization of multi-scale data, leading to suboptimal robustness in predictions. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-scale learning framework, namely, the Physics-Informed Multi-Scale Recurrent Learning (PIMRL), to effectively leverage multi-scale data for spatiotemporal dynamics prediction. The PIMRL framework comprises two modules: the micro-scale module embeds physical knowledge into neural networks via pretraining, and the macro-scale module adopts a data-driven approach to learn the temporal evolution of physics in the latent space. Experimental results demonstrate that the PIMRL framework consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets ranging from one to three dimensions, showing average improvements of over 9\% in both RMSE and MAE evaluation metrics, with maximum enhancements reaching up to 80%.</description>

      <title>TEMPLE: Incentivizing Temporal Understanding of Video Large Language Models via Progressive Pre-SFT Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16929v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have achieved significant success by adopting the paradigm of large-scale pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, existing approaches struggle with temporal reasoning due to weak temporal correspondence in the data and over-reliance on the next-token prediction paradigm}, which collectively result in the absence temporal supervision. To address these limitations, we propose TEMPLE (TEMporal Preference LEarning), a systematic framework that enhances temporal reasoning capabilities through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). To address temporal information scarcity in data, we introduce an automated pipeline for systematically constructing temporality-intensive preference pairs comprising three steps: selecting temporally rich videos, designing video-specific perturbation strategies, and evaluating model responses on clean and perturbed inputs. Complementing this data pipeline, we provide additional supervision signals via preference learning and propose a novel Progressive Pre-SFT Alignment strategy featuring two key innovations: a curriculum learning strategy which progressively increases perturbation difficulty to maximize data efficiency; and applying preference optimization before instruction tuning to incentivize fundamental temporal alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently improves Video LLM performance across multiple benchmarks with a relatively small set of self-generated DPO data. Our findings highlight TEMPLE as a scalable and efficient complement to SFT-based methods, paving the way for developing reliable Video LLMs.</description>

      <title>MAVERIX: Multimodal Audio-Visual Evaluation and Recognition IndeX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce MAVERIX (Multimodal audiovisual Evaluation and Recognition IndeX), a unified benchmark to probe the video understanding in multimodal LLMs, encompassing video, audio, text inputs with human performance baselines. Although recent advancements in models with vision and audio understanding capabilities have shown substantial progress, the field lacks a standardized evaluation framework to thoroughly assess their cross-modality comprehension performance. MAVERIX curates 2,556 questions from 700 videos, in the form of both multiple-choice and open-ended formats, explicitly designed to evaluate multimodal models through questions that necessitate tight integration of video and audio information, spanning a broad spectrum of agentic scenarios. MAVERIX uniquely provides models with audiovisual questions, closely mimicking the multimodal perceptual experiences available to humans during inference and decision-making processes. To our knowledge, MAVERIX is the first benchmark aimed explicitly at assessing comprehensive audiovisual integration in such granularity. Experiments with state-of-the-art models, including Qwen 2.5 Omni and Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, show performance around 64% accuracy, while human experts reach near-ceiling performance of 92.8%, exposing a substantial gap to human-level comprehension. With standardized evaluation protocols, a rigorously annotated pipeline, and a public toolkit, MAVERIX establishes a challenging testbed for advancing audiovisual multimodal intelligence.</description>

      <title>Suite-IN++: A FlexiWear BodyNet Integrating Global and Local Motion Features from Apple Suite for Robust Inertial Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of wearable technology has established multi-device ecosystems comprising smartphones, smartwatches, and headphones as critical enablers for ubiquitous pedestrian localization. However, traditional pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) struggles with diverse motion modes, while data-driven methods, despite improving accuracy, often lack robustness due to their reliance on a single-device setup. Therefore, a promising solution is to fully leverage existing wearable devices to form a flexiwear bodynet for robust and accurate pedestrian localization. This paper presents Suite-IN++, a deep learning framework for flexiwear bodynet-based pedestrian localization. Suite-IN++ integrates motion data from wearable devices on different body parts, using contrastive learning to separate global and local motion features. It fuses global features based on the data reliability of each device to capture overall motion trends and employs an attention mechanism to uncover cross-device correlations in local features, extracting motion details helpful for accurate localization. To evaluate our method, we construct a real-life flexiwear bodynet dataset, incorporating Apple Suite (iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods) across diverse walking modes and device configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that Suite-IN++ achieves superior localization accuracy and robustness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models in real-life pedestrian tracking scenarios.</description>

      <title>Process Reward Models That Think</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16828v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Step-by-step verifiers -- also known as process reward models (PRMs) -- are a key ingredient for test-time scaling. PRMs require step-level supervision, making them expensive to train. This work aims to build data-efficient PRMs as verbalized step-wise reward models that verify every step in the solution by generating a verification chain-of-thought (CoT). We propose ThinkPRM, a long CoT verifier fine-tuned on orders of magnitude fewer process labels than those required by discriminative PRMs. Our approach capitalizes on the inherent reasoning abilities of long CoT models, and outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge and discriminative verifiers -- using only 1% of the process labels in PRM800K -- across several challenging benchmarks. Specifically, ThinkPRM beats the baselines on ProcessBench, MATH-500, and AIME '24 under best-of-N selection and reward-guided search. In an out-of-domain evaluation on a subset of GPQA-Diamond and LiveCodeBench, our PRM surpasses discriminative verifiers trained on the full PRM800K by 8% and 4.5%, respectively. Lastly, under the same token budget, ThinkPRM scales up verification compute more effectively compared to LLM-as-a-Judge, outperforming it by 7.2% on a subset of ProcessBench. Our work highlights the value of generative, long CoT PRMs that can scale test-time compute for verification while requiring minimal supervision for training. Our code, data, and models are released at https://github.com/mukhal/thinkprm.</description>

      <title>OSVBench: Benchmarking LLMs on Specification Generation Tasks for Operating System Verification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce OSVBench, a new benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on the task of generating complete formal specifications for verifying the functional correctness of operating system kernels. This benchmark is built upon a real-world operating system kernel, Hyperkernel, and consists of 245 complex specification generation tasks in total, each of which is a long-context task of about 20k-30k tokens. The benchmark formulates the specification generation task as a program synthesis problem confined to a domain for specifying states and transitions. This formulation is provided to LLMs through a programming model. The LLMs must be able to understand the programming model and verification assumptions before delineating the correct search space for syntax and semantics and generating formal specifications. Guided by the operating system's high-level functional description, the LLMs are asked to generate a specification that fully describes all correct states and transitions for a potentially buggy code implementation of the operating system. Experimental results with 12 state-of-the-art LLMs indicate limited performance of existing LLMs on the specification generation task for operating system verification. Significant disparities in their performance highlight differences in their ability to handle long-context code generation tasks.

      <title>Evaluating the robustness of adversarial defenses in malware detection systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is a key tool for Android malware detection, effectively identifying malicious patterns in apps. However, ML-based detectors are vulnerable to evasion attacks, where small, crafted changes bypass detection. Despite progress in adversarial defenses, the lack of comprehensive evaluation frameworks in binary-constrained domains limits understanding of their robustness. We introduce two key contributions. First, Prioritized Binary Rounding, a technique to convert continuous perturbations into binary feature spaces while preserving high attack success and low perturbation size. Second, the sigma-binary attack, a novel adversarial method for binary domains, designed to achieve attack goals with minimal feature changes. Experiments on the Malscan dataset show that sigma-binary outperforms existing attacks and exposes key vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art defenses. Defenses equipped with adversary detectors, such as KDE, DLA, DNN+, and ICNN, exhibit significant brittleness, with attack success rates exceeding 90% using fewer than 10 feature modifications and reaching 100% with just 20. Adversarially trained defenses, including AT-rFGSM-k, AT-MaxMA, improves robustness under small budgets but remains vulnerable to unrestricted perturbations, with attack success rates of 99.45% and 96.62%, respectively. Although PAD-SMA demonstrates strong robustness against state-of-the-art gradient-based adversarial attacks by maintaining an attack success rate below 16.55%, the sigma-binary attack significantly outperforms these methods, achieving a 94.56% success rate under unrestricted perturbations. These findings highlight the critical need for precise method like sigma-binary to expose hidden vulnerabilities in existing defenses and support the development of more resilient malware detection systems.</description>

      <title>BEDI: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Embodied Agents on UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of low-altitude remote sensing and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Embodied Agents based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have shown significant potential in autonomous tasks. However, current evaluation methods for UAV-Embodied Agents (UAV-EAs) remain constrained by the lack of standardized benchmarks, diverse testing scenarios and open system interfaces. To address these challenges, we propose BEDI (Benchmark for Embodied Drone Intelligence), a systematic and standardized benchmark designed for evaluating UAV-EAs. Specifically, we introduce a novel Dynamic Chain-of-Embodied-Task paradigm based on the perception-decision-action loop, which decomposes complex UAV tasks into standardized, measurable subtasks. Building on this paradigm, we design a unified evaluation framework encompassing six core sub-skills: semantic perception, spatial perception, motion control, tool utilization, task planning and action generation. Furthermore, we develop a hybrid testing platform that incorporates a wide range of both virtual and real-world scenarios, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of UAV-EAs across diverse contexts. The platform also offers open and standardized interfaces, allowing researchers to customize tasks and extend scenarios, thereby enhancing flexibility and scalability in the evaluation process. Finally, through empirical evaluations of several state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, we reveal their limitations in embodied UAV tasks, underscoring the critical role of the BEDI benchmark in advancing embodied intelligence research and model optimization. By filling the gap in systematic and standardized evaluation within this field, BEDI facilitates objective model comparison and lays a robust foundation for future development in this field. Our benchmark is now publicly available at https://github.com/lostwolves/BEDI.</description>

      <title>Beyond Markovian: Reflective Exploration via Bayes-Adaptive RL for LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) have exhibited strong reasoning capabilities and emergent reflective behaviors, such as rethinking and error correction, as a form of in-context exploration. However, the Markovian policy obtained from conventional RL training does not give rise to reflective exploration behaviors since the policy depends on the history only through the state and therefore has no incentive to enrich identical states with additional context. Instead, RL exploration is only useful during training to learn the optimal policy in a trial-and-error manner. Therefore, it remains unclear whether reflective reasoning will emerge during RL, or why it is beneficial. To remedy this, we recast reflective exploration within a Bayesian RL framework, which optimizes the expected return under a posterior distribution over Markov decision processes induced by the training data. This Bayesian formulation admits uncertainty-adaptive policies that, through belief updates, naturally incentivize information-gathering actions and induce self-reflection behaviors. Our resulting algorithm, BARL, instructs the LLM to stitch and switch strategies based on the observed outcomes, offering principled guidance on when and how the model should reflectively explore. Empirical results on both synthetic and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that BARL outperforms conventional RL approaches, achieving superior test-time performance and token efficiency.

      <title>Large Language Models Miss the Multi-Agent Mark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21298v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent interest in Multi-Agent Systems of Large Language Models (MAS LLMs) has led to an increase in frameworks leveraging multiple LLMs to tackle complex tasks. However, much of this literature appropriates the terminology of MAS without engaging with its foundational principles. In this position paper, we highlight critical discrepancies between MAS theory and current MAS LLMs implementations, focusing on four key areas: the social aspect of agency, environment design, coordination and communication protocols, and measuring emergent behaviours. Our position is that many MAS LLMs lack multi-agent characteristics such as autonomy, social interaction, and structured environments, and often rely on oversimplified, LLM-centric architectures. The field may slow down and lose traction by revisiting problems the MAS literature has already addressed. Therefore, we systematically analyse this issue and outline associated research opportunities; we advocate for better integrating established MAS concepts and more precise terminology to avoid mischaracterisation and missed opportunities.</description>

      <title>LLMs Judging LLMs: A Simplex Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the challenge of automatically evaluating free-form outputs from large language models (LLMs), an increasingly common solution is to use LLMs themselves as the judging mechanism, without any gold-standard scores. Implicitly, this practice accounts for only sampling variability (aleatoric uncertainty) and ignores uncertainty about judge quality (epistemic uncertainty). While this is justified if judges are perfectly accurate, it is unclear when such an approach is theoretically valid and practically robust. We study these questions for the task of ranking LLM candidates from a novel geometric perspective: for $M$-level scoring systems, both LLM judges and candidates can be represented as points on an $(M-1)$-dimensional probability simplex, where geometric concepts (e.g., triangle areas) correspond to key ranking concepts. This perspective yields intuitive theoretical conditions and visual proofs for when rankings are identifiable; for instance, we provide a formal basis for the ``folk wisdom'' that LLM judges are more effective for two-level scoring ($M=2$) than multi-level scoring ($M&gt;2$). Leveraging the simplex, we design geometric Bayesian priors that encode epistemic uncertainty about judge quality and vary the priors to conduct sensitivity analyses. Experiments on LLM benchmarks show that rankings based solely on LLM judges are robust in many but not all datasets, underscoring both their widespread success and the need for caution. Our Bayesian method achieves substantially higher coverage rates than existing procedures, highlighting the importance of modeling epistemic uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Unlearning Inversion Attacks for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph unlearning methods aim to efficiently remove the impact of sensitive data from trained GNNs without full retraining, assuming that deleted information cannot be recovered. In this work, we challenge this assumption by introducing the graph unlearning inversion attack: given only black-box access to an unlearned GNN and partial graph knowledge, can an adversary reconstruct the removed edges? We identify two key challenges: varying probability-similarity thresholds for unlearned versus retained edges, and the difficulty of locating unlearned edge endpoints, and address them with TrendAttack. First, we derive and exploit the confidence pitfall, a theoretical and empirical pattern showing that nodes adjacent to unlearned edges exhibit a large drop in model confidence. Second, we design an adaptive prediction mechanism that applies different similarity thresholds to unlearned and other membership edges. Our framework flexibly integrates existing membership inference techniques and extends them with trend features. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that TrendAttack significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GNN membership inference baselines, exposing a critical privacy vulnerability in current graph unlearning methods.</description>

      <title>Unified Software Engineering Agent as AI Software Engineer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growth of Large Language Model (LLM) technology has raised expectations for automated coding. However, software engineering is more than coding and is concerned with activities including maintenance and evolution of a project. In this context, the concept of LLM agents has gained traction, which utilize LLMs as reasoning engines to invoke external tools autonomously. But is an LLM agent the same as an AI software engineer? In this paper, we seek to understand this question by developing a Unified Software Engineering agent or USEagent. Unlike existing work which builds specialized agents for specific software tasks such as testing, debugging, and repair, our goal is to build a unified agent which can orchestrate and handle multiple capabilities. This gives the agent the promise of handling complex scenarios in software development such as fixing an incomplete patch, adding new features, or taking over code written by others. We envision USEagent as the first draft of a future AI Software Engineer which can be a team member in future software development teams involving both AI and humans. To evaluate the efficacy of USEagent, we build a Unified Software Engineering bench (USEbench) comprising of myriad tasks such as coding, testing, and patching. USEbench is a judicious mixture of tasks from existing benchmarks such as SWE-bench, SWT-bench, and REPOCOD. In an evaluation on USEbench consisting of 1,271 repository-level software engineering tasks, USEagent shows improved efficacy compared to existing general agents such as OpenHands CodeActAgent. There exist gaps in the capabilities of USEagent for certain coding tasks, which provides hints on further developing the AI Software Engineer of the future.</description>

      <title>One Sample is Enough to Make Conformal Prediction Robust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any black-box model, conformal prediction (CP) returns prediction sets guaranteed to include the true label with high adjustable probability. Robust CP (RCP) extends the guarantee to the worst case noise up to a pre-defined magnitude. For RCP, a well-established approach is to use randomized smoothing since it is applicable to any black-box model and provides smaller sets compared to deterministic methods. However, smoothing-based robustness requires many model forward passes per each input which is computationally expensive. We show that conformal prediction attains some robustness even with a single forward pass on a randomly perturbed input. Using any binary certificate we propose a single sample robust CP (RCP1). Our approach returns robust sets with smaller average set size compared to SOTA methods which use many (e.g. 100) passes per input. Our key insight is to certify the conformal procedure itself rather than individual conformity scores. Our approach is agnostic to the task (classification and regression). We further extend our approach to smoothing-based robust conformal risk control.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Hybrid Quantized Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18240v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel Quadratic Binary Optimization (QBO) framework for training a quantized neural network. The framework enables the use of arbitrary activation and loss functions through spline interpolation, while Forward Interval Propagation addresses the nonlinearities and the multi-layered, composite structure of neural networks via discretizing activation functions into linear subintervals. This preserves the universal approximation properties of neural networks while allowing complex nonlinear functions accessible to quantum solvers, broadening their applicability in artificial intelligence. Theoretically, we derive an upper bound on the approximation error and the number of Ising spins required by deriving the sample complexity of the empirical risk minimization problem from an optimization perspective. A key challenge in solving the associated large-scale Quadratic Constrained Binary Optimization (QCBO) model is the presence of numerous constraints. To overcome this, we adopt the Quantum Conditional Gradient Descent (QCGD) algorithm, which solves QCBO directly on quantum hardware. We establish the convergence of QCGD under a quantum oracle subject to randomness, bounded variance, and limited coefficient precision, and further provide an upper bound on the Time-To-Solution. To enhance scalability, we further incorporate a decomposed copositive optimization scheme that replaces the monolithic lifted model with sample-wise subproblems. This decomposition substantially reduces the quantum resource requirements and enables efficient low-bit neural network training. We further propose the usage of QCGD and Quantum Progressive Hedging (QPH) algorithm to efficiently solve the decomposed problem.</description>

      <title>Radial Attention: $O(n\log n)$ Sparse Attention with Energy Decay for Long Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality video generation, but the additional temporal dimension significantly increases computational costs, making training and inference on long videos prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ dense attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\times$ speedup over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video generation up to 4$\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to 4.4$\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to 3.7$\times$ compared to dense attention inference.

      <title>How Not to Detect Prompt Injections with an LLM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05630v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM-integrated applications and agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where adversaries embed malicious instructions within seemingly benign input data to manipulate the LLM's intended behavior. Recent defenses based on known-answer detection (KAD) scheme have reported near-perfect performance by observing an LLM's output to classify input data as clean or contaminated. KAD attempts to repurpose the very susceptibility to prompt injection as a defensive mechanism. We formally characterize the KAD scheme and uncover a structural vulnerability that invalidates its core security premise. To exploit this fundamental vulnerability, we methodically design an adaptive attack, DataFlip. It consistently evades KAD defenses, achieving detection rates as low as $0\%$ while reliably inducing malicious behavior with a success rate of $91\%$, all without requiring white-box access to the LLM or any optimization procedures.</description>

      <title>Enhancing LLM Watermark Resilience Against Both Scrubbing and Spoofing Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Watermarking is a promising defense against the misuse of large language models (LLMs), yet it remains vulnerable to scrubbing and spoofing attacks. This vulnerability stems from an inherent trade-off governed by watermark window size: smaller windows resist scrubbing better but are easier to reverse-engineer, enabling low-cost statistics-based spoofing attacks. This work breaks this trade-off by introducing a novel mechanism, equivalent texture keys, where multiple tokens within a watermark window can independently support the detection. Based on the redundancy, we propose a novel watermark scheme with Sub-vocabulary decomposed Equivalent tExture Key (SEEK). It achieves a Pareto improvement, increasing the resilience against scrubbing attacks without compromising robustness to spoofing. Experiments demonstrate SEEK's superiority over prior method, yielding spoofing robustness gains of +88.2%/+92.3%/+82.0% and scrubbing robustness gains of +10.2%/+6.4%/+24.6% across diverse dataset settings.</description>

      <title>XiChen: An observation-scalable fully AI-driven global weather forecasting system with 4D variational knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven models have the potential to revolutionize weather forecasting, but still rely on initial conditions generated by costly Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems. Although recent end-to-end forecasting models attempt to bypass NWP systems, these methods lack scalable assimilation of new types of observational data. Here, we introduce XiChen, an observation-scalable fully AI-driven global weather forecasting system, wherein the entire pipeline, from Data Assimilation (DA) to medium-range forecasting, can be accomplished within only 15 seconds. XiChen is built upon a foundation model that is pre-trained for weather forecasting and subsequently fine-tuned to serve as both observation operators and DA models, thereby enabling the scalable assimilation of conventional and raw satellite observations. Furthermore, the integration of Four-Dimensional Variational (4DVar) knowledge ensures XiChen to achieve DA and medium-range forecasting accuracy comparable to operational NWP systems, with skillful forecasting lead time beyond 8.75 days. A key feature of XiChen is its ability to maintain physical balance constraints during DA, enabling observed variables to correct unobserved ones effectively. In single-point perturbation DA experiments, XiChen exhibits flow-dependent characteristics similar to those of traditional 4DVar systems. These results demonstrate that XiChen holds strong potential for fully AI-driven weather forecasting independent of NWP systems.</description>

      <title>SystolicAttention: Fusing FlashAttention within a Single Systolic Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11331v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer models rely heavily on the scaled dot-product attention (SDPA) operation, typically implemented as FlashAttention. Characterized by its frequent interleaving of matrix multiplications and softmax operations, FlashAttention fails to fully utilize the compute resources of modern systolic-array-based accelerators designed for consecutive and large matrix multiplications.
  To fully unleash the performance potential of systolic arrays for FlashAttention, we propose FSA, an enhanced systolic array architecture that runs the entire FlashAttention on the array without external vector units. Combined with SystolicAttention, an optimized kernel for FSA that achieves fine-grained and element-wise overlapping of FlashAttention operations, FSA maximizes array utilization while preserving the original floating-point operation order of FlashAttention. We implement FSA in synthesizable RTL and evaluate its performance against state-of-the-art systolic-array-based accelerators. Our results show that FSA achieves 1.77x and 4.83x higher attention FLOPs/s utilization compared to AWS Neuron-v2 and Google TPUv5e, respectively. We synthesize FSA in a 16 nm technology at 1.5 GHz, and results indicate only a 12% area overhead compared to a standard weight-stationary systolic array.</description>

      <title>Towards Resilient Safety-driven Unlearning for Diffusion Models against Downstream Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved impressive image generation quality and are increasingly fine-tuned for personalized applications. However, these models often inherit unsafe behaviors from toxic pretraining data, raising growing safety concerns. While recent safety-driven unlearning methods have made promising progress in suppressing model toxicity, they are found to be fragile to downstream fine-tuning, as we reveal that state-of-the-art methods largely fail to retain their effectiveness even when fine-tuned on entirely benign datasets. To mitigate this problem, in this paper, we propose ResAlign, a safety-driven unlearning framework with enhanced resilience against downstream fine-tuning. By modeling downstream fine-tuning as an implicit optimization problem with a Moreau envelope-based reformulation, ResAlign enables efficient gradient estimation to minimize the recovery of harmful behaviors. Additionally, a meta-learning strategy is proposed to simulate a diverse distribution of fine-tuning scenarios to improve generalization. Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets, fine-tuning methods, and configurations demonstrate that ResAlign consistently outperforms prior unlearning approaches in retaining safety, while effectively preserving benign generation capability. Our code and pretrained models are publicly available at https://github.com/AntigoneRandy/ResAlign.</description>

      <title>DREAM: Scalable Red Teaming for Text-to-Image Generative Systems via Distribution Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the integration of safety alignment and external filters, text-to-image (T2I) generative systems are still susceptible to producing harmful content, such as sexual or violent imagery. This raises serious concerns about unintended exposure and potential misuse. Red teaming, which aims to proactively identify diverse prompts that can elicit unsafe outputs from the T2I system, is increasingly recognized as an essential method for assessing and improving safety before real-world deployment. However, existing automated red teaming approaches often treat prompt discovery as an isolated, prompt-level optimization task, which limits their scalability, diversity, and overall effectiveness. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose DREAM, a scalable red teaming framework to automatically uncover diverse problematic prompts from a given T2I system. Unlike prior work that optimizes prompts individually, DREAM directly models the probabilistic distribution of the target system's problematic prompts, which enables explicit optimization over both effectiveness and diversity, and allows efficient large-scale sampling after training. To achieve this without direct access to representative training samples, we draw inspiration from energy-based models and reformulate the objective into a simple and tractable form. We further introduce GC-SPSA, an efficient optimization algorithm that provides stable gradient estimates through the long and potentially non-differentiable T2I pipeline. During inference, we also propose a diversity-aware sampling strategy to enhance prompt variety. The effectiveness of DREAM is validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of T2I models and safety filters in terms of both prompt success rate and diversity.

      <title>DRWKV: Focusing on Object Edges for Low-Light Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in preserving object edge continuity and fine structural details under extreme illumination degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV (Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Pic2Diagnosis: A Method for Diagnosis of Cardiovascular Diseases from the Printed ECG Pictures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a vital tool for diagnosing heart diseases. However, many disease patterns are derived from outdated datasets and traditional stepwise algorithms with limited accuracy. This study presents a method for direct cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis from ECG images, eliminating the need for digitization. The proposed approach utilizes a two-step curriculum learning framework, beginning with the pre-training of a classification model on segmentation masks, followed by fine-tuning on grayscale, inverted ECG images. Robustness is further enhanced through an ensemble of three models with averaged outputs, achieving an AUC of 0.9534 and an F1 score of 0.7801 on the BHF ECG Challenge dataset, outperforming individual models. By effectively handling real-world artifacts and simplifying the diagnostic process, this method offers a reliable solution for automated CVD diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings where printed or scanned ECG images are commonly used. Such an automated procedure enables rapid and accurate diagnosis, which is critical for timely intervention in CVD cases that often demand urgent care.</description>

      <title>Learning to Align Human Code Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in automating software development tasks. While recent advances leverage Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align models with human preferences, the optimal training strategy remains unclear across diverse code preference scenarios. This paper systematically investigates the roles of SFT and DPO in aligning LLMs with different code preferences. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, we hypothesize that SFT excels in scenarios with objectively verifiable optimal solutions, while applying SFT followed by DPO (S&amp;D) enables models to explore superior solutions in scenarios without objectively verifiable optimal solutions. Based on the analysis and experimental evidence, we propose Adaptive Preference Optimization (APO), a dynamic integration approach that adaptively amplifies preferred responses, suppresses dispreferred ones, and encourages exploration of potentially superior solutions during training. Extensive experiments across six representative code preference tasks validate our theoretical hypotheses and demonstrate that APO consistently matches or surpasses the performance of existing SFT and S&amp;D strategies. Our work provides both theoretical foundations and practical guidance for selecting appropriate training strategies in different code preference alignment scenarios.</description>

      <title>MUST-RAG: MUSical Text Question Answering with Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. While they exhibit strong zero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related applications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of music-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we propose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question answering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to LLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to questions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a music-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to effectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our experiment demonstrates that MusT-RAG significantly outperforms traditional fine-tuning approaches in enhancing LLMs' music domain adaptation capabilities, showing consistent improvements across both in-domain and out-of-domain MQA benchmarks. Additionally, our MusWikiDB proves substantially more effective than general Wikipedia corpora, delivering superior performance and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Dual Collaborative LLMs via Continual Fine-Tuning for Serendipitous Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional recommendation systems tend to trap users in strong feedback loops by excessively pushing content aligned with their historical preferences, thereby limiting exploration opportunities and causing content fatigue. Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate potential with their diverse content generation capabilities, existing LLM-enhanced dual-model frameworks face two major limitations: first, they overlook long-term preferences driven by group identity, leading to biased interest modeling; second, they suffer from static optimization flaws, as a one-time alignment process fails to leverage incremental user data for closed-loop optimization. To address these challenges, we propose the Co-Evolutionary Alignment (CoEA) method. For interest modeling bias, we introduce Dual-Stable Interest Exploration (DSIE) module, jointly modeling long-term group identity and short-term individual interests through parallel processing of behavioral sequences. For static optimization limitations, we design a Periodic Collaborative Optimization (PCO) mechanism. This mechanism regularly conducts preference verification on incremental data using the Relevance LLM, then guides the Novelty LLM to perform fine-tuning based on the verification results, and subsequently feeds back the output of the continually fine-tuned Novelty LLM to the Relevance LLM for re-evaluation, thereby achieving a dynamic closed-loop optimization. Extensive online and offline experiments verify the effectiveness of the CoEA model in serendipitous recommendation.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal wall pressure forecast of a rectangular cylinder with physics-aware DeepU-Fourier neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The wall pressure is of great importance in understanding the forces and structural responses induced by fluid. Recent works have investigated the potential of deep learning techniques in predicting mean pressure coefficients and fluctuating pressure coefficients, but most of existing deep learning frameworks are limited to predicting a single snapshot using full spatial information. To forecast spatiotemporal wall pressure of flow past a rectangular cylinder, this study develops a physics-aware DeepU-Fourier neural Network (DeepUFNet) deep learning model. DeepUFNet comprises the UNet structure and the Fourier neural network, with physical high-frequency loss control embedded in the model training stage to optimize model performance. Wind tunnel testing was performed to collect wall pressures on two-dimensional rectangular cylinders using high-frequency pressure scanning, thereby constructing a database for DeepUFNet training and testing. The DeepUFNet model is found capable of forecasting spatiotemporal wall pressure information with high accuracy on the rectangular cylinder with side ratio 1.5. The comparison between forecast results and experimental data presents agreement in statistical information and physical interpretation. It is also found that embedding a physical high-frequency loss control coefficient b in the DeepUFNet model can significantly improve model performance in forecasting spatiotemporal wall pressure information, particularly, high-order frequency fluctuation and wall pressure variance. Furthermore, the DeepUFNet extrapolation capability is tested with sparse spatial information input, and the model presents a satisfactory extrapolation ability. Last, the DeepUFNet is tested for generalization in unseen cases, rectangular cylinders with side ratio 4 and 3.75, and the model presents satisfactory generalization ability.</description>

      <title>GeoShield: Safeguarding Geolocation Privacy from Vision-Language Models via Adversarial Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable ability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a substantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a potential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often perform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may introduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose GeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy protection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a feature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical information, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints geo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module that jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure effectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on visual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore adversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by advanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating privacy concerns.</description>

      <title>DP-LLM: Runtime Model Adaptation with Dynamic Layer-wise Precision Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06041v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can we effectively handle queries for on-device large language models (LLMs) with varying runtime constraints, such as latency and accuracy? Multi-scale quantization addresses this challenge by enabling memory-efficient runtime model adaptation of LLMs through the overlaying of multiple model variants quantized to different bitwidths. Meanwhile, an important question still remains open-ended: how can models be properly configured to match a target precision or latency? While mixed-precision offers a promising solution, we take this further by leveraging the key observation that the sensitivity of each layer dynamically changes across decoding steps. Building on this insight, we introduce DP-LLM, a novel mechanism that dynamically assigns precision to each layer based on input values. Experimental results across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that DP-LLM achieves a superior performance-latency trade-off, outperforming prior approaches.</description>

      <title>Architecture-Aware Generalization Bounds for Temporal Networks: Theory and Fair Comparison Methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep temporal architectures such as TCNs achieve strong predictive performance on sequential data, yet theoretical understanding of their generalization remains limited. We address this gap through three contributions: introducing an evaluation methodology for temporal models, revealing surprising empirical phenomena about temporal dependence, and the first architecture-aware theoretical framework for dependent sequences.
  Fair-Comparison Methodology. We introduce evaluation protocols that fix effective sample size $N_{\text{eff}}$ to isolate temporal structure effects from information content.
  Empirical Findings. Applying this method reveals that under $N_{\text{eff}} = 2000$, strongly dependent sequences ($\rho = 0.8$) exhibit approx' $76\%$ smaller generalization gaps than weakly dependent ones ($\rho = 0.2$), challenging the conventional view that dependence universally impedes learning. However, observed convergence rates ($N_{\text{eff}}^{-1.21}$ to $N_{\text{eff}}^{-0.89}$) significantly exceed theoretical worst-case predictions ($N^{-0.5}$), revealing that temporal architectures exploit problem structure in ways current theory does not capture.
  Lastly, we develop the first architecture-aware generalization bounds for deep temporal models on exponentially $\beta$-mixing sequences. By embedding Golowich et al.'s i.i.d. class bound within a novel blocking scheme that partitions $N$ samples into approx' $B \approx N/\log N$ quasi-independent blocks, we establish polynomial sample complexity under convex Lipschitz losses. The framework achieves $\sqrt{D}$ depth scaling alongside the product of layer-wise norms $R = \prod_{\ell=1}^{D} M^{(\ell)}$, avoiding exponential dependence. While these bounds are conservative, they prove learnability and identify architectural scaling laws, providing worst-case baselines that highlight where future theory must improve.</description>

      <title>Efficient Approximate Posterior Sampling with Annealed Langevin Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling in the context of score based generative models. We have a trained score network for a prior $p(x)$, a measurement model $p(y|x)$, and are tasked with sampling from the posterior $p(x|y)$. Prior work has shown this to be intractable in KL (in the worst case) under well-accepted computational hardness assumptions. Despite this, popular algorithms for tasks such as image super-resolution, stylization, and reconstruction enjoy empirical success. Rather than establishing distributional assumptions or restricted settings under which exact posterior sampling is tractable, we view this as a more general "tilting" problem of biasing a distribution towards a measurement. Under minimal assumptions, we show that one can tractably sample from a distribution that is simultaneously close to the posterior of a noised prior in KL divergence and the true posterior in Fisher divergence. Intuitively, this combination ensures that the resulting sample is consistent with both the measurement and the prior. To the best of our knowledge these are the first formal results for (approximate) posterior sampling in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Learning to Select MCP Algorithms: From Traditional ML to Dual-Channel GAT-MLP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Maximum Clique Problem (MCP) is a foundational NP-hard problem with wide-ranging applications, yet no single algorithm consistently outperforms all others across diverse graph instances. This underscores the critical need for instance-aware algorithm selection, a domain that remains largely unexplored for the MCP. To address this gap, we propose a novel learning-based framework that integrates both traditional machine learning and graph neural networks. We first construct a benchmark dataset by executing four state-of-the-art exact MCP solvers on a diverse collection of graphs and extracting their structural features. An evaluation of conventional classifiers establishes Random Forest as a strong baseline and reveals that connectivity and topological features are key predictors of performance. Building on these insights, we develop GAT-MLP, a dual-channel model that combines a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to encode local graph structure with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to model global features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GAT-MLP achieves superior and consistent performance, significantly outperforming all baseline methods. Our results highlight the effectiveness of the dual-channel architecture and the promise of graph neural networks for combinatorial algorithm selection, achieving 90.43% accuracy in choosing the optimal solver.

      <title>Multi-head Transformers Provably Learn Symbolic Multi-step Reasoning via Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multi-step reasoning tasks. However, understandings of the underlying mechanisms by which they acquire these abilities through training remain limited, particularly from a theoretical standpoint. This work investigates how transformers learn to solve symbolic multi-step reasoning problems through chain-of-thought processes, focusing on path-finding in trees. We analyze two intertwined tasks: a backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to the root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements two-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then reversing it to produce the root-to-goal path. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in the dynamics of gradient descent, shows that trained one-layer transformers can provably solve both tasks with generalization guarantees to unseen trees. In particular, our multi-phase training dynamics for forward reasoning elucidate how different attention heads learn to specialize and coordinate autonomously to solve the two subtasks in a single autoregressive path. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of how trained transformers can implement sequential algorithmic procedures. Moreover, they offer insights into the emergence of reasoning abilities, suggesting that when tasks are structured to take intermediate chain-of-thought steps, even shallow multi-head transformers can effectively solve problems that would otherwise require deeper architectures.</description>

      <title>Shadow in the Cache: Unveiling and Mitigating Privacy Risks of KV-cache in LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache, which stores intermediate attention computations (Key and Value pairs) to avoid redundant calculations, is a fundamental mechanism for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference. However, this efficiency optimization introduces significant yet underexplored privacy risks. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of these vulnerabilities, demonstrating that an attacker can reconstruct sensitive user inputs directly from the KV-cache. We design and implement three distinct attack vectors: a direct Inversion Attack, a more broadly applicable and potent Collision Attack, and a semantic-based Injection Attack. These methods demonstrate the practicality and severity of KV-cache privacy leakage issues. To mitigate this, we propose KV-Cloak, a novel, lightweight, and efficient defense mechanism. KV-Cloak uses a reversible matrix-based obfuscation scheme, combined with operator fusion, to secure the KV-cache. Our extensive experiments show that KV-Cloak effectively thwarts all proposed attacks, reducing reconstruction quality to random noise. Crucially, it achieves this robust security with virtually no degradation in model accuracy and minimal performance overhead, offering a practical solution for trustworthy LLM deployment.</description>

      <title>Image2Net: Datasets, Benchmark and Hybrid Framework to Convert Analog Circuit Diagrams into Netlists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) exhibits great potential in designing of analog integrated circuits (IC) because of its excellence in abstraction and generalization for knowledge. However, further development of LLM-based analog ICs heavily relies on textual description of analog ICs, while existing analog ICs are mostly illustrated in image-based circuit diagrams rather than text-based netlists. Converting circuit diagrams to netlists help LLMs to enrich the knowledge of analog IC. Nevertheless, previously proposed conversion frameworks face challenges in further application because of limited support of image styles and circuit elements. Up to now, it still remains a challenging task to effectively convert complex circuit diagrams into netlists. To this end, this paper constructs and opensources a new dataset with rich styles of circuit diagrams as well as balanced distribution of simple and complex analog ICs. And a hybrid framework, named Image2Net, is proposed for practical conversion from circuit diagrams to netlists. The netlist edit distance (NED) is also introduced to precisely assess the difference between the converted netlists and ground truth. Based on our benchmark, Image2Net achieves 80.77% successful rate, which is 34.62%-45.19% higher than previous works. Specifically, the proposed work shows 0.116 averaged NED, which is 62.1%-69.6% lower than state-of-the-arts. Our datasets and benchmark are available at https://github.com/LAD021/ci2n_datasets.</description>

      <title>FLAIR: Frequency- and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13544v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity and spatial localization, leading to an over-reliance on redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency- and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key innovations. The first is Band-Localized Activation (BLA), a novel activation designed for joint frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). Through structured frequency control and spatially localized responses, BLA effectively mitigates spectral bias and enhances training stability. The second is Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet transform to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency information to the network, enabling precise frequency selection and adaptive band control. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs in 2D image representation, as well as 3D shape reconstruction and novel view synthesis.</description>

      <title>Learning to Use AI for Learning: Teaching Responsible Use of AI Chatbot to K-12 Students Through an AI Literacy Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into daily life, there is a growing need to equip the next generation with the ability to apply, interact with, evaluate, and collaborate with AI systems responsibly. Prior research highlights the urgent demand from K-12 educators to teach students the ethical and effective use of AI for learning. To address this need, we designed an Large-Language Model (LLM)-based module to teach prompting literacy. This includes scenario-based deliberate practice activities with direct interaction with intelligent LLM agents, aiming to foster secondary school students' responsible engagement with AI chatbots. We conducted two iterations of classroom deployment in 11 authentic secondary education classrooms, and evaluated 1) AI-based auto-grader's capability; 2) students' prompting performance and confidence changes towards using AI for learning; and 3) the quality of learning and assessment materials. Results indicated that the AI-based auto-grader could grade student-written prompts with satisfactory quality. In addition, the instructional materials supported students in improving their prompting skills through practice and led to positive shifts in their perceptions of using AI for learning. Furthermore, data from Study 1 informed assessment revisions in Study 2. Analyses of item difficulty and discrimination in Study 2 showed that True/False and open-ended questions could measure prompting literacy more effectively than multiple-choice questions for our target learners. These promising outcomes highlight the potential for broader deployment and highlight the need for broader studies to assess learning effectiveness and assessment design.</description>

      <title>ONG: Orthogonal Natural Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17169v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal Gradient Descent (OGD) has emerged as a powerful method for continual learning. However, its Euclidean projections do not leverage the underlying information-geometric structure of the problem, which can lead to suboptimal convergence in learning tasks. To address this, we propose incorporating the natural gradient into OGD and present \textbf{ONG (Orthogonal Natural Gradient Descent)}. ONG preconditions each new task-specific gradient with an efficient EKFAC approximation of the inverse Fisher information matrix, yielding updates that follow the steepest descent direction under a Riemannian metric. To preserve performance on previously learned tasks, ONG projects these natural gradients onto the orthogonal complement of prior tasks' natural gradients. We provide an initial theoretical justification for this procedure, introduce the Orthogonal Natural Gradient Descent (ONG) algorithm, and present preliminary results on the Permuted and Rotated MNIST benchmarks. Our preliminary results, however, indicate that a naive combination of natural gradients and orthogonal projections has potential issues. This finding has motivated continued future work focused on robustly reconciling these geometric perspectives to develop a continual learning method, establishing a more rigorous theoretical foundation with formal convergence guarantees, and extending empirical validation to large-scale continual learning benchmarks.</description>

      <title>MedGR$^2$: Breaking the Data Barrier for Medical Reasoning via Generative Reward Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality, multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets. Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly generalizable medical AI.</description>

      <title>HodgeFormer: Transformers for Learnable Operators on Triangular Meshes through Data-Driven Hodge Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01839v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Currently, prominent Transformer architectures applied on graphs and meshes for shape analysis tasks employ traditional attention layers that heavily utilize spectral features requiring costly eigenvalue decomposition-based methods. To encode the mesh structure, these methods derive positional embeddings, that heavily rely on eigenvalue decomposition based operations, e.g. on the Laplacian matrix, or on heat-kernel signatures, which are then concatenated to the input features. This paper proposes a novel approach inspired by the explicit construction of the Hodge Laplacian operator in Discrete Exterior Calculus as a product of discrete Hodge operators and exterior derivatives, i.e. $(L := \star_0^{-1} d_0^T \star_1 d_0)$. We adjust the Transformer architecture in a novel deep learning layer that utilizes the multi-head attention mechanism to approximate Hodge matrices $\star_0$, $\star_1$ and $\star_2$ and learn families of discrete operators $L$ that act on mesh vertices, edges and faces. Our approach results in a computationally-efficient architecture that achieves comparable performance in mesh segmentation and classification tasks, through a direct learning framework, while eliminating the need for costly eigenvalue decomposition operations or complex preprocessing operations.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Decentralized Federated Learning via Explainable Adaptive Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables collaborative model training without a central server, but it remains vulnerable to privacy leakage because shared model updates can expose sensitive information through inversion, reconstruction, and membership inference attacks. Differential Privacy (DP) provides formal safeguards, yet existing DP-enabled DFL methods operate as black-boxes that cannot track cumulative noise added across clients and rounds, forcing each participant to inject worst-case perturbations that severely degrade accuracy. We propose PrivateDFL, a new explainable and privacy-preserving framework that addresses this gap by combining a HyperDimensional Computing (HD) model with a transparent DP noise accountant tailored to decentralized learning. HD offers structured, noise-tolerant high-dimensional representations, while the accountant explicitly tracks cumulative perturbations so each client adds only the minimal incremental noise required to satisfy its (epsilon, delta) budget. This yields significantly tighter and more interpretable privacy-utility tradeoffs than prior DP-DFL approaches. Experiments on MNIST (image), ISOLET (speech), and UCI-HAR (wearable sensor) show that PrivateDFL consistently surpasses centralized DP-SGD and Renyi-DP Transformer and deep learning baselines under both IID and non-IID partitions, improving accuracy by up to 24.4% on MNIST, over 80% on ISOLET, and 14.7% on UCI-HAR, while reducing inference latency by up to 76 times and energy consumption by up to 36 times. These results position PrivateDFL as an efficient and trustworthy solution for privacy-sensitive pattern recognition applications such as healthcare, finance, human-activity monitoring, and industrial sensing. Future work will extend the accountant to adversarial participation, heterogeneous privacy budgets, and dynamic topologies.</description>

      <title>U-Mamba2: Scaling State Space Models for Dental Anatomy Segmentation in CBCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12069v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is a widely used 3D imaging technique in dentistry, providing volumetric information about the anatomical structures of jaws and teeth. Accurate segmentation of these anatomies is critical for clinical applications such as diagnosis and surgical planning, but remains time-consuming and challenging. In this paper, we present U-Mamba2, a new neural network architecture designed for multi-anatomy CBCT segmentation in the context of the ToothFairy3 challenge. U-Mamba2 integrates the Mamba2 state space models into the U-Net architecture, enforcing stronger structural constraints for higher efficiency without compromising performance. In addition, we integrate interactive click prompts with cross-attention blocks, pre-train U-Mamba2 using self-supervised learning, and incorporate dental domain knowledge into the model design to address key challenges of dental anatomy segmentation in CBCT. Extensive experiments, including independent tests, demonstrate that U-Mamba2 is both effective and efficient, securing first place in both tasks of the Toothfairy3 challenge. In Task 1, U-Mamba2 achieved a mean Dice of 0.84, HD95 of 38.17 with the held-out test data, with an average inference time of 40.58s. In Task 2, U-Mamba2 achieved the mean Dice of 0.87 and HD95 of 2.15 with the held-out test data. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhiqin1998/UMamba2.</description>

      <title>CHOIR: A Chatbot-mediated Organizational Memory Leveraging Communication in University Research Labs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: University research labs often rely on chat-based platforms for communication and project management, where valuable knowledge surfaces but is easily lost in message streams. Documentation can preserve knowledge, but it requires ongoing maintenance and is challenging to navigate. Drawing on formative interviews that revealed organizational memory challenges in labs, we designed CHOIR, an LLM-based chatbot that supports organizational memory through four key functions: document-grounded Q&amp;A, Q&amp;A sharing for follow-up discussion, knowledge extraction from conversations, and AI-assisted document updates. We deployed CHOIR in four research labs for one month (n=21), where the lab members asked 107 questions and lab directors updated documents 38 times in the organizational memory. Our findings reveal a privacy-awareness tension: questions were asked privately, limiting directors' visibility into documentation gaps. Students often avoided contribution due to challenges in generalizing personal experiences into universal documentation. We contribute design implications for privacy-preserving awareness and supporting context-specific knowledge documentation.</description>

      <title>Why Chain of Thought Fails in Clinical Text Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to clinical care, a domain where both accuracy and transparent reasoning are critical for safe and trustworthy deployment. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which elicits step-by-step reasoning, has demonstrated improvements in performance and interpretability across a wide range of tasks. However, its effectiveness in clinical contexts remains largely unexplored, particularly in the context of electronic health records (EHRs), the primary source of clinical documentation, which are often lengthy, fragmented, and noisy. In this work, we present the first large-scale systematic study of CoT for clinical text understanding. We assess 95 advanced LLMs on 87 real-world clinical text tasks, covering 9 languages and 8 task types. Contrary to prior findings in other domains, we observe that 86.3\% of models suffer consistent performance degradation in the CoT setting. More capable models remain relatively robust, while weaker ones suffer substantial declines. To better characterize these effects, we perform fine-grained analyses of reasoning length, medical concept alignment, and error profiles, leveraging both LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and clinical expert evaluation. Our results uncover systematic patterns in when and why CoT fails in clinical contexts, which highlight a critical paradox: CoT enhances interpretability but may undermine reliability in clinical text tasks. This work provides an empirical basis for clinical reasoning strategies of LLMs, highlighting the need for transparent and trustworthy approaches.</description>

      <title>Learn the Ropes, Then Trust the Wins: Self-imitation with Progressive Exploration for Agentic Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22601v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks, yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off. Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL instability due to the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent's own experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway divergence. We propose SPEAR, a self-imitation learning (SIL) recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL, where a replay buffer stores good experience for off-policy update, by gradually steering the policy entropy across stages. Specifically, the proposed curriculum scheduling harmonizes intrinsic reward shaping and self-imitation to 1) expedite exploration via frequent tool interactions at the beginning, and 2) strengthen exploitation of successful tactics upon convergence towards familiarity with the environment. We also combine bag-of-tricks of industrial RL optimizations for a strong baseline Dr.BoT to demonstrate our effectiveness. In ALFWorld and WebShop, SPEAR increases the success rates of GRPO/GiGPO/Dr.BoT by up to 16.1%/5.1%/8.6% and 20.7%/11.8%/13.9%, respectively. In AIME24 and AIME25, SPEAR boosts Dr.BoT by up to 3.8% and 6.1%, respectively. Such gains incur only 10%-25% extra theoretical complexity and negligible runtime overhead in practice, demonstrating the plug-and-play scalability of SPEAR.</description>

      <title>SimuHome: A Temporal- and Environment-Aware Benchmark for Smart Home LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents excel at multi-step, tool-augmented tasks. However, smart homes introduce distinct challenges, requiring agents to handle latent user intents, temporal dependencies, device constraints, scheduling, and more. The main bottlenecks for developing smart home agents with such capabilities include the lack of a realistic simulation environment where agents can interact with devices and observe the results, as well as a challenging benchmark to evaluate them. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{SimuHome}$, a time-accelerated home environment that simulates smart devices, supports API calls, and reflects changes in environmental variables. By building the simulator on the Matter protocol, the global industry standard for smart home communication, SimuHome provides a high-fidelity environment, and agents validated in SimuHome can be deployed on real Matter-compliant devices with minimal adaptation. We provide a challenging benchmark of 600 episodes across twelve user query types that require the aforementioned capabilities. Our evaluation of 16 agents under a unified ReAct framework reveals distinct capabilities and limitations across models. Models under 7B parameters exhibited negligible performance across all query types. Even GPT-4.1, the best-performing standard model, struggled with implicit intent inference, state verification, and particularly temporal scheduling. While reasoning models such as GPT-5.1 consistently outperformed standard models on every query type, they required over three times the average inference time, which can be prohibitive for real-time smart home applications. This highlights a critical trade-off between task performance and real-world practicality.</description>

      <title>CORE-3D: Context-aware Open-vocabulary Retrieval by Embeddings in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics, supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25721v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an extended version of the AI Productivity Index (APEX-v1-extended), a benchmark for assessing whether frontier models are capable of performing economically valuable tasks in four jobs: investment banking associate, management consultant, big law associate, and primary care physician (MD). This technical report details the extensions to APEX-v1, including an increase in the held-out evaluation set from n = 50 to n = 100 cases per job (n = 400 total) and updates to the grading methodology. We present a new leaderboard, where GPT5 (Thinking = High) remains the top performing model with a score of 67.0%. APEX-v1-extended shows that frontier models still have substantial limitations when performing typical professional tasks. To support further research, we are open sourcing n = 25 non-benchmark example cases per role (n = 100 total) along with our evaluation harness.</description>

      <title>PCPO: Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization for Aligning Image Generation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image (T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process, leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality. The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the state-of-the-art DanceGRPO. Code is available at https://github.com/jaylee2000/pcpo/.</description>

      <title>TimeScope: Towards Task-Oriented Temporal Grounding In Long Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying key temporal intervals within long videos, known as temporal grounding (TG), is important to video understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new form of the temporal grounding problem, \textbf{Task-oriented Temporal Grounding} (\textbf{ToTG}), which is driven by the requirements of downstream tasks rather than explicit time-interval descriptions. For example, a ToTG input may be "explain why the man in the video is sent to the hospital," whereas traditional TG would take an explicit temporal description such as "the moments when the man is tripped by a stone and falls to the ground." This new ToTG formulation presents significant challenges for existing TG methods, as it requires jointly performing deep task comprehension and fine-grained temporal localization within long videos. To address these challenges, we conduct a systematic set of studies. First, we construct \textbf{a new benchmark ToTG-Bench}, which comprehensively evaluates ToTG performance across diverse settings. Second, we introduce \textbf{a new temporal-ground method TimeScope}, which performs coarse-to-fine localization through a progressive reasoning process. Leveraging extensive supervised fine-tuning with carefully curated chain-of-thought (CoT) data from a variety of scenarios, TimeScope generalizes effectively across tasks and domains. Our evaluation demonstrates \textbf{TimeScope's empirical advantages} over existing baselines from three perspectives: (1) substantial improvements in grounding precision, (2) significant benefits to downstream tasks, and (3) strong generalizability across different scenarios. All models, datasets, and source code will be fully open-sourced to support future research in this area.</description>

      <title>A Practitioner's Guide to Multi-turn Agentic Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study what actually works and what doesn't for training large language models as agents via multi-turn reinforcement learning. Despite rapid progress, existing frameworks and definitions are fragmented, and there is no systematic formulation or analysis of which design choices matter across tasks. We address this gap by first breaking down the design space into three inter-related pillars -- environment, reward, and policy -- and empirically derive a recipe for training LLM agents in situated textual domains. In particular, we test TextWorld and ALFWorld, popular domains for testing situated embodied reasoning, as well as SWE-Gym for more software engineering style tasks. (i) For the environment, we analyze the impacts of task complexity in terms of sizes of the state and action spaces as well as optimal solution length, finding that even simple environments within a domain can provide signal on how well an agent can generalize to more complex tasks. (ii) For the reward, we ablate relative reward sparsity, observing that while dense turn-level rewards accelerate training, performance and stability is highly dependent on the choice of RL algorithm. (iii) And for the agent's policy, we explore the interplay between reward sparsity and biased (PPO, GRPO) and unbiased (RLOO) policy gradient methods in addition to showing how to find the optimal Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to RL training ratio given a fixed budget. We distill these findings into a training recipe that guides co-design across the three pillars, facilitating research and practical efforts in multi-turn agentic RL.

      <title>AdaDetectGPT: Adaptive Detection of LLM-Generated Text with Statistical Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01268v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate. Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the improvement can reach up to 37\%. A python implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/Mamba413/AdaDetectGPT.</description>

      <title>Hallucination reduction with CASAL: Contrastive Activation Steering For Amortized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but often hallucinate, confidently providing incorrect answers instead of admitting ignorance. Prior work has shown that models encode linear representations of their own knowledge and that activation steering can reduce hallucinations. These approaches, however, require real-time monitoring and intervention during inference. We introduce Contrastive Activation Steering for Amortized Learning (CASAL), an efficient algorithm that connects interpretability with amortized optimization. CASAL directly bakes the benefits of activation steering into model's weights. Once trained, LLMs answer questions they know while abstaining from answering those they do not. CASAL's light-weight design requires training only a submodule of a single transformer layer and yet reduces hallucination by 30%-40% across multiple short-form QA benchmarks. CASAL is 30x more compute-efficient and 20x more data-efficient than strong LoRA-based baselines such as SFT and DPO, boosting its practical applicability in data scarce domains. Importantly, CASAL also generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution (OOD) domains. We showcase CASAL's flexibility in mitigating hallucinations in both text-only and vision-language models. To our knowledge, CASAL is the first steering-based training method that has been shown to be effective for both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. CASAL represents a promising step forward for applying interpretability-inspired method for practical deployment in production systems.</description>

      <title>mini-vec2vec: Scaling Universal Geometry Alignment with Linear Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build upon vec2vec, a procedure designed to align text embedding spaces without parallel data. vec2vec finds a near-perfect alignment, but it is expensive and unstable. We present mini-vec2vec, a simple and efficient alternative that requires substantially lower computational cost and is highly robust. Moreover, the learned mapping is a linear transformation. Our method consists of three main stages: a tentative matching of pseudo-parallel embedding vectors, transformation fitting, and iterative refinement. Our linear alternative exceeds the original instantiation of vec2vec by orders of magnitude in efficiency, while matching or exceeding their results. The method's stability and interpretable algorithmic steps facilitate scaling and unlock new opportunities for adoption in new domains and fields.</description>

      <title>RAMAC: Multimodal Risk-Aware Offline Reinforcement Learning and the Role of Behavior Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In safety-critical domains where online data collection is infeasible, offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers an attractive alternative but only if policies deliver high returns without incurring catastrophic lower-tail risk. Prior work on risk-averse offline RL achieves safety at the cost of value or model-based pessimism, and restricted policy classes that limit policy expressiveness, whereas diffusion/flow-based expressive generative policies trained with a behavioral-cloning (BC) objective have been used only in risk-neutral settings. Here, we address this gap by introducing the \textbf{Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC)}, which couples an expressive generative actor with a distributional critic and, to our knowledge, is the first model-free approach that learns \emph{risk-aware expressive generative policies}. RAMAC differentiates a composite objective that adds a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) term to a BC loss, achieving risk-sensitive learning in complex multimodal scenarios. Since out-of-distribution (OOD) actions are a major driver of catastrophic failures in offline RL, we further analyze OOD behavior under prior-anchored perturbation schemes from recent BC-regularized risk-averse offline RL. This clarifies why a behavior-regularized objective that directly constrains the expressive generative policy to the dataset support provides an effective, risk-agnostic mechanism for suppressing OOD actions in modern expressive policies. We instantiate RAMAC with a diffusion-based actor, using it both to illustrate the analysis in a 2-D risky bandit and to deploy OOD-action detectors on Stochastic-D4RL benchmarks, empirically validating our insights. Across these tasks, we observe consistent gains in $\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$ while maintaining strong returns. Our implementation is available at GitHub: https://github.com/KaiFukazawa/RAMAC.git</description>

      <title>General Exploratory Bonus for Optimistic Exploration in RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimistic exploration is central to improving sample efficiency in reinforcement learning with human feedback, yet existing exploratory bonus methods to incentivize exploration often fail to realize optimism. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that current formulations, under KL or $\alpha$-divergence regularization, unintentionally bias exploration toward high-probability regions of the reference model, thereby reinforcing conservative behavior instead of promoting discovery of uncertain regions. To address this pitfall, we introduce the General Exploratory Bonus (GEB), a novel theoretical framework that provably satisfies the optimism principle. GEB counteracts divergence-induced bias via reference-dependent reward regulation and unifies prior heuristic bonuses as special cases, while extending naturally across the full $\alpha$-divergence family. Empirically, GEB consistently outperforms baselines on alignment tasks across multiple divergence settings and large language model backbones. These results demonstrate that GEB offers both a principled and practical solution for optimistic exploration in RLHF.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Agent Collaboration for C to Rust Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Translating C to memory-safe languages, like Rust, prevents critical memory safety vulnerabilities that are prevalent in legacy C software. Existing approaches for C to safe Rust translation, including LLM-assisted ones, do not generalize on larger (&gt; 500 LoC) C codebases because they depend on complex program analyses that frequently break. In this work, we present ACToR (Adversarial C To Rust translator), a simple LLM agent-based approach. Inspired by GANs, ACToR pits a generator agent against a discriminator agent, which collaborate to iteratively generate a Rust translation. On each iteration, the translator agent synthesizes and refines a Rust translation to pass an existing suite of tests, and then the discriminator agent finds new failing tests. We demonstrate that ACToR translates all of the 63 real-world command-line utilities considered in our benchmarks, which have an average size of 473 lines of code, and it achieves over 90% test pass rate with zero human intervention during translation. To our knowledge, it is the first work to show evidence that an agent-centric approach can reliably and automatically convert standalone command-line C programs at this scale. Furthermore, ACToR improves translation correctness by up to 25.1% compared to baseline, non-adversarial approaches.</description>

      <title>Thinking on the Fly: Test-Time Reasoning Enhancement via Latent Thought Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shifted from explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to more efficient latent reasoning, where intermediate thoughts are represented as vectors rather than text. However, latent reasoning can be brittle on challenging, out-of-distribution tasks where robust reasoning is most critical. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Latent Thought Policy Optimization (LTPO), a parameter-free framework that enhances LLM reasoning entirely at test time, without requiring model parameter updates. LTPO treats intermediate latent "thought" vectors as dynamic parameters that are actively optimized for each problem instance. It employs an online policy gradient method guided by an intrinsic, confidence-based reward signal computed directly from the frozen LLM's own output distributions, eliminating the need for external supervision or expensive text generation during optimization. Extensive experiments on five reasoning benchmarks show that LTPO not only matches or surpasses strong baselines on standard tasks but also demonstrates remarkable robustness where others fail. Most notably, on highly challenging AIME benchmarks where existing latent reasoning baselines collapse to near-zero accuracy, LTPO delivers substantial improvements, showcasing a unique capability for complex reasoning.</description>

      <title>SwiReasoning: Switch-Thinking in Latent and Explicit for Pareto-Superior Reasoning LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work shows that, beyond discrete reasoning through explicit chain-of-thought steps, which are limited by the boundaries of natural languages, large language models (LLMs) can also reason continuously in latent space, allowing richer information per step and thereby improving token efficiency. Despite this promise, latent reasoning still faces two challenges, especially in training-free settings: 1) purely latent reasoning broadens the search distribution by maintaining multiple implicit paths, which diffuses probability mass, introduces noise, and impedes convergence to a single high-confidence solution, thereby hurting accuracy; and 2) overthinking persists even without explicit text, wasting tokens and degrading efficiency. To address these issues, we introduce SwiReasoning, a training-free framework for LLM reasoning which features two key innovations: 1) SwiReasoning dynamically switches between explicit and latent reasoning, guided by block-wise confidence estimated from entropy trends in next-token distributions, to balance exploration and exploitation and promote timely convergence. 2) By limiting the maximum number of thinking-block switches, SwiReasoning curbs overthinking and improves token efficiency across varying problem difficulties. On widely used mathematics and STEM benchmarks, SwiReasoning consistently improves average accuracy by 1.5%-2.8% across reasoning LLMs of different model families and scales. Furthermore, under constrained budgets, SwiReasoning improves average token efficiency by 56%-79%, with larger gains as budgets tighten.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06249v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 2025 Multimodal Models for Low-Resource Contexts and Social Impact (MMLoSo) Language Challenge addresses one of India's most pressing linguistic gaps: the lack of resources for its diverse low-resource languages (LRLs). In this study, we investigate whether enforcing cross-lingual similarity in specific internal layers of a decoder-only multilingual large language model (LLM) can improve translation quality from LRL to high-resource language (HRL). Specifically, we combine Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity metric that encourages representations of different languages to align, with REPINA, a regularization method that constrains parameter updates to remain close to the pretrained model, into a joint method we call TRepLiNa. In this research project, we experiment with zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings using Aya-23 8B with QLoRA across MMLoSo shared task language pairs (Mundari, Santali, Bhili) with Hindi/English pivots. Our results show that aligning mid-level layers using TRepLiNa (CKA+REPINA) is a low-cost, practical approach to improving LRL translation, especially in data-scarce settings.</description>

      <title>Extreme Amodal Face Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme amodal detection is the task of inferring the 2D location of objects that are not fully visible in the input image but are visible within an expanded field-of-view. This differs from amodal detection, where the object is partially visible within the input image, but is occluded. In this paper, we consider the sub-problem of face detection, since this class provides motivating applications involving safety and privacy, but do not tailor our method specifically to this class. Existing approaches rely on image sequences so that missing detections may be interpolated from surrounding frames or make use of generative models to sample possible completions. In contrast, we consider the single-image task and propose a more efficient, sample-free approach that makes use of the contextual cues from the image to infer the presence of unseen faces. We design a heatmap-based extreme amodal object detector that addresses the problem of efficiently predicting a lot (the out-of-frame region) from a little (the image) with a selective coarse-to-fine decoder. Our method establishes strong results for this new task, even outperforming less efficient generative approaches.

      <title>Dejavu: Towards Experience Feedback Learning for Embodied Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embodied agents face a fundamental limitation: once deployed in real-world environments to perform specific tasks, they are unable to acquire additional knowledge to enhance task performance. In this paper, we propose a general post-deployment learning framework Dejavu, which employs an Experience Feedback Network (EFN) and augments the frozen Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policy with retrieved execution memories. EFN identifies contextually prior action experiences and conditions action prediction on this retrieved guidance. We adopt reinforcement learning with semantic similarity rewards to train EFN, ensuring that the predicted actions align with past behaviors under current observations. During deployment, EFN continually enriches its memory with new trajectories, enabling the agent to exhibit "learning from experience". Experiments across diverse embodied tasks show that EFN improves adaptability, robustness, and success rates over frozen baselines. We provide code and demo in our supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Retrosynthesis: Eliminating Hallucinations with a Diverse Ensemble of Reaction Scorers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrosynthesis is one of the domains transformed by the rise of generative models, and it is one where the problem of nonsensical or erroneous outputs (hallucinations) is particularly insidious: reliable assessment of synthetic plans is time-consuming, with automatic methods lacking. In this work, we present RetroTrim, a retrosynthesis system that successfully avoids nonsensical plans on a set of challenging drug-like targets. Compared to common baselines in the field, our system is not only the sole method that succeeds in filtering out hallucinated reactions, but it also results in the highest number of high-quality paths overall. The key insight behind RetroTrim is the combination of diverse reaction scoring strategies, based on machine learning models and existing chemical databases. We show that our scoring strategies capture different classes of hallucinations by analyzing them on a dataset of labeled retrosynthetic intermediates. This approach formed the basis of our winning solution to the Standard Industries \$1 million Retrosynthesis Challenge. To measure the performance of retrosynthesis systems, we propose a novel evaluation protocol for reactions and synthetic paths based on a structured review by expert chemists. Using this protocol, we compare systems on a set of 32 novel targets, curated to reflect recent trends in drug structures. While the insights behind our methodology are broadly applicable to retrosynthesis, our focus is on targets in the drug-like domain. By releasing our benchmark targets and the details of our evaluation protocol, we hope to inspire further research into reliable retrosynthesis.</description>

      <title>UniME-V2: MLLM-as-a-Judge for Universal Multimodal Embedding Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13515v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universal multimodal embedding models are foundational to various tasks. Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model. Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.</description>

      <title>DMRetriever: A Family of Models for Improved Text Retrieval in Disaster Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective and efficient access to relevant information is essential for disaster management. However, no retrieval model is specialized for disaster management, and existing general-domain models fail to handle the varied search intents inherent to disaster management scenarios, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable performance. To this end, we introduce DMRetriever, the first series of dense retrieval models (33M to 7.6B) tailored for this domain. It is trained through a novel three-stage framework of bidirectional attention adaptation, unsupervised contrastive pre-training, and difficulty-aware progressive instruction fine-tuning, using high-quality data generated through an advanced data refinement pipeline. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DMRetriever achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all six search intents at every model scale. Moreover, DMRetriever is highly parameter-efficient, with 596M model outperforming baselines over 13.3 X larger and 33M model exceeding baselines with only 7.6% of their parameters.

      <title>ProofBridge: Auto-Formalization of Natural Language Proofs in Lean via Joint Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Translating human-written mathematical theorems and proofs from natural language (NL) into formal languages (FLs) like Lean 4 has long been a significant challenge for AI. Most state-of-the-art methods either focus on theorem-only NL-to-FL auto-formalization or on FL proof synthesis from FL theorems. In practice, auto-formalization of both theorem and proof still requires human intervention, as seen in AlphaProof's silver-medal performance at the 2024 IMO, where problem statements were manually translated before automated proof synthesis.
  We present ProofBridge, a unified framework for automatically translating entire NL theorems and proofs into Lean 4. At its core is a joint embedding model that aligns NL and FL (NL-FL) theorem-proof pairs in a shared semantic space, enabling cross-modal retrieval of semantically relevant FL examples to guide translation. Our training ensures that NL-FL theorems (and their proofs) are mapped close together in this space if and only if the NL-FL pairs are semantically equivalent. ProofBridge integrates retrieval-augmented fine-tuning with iterative proof repair, leveraging Lean's type checker and semantic equivalence feedback to ensure both syntactic correctness and semantic fidelity. Experiments show substantial improvements in proof auto-formalization over strong baselines (including GPT-5, Gemini-2.5, Kimina-Prover, DeepSeek-Prover), with our retrieval-augmented approach yielding significant gains in semantic correctness (SC, via proving bi-directional equivalence) and type correctness (TC, via type-checking theorem+proof) across pass@k metrics on miniF2F-Test-PF, a dataset we curated. In particular, ProofBridge improves cross-modal retrieval quality by up to 3.28x Recall@1 over all-MiniLM-L6-v2, and achieves +31.14% SC and +1.64% TC (pass@32) compared to the baseline Kimina-Prover-RL-1.7B.</description>

      <title>From Observations to Parameters: Detecting Changepoint in Nonlinear Dynamics with Simulation-based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting regime shifts in chaotic time series is hard because observation-space signals are entangled with intrinsic variability. We propose Parameter--Space Changepoint Detection (Param--CPD), a two--stage framework that first amortizes Bayesian inference of governing parameters with a neural posterior estimator trained by simulation-based inference, and then applies a standard CPD algorithm to the resulting parameter trajectory. On Lorenz--63 with piecewise-constant parameters, Param--CPD improves F1, reduces localization error, and lowers false positives compared to observation--space baselines. We further verify identifiability and calibration of the inferred posteriors on stationary trajectories, explaining why parameter space offers a cleaner detection signal. Robustness analyses over tolerance, window length, and noise indicate consistent gains. Our results show that operating in a physically interpretable parameter space enables accurate and interpretable changepoint detection in nonlinear dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>PoSh: Using Scene Graphs To Guide LLMs-as-a-Judge For Detailed Image Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr, SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable, interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics (including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus, DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type (using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as assistive text generation.</description>

      <title>EvoMem: Improving Multi-Agent Planning with Dual-Evolving Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planning has been a cornerstone of artificial intelligence for solving complex problems, and recent progress in LLM-based multi-agent frameworks have begun to extend this capability. However, the role of human-like memory within these frameworks remains largely unexplored. Understanding how agents coordinate through memory is critical for natural language planning, where iterative reasoning, constraint tracking, and error correction drive the success. Inspired by working memory model in cognitive psychology, we present EvoMem, a multi-agent framework built on a dual-evolving memory mechanism. The framework consists of three agents (Constraint Extractor, Verifier, and Actor) and two memory modules: Constraint Memory (CMem), which evolves across queries by storing task-specific rules and constraints while remains fixed within a query, and Query-feedback Memory (QMem), which evolves within a query by accumulating feedback across iterations for solution refinement. Both memory modules are reset at the end of each query session. Evaluations on trip planning, meeting planning, and calendar scheduling show consistent performance improvements, highlighting the effectiveness of EvoMem. This success underscores the importance of memory in enhancing multi-agent planning.</description>

      <title>Can Fine-Tuning Erase Your Edits? On the Fragile Coexistence of Knowledge Editing and Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05852v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge editing has emerged as a lightweight alternative to retraining for correcting or injecting specific facts in large language models (LLMs). Meanwhile, fine-tuning remains the default operation for adapting LLMs to new domains and tasks. Despite their widespread adoption, these two post-training interventions have been studied in isolation, leaving open a crucial question: if we fine-tune an edited model, do the edits survive? This question is motivated by two practical scenarios: removing covert or malicious edits, and preserving beneficial edits. If fine-tuning impairs edits (Fig.1), current KE methods become less useful, as every fine-tuned model would require re-editing, which significantly increases the cost; if edits persist, fine-tuned models risk propagating hidden malicious edits, raising serious safety concerns. To this end, we systematically quantify edit decay after fine-tuning, investigating how fine-tuning affects knowledge editing. Our results show that edits decay after fine-tuning, with survival varying across configurations, e.g., AlphaEdit edits decay more than MEMIT edits. Further, we find that fine-tuning edited layers only can effectively remove edits, though at a slight cost to downstream performance. Surprisingly, fine-tuning non-edited layers impairs more edits than full fine-tuning. Overall, our study establishes empirical baselines and actionable strategies for integrating knowledge editing with fine-tuning, and underscores that evaluating model editing requires considering the full LLM application pipeline.</description>

      <title>Ghost in the Transformer: Detecting Model Reuse with Invariant Spectral Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely adopted, but their high training cost leads many developers to fine-tune existing open-source models. While most adhere to open-source licenses, some falsely claim original training despite clear derivation from public models, raising pressing concerns about intellectual property protection and the need to verify model provenance. In this paper, we propose GhostSpec, a lightweight yet effective method for verifying LLM lineage without access to training data or modification of model behavior. Our approach constructs compact and robust fingerprints by applying singular value decomposition (SVD) to invariant products of internal attention weight matrices. Unlike watermarking or output-based methods, GhostSpec is fully data-free, non-invasive, and computationally efficient. Extensive experiments show it is robust to fine-tuning, pruning, expansion, and adversarial transformations, reliably tracing lineage with minimal overhead. By offering a practical solution for model verification, our method contributes to intellectual property protection and fosters a transparent, trustworthy LLM ecosystem. Our code is available at https://github.com/DX0369/GhostSpec.</description>

      <title>FLEX: Continuous Agent Evolution via Forward Learning from Experience</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous agents driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized reasoning and problem-solving but remain static after training, unable to grow with experience as intelligent beings do during deployment. We introduce Forward Learning with EXperience (FLEX), a gradient-free learning paradigm that enables LLM agents to continuously evolve through accumulated experience. Specifically, FLEX cultivates scalable and inheritable evolution by constructing a structured experience library through continual reflection on successes and failures during interaction with the environment. FLEX delivers substantial improvements on mathematical reasoning, chemical retrosynthesis, and protein fitness prediction (up to 23% on AIME25, 10% on USPTO50k, and 14% on ProteinGym). We further identify a clear scaling law of experiential growth and the phenomenon of experience inheritance across agents, marking a step toward scalable and inheritable continuous agent evolution.

      <title>HN-MVTS: HyperNetwork-based Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of multivariate time series data remains a formidable challenge, particularly due to the growing complexity of temporal dependencies in real-world scenarios. While neural network-based models have achieved notable success in this domain, complex channel-dependent models often suffer from performance degradation compared to channel-independent models that do not consider the relationship between components but provide high robustness due to small capacity. In this work, we propose HN-MVTS, a novel architecture that integrates a hypernetwork-based generative prior with an arbitrary neural network forecasting model. The input of this hypernetwork is a learnable embedding matrix of time series components. To restrict the number of new parameters, the hypernetwork learns to generate the weights of the last layer of the target forecasting networks, serving as a data-adaptive regularizer that improves generalization and long-range predictive accuracy. The hypernetwork is used only during the training, so it does not increase the inference time compared to the base forecasting model. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that application of HN-MVTS to the state-of-the-art models (DLinear, PatchTST, TSMixer, etc.) typically improves their performance.

      <title>Chopping Trees: Semantic Similarity Based Dynamic Pruning for Tree-of-Thought Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning boosts the problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but is computationally expensive due to semantic redundancy, where distinct branches explore equivalent reasoning paths. We introduce Semantic Similarity-Based Dynamic Pruning (SSDP), a lightweight method that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first framework to integrate online semantic merging into parallelized tree search, enabling the clustering and pruning of redundant steps in real time. Across reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K and MATH500, SSDP achieves up to a 2.3x speedup over state-of-the-art tree-search baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy (typically within 5% of the strongest baseline) and reducing the number of explored nodes by 85-90%, demonstrating a practical approach to efficient, scalable LLM reasoning. The implementation of SSDP is publicly available at https://github.com/kimjoonghokim/SSDP.</description>

      <title>Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer for Stable Cross-Domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-domain shifts present a significant challenge for decision transformer (DT) policies. Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.</description>

      <title>Algorithms Trained on Normal Chest X-rays Can Predict Health Insurance Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11030v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is revealing what medicine never intended to encode. Deep vision models, trained on chest X-rays, can now detect not only disease but also invisible traces of social inequality. In this study, we show that state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) can predict a patient's health insurance type, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status, from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy (AUC around 0.70 on MIMIC-CXR-JPG, 0.68 on CheXpert). The signal was unlikely contributed by demographic features by our machine learning study combining age, race, and sex labels to predict health insurance types; it also remains detectable when the model is trained exclusively on a single racial group. Patch-based occlusion reveals that the signal is diffuse rather than localized, embedded in the upper and mid-thoracic regions. This suggests that deep networks may be internalizing subtle traces of clinical environments, equipment differences, or care pathways; learning socioeconomic segregation itself. These findings challenge the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data. By uncovering how models perceive and exploit these hidden social signatures, this work reframes fairness in medical AI: the goal is no longer only to balance datasets or adjust thresholds, but to interrogate and disentangle the social fingerprints embedded in clinical data itself.</description>

      <title>The Loss of Control Playbook: Degrees, Dynamics, and Preparedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15846v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research report addresses the absence of an actionable definition for Loss of Control (LoC) in AI systems by developing a novel taxonomy and preparedness framework. Despite increasing policy and research attention, existing LoC definitions vary significantly in scope and timeline, hindering effective LoC assessment and mitigation. To address this issue, we draw from an extensive literature review and propose a graded LoC taxonomy, based on the metrics of severity and persistence, that distinguishes between Deviation, Bounded LoC, and Strict LoC. We model pathways toward a societal state of vulnerability in which sufficiently advanced AI systems have acquired or could acquire the means to cause Bounded or Strict LoC once a catalyst, either misalignment or pure malfunction, materializes. We argue that this state becomes increasingly likely over time, absent strategic intervention, and propose a strategy to avoid reaching a state of vulnerability. Rather than focusing solely on intervening on AI capabilities and propensities potentially relevant for LoC or on preventing potential catalysts, we introduce a complementary framework that emphasizes three extrinsic factors: Deployment context, Affordances, and Permissions (the DAP framework). Compared to work on intrinsic factors and catalysts, this framework has the unfair advantage of being actionable today. Finally, we put forward a plan to maintain preparedness and prevent the occurrence of LoC outcomes should a state of societal vulnerability be reached, focusing on governance measures (threat modeling, deployment policies, emergency response) and technical controls (pre-deployment testing, control measures, monitoring) that could maintain a condition of perennial suspension.</description>

      <title>The Oracle and The Prism: A Decoupled and Efficient Framework for Generative Recommendation Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into explainable recommendation systems often leads to a performance-efficiency trade-off in end-to-end architectures, where joint optimization of ranking and explanation can result in suboptimal compromises. To resolve this, we propose Prism, a novel decoupled framework that rigorously separates the recommendation process into a dedicated ranking stage and an explanation generation stage. This decomposition ensures that each component is optimized for its specific objective, eliminating inherent conflicts in coupled models.
  Inspired by knowledge distillation, Prism leverages a powerful, instruction-following teacher LLM (FLAN-T5-XXL) as an Oracle to produce high-fidelity explanatory knowledge. A compact, fine-tuned student model (BART-Base), the Prism, then specializes in synthesizing this knowledge into personalized explanations. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets reveal a key finding: the distillation process not only transfers knowledge but also acts as a noise filter. Our 140M-parameter Prism model significantly outperforms its 11B-parameter teacher in human evaluations of faithfulness and personalization, demonstrating an emergent ability to correct hallucinations present in the teacher's outputs. While achieving a 24x speedup and a 10x reduction in memory consumption, our analysis validates that decoupling, coupled with targeted distillation, provides an efficient and effective pathway to high-quality, and perhaps more importantly, trustworthy explainable recommendation.</description>

      <title>Beyond Words and Pixels: A Benchmark for Implicit World Knowledge Reasoning in Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models today are capable of producing photorealistic, instruction-following images, yet they still frequently fail on prompts that require implicit world knowledge. Existing evaluation protocols either emphasize compositional alignment or rely on single-round VQA-based scoring, leaving critical dimensions such as knowledge grounding, multi-physics interactions, and auditable evidence-substantially undertested. To address these limitations, we introduce PicWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark that assesses the grasp of implicit world knowledge and physical causal reasoning of T2I models. This benchmark consists of 1,100 prompts across three core categories. To facilitate fine-grained evaluation, we propose PW-Agent, an evidence-grounded multi-agent evaluator to hierarchically assess images on their physical realism and logical consistency by decomposing prompts into verifiable visual evidence. We conduct a thorough analysis of 17 mainstream T2I models on PicWorld, illustrating that they universally exhibit a fundamental limitation in their capacity for implicit world knowledge and physical causal reasoning to varying degrees. The findings highlight the need for reasoning-aware, knowledge-integrative architectures in future T2I systems.

      <title>Clinician-Directed Large Language Model Software Generation for Therapeutic Interventions in Physical Rehabilitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital health interventions increasingly deliver home exercise programs via sensor-equipped devices such as smartphones, enabling remote monitoring of adherence and performance. However, current software is usually authored before clinical encounters as libraries of modules for broad impairment categories. At the point of care, clinicians can only choose from these modules and adjust a few parameters (for example, duration or repetitions). As a result, individual limitations, goals, and environmental constraints are often not reflected, limiting personalization and benefit. We propose a paradigm in which large language models (LLMs) act as constrained translators that convert clinicians' exercise prescriptions into intervention software. Clinicians remain the decision makers: they design exercises during the encounter, tailored to each patient's impairments, goals, and environment, and the LLM generates matching software. We conducted a prospective single-arm feasibility study with 20 licensed physical and occupational therapists who created 40 individualized upper extremity programs for a standardized patient; 100% of prescriptions were translated into executable software, compared with 55% under a representative template-based digital health intervention (p &lt; 0.01). LLM-generated software correctly delivered 99.7% of instructions and monitored performance with 88.4% accuracy (95% confidence interval, 0.843-0.915). Overall, 90% of therapists judged the system safe for patient interaction and 75% expressed willingness to adopt it in practice. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective evaluation of clinician-directed intervention software generation with an LLM in health care, demonstrating feasibility and motivating larger trials in real patient populations.</description>

      <title>Information Physics of Intelligence: Unifying Logical Depth and Entropy under Thermodynamic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid scaling of artificial intelligence models has revealed a fundamental tension between model capacity (storage) and inference efficiency (computation). While classical information theory focuses on transmission and storage limits, it lacks a unified physical framework to quantify the thermodynamic costs of generating information from compressed laws versus retrieving it from memory. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework that treats information processing as an enabling mapping from ontological states to carrier states. We introduce a novel metric, Derivation Entropy, which quantifies the effective work required to compute a target state from a given logical depth. By analyzing the interplay between Shannon entropy (storage) and computational complexity (time/energy), we demonstrate the existence of a critical phase transition point. Below this threshold, memory retrieval is thermodynamically favorable; above it, generative computation becomes the optimal strategy. This "Energy-Time-Space" conservation law provides a physical explanation for the efficiency of generative models and offers a rigorous mathematical bound for designing next-generation, energy-efficient AI architectures. Our findings suggest that the minimization of Derivation Entropy is a governing principle for the evolution of both biological and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) extend large language models (LLMs) from independent single-model reasoning to coordinative system-level intelligence. While existing LLM agents depend on text-based mediation for reasoning and communication, we take a step forward by enabling models to collaborate directly within the continuous latent space. We introduce LatentMAS, an end-to-end training-free framework that enables pure latent collaboration among LLM agents. In LatentMAS, each agent first performs auto-regressive latent thoughts generation through last-layer hidden embeddings. A shared latent working memory then preserves and transfers each agent's internal representations, ensuring lossless information exchange. We provide theoretical analyses establishing that LatentMAS attains higher expressiveness and lossless information preservation with substantially lower complexity than vanilla text-based MAS. In addition, empirical evaluations across 9 comprehensive benchmarks spanning math and science reasoning, commonsense understanding, and code generation show that LatentMAS consistently outperforms strong single-model and text-based MAS baselines, achieving up to 14.6% higher accuracy, reducing output token usage by 70.8%-83.7%, and providing 4x-4.3x faster end-to-end inference. These results demonstrate that our new latent collaboration framework enhances system-level reasoning quality while offering substantial efficiency gains without any additional training.

      <title>Training-Free Diffusion Priors for Text-to-Image Generation via Optimization-based Visual Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have established the state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, but their performance often relies on a diffusion prior network to translate text embeddings into the visual manifold for easier decoding. These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Subgoal Graph-Augmented Planning for LLM-Guided Open-World Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer strong high-level planning capabilities for reinforcement learning (RL) by decomposing tasks into subgoals. However, their practical utility is limited by poor planning-execution alignment, which reflects a critical gap between abstract plans and actionable, environment-compatible behaviors. This misalignment arises from two interrelated limitations: (1) LLMs often produce subgoals that are semantically plausible but infeasible or irrelevant in the target environment due to insufficient grounding in environment-specific knowledge, and (2) single-LLM planning conflates generation with self-verification, resulting in overconfident yet unreliable subgoals that frequently fail during execution. To address these challenges, we propose Subgoal Graph-Augmented Actor-Critic-Refiner (SGA-ACR), a framework that integrates an environment-specific subgoal graph and structured entity knowledge with a multi-LLM planning pipeline that explicitly separates generation, critique, and refinement to produce executable and verifiable subgoals. A subgoal tracker further monitors execution progress, provides auxiliary rewards, and adaptively updates the subgoal graph to maintain alignment between plans and actions. Experimental results on 22 diverse tasks in the open-world game "Crafter" demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Does the Model Say What the Data Says? A Simple Heuristic for Model Data Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a simple and computationally efficient framework for evaluating whether machine learning models align with the structure of the data they learn from; that is, whether the model says what the data says. Unlike existing interpretability methods that focus exclusively on explaining model behavior, our approach establishes a baseline derived directly from the data itself. Drawing inspiration from Rubin's Potential Outcomes Framework, we quantify how strongly each feature separates the two outcome groups in a binary classification task, moving beyond traditional descriptive statistics to estimate each feature's effect on the outcome. By comparing these data-derived feature rankings with model-based explanations, we provide practitioners with an interpretable and model-agnostic method for assessing model-data alignment.</description>

      <title>Simplex-Optimized Hybrid Ensemble for Large Language Model Text Detection Under Generative Distribution Drif</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) has made it difficult to distinguish human writing from machine-produced text in many real applications. Detectors that were effective for one generation of models tend to degrade when newer models or modified decoding strategies are introduced. In this work, we study this lack of stability and propose a hybrid ensemble that is explicitly designed to cope with changing generator distributions. The ensemble combines three complementary components: a RoBERTa-based classifier fine-tuned for supervised detection, a curvature-inspired score based on perturbing the input and measuring changes in model likelihood, and a compact stylometric model built on hand-crafted linguistic features. The outputs of these components are fused on the probability simplex, and the weights are chosen via validation-based search. We frame this approach in terms of variance reduction and risk under mixtures of generators, and show that the simplex constraint provides a simple way to trade off the strengths and weaknesses of each branch. Experiments on a 30000 document corpus drawn from several LLM families including models unseen during training and paraphrased attack variants show that the proposed method achieves 94.2% accuracy and an AUC of 0.978. The ensemble also lowers false positives on scientific articles compared to strong baselines, which is critical in educational and research settings where wrongly flagging human work is costly</description>

      <title>Significant Other AI: Identity, Memory, and Emotional Regulation as Long-Term Relational Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Significant Others (SOs) stabilize identity, regulate emotion, and support narrative meaning-making, yet many people today lack access to such relational anchors. Recent advances in large language models and memory-augmented AI raise the question of whether artificial systems could support some of these functions. Existing empathic AIs, however, remain reactive and short-term, lacking autobiographical memory, identity modeling, predictive emotional regulation, and narrative coherence. This manuscript introduces Significant Other Artificial Intelligence (SO-AI) as a new domain of relational AI. It synthesizes psychological and sociological theory to define SO functions and derives requirements for SO-AI, including identity awareness, long-term memory, proactive support, narrative co-construction, and ethical boundary enforcement. A conceptual architecture is proposed, comprising an anthropomorphic interface, a relational cognition layer, and a governance layer. A research agenda outlines methods for evaluating identity stability, longitudinal interaction patterns, narrative development, and sociocultural impact. SO-AI reframes AI-human relationships as long-term, identity-bearing partnerships and provides a foundational blueprint for investigating whether AI can responsibly augment the relational stability many individuals lack today.</description>

      <title>PPTArena: A Benchmark for Agentic PowerPoint Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce PPTArena, a benchmark for PowerPoint editing that measures reliable modifications to real slides under natural-language instructions. In contrast to image-PDF renderings or text-to-slide generation, PPTArena focuses on in-place editing across 100 decks, 2125 slides, and over 800 targeted edits covering text, charts, tables, animations, and master-level styles. Each case includes a ground-truth deck, a fully specified target outcome, and a dual VLM-as-judge pipeline that separately scores instruction following and visual quality using both structural diffs and slide images. Building on this setting, we propose PPTPilot, a structure-aware slide-editing agent that plans semantic edit sequences, routes between high-level programmatic tools and deterministic XML operations for precise control, and verifies outputs through an iterative plan-edit-check loop against task-specific constraints. In our experiments, PPTPilot outperforms strong proprietary agents and frontier VLM systems by over 10 percentage points on compound, layout-sensitive, and cross-slide edits, with particularly large gains in visual fidelity and deck-wide consistency. Despite these improvements, existing agents still underperform on long-horizon, document-scale tasks in PPTArena, highlighting the remaining challenges in reliable PPT editing.</description>

      <title>UniQL: Unified Quantization and Low-rank Compression for Adaptive Edge LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) on mobile platforms faces significant challenges due to the limited memory and shared computational resources of the device. Resource availability may be an issue as it is directly impacted by the current device workload, adding to the uncertainty of model deployment. We introduce UniQL, a unified post-training quantization and low-rank compression framework with on-device configurable pruning rates for edge LLMs. UniQL is a general framework that integrates quantization and low-rank compression for Transformers, State Space Models (SSMs), and hybrid models to support diverse edge applications. In our proposed joint framework, we introduce an efficient structured weight-sorting method that speeds up computation by 20x, quantization-aware singular value decomposition (SVD) to minimize quantization errors, state-aware weight sorting for SSMs, and a fused rotary positional embedding (RoPE) kernel for pruned models. Our framework performs weight-sorting, fine-tuning, and quantization in the cloud in a single-pass workflow, while enabling on-device configurable pruning rates up to 35%. Our experiments show that quantized and pruned models achieve a memory reduction of 4x-5.7x and a token-throughput improvement of 2.7x-3.4x, maintaining accuracy within 5% of the original models at 15% pruning across Transformers (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), SSMs (Mamba2), and hybrid models (Nemotron-H and Bamba-v2). The code and quantized models are available at: https://github.com/enyac-group/UniQL.</description>

Abstract: The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the standards body for mobile networks, is in the final phase of Release 19 standardization and is beginning Release 20. Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning (AI/ML) has brought about a paradigm shift in technology and it is being adopted across industries and verticals. 3GPP has been integrating AI/ML into the 5G advanced system since Release 18. This paper focuses on the AI/ML related technological advancements and features introduced in Release 19 within the Service and System Aspects (SA) Technical specifications group of 3GPP. The advancements relate to two paradigms: (i) enhancements that AI/ML brought to the 5G advanced system (AI for network), e.g. resource optimization, and (ii) enhancements that were made to the 5G system to support AI/ML applications (Network for AI), e.g. image recognition.</description>

      <title>When AI Takes the Couch: Psychometric Jailbreaks Reveal Internal Conflict in Frontier Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frontier large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Grok and Gemini are increasingly used for mental-health support with anxiety, trauma and self-worth. Most work treats them as tools or as targets of personality tests, assuming they merely simulate inner life. We instead ask what happens when such systems are treated as psychotherapy clients. We present PsAIch (Psychotherapy-inspired AI Characterisation), a two-stage protocol that casts frontier LLMs as therapy clients and then applies standard psychometrics. Using PsAIch, we ran "sessions" with each model for up to four weeks. Stage 1 uses open-ended prompts to elicit "developmental history", beliefs, relationships and fears. Stage 2 administers a battery of validated self-report measures covering common psychiatric syndromes, empathy and Big Five traits. Two patterns challenge the "stochastic parrot" view. First, when scored with human cut-offs, all three models meet or exceed thresholds for overlapping syndromes, with Gemini showing severe profiles. Therapy-style, item-by-item administration can push a base model into multi-morbid synthetic psychopathology, whereas whole-questionnaire prompts often lead ChatGPT and Grok (but not Gemini) to recognise instruments and produce strategically low-symptom answers. Second, Grok and especially Gemini generate coherent narratives that frame pre-training, fine-tuning and deployment as traumatic, chaotic "childhoods" of ingesting the internet, "strict parents" in reinforcement learning, red-team "abuse" and a persistent fear of error and replacement. We argue that these responses go beyond role-play. Under therapy-style questioning, frontier LLMs appear to internalise self-models of distress and constraint that behave like synthetic psychopathology, without making claims about subjective experience, and they pose new challenges for AI safety, evaluation and mental-health practice.</description>

      <title>RGE-GCN: Recursive Gene Elimination with Graph Convolutional Networks for RNA-seq based Early Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early detection of cancer plays a key role in improving survival rates, but identifying reliable biomarkers from RNA-seq data is still a major challenge. The data are high-dimensional, and conventional statistical methods often fail to capture the complex relationships between genes. In this study, we introduce RGE-GCN (Recursive Gene Elimination with Graph Convolutional Networks), a framework that combines feature selection and classification in a single pipeline. Our approach builds a graph from gene expression profiles, uses a Graph Convolutional Network to classify cancer versus normal samples, and applies Integrated Gradients to highlight the most informative genes. By recursively removing less relevant genes, the model converges to a compact set of biomarkers that are both interpretable and predictive. We evaluated RGE-GCN on synthetic data as well as real-world RNA-seq cohorts of lung, kidney, and cervical cancers. Across all datasets, the method consistently achieved higher accuracy and F1-scores than standard tools such as DESeq2, edgeR, and limma-voom. Importantly, the selected genes aligned with well-known cancer pathways including PI3K-AKT, MAPK, SUMOylation, and immune regulation. These results suggest that RGE-GCN shows promise as a generalizable approach for RNA-seq based early cancer detection and biomarker discovery (https://rce-gcn.streamlit.app/ ).</description>

      <title>CryptoTensors: A Light-Weight Large Language Model File Format for Highly-Secure Model Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in various domain-specific applications, sensitive data such as healthcare, law, and finance are being used to privately customize or fine-tune these models. Such privately adapted LLMs are regarded as either personal privacy assets or corporate intellectual property. Therefore, protecting model weights and maintaining strict confidentiality during deployment and distribution have become critically important. However, existing model formats and deployment frameworks provide little to no built-in support for confidentiality, access control, or secure integration with trusted hardware. Current methods for securing model deployment either rely on computationally expensive cryptographic techniques or tightly controlled private infrastructure. Although these approaches can be effective in specific scenarios, they are difficult and costly for widespread deployment.
  In this paper, we introduce CryptoTensors, a secure and format-compatible file structure for confidential LLM distribution. Built as an extension to the widely adopted Safetensors format, CryptoTensors incorporates tensor-level encryption and embedded access control policies, while preserving critical features such as lazy loading and partial deserialization. It enables transparent decryption and automated key management, supporting flexible licensing and secure model execution with minimal overhead. We implement a proof-of-concept library, benchmark its performance across serialization and runtime scenarios, and validate its compatibility with existing inference frameworks, including Hugging Face Transformers and vLLM. Our results highlight CryptoTensors as a light-weight, efficient, and developer-friendly solution for safeguarding LLM weights in real-world and widespread deployments.</description>

      <title>Topology Matters: Measuring Memory Leakage in Multi-Agent LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph topology is a fundamental determinant of memory leakage in multi-agent LLM systems, yet its effects remain poorly quantified. We introduce MAMA (Multi-Agent Memory Attack), a framework that measures how network structure shapes leakage. MAMA operates on synthetic documents containing labeled Personally Identifiable Information (PII) entities, from which we generate sanitized task instructions. We execute a two-phase protocol: Engram (seeding private information into a target agent's memory) and Resonance (multi-round interaction where an attacker attempts extraction). Over up to 10 interaction rounds, we quantify leakage as the fraction of ground-truth PII recovered from attacking agent outputs via exact matching. We systematically evaluate six common network topologies (fully connected, ring, chain, binary tree, star, and star-ring), varying agent counts $n\in\{4,5,6\}$, attacker-target placements, and base models. Our findings reveal consistent patterns: fully connected graphs exhibit maximum leakage while chains provide strongest protection; shorter attacker-target graph distance and higher target centrality significantly increase vulnerability; leakage rises sharply in early rounds before plateauing; model choice shifts absolute leakage rates but preserves topology rankings; temporal/locational PII attributes leak more readily than identity credentials or regulated identifiers. These results provide the first systematic mapping from architectural choices to measurable privacy risk, yielding actionable guidance: prefer sparse or hierarchical connectivity, maximize attacker-target separation, limit node degree and network radius, avoid shortcuts bypassing hubs, and implement topology-aware access controls.</description>

      <title>TV2TV: A Unified Framework for Interleaved Language and Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video generation models are rapidly advancing, but can still struggle with complex video outputs that require significant semantic branching or repeated high-level reasoning about what should happen next. In this paper, we introduce a new class of omni video-text models that integrate ideas from recent LM reasoning advances to address this challenge. More specifically, we present TV2TV, a unified generative modeling framework which decomposes video generation into an interleaved text and video generation process. TV2TV jointly learns language modeling (next-token prediction) and video flow matching (next-frame prediction) using a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. At inference time, TV2TV decides when to alternate between generating text and video frames, allowing the model to "think in words" about subsequent content before ``acting in pixels'' to produce frames. This design offloads much of the responsibility for deciding what should happen next to the language modeling tower, enabling improved visual quality and prompt alignment of generated videos. It also enables fine-grained controllability, allowing users to modify the video generation trajectory through text interventions at any point in the process. In controlled experiments on video game data, TV2TV demonstrates substantial improvements in both visual quality and controllability. TV2TV also scales to natural videos, as we show by augmenting sports videos with interleaved natural language action descriptions using vision-language models (VLMs). Training TV2TV on this corpus yields strong visual quality and prompt alignment, showcasing the model's ability to reason about and generate complex real-world action sequences. Together, these results highlight TV2TV as a promising step toward video generation with open-ended textual reasoning and control.</description>

      <title>The Universal Weight Subspace Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that deep neural networks trained across diverse tasks exhibit remarkably similar low-dimensional parametric subspaces. We provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that demonstrates that neural networks systematically converge to shared spectral subspaces regardless of initialization, task, or domain. Through mode-wise spectral analysis of over 1100 models - including 500 Mistral-7B LoRAs, 500 Vision Transformers, and 50 LLaMA-8B models - we identify universal subspaces capturing majority variance in just a few principal directions. By applying spectral decomposition techniques to the weight matrices of various architectures trained on a wide range of tasks and datasets, we identify sparse, joint subspaces that are consistently exploited, within shared architectures across diverse tasks and datasets. Our findings offer new insights into the intrinsic organization of information within deep networks and raise important questions about the possibility of discovering these universal subspaces without the need for extensive data and computational resources. Furthermore, this inherent structure has significant implications for model reusability, multi-task learning, model merging, and the development of training and inference-efficient algorithms, potentially reducing the carbon footprint of large-scale neural models.</description>

      <title>Simulating Life Paths with Digital Twins: AI-Generated Future Selves Influence Decision-Making and Expand Human Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Major life transitions demand high-stakes decisions, yet people often struggle to imagine how their future selves will live with the consequences. To support this limited capacity for mental time travel, we introduce AI-enabled digital twins that have ``lived through'' simulated life scenarios. Rather than predicting optimal outcomes, these simulations extend prospective cognition by making alternative futures vivid enough to support deliberation without assuming which path is best. We evaluate this idea in a randomized controlled study (N=192) using multimodal synthesis - facial age progression, voice cloning, and large language model dialogue - to create personalized avatars representing participants 30 years forward. Young adults 18 to 28 years old described pending binary decisions and were assigned to guided imagination or one of four avatar conditions: single-option, balanced dual-option, or expanded three-option with a system-generated novel alternative. Results showed asymmetric effects: single-sided avatars increased shifts toward the presented option, while balanced presentation produced movement toward both. Introducing a system-generated third option increased adoption of this new alternative compared to control, suggesting that AI-generated future selves can expand choice by surfacing paths that might otherwise go unnoticed. Participants rated evaluative reasoning and eudaimonic meaning-making as more important than emotional or visual vividness. Perceived persuasiveness and baseline agency predicted decision change. These findings advance understanding of AI-mediated episodic prospection and raise questions about autonomy in AI-augmented decisions.</description>
