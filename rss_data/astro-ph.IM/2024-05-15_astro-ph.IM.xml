      <title>Detecting changes in anthropogenic light emissions: limits due to atmospheric variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring the evolution of the anthropogenic light emissions is a priority task in light pollution research. Among the complementary approaches that can be adopted to achieve this goal stand out those based on measuring the direct radiance of the sources at ground level or from low Earth orbit satellites, and on measuring the scattered radiance (known as artificial night sky brightness or skyglow) using networks of ground-based sensors. The terrestrial atmosphere is a variable medium interposed between the sources and the measuring instruments, and the fluctuation of its optical parameters sets a lower limit for the actual source emission changes that can be confidently detected. In this paper we analyze the effect of the fluctuations of the molecular and aerosol optical depths. It is shown that for reliably detecting changes in the anthropogenic light emissions of order ~1% per year, the inter-annual variability of the annual means of these atmospheric parameters in the measurement datasets must be carefully controlled or efficiently corrected for.</description>

      <title>The Radio and Microwave Sky as Seen by Juno on its Mission to Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present six nearly full-sky maps made from data taken by radiometers on the Juno satellite during its 5-year flight to Jupiter. The maps represent integrated emission over $\sim 4\%$ passbands spaced approximately in octaves between 600 MHz and 21.9 GHz. Long time-scale offset drifts are removed in all bands, and, for the two lowest frequency bands, gain drifts are also removed from the maps via a self-calibration algorithm similar to the NPIPE pipeline used by the Planck collaboration. We show that, after this solution is applied, residual noise in the maps is consistent with thermal radiometer noise. We verify our map solutions with several consistency tests and end-to-end simulations. We also estimate the level of pixelization noise and polarization leakage via simulations.</description>

      <title>Improving pulsar timing precision through superior Time-of-Arrival creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of pulsar pulse times-of-arrival (ToAs) is a crucial step in detecting low-frequency gravitational waves. To determine ToAs, we can use template-matching to compare each observed pulse profile with a standard template. However, using different combinations of templates and template-matching methods (TMMs) without careful consideration may lead to inconsistent results. In pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments, distinct ToAs from the same observations can be obtained, due to the use of diverse templates and TMMs. In other words, employing diverse approaches can yield different timing results and would thus have a significant impact on subsequent gravitational wave searches. In this paper, we examine several commonly used combinations to analyze their effect on pulse ToAs. we evaluate the potential impact of template and TMM selection on thirteen typical millisecond pulsars within the European PTA. We employ pulsar timing methods, specifically the root mean square and reduced chi-square $\chi_r^2$ of the residuals of the best timing solution to assess the outcomes. Additionally, we evaluate the system-limited noise floor (SLNF) for each pulsar at various telescopes operating around 1.4~GHz using frequency-resolved templates.
  Our findings suggest that utilizing data-derived and smoothed templates in conjunction with the Fourier-domain with Markov-chain Monte Carlo (FDM) TMM is generally the most effective approach, though there may be exceptions that require further attention. Furthermore, we determine that pulse phase jitter noise does not significantly limit the current precision of the European PTA's timing, as jitter levels derived from other studies are much smaller than the SLNF.</description>

      <title>CATEcor: an Open Science, Shaded-Truss, Externally-Occulted Coronagraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design of a portable coronagraph, CATEcor, that incorporates a novel "shaded truss" style of external occultation and serves as a proof-of-concept for that family of coronagraphs. The shaded truss design style has the potential for broad application in various scientific settings. We conceived CATEcor itself as a simple instrument to observe the corona during the darker skies available during a partial solar eclipse, or for students or interested amateurs to detect the corona under ideal non-eclipsed conditions. CATEcor is therefore optimized for simplicity and accessibility to the public. It is implemented using an existing dioptric telescope and an adapter rig that mounts in front of the objective lens, restricting the telescope aperture and providing external occultation. The adapter rig, including occulter, is fabricated using fusion deposition modeling (FDM; colloquially "3D printing"), greatly reducing cost. The structure is designed to be integrated with moderate care and may be replicated in a university or amateur setting. While CATEcor is a simple demonstration unit, the design concept, process, and trades are useful for other more sophisticated coronagraphs in the same general family, which might operate under normal daytime skies outside the annular-eclipse conditions used for CATEcor.</description>

      <title>Direct RF Sampling based LLRF Control System for C-band Linear Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low Level RF (LLRF) control systems of linear accelerators (LINACs) are typically implemented with heterodyne based architectures, which have complex analog RF mixers for up and down conversion. The Gen 3 Radio Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC) device from AMD Xilinx integrates data converters with maximum RF frequency of 6~GHz. This enables direct RF sampling of C-band LLRF signal typically operated at 5.712 GHz without any analogue mixers, which can significantly simplify the system architecture. The data converters sample RF signals in higher order Nyquist zones and then up or down convert digitally by the integrated data path in RFSoC. The closed-loop feedback control firmware implemented in FPGA integrated in RFSoC can process the base-band signal from the ADC data path and calculate the updated phase and amplitude to be up-mixed by the DAC data path. We have developed a C-band LLRF control RFSoC platform with direct RF sampling, which targets Cool Copper Collider (C3) and other C or S band LINAC research and development projects. In this paper, the architecture of the platform will be described. We have optimized the configuration of the data converter and characterized performance of them with RF pulses. The test results for some of the key performance parameters for the LLRF platform with our custom solid-state amplifier, such as phase and amplitude stability, will be discussed in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cherenkov-type particle detectors or scintillators use as a fundamental element photomultiplier tubes, whose efficiency decreases when subjected to the Earth's magnetic field. This work develops a geomagnetic field compensation system based on coils for large scale cylindrical detectors. The effect of different parameters such as the size of the detector, the distance between coils or the magnetic field strength on the compensation using a basic coil system composed of circular and rectangular coils is studied. The addition of coils of very specific geometry and position to the basic configuration is proposed in order to address the compensation in the areas of the detector where it is more difficult to influence, in order to minimize the loss of efficiency. With such improvement, in the considered simulated system, more than 99.5% of the photomultiplier tubes in the detector experience an efficiency loss of less than 1% due to the effect of the magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>A library of meteoroid environments encountered by spacecraft in the inner solar system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NASA's Meteoroid Engineering Model (MEM) is designed to provide aerospace engineers with an accurate description of potentially hazardous meteoroids. It accepts a spacecraft trajectory as input and its output files describe the flux, speed, directionality, and density of microgram- to gram-sized meteoroids relative to the provided trajectory. MEM provides this information at a fairly fine level of detail in order to support detailed risk calculations. However, engineers and scientists in the very early planning stages of a mission may not yet have developed a trajectory or acquired the tools to analyze environment data. Therefore, we have developed an online library of sample MEM runs that allow new users or overloaded mission planners to get a quick feel for the characteristics of the meteoroid environment. This library provides both visualizations of these runs and input files that allow users to replicate them exactly. We also discuss the number of state vectors needed to obtain an accurate representation of the environment encountered along our sample trajectories, and outline a process for verifying that any given trajectory is adequately sampled.</description>

      <title>Using autoencoders and deep transfer learning to determine the stellar parameters of 286 CARMENES M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) techniques are a promising approach among the set of methods used in the ever-challenging determination of stellar parameters in M dwarfs. In this context, transfer learning could play an important role in mitigating uncertainties in the results due to the synthetic gap (i.e. difference in feature distributions between observed and synthetic data). We propose a feature-based deep transfer learning (DTL) approach based on autoencoders to determine stellar parameters from high-resolution spectra. Using this methodology, we provide new estimations for the effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and projected rotational velocity for 286 M dwarfs observed by the CARMENES survey. Using autoencoder architectures, we projected synthetic PHOENIX-ACES spectra and observed CARMENES spectra onto a new feature space of lower dimensionality in which the differences between the two domains are reduced. We used this low-dimensional new feature space as input for a convolutional neural network to obtain the stellar parameter determinations. We performed an extensive analysis of our estimated stellar parameters, ranging from 3050 to 4300 K, 4.7 to 5.1 dex, and -0.53 to 0.25 dex for Teff, logg, and [Fe/H], respectively. Our results are broadly consistent with those of recent studies using CARMENES data, with a systematic deviation in our Teff scale towards hotter values for estimations above 3750 K. Furthermore, our methodology mitigates the deviations in metallicity found in previous DL techniques due to the synthetic gap. We consolidated a DTL-based methodology to determine stellar parameters in M dwarfs from synthetic spectra, with no need for high-quality measurements involved in the knowledge transfer. These results suggest the great potential of DTL to mitigate the differences in feature distributions between the observations and the PHOENIX-ACES spectra.</description>

      <title>REXPACO ASDI: Joint unmixing and deconvolution of the circumstellar environment by angular and spectral differential imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.12644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Angular and spectral differential imaging is an observational technique of choice to investigate the immediate vicinity of stars. The relative angular motion and spectral scaling between on-axis and off-axis sources are exploited by post-processing techniques to separate two components: the residual star light and the light coming from surrounding objects such as circumstellar disks or point-like objects. This paper introduces a new algorithm to jointly unmix these two components and deconvolve disk images. The proposed algorithm is based on a statistical modeling of the residual star light, accounting for its spatial and spectral correlations. While critical, these correlations are not modeled and compensated for by existing reconstruction algorithms. We leverage dedicated shrinkage techniques to estimate the large number of parameters of our model of correlations in a data-driven fashion. We show that the resulting separable model of the spatial and spectral covariances captures very accurately the star light, thus allowing its efficient suppression. We apply our method on several datasets from the VLT/SPHERE instrument and compare the performances against standard algorithms of the field (cADI, PCA). We show that accounting for the multiple correlations of the data significantly enhances the reconstruction quality, leading to better preservation of both the disk morphology and photometry. Thanks to its unique joint spectral modeling of the data, the proposed algorithm can reconstruct disks having a circular symmetry (e.g., rings, spirals) at intensities one million times fainter than the star, without resorting to additional reference datasets free from the off-axis objects.</description>

      <title>Dilated convolutional neural network for detecting extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>

Abstract: The detection of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) is intricate due to their complex waveforms, extended duration, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), making them more challenging to be identified compared to compact binary coalescences. While matched filtering-based techniques are known for their computational demands, existing deep learning-based methods primarily handle time-domain data and are often constrained by data duration and SNR. In addition, most existing work ignores time-delay interferometry (TDI) and applies the long-wavelength approximation in detector response calculations, thus limiting their ability to handle laser frequency noise. In this study, we introduce DECODE, an end-to-end model focusing on EMRI signal detection by sequence modeling in the frequency domain. Centered around a dilated causal convolutional neural network, trained on synthetic data considering TDI-1.5 detector response, DECODE can efficiently process a year's worth of multichannel TDI data with an SNR of around 50. We evaluate our model on 1-year data with accumulated SNR ranging from 50 to 120 and achieve a true positive rate of 96.3% at a false positive rate of 1%, keeping an inference time of less than 0.01 seconds. With the visualization of three showcased EMRI signals for interpretability and generalization, DECODE exhibits strong potential for future space-based gravitational wave data analyses.</description>

      <title>Improving Photometric Redshift Estimates with Training Sample Augmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large imaging surveys will rely on photometric redshifts (photo-z's), which are typically estimated through machine learning methods. Currently planned spectroscopic surveys will not be deep enough to produce a representative training sample for LSST, so we seek methods to improve the photo-z estimates that arise from non-representative training samples. Spectroscopic training samples for photo-z's are biased towards redder, brighter galaxies, which also tend to be at lower redshift than the typical galaxy observed by LSST, leading to poor photo-z estimates with outlier fractions nearly 4 times larger than for a representative training sample. In this paper, we apply the concept of training sample augmentation, where we augment simulated non-representative training samples with simulated galaxies possessing otherwise unrepresented features. When we select simulated galaxies with (g-z) color, i-band magnitude and redshift outside the range of the original training sample, we are able to reduce the outlier fraction of the photo-z estimates for simulated LSST data by nearly 50% and the normalized median absolute deviation (NMAD) by 56%. When compared to a fully representative training sample, augmentation can recover nearly 70% of the degradation in the outlier fraction and 80% of the degradation in NMAD. Training sample augmentation is a simple and effective way to improve training samples for photo-z's without requiring additional spectroscopic samples.</description>

      <title>Analytical capability of K-Ar isochron dating on Mars: assessment from mineral compositions of Martian meteorites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dating rocks with a precision of $\pm$200 Myr (2$\sigma$) has been required to understand the Martian habitability and volcanic history around 4000 Myr ago. In situ potassium-argon (K-Ar) dating techniques employing spot-by-spot laser ablation have been developed for isochron dating on Mars. The precision of isochron ages is predominantly determined by the relationship between the laser spot diameter and the mineral grain size. However, the achievable age precisions for the realistic mineralogy of Martian rocks were not investigated yet. This study simulates isochrons under various conditions, including laser spot size, measurement errors for K and Ar, the number of isochron points, and the mineral compositions of representative Martian meteorites (NWA 817, Zagami, and NWA 1068) analyzed with an electron microprobe. We find that attaining the 200 Myr precision necessitates an isochron data range wider than 6, a laser spot diameter of 250 $\mu$m, and measurement errors of 10% for both K and Ar. Furthermore, minimizing the variance in measurement errors between K and Ar is essential for increasing age accuracy. This investigation demonstrates that the required precision for Mars missions is achievable with realistic instrument settings, thus supporting the viability of in situ K-Ar geochronology on Mars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The millihertz gravitational wave band is expected to be opened by space-borne detectors like TianQin. Various mechanisms can produce short outbursts of gravitational waves, whose actual waveform can be hard to model. In order to identify such gravitational wave bursts and not to misclassify them as noise transients, we proposed a proof-of-principle energy excess method, that utilized the signal-insensitive channel to veto noise transients. We perform a test on simulated data, and for bursts with a signal-to-noise ratio of 20, even with the contamination of noise transient, our methods can reach a detection efficiency of 97.4% under a false alarm rate of once per year. However, more frequent occurrences of noise transients would lower the detection efficiency.</description>

Abstract: The early and precise localization of gravitational waves (GWs) is pivotal in detecting their electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, especially for binary neutron stars (BNS) and neutron star-black hole binaries (NSBH). In this letter, we pioneer the exploration of utilizing the higher harmonic modes induced by the eccentricity of compact binaries to localize GWs with ground-based detectors even before the quadrupole baseline $\ell=2$ mode enters the detector band. Our theoretical analysis marks a first in proposing a strategy for gaining the earliest possible warning and maximizing preparation time for observing pre- and/or post-merger EM counterparts. We simulate three typical binaries from GWTC-3 with eccentricities ranging from 0.05 to 0.4. Our results reveal that the third-generation (3G) detectors (low frequency cut-off $f_0=5$ Hz) can accumulate sufficient signal-to-noise ratios through higher modes before the onset of the baseline $\ell=2$ mode entry into the band. Notably, relying solely on the higher modes, the 3G detector network ET+2CE achieves an average localization on the order of $1-10^2~\rm deg^2$ around 1-1.8 hours before the merger of a GW170817-like BNS, and $10-10^3~\rm deg^2$ approximately 18-30 minutes prior to the merger of a GW200115-like NSBH. A $100~\rm deg^2$ localization is attainable even 2-4 hours prior to a BNS merger. Moreover, in the near face-on orientations which are generally more favorable for EM counterpart detection, the localization can be further improved.</description>

      <title>SIDE-real: Supernova Ia Dust Extinction with truncated marginal neural ratio estimation applied to real data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first fully simulation-based hierarchical analysis of the light curves of a population of low-redshift type Ia supernovae (SNae Ia). Our hardware-accelerated forward model, released in the Python package slicsim, includes stochastic variations of each SN's spectral flux distribution (based on the pre-trained BayeSN model), extinction from dust in the host and in the Milky Way, redshift, and realistic instrumental noise. By utilising truncated marginal neural ratio estimation (TMNRE), a neural network-enabled simulation-based inference technique, we implicitly marginalise over 4000 latent variables (for a set of $\approx 100$ SNae Ia) to efficiently infer SN Ia absolute magnitudes and host-galaxy dust properties at the population level while also constraining the parameters of individual objects. Amortisation of the inference procedure allows us to obtain coverage guarantees for our results through Bayesian validation and frequentist calibration. Furthermore, we show a detailed comparison to full likelihood-based inference, implemented through Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, on simulated data and then apply TMNRE to the light curves of 86 SNae Ia from the Carnegie Supernova Project, deriving marginal posteriors in excellent agreement with previous work. Given its ability to accommodate arbitrarily complex extensions to the forward model -- e.g. different populations based on host properties, redshift evolution, complicated photometric redshift estimates, selection effects, and non-Ia contamination -- without significant modifications to the inference procedure, TMNRE has the potential to become the tool of choice for cosmological parameter inference from future, large SN Ia samples.</description>

      <title>GRASS II: Simulations of Potential Granulation Noise Mitigation Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an updated version of GRASS (the GRanulation And Spectrum Simulator, Palumbo et al. 2022) which now uses an expanded library of 22 solar lines to empirically model time-resolved spectral variations arising from solar granulation. We show that our synthesis model accurately reproduces disk-integrated solar line profiles and bisectors, and we quantify the intrinsic granulation-driven radial-velocity (RV) variability for each of the 22 lines studied. We show that summary statistics of bisector shape (e.g., bisector inverse slope) are strongly correlated with the measured anomalous, variability-driven RV at high pixel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral resolution. Further, the strength of the correlations vary both line by line and with the summary statistic used. These correlations disappear for individual lines at the typical spectral resolutions and SNRs achieved by current EPRV spectrographs; so we use simulations from GRASS to demonstrate that they can, in principle, be recovered by selectively binning lines that are similarly affected by granulation. In the best-case scenario (high SNR and large number of binned lines), we find that a $\lesssim$30$\%$ reduction in the granulation-induced root mean square (RMS) RV can be achieved, but that the achievable reduction in variability is most strongly limited by the spectral resolution of the observing instrument. Based on our simulations, we predict that existing ultra-high-resolution spectrographs, namely ESPRESSO and PEPSI, should be able to resolve convective variability in other, bright stars.</description>
