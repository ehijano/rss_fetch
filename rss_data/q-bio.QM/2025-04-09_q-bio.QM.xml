      <title>GraphPINE: Graph Importance Propagation for Interpretable Drug Response Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainability is necessary for many tasks in biomedical research. Recent explainability methods have focused on attention, gradient, and Shapley value. These do not handle data with strong associated prior knowledge and fail to constrain explainability results based on known relationships between predictive features.
  We propose GraphPINE, a graph neural network (GNN) architecture leveraging domain-specific prior knowledge to initialize node importance optimized during training for drug response prediction. Typically, a manual post-prediction step examines literature (i.e., prior knowledge) to understand returned predictive features. While node importance can be obtained for gradient and attention after prediction, node importance from these methods lacks complementary prior knowledge; GraphPINE seeks to overcome this limitation. GraphPINE differs from other GNN gating methods by utilizing an LSTM-like sequential format. We introduce an importance propagation layer that unifies 1) updates for feature matrix and node importance and 2) uses GNN-based graph propagation of feature values. This initialization and updating mechanism allows for informed feature learning and improved graph representation.
  We apply GraphPINE to cancer drug response prediction using drug screening and gene data collected for over 5,000 gene nodes included in a gene-gene graph with a drug-target interaction (DTI) graph for initial importance. The gene-gene graph and DTIs were obtained from curated sources and weighted by article count discussing relationships between drugs and genes. GraphPINE achieves a PR-AUC of 0.894 and ROC-AUC of 0.796 across 952 drugs. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GraphPINE-40DE.</description>

      <title>Accuracy Enhancement in Refractive Index Sensing via Full-Spectrum Machine Learning Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a full-spectrum machine learning framework for refractive index sensing using simulated absorption spectra from meta-grating structures composed of titanium or silicon nanorods under TE and TM polarizations. Linear regression was applied to 80 principal components extracted from each spectrum, and model performance was assessed using five-fold cross-validation, simulating real-world biosensing scenarios where unknown patient samples are predicted based on standard calibration data. Titanium-based structures, dominated by broadband intensity changes, yielded the lowest mean squared errors and the highest accuracy improvements: up to a 6065-fold reduction compared to the best single-feature model. In contrast, silicon-based structures, governed by narrow resonances, showed more modest gains due to spectral nonlinearity that limits the effectiveness of global linear models. We also show that even the best single-wavelength predictor is identified through data-driven analysis, not visual selection, highlighting the value of automated feature preselection. These findings demonstrate that spectral shape plays a key role in modeling performance and that full-spectrum linear approaches are especially effective for intensity-modulated index sensors.</description>

      <title>Anti-pathogenic property of thermophile-fermented compost as a feed additive and its in vivo external diagnostic imaging in a fish model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22916</link>

Abstract: Fermentative recycling of organic matter is important for a sustainable society, but the functionality of fermented products needs to be adequately evaluated. Here, we clarify the antipathogenic properties for fish of a compost-type feed additive fermented by thermophilic Bacillaceae using non-edible marine resources as raw materials. After prior administration of the compost extract to seabream as a fish model for 70 days, the mortality rate after 28 days of exposure to the fish pathogen Edwardsiella reached a maximum of 20%, although the rate was 60% without prior administration. Under such conditions, the serum complement activity of seabream increased, and the recovery time after anesthesia treatment was also fasten. Furthermore, the differences in the degree of smoothness and glossiness of the fish body surface depending on the administration were statistically shown by imaging techniques to evaluate the texture and color tone of field photographs. These results suggest that thermophile-fermented compost is effective as a functional feed additive against fish disease infection, and that such conditions can be estimated by body surface analysis. This study provides a new perspective for the natural symbiosis industry, as well as for the utilization of non-invasive diagnosis to efficiently estimate the quality of its production activities</description>

      <title>DrugAgent: Multi-Agent Large Language Model-Based Reasoning for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13378v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in large language models (LLMs) allow them to address diverse questions using human-like interfaces. Still, limitations in their training prevent them from answering accurately in scenarios that could benefit from multiple perspectives. Multi-agent systems allow the resolution of questions to enhance result consistency and reliability. While drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is important for drug discovery, existing approaches face challenges due to complex biological systems and the lack of interpretability needed for clinical applications. DrugAgent is a multi-agent LLM system for DTI prediction that combines multiple specialized perspectives with transparent reasoning. Our system adapts and extends existing multi-agent frameworks by (1) applying coordinator-based architecture to the DTI domain, (2) integrating domain-specific data sources, including ML predictions, knowledge graphs, and literature evidence, and (3) incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and ReAct (Reason+Act) frameworks for transparent DTI reasoning. We conducted comprehensive experiments using a kinase inhibitor dataset, where our multi-agent LLM method outperformed the non-reasoning multi-agent model (GPT-4o mini) by 45% in F1 score (0.514 vs 0.355). Through ablation studies, we demonstrated the contributions of each agent, with the AI agent being the most impactful, followed by the KG agent and search agent. Most importantly, our approach provides detailed, human-interpretable reasoning for each prediction by combining evidence from multiple sources - a critical feature for biomedical applications where understanding the rationale behind predictions is essential for clinical decision-making and regulatory compliance.
