      <title>Revisiting the properties of superfluid and normal liquid ${}^4$He using ab initio potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of liquid ${}^4$He in both the normal and superfluid phases using path integral Monte Carlo simulations and recently developed ab initio potentials that incorporate pair, three-body, and four-body interactions. By focusing on the energy per particle as a representative observable, we use a perturbative approach to quantify the individual contributions of the many-body potentials and systematically propagate their associated uncertainties. Our findings indicate that the three-body and four-body potentials contribute to the total energy by approximately 4% and 0.4%, respectively. However, the primary limitation in achieving highly accurate first-principles calculations arises from the uncertainty in the four-body potential, which currently dominates the propagated uncertainty. In addition to the energy per particle, we analyze other key observables, including the superfluid fraction, condensed fraction, and pair distribution function, all of which demonstrate excellent agreement with experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantum disorder induced by nuclear tunneling in lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice degrees of freedom (DoFs) may induce quantum disorder (QD) when nuclear tunneling outvies long-range order, but conventional phonon theory is incapable of describing such QD phases. Here we develop a method based on path-integral molecular dynamics to solve this problem. Its accuracy is verified in a double-well chain model and it is applied to a real material from first principles. A quantum order-disorder-order phase transition sequence is demonstrated when varying the strength of quantum fluctuations using the lattice constants as the tuning factor. Combining the excitation spectra and R\'enyi entanglement entropy, we pinpoint the QD region. This picture may be general in lattice systems having soft phonon modes, not limited to quantum paraelectricity, in which novel entangled lattice motion and its coupling with other DoFs can be expected.</description>

      <title>Energy density and stress fields in quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been an enduring interest and controversy about whether or not one can define physically meaningful energy density and stress fields, $e({\bf r})$ and $\sigma_{\alpha \beta}({\bf r})$ in quantum systems. A key issue is kinetic energy since $\frac{1}{2}|\nabla \Psi|^2$ and $-\frac{1}{2}\Psi\nabla^2 \Psi$ lead to different densities, and analogous issues arise interaction energies. This paper presents a resolution to the problems in two steps: 1) All effects of exchange and correlation are shown to be unique functions defined at each point ${\bf r}$; all issues of non-uniqueness involve only the density $n({\bf r})$ and are equivalent to a single-particle problem with wavefunction $s({\bf r}) = \sqrt{n({\bf r})/N}$. 2) Forms for the latter terms are proposed based on the nature of energy and stress, where energy has two distinct roles. Because the energy determines the ground state itself through the variational principle, the appropriate density involves the terms in the hamiltonian: $-\frac{1}{2}\Psi\nabla^2 \Psi$ and interactions in terms of potentials acting on the particles. This leads naturally to density functional theory with the interpretation that the energy density $e({\bf r})$ is equilibrated to minimize fluctuations with the same chemical potential throughout the system. On the other hand, the energy and stress (derivative of the energy with respect to strain) are properties of the ground state, and simple examples to show that the only acceptable expressions involve the combination $\frac{1}{4}[|\nabla \Psi|^2 - \Psi\nabla^2 \Psi]$, as derived by Schrodinger, Pauli and others, and Coulomb interactions in the Maxwell form in terms of electric fields, not potentials. Together these results lead to well-defined formulations of energy density and stress fields that are physically motivated and based on a clear set of arguments.</description>

      <title>Relative knot probabilities in confined lattice polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the relative knotting probabilities in a lattice model of ring polymers confined in a cavity. The model is of a lattice knot of size $n$ in the cubic lattice, confined to a cube of side-length $L$ and with volume $V=(L{+}1)^3$ sites. We use Monte Carlo algorithms to approximately enumerate the number of conformations of lattice knots in the confining cube. If $p_{n,L}(K)$ is the number of conformations of a lattice polygon of length $n$ and knot type $K$ in a cube of volume $L^3$, then the relative knotting probability of a lattice polygon to have knot type $K$, relative to the probability that the polygon is the unknot (the trivial knot, denoted by $0_1$), is $\rho_{n,L}(K/0_1) = p_{n,L}(K)/p_{n,L}(0_1)$. We determine $\rho_{n,L}(K/0_1)$ for various knot types $K$ up to six crossing knots. Our data show that these relative knotting probabilities are small so that the model is dominated by lattice polygons of knot type the unknot. Moreover, if the concentration of the monomers of the lattice knot is $\varphi = n/V$, then the relative knot probability increases with $\varphi$ along a curve that flattens off as the Hamiltonian state is approached.</description>

      <title>Amp\`ere phase in frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a new class of algebraic spin liquids, in which the macroscopically degenerate ground state manifold is not Coulombic, like in spin ices, but Amp\`ere-like. The local constraint characterizing an Amp\`ere phase is not a Gauss law, but rather an Amp\`ere law, i.e., a condition on the curl of the magnetization vector field and not on its divergence. As a consequence, the excitations evolving in such a manifold are not magnetically charged scalar quasiparticles, the so-called magnetic monopoles in Coulomb phases, but instead vectorial magnetic loops (or fictional current lines). We demonstrate analytically that in a macroscopically degenerate manifold inheriting the properties of a cooperative paramagnet and subject to a local curl-free contraint, magnetic correlations decay in space with a power law whose exponent is the space dimension d: the Amp\`ere phase is a d-algebraic spin liquid. Using Monte Carlo simulations with appropriate cluster dynamics, we confirm this physics numerically in two- and three-dimensional examples, and illustrate how the Amp\`ere phase compares to its Coulomb counterpart.</description>
