      <title>The Role of Population III Star Tidal Disruption Events in Black Hole Growth at the Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshifts has intensified efforts to understand their early formation and rapid growth during the cosmic dawn. Using a semi-analytical cosmological framework, we investigate the role of tidal disruption events (TDEs) involving Population III (Pop-III) stars in driving the growth of heavy seed black holes (10^4-10^6 solar mass). Our results indicate that Pop-III TDEs significantly accelerate the growth of relatively lighter massive black holes (~ 10^4-10^5 solar mass), allowing them to increase their mass by roughly an order of magnitude within the first 10 Myr. Cosmological evolution modeling further supports that such Pop-III TDE-driven growth scenarios are consistent with the formation pathways of observed luminous high-redshift quasars originating from seed black holes at 10&lt;z&lt;15. We also discuss the future observational probes of these early-stage growth processes that future facilities, including space-based gravitational wave observatories and infrared telescopes like JWST, could potentially detect. These findings provide a clear observational framework to test the critical role of Pop-III star interactions in the rapid buildup of SMBHs during the earliest epochs.</description>

      <title>Are FRBs emitted from rotating magnetospheres? Searching for periodicity in polarized bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the potential sources of repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is a rotating magnetosphere of a compact object, as suggested by the similarities in the polarization properties of FRBs and radio pulsars. Attempts to measure an underlying period in the times of arrival of repeating FRBs have nevertheless been unsuccessful. To explain this lack of observed periodicity, it is often suggested that the line of sight towards the source must be sampling active parts of the emitting magnetosphere throughout the rotation of the compact object, i.e. has a large duty cycle, as can be the case in a neutron star with near-aligned magnetic and rotation axes. This may lead to apparently aperiodic bursts, however the polarization angle of the bursts should be tied to the rotational phase from which they occur. This is true for radio pulsars. We therefore propose a new test to identify a possible stable rotation period under the assumptions above, based on a periodogram of the measured polarization angle timeseries for repeating FRBs. We show that this test is highly sensitive when the duty cycle is large, where standard time-of-arrival periodicity searches fail. Therefore, we can directly test the hypothesis of repeating FRBs of magnetospheric origin with a stable rotation period. Both positive and negative results of the test applied to FRB data will provide important information.</description>

      <title>An e-MERLIN &amp; EVN radio counterpart to the ultraluminous X-ray source M82 X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are X-ray bright (L$_{\rm X-ray} &gt;$3$\times$10$^{39}$erg s$^{-1}$) extra-galactic objects that are powered by either neutron stars, or stellar or intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) but few have been detected in the radio waveband. In the nearby galaxy M82, the brightest ULX - M82 X$-$1, is thought to be associated with an IMBH but to date does not have a radio counterpart. We present deep wide-band reprocessed e-MERLIN images observed in 2015 May with an r.m.s. sensitivity of 7$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ and report the discovery of a new radio source with an integrated flux of S$_{\rm \nu=4.88\,GHz}$ = 174$\pm$15$\mu$Jy, which is spatially co-incident with the Chandra X-ray position of M82 X$-$1. This source is not detected in archival MERLIN/e-MERLIN observations in the last three decades. A search for intra-observation variability in the 2015 e-MERLIN data was inconclusive, but a comparison with 1.5 GHz e-MERLIN observations taken a week prior yielded no detection. We also detect the source at the same position with milliarcsecond angular resolution in EVN+e-MERLIN data from 2021 March at 53$\pm$10$\mu$Jy. The radio source position is ICRF J2000 RA: 09$^{h}$55$^{m}$50.1172$^{s}$, Dec: +69$^{\circ}$40'46.606" ($\pm$1.5 mas). These radio fluxes are consistent with other radio-detected ULXs on the radio:X-ray plane and points towards a stellar/intermediate-mass black hole. The black hole mass inferred by the `fundamental plane of black hole activity' is 2650 M$_{\odot}$, but this value remains highly uncertain.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of inclined extensive air showers using radio signals: from arrival times and amplitudes to direction and energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio detection is now an established technique for the study of ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays with energies above $\sim10^{17}$ eV. The next-generation of radio experiments aims to extend this technique to the observation of UHE earth-skimming neutrinos, which requires the detection of very inclined extensive air showers (EAS). In this article we present a new reconstruction method for the arrival direction and the energy of EAS. It combines a point-source-like description of the radio wavefront with a phenomenological model: the Angular Distribution Function (ADF). The ADF describes the angular distribution of the radio signal amplitude in the 50-200 MHz frequency range, with a particular focus on the Cherenkov angle, a crucial feature of the radio amplitude pattern. The method is applicable to showers with zenith angles larger than $60^\circ$, and in principle up to neutrino-induced showers with up-going trajectories. It is tested here on a simulated data set of EAS induced by cosmic rays. A resolution better than 4 arc-minutes ($0.07^\circ$) is achieved on arrival direction, as well as an intrinsic resolution of 5% on the electromagnetic energy, and around 15% on the primary energy.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of Schwarzschild-like Black Holes with a Generalized Compton Wavelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the generalized Compton wavelength (GCW), emerging from a three-dimensional dynamical quantum vacuum (3D DQV) on Schwarzschild-like black hole spacetimes, motivated by the work of Fiscaletti [10.1134/S0040577925020096] \cite{Fiscaletti:2025iuh}. The GCW modifies the classical geometry through a deformation parameter $ \varepsilon $, encoding quantum gravitational backreaction. We derive exact analytical expressions for the black hole shadow radius, photon sphere, and weak deflection angle, incorporating higher-order corrections and finite-distance effects of a black hole with generalized Compton effect (BHGCE). Using Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data, constraints on $ \varepsilon $ are obtained: $ \varepsilon \in [-2.572, 0.336] $ for Sgr. A* and $ \varepsilon \in [-2.070, 0.620] $ for M87*, both consistent with general relativity yet allowing moderate deviations. Weak lensing analyses via the Keeton-Petters and Gauss-Bonnet formalisms further constrain $ \varepsilon \approx 0.061 $, aligning with solar system bounds. We compute the modified Hawking temperature, showing that positive $ \varepsilon $ suppresses black hole evaporation. Quasinormal mode frequencies in the eikonal limit are also derived, demonstrating that both the oscillation frequency and damping rate shift under GCW-induced corrections. Additionally, the gravitational redshift and scalar perturbation waveform exhibit deformations sensitive to $ \varepsilon $. Our results highlight the GCW framework as a phenomenologically viable semiclassical model, offering testable predictions for upcoming gravitational wave and VLBI observations.</description>

      <title>Equation of state and Fermi liquid properties of dense matter based on chiral EFT interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results for the equation of state of symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter obtained in many-body-perturbation theory (MBPT) up to third order, based on various chiral nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon interactions used in ab initio calculations of nuclei. We extract equation of state properties, such as the incompressibility and the symmetry energy, and discuss estimates of the theoretical uncertainties due to neglected higher-order contributions in the MBPT expansion as well as the chiral effective field theory expansion. In addition, we discuss the Fermi liquid approach to nuclear matter and present results for the Landau parameters, effective mass, and speed of sound for pure neutron matter.</description>

      <title>ReGrayssion: Machine Learning-Based Analytical Expressions for Gray-Body Factors and Application to Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a machine learning approach that explores the space of mathematical expressions to identify those that best fit a given dataset, balancing both accuracy and simplicity. We apply SR to the study of Gray-Body Factors (GBFs), which play a crucial role in the derivation of Hawking radiation and are recognized for their computational complexity. We explore simple analytical forms for the GBFs of the Schwarzschild Black Hole (BH). We compare the results obtained with different approaches and quantify their consistency with those obtained by solving the Teukolsky equation. As a case study, we apply our pipeline, which we call \texttt{ReGrayssion}, to the study of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) as Dark Matter (DM) candidates, deriving constraints on the abundance from observations of diffuse extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background. These results highlight the possible role of SR in providing human-interpretable, approximate analytical GBF expressions, offering a new pathway for investigating PBH as a DM candidate.</description>

      <title>Polarization Studies in Different Blazar Types. Part I: Correlation between Optical Brightness and Polarization Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the cross-correlation between optical brightness and polarization degree in different types of blazars. The aim is to identify objects with simultaneous and consistent changes in characteristics and to determine if this behavior relates to the types of objects studied. The analysis includes 23 objects: 11 FSRQ, 11 BL Lac, and 1 radio galaxy. Dense overlapping observation series in the R band were used, collected over more than 10 years as part of a monitoring program for bright blazars at St. Petersburg State University. The cross-correlation analysis procedure is detailed, including a method for assessing significance based on Monte Carlo simulations of synthetic light curves modeled using a Damped Random Walk. Significant correlations were found for 5 FSRQ and 1 BL Lac. No significant correlation was detected for 10 BL Lac and 6 FSRQ. One object did not yield a reliable estimate. Based on the current results, we cannot claim that the observed difference in the behavior of these emission characteristics for different classes of blazars is significant. It is possible that observed correlations may be explained by the contribution of simultaneous flare events to the changes in flux and polarization degree curves, which occur more frequently in FSRQ objects.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Energy Distribution and Formation Rate of CHIME Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a large sample of fast radio bursts (FRBs) from the first CHIME/FRB catalog, we apply the Lynden-Bell's c$^-$ method to study their energy function and formation rate evolutions with redshift. It is found with the non-parametric Kendell's $\tau$ statistics that the FRB energy strongly evolves with the cosmological redshift as $E(z)\propto(1 + z)^{5.23}$. After removing the redshift dependence, the local energy distribution can be described by a broken power-law form of $\Psi(E_{0})\propto E_{0}^{-0.38}$ for the low-energy segment and $\Psi(E_{0})\propto E_{0}^{-2.01}$ for the high-energy segment with a dividing line of $\sim2.1\times10^{40} \rm erg$. Interestingly, we find that the formation rate of CHIME FRBs also evolves with redshift as $\rho(z)\propto(1+z)^{-4.73\pm0.08}$. The local formation rate $\rho(0)$ of the CHIME FRBs is constrained to be about $ 1.25\times 10^4\rm{\,Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$ that is comparable with some previous estimations. In addition, we notice the formation rate not only exceeds the star formation rate at the lower redshifts but also always declines with the increase of redshift, which does not match the star formation history at all. Consequently, we suggest that most FRBs could originate from the older stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Further evidence of Quasiperiodic Eruptions in a tidal disruption event AT2019vcb by SRG/eROSITA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a short, large amplitude X-ray flare from AT2019vcb (aka Tormund), a tidal disruption event at $z=0.088$. The discovery is based on the data from the SRG/eROSITA X-ray telescope which happened to observe the source seven months after the onset of the optical TDE. eROSITA observation occurred 13 days after a soft flare was detected in the XMM-Newton data by Quintin et al. 2023. Both events bear similar characteristics in terms of timing and spectral properties. eROSITA spectrum is described as an accretion disk with a characteristic temperature of $\sim180$ eV and luminosity $\sim8\times10^{43}$ erg/s. The eROSITA flare lasted less than 12 hours and had an amplitude $\ge70$ with respect to the quiescent level, no flares were detected in later eROSITA observations (6-18 months later). The XMM-Newton and eROSITA flares provide strong evidence that the TDE AT2019vcb is a bona fide QPE source. Our work further strengthens the direct connection between TDEs and QPE following similar recent results in a TDE AT2019qiz by Nicholl et al. 2024.</description>

      <title>The cosmic evolution of FRBs inferred from CHIME/FRB Baseband Catalog 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Redshift and luminosity distributions are essential for understanding the cosmic evolution of extragalactic objects and phenomena, such as galaxies, gamma-ray bursts, and fast radio bursts (FRBs). For FRBs, these distributions are primarily estimated using the fluence and the Dispersion Measure (DM). Calibrating their joint distribution has been challenging due to a lack of accurate fluences in the intensity data of the CHIME/FRB survey. Using the baseband update of CHIME/FRB Catalog 1, we calibrate the 2D fluence-DM distribution for the first time. We find the energy distribution is described well by a Schechter function with power-law slope of $-1.94^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$. Testing two types of redshift evolution models suggests a likely combination of young and old formation channels. $31^{+31}_{-21}$% of FRB sources may track star formation, or correspondingly, FRB sources may have delay times of $1.94^{+1.54}_{-1.31}$ Gyr. A pure star formation tracking population is excluded by only one model at $&gt; 2\sigma$ confidence. An updated cosmic star formation rate density evolution up to redshift 14 is constrained by compiling results from several JWST studies. The furthest FRB detection with planned radio facilities is expected to be at $z \approx 5$. A radio telescope operating at 200 MHz with a system-equivalent flux density of $\leq 0.07$ Jy (equivalent to a detection threshold of 1 mJy ms) and instantaneous sky coverage of $\gtrsim 400$ square degrees should be able to detect $630^{+730}_{-485}$ FRBs year$^{-1}$ at $z \gtrsim 6$ and $53^{+83}_{-43}$ FRBs year$^{-1}$ at $z\gtrsim 8$, which is sufficient to differentiate between reionization histories.</description>

      <title>Effect of thermal conduction on accretion shocks in relativistic magnetized flows around rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the effects of thermal conduction on relativistic, magnetized, viscous, advective accretion flows around rotating black holes considering bremsstrahlung and synchrotron cooling processes. Assuming the toroidal component of magnetic fields as the dominant one, we self-consistently solve the steady-state fluid equations to derive the global transonic accretion solutions for a black hole of spin $a_{\rm k}$. Depending on the model parameters, the magnetized accretion flow undergoes shock transitions and shock-induced global accretion solutions persist over a wide range of model parameters including the conduction parameter ($\Upsilon_{\rm s}$), plasma-$\beta$, and viscosity parameter ($\alpha_{\rm B}$). We find that the shock properties -- such as shock radius ($r_{\rm s}$), compression ratio ($R$), and shock strength ($S$) -- are regulated by $\Upsilon_{\rm s}$, plasma $\beta$, and $\alpha_{\rm B}$. Furthermore, we compute the critical conduction parameter ($\Upsilon_{\rm s}^{\rm cri}$), a threshold beyond which shock formation ceases to exist, and investigate its dependence on plasma-$\beta$ and $\alpha_{\rm B}$ for both weakly rotating ($a_{\rm k} \rightarrow 0$) and rapidly rotating ($a_{\rm k} \rightarrow 1$) black holes. Finally, we examine the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the accretion disc and observe that increased thermal conduction and magnetic field strength lead to more luminous emission spectra from black hole sources.</description>

      <title>SN 2024abfo: a partially stripped SN II from a yellow supergiant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic data of the type IIb supernova (SN) 2024abfo in NGC 1493 (at 11 Mpc). The ATLAS survey discovered the object just a few hours after the explosion, and observed a fast rise on the first day. Signs of the sharp shock break-out peak and the subsequent cooling phase are observed in the ultraviolet and the bluest optical bands in the first couple of days, while no peak is visible in the reddest filters. Subsequently, in analogy with normal SNe IIb, the light curve of SN 2024abfo rises again in all bands to the broad peak, with the maximum light reached around one month after the explosion. Its absolute magnitude at peak is $M_r=-16.5\pm0.1$ mag, making it a faint SN IIb. The early spectra are dominated by Balmer lines with broad P-Cygni profiles indicating ejecta velocity of 22,500 km/s. One month after the explosion, the spectra display a transition towards being He-dominated, though the H lines do not completely disappear, supporting the classification of SN 2024abfo as a relatively H-rich SN IIb. We identify the progenitor of SN 2024abfo in archival images of the Hubble Space Telescope, the Dark Energy Survey, and the XMM-Newton space telescope, in multiple optical filters. From its spectral energy distribution, the progenitor is consistent with being a yellow supergiant, having an initial mass of 15 $M_{\odot}$. This detection supports an emerging trend of SN IIb progenitors being more luminous and hotter than SN II ones, and being primaries of massive binaries. Within the SN IIb class, fainter events such as SN 2024abfo tend to have cooler and more expanded progenitors than luminous SNe IIb.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Accretion on FRB Radiation Mechanisms in Binary Systems: Constraints and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are intense, millisecond-duration radio transients that have recently been proposed to arise from coherent radiation mechanisms within the magnetosphere of neutron stars. Observations of repeating FRBs, including periodic activity and large variations in Faraday rotation measures, suggest that these bursts may have binary system origins, with massive companion. In this work, we investigate how accretion from a massive companion influences the FRB radiation within the magnetosphere of the neutron star. Focusing on two widely accepted pulsar-like coherent radiation mechanisms, we establish the parameter space for neutron stars that allows FRB generation, even in the presence of accreted matter. Our analysis shows that coherent curvature radiation is only viable within a narrow range of parameters, while the magnetic reconnection mechanism operates across a broader range. In both cases, the neutron star must possess a strong magnetic field with strength $\gtrsim 10^{13}$ G. These findings at least indicate that the central engines responsible for producing observable FRBs in binary systems are indeed magnetars.</description>

      <title>Spin evolution modeling for a newly-formed white dwarf resulting from binary white dwarf merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03199v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Merger of two white dwarfs (WDs) has been proposed to form an isolated WD having high magnetization and rapid rotation. We study the influence of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind on spin evolution of the newly-formed merger product. We consider the scenario that the merger product appears as a giant-star-like object with a radius of $&gt; 10^{10}$ cm and a luminosity of the order of an Eddington value. We solve a structure of the merger product under the hydrostatic equilibrium and identify the position of the slow-point in the hot envelope. It is found that if such a giant-star-like object is spinning with an angular speed of the order of the Keplerian value, the MHD wind can be produced. The mass-loss rate is estimated to be of the order of $\sim 10^{20-21}~\mathrm{g~s^{-1}}$, and the timescale of the spin down is $\sim 10\text{-}10^{3}$ years, which depends on stellar magnetic field. We discuss that the final angular momentum when the MHD wind is terminated is related to the magnetic flux and initial radiation luminosity of the merger product. We apply our model to three specific magnetic WD sources ZTF J190132.9+145808.7, SDSS J221141.8+113604.4, and PG 1031+234 by assuming that those WDs were as a result of the merger product. We argue that the current periods of ZTF J190132.9+145808.7 and PG 1031+234 that are strongly magnetized WDs are related to the initial luminosity at the giant phase. For SDSS J221141.8+113604.4, which is mildly magnetized WD, its angular momentum was almost determined when the spin-down timescale due to MHD wind is comparable to the cooling timescale in the giant phase.</description>

      <title>CHIME All-sky Multiday Pulsar Stacking Search (CHAMPSS): System Overview and First Discoveries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the CHIME All-sky Multiday Pulsar Stacking Search (CHAMPSS) project. This novel radio pulsar survey revisits the full Northern Sky daily, offering unprecedented opportunity to detect highly intermittent pulsars, as well as faint sources via long-term data stacking. CHAMPSS uses the CHIME/FRB datastream, which consists of 1024 stationary beams streaming intensity data at $0.983$\,ms resolution, 16384 frequency channels across 400--800\,MHz, continuously being searched for single, dispersed bursts/pulses. In CHAMPSS, data from adjacent east-west beams are combined to form a grid of tracking beams, allowing longer exposures at fixed positions. These tracking beams are dedispersed to many trial dispersion measures (DM) to a maximum DM beyond the Milky Way's expected contribution, and Fourier transformed in time to form power spectra. Repeated observations are searched daily to find intermittent sources, and power spectra of the same sky positions are incoherently stacked, increasing sensitivity to faint persistent sources. The $0.983$\,ms time resolution limits our sensitivity to millisecond pulsars; we have full sensitivity to pulsars with $P &gt; 60\,$ms, with sensitivity gradually decreasing from $60$ ms to $2$\,ms as higher harmonics are beyond the Nyquist limit. In a commissioning survey, data covering $\sim 1/16$ of the CHIME sky was processed and searched in quasi-realtime over two months, leading to the discovery of eleven new pulsars, each with $S_{600} &gt; 0.1$\,mJy. When operating at scale, CHAMPSS will stack $&gt;$1\,year of data along each sightline, reaching a sensitivity of $\lesssim 30\, \mu$Jy for all sightlines above a declination of $10^{\circ}$, and off of the Galactic plane.</description>

      <title>Modeling of lightcurves from reconnection-powered very high energy flares from M87*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The black hole at the center of M87 is observed to flare regularly in the very high energy (VHE) band, with photon energies $\gtrsim 100$ GeV. The rapid variability, which can be as short as $2$ days in the VHE lightcurve constrains some of the flares to originate close to the black hole. Magnetic reconnection is a promising candidate for explaining the flares, where the VHE emission comes from background soft photons that Inverse Compton (IC) scatter off of high energy electron-positron pairs in the reconnecting current sheet. In this work, we ray trace photons from a current sheet near the black hole event horizon during a flux eruption in a magnetically arrested state in a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulation. We incorporate beaming of the Compton up-scattered photons, based on results from radiative kinetic simulations of relativistic reconnection. We then construct VHE lightcurves that account for the dynamics of the current sheet and lensing from general-relativistic effects. We find that most of the flux originates in the inner $5$ gravitational radii, and beaming is essential to explain the observed flux from the strongest VHE flares. The ray traced lightcurves show features resulting from the changing volume of the reconnecting current sheet on timescales that can be consistent with observations. Furthermore, we find that the amount of beaming depends strongly on two effects: the current sheet inclination with respect to the observer and the anisotropy in the direction of motion of the accelerated particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave data analysis (GWDA) faces significant challenges due to high-dimensional parameter spaces and non-Gaussian, non-stationary artifacts in the interferometer background, which traditional methods have made significant progress in addressing but continue to face limitations. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning (DL) algorithms, offers potential advantages, including computational efficiency, scalability, and adaptability, which may complement traditional approaches in tackling these challenges more effectively. In this review, we explore AI-driven approaches to GWDA, covering every stage of the pipeline and presenting first explorations in waveform modeling and parameter estimation. This work represents the most comprehensive review to date, integrating the latest AI advancements with practical GWDA applications. Our meta-analysis reveals insights and trends, highlighting the transformative potential of AI in revolutionizing gravitational wave research and paving the way for future discoveries.</description>

      <title>Fisher Forecast of Finite-Size Effects with Future Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use Fisher information theory to forecast the bounds on the finite-size effects of astrophysical compact objects with next-generation gravitational wave detectors, including the ground-based Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), as well as the space-based Laser Interferomet Space Antenna (LISA). Exploiting the worldline effective field theory (EFT) formalism, we first characterize three types of quadrupole finite-size effects: the spin-induced quadrupole moments, the conservative tidal deformations, and the tidal heating. We then derive the corresponding contributions to the gravitational waveform phases for binary compact objects in aligned-spin quasi-circular orbits. We separately estimate the constraints on these finite-size effects for black holes using the power spectral densities (PSDs) of the CE+ET detector network and LISA observations. For the CE+ET network, we find that the bounds on the mass-weighted spin-independent dissipation number $H_0$ are of the order $O(1)$, while the bounds on the mass-weighted tidal Love number $\tilde{\Lambda}$ are of the order $O(10)$. For high-spin binary black holes with dimensionless spin $\chi \simeq 0.8$, the bounds on the symmetric spin-induced quadrupole moment $\kappa_s$ are of the order $O(10^{-1})$. LISA observations of supermassive black hole mergers offer slightly tighter constraints on all three finite-size parameters. Additionally, we perform a Fisher analysis for a binary neutron star merger within the CE+ET network. The bounds on the tidal parameter $H_0$ and on $\tilde \Lambda$ are around two orders of magnitude better than the current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) bounds.</description>

      <title>Spectral diversity in collisional neutrino-flavor conversion: flavor equipartition or swap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum kinetics of neutrinos are known to potentially change the classical neutrino radiation field in high-energy astrophysical sources such as core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron-star mergers. However, the mixing phenomena still have open issues in the nonlinear dynamics and the asymptotic states, particularly for recently discovered collision-induced flavor conversion. In this paper, we investigate linear and nonlinear dynamics of collisional neutrino-flavor conversion (CFC) with multi-energy neutrino gases through numerical simulations, demonstrating that the asymptotic states dramatically change depending on unstable modes dominating the system. In one unstable mode, high-energy neutrinos reach a flavor equipartition, but low-energy neutrinos return back to almost their initial states. In contrast, in the other one, rather low-energy neutrinos achieve a full flavor swap, but high-energy neutrinos undergo less flavor conversion. We clarify the distinct spectral behaviors in two different ways based on stability analysis and flavor pendulum. Our result suggests that CFC with flavor swap can become crucial at deeper radii with low electron fraction and requires more detailed theoretical modeling of neutrino quantum kinetics.</description>

      <title>Probing a low-mass $Z^{\prime}$ gauge boson at IceCube and prospects for IceCube-Gen2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of the $L_\mu - L_\tau$ model, which predicts a new massive gauge boson, $Z'$, on astrophysical neutrino events at the IceCube Observatory. This new gauge boson couples with leptons from the second and third families, and would break the power law of the astrophysical neutrino flux due to the interaction of this flux with the cosmic neutrino background. We derive the sensitivity of the IceCube to this model considering the HESE data from 12 years of observation by assuming different assumptions for the redshift distributions of astrophysical neutrino sources, mass ordering, and sum of neutrino masses. Our results indicate that the current IceCube data is able to probe small coupling and masses of the order of some few MeV, with the covered parameter space being larger if a distribution of neutrino sources is described by the star formation rate model. In addition, we demonstrate that the IceCube-Gen2 will cover a large region of the parameter space and will allow us to improve our understanding of the $L_\mu - L_\tau$ model.</description>

      <title>Cumulative effect of orbital resonances in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orbital resonances in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) have been proven to be a key feature for accurate gravitational-wave template modeling. Decades of research have led to schemes that can not only model the adiabatic inspiral of such a binary system, but also account for the effects of resonances on their evolution. In this work, we use an effective resonance model that includes analytically derived corrections to the radiation reaction fluxes, to study the combined effects of both dominant (low-order) and subdominant (high-order) orbital resonances in EMRIs. We show that using single, universal shifts for all fluxes overestimates the resonance impact, and therefore individualized shifts for each resonance crossing are needed for accurate modeling. Our analysis reveals that the cumulative effects from multiple resonance crossings can significantly impact the orbital evolution of EMRIs, especially for highly eccentric orbits. Our results provide further evidence that resonance effects have to be included in template production to extract detailed astrophysical parameters from EMRI signals.</description>

      <title>[C II]-deficit caused by self-absorption in an ionized carbon-filled bubble in RCW79</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent spectroscopic observations of the [C II] 158$\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ fine-structure line of ionized carbon (C$^+$), using the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), have revealed expanding [C II] shells in Galactic H\,{ II} regions. We report the discovery of a bubble-shaped source (S144 in RCW79), associated with a compact H II region, excited by a single O7.5--9.5V/III star, which is consistent with a scenario that the bubble is still mostly ``filled'' with C$^+$. This indicates most likely a very early evolutionary state, in which the stellar wind has not yet blown material away, as it is the case for more evolved H II regions. Using the SimLine non-LTE radiative transfer code, the [C II] emission can be modeled to originate from three regions. First, a central H II region with little C$^+$ in the fully ionized phase, followed by two layers with gas density around $2500\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ of partially photo-dissociated gas. The second layer is a slowly expanding [C II] shell with an expansion velocity of $\sim\,$$2.6\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. The outermost layer exhibits a temperature and velocity gradient that produces the observed self-absorption features in the optically thick [C II] line ($\tau \sim 4$) leading to an apparent deficit in [C II] emission and a low ratio of [C II] to total far-infrared (FIR) emission. We developed a procedure to approximate the missing [C II] flux and find a linear correlation between [C II] and FIR without a [C II]-deficit. This demonstrates that at least some of the [C II]-deficit found in Galactic H II bubbles can be attributed to self-absorption.</description>
