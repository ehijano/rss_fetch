      <title>Probing the pseudogap and beyond: examining single-particle properties of the hole- and electron-doped Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of the Hubbard model using the unbiased determinant quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, revealing an asymmetry between electron and hole doping. Electron doping exhibits more coherent quasiparticles and stronger antiferromagnetic correlations compared to hole doping. At low doping, a nodal-antinodal dichotomy on the Fermi surface is observed, similar to cuprate experiments. The dichotomy reflects the momentum dependence of the Mott gap, as manifested in both the spectral function and the self-energy. For hole doping, we observe a transition towards the pseudogap, without signature of pocket formation. The simulated nuclear magnetic resonance pseudogap temperatures do not necessarily agree with the temperature determined by spectroscopy. These findings collectively suggest the pseudogap is a smooth crossover driven by strong correlations.</description>

      <title>$La_3Pd_2NaO_9$: A High-Valent Insulating Palladate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high-valent palladate, $La_3Pd_2NaO_9$, has been synthesized for the first time. Single crystals with dimensions of 20 ${\mu}$m on edge were successfully grown using the flux method at 420 $^o$C and 70 bar oxygen pressure. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP) measurements show that the atomic ratio of La: (Pd+Na) is 3: 3 and Pd: Na is 2: 1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements show that the oxidation state of Pd is dominated by +4. Synchrotron X-ray single-crystal diffraction measurements revealed that this material crystallizes in the monoclinic $P2_1/c$ space group with charge ordering of Na and Pd. Real-space imaging via scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirmed the crystal structure and revealed excellent sample homogeneity. Electrical resistivity measurements show an insulating behavior. Magnetic measurements show an unexpected paramagnetic behavior, which probably originate from a small fraction of high-spin Pd$^{2+}$ evidenced by XPS. The successful growth of $La_3Pd_2NaO_9$ single crystals with a high-valent oxidation state of Pd offers an approach for exploring interesting palladates, including potential bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper palladates analogous to the high temperature superconducting $La_3Ni_2O_7$.</description>

      <title>Extracting the singularity of the logarithmic partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In principle, the logarithm of the partition function and its derivatives can be used to rigorously determine the nature of phase transitions. However, in practice, this approach is often ineffective in numerical calculations, since resolving the singularities of the logarithmic partition function requires extremely high precision data especially when distinguishing between weakly first order phase transitions and deconfined quantum critical points. Based on the finite size scaling hypothesis, we propose that the singular contribution to the logarithmic partition function in quantum phase transitions can be extracted by eliminating the leading volume-law term. This is achieved by computing the Renyi thermal entropy (RTE) and its derivative (DRTE). We have derived the scaling relations for RTE and DRTE, which successfully determine the phase transition points and critical exponents through data collapse in various quantum many body systems. Notably, beyond their utility in locating quantum critical points, we find that DRTE is remarkably effective in detecting weakly first order phase transitions, such as in $ JQ $ models, which were initially thought to be continuous deconfined quantum phase transitions. The discontinuity of these transitions is challenging to detect using traditional local physical quantities. This work provides a new and powerful paradigm for studying quantum many body phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Quantum disordered ground state and relative proximity to an exactly solvable model in the frustrated magnet CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic properties of the triangular magnet CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ were investigated by magnetization and specific heat measurements down to $T=0.03\,$K on single crystals grown by the floating zone method. The formation of effective spins $S_\mathrm{eff}= 1/2$ below $T &lt; 10$\,K was confirmed both by DFT calculations and specific heat measurements. No magnetic order was found down to $T=0.03\,$K despite the formation of magnetic correlations observed in specific heat. The measured magnetization was compared with DMRG computation and their agreement supports the proposal of a strongly anisotropic magnetic interaction antiferromagnetically coupling the spin components in the $ab$ plane and ferromagnetically coupling the spin component along the $c$ axis. However, our quantitative study of the magnetization indicates a weaker proximity to quantum criticality between ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism than the previous inelastic neutron scattering study. Finally, we propose that the absence of magnetic order in CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ would most probably be related to the structural disorder revealed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.</description>

      <title>Orbital Order and Superconductivity in Bilayer Nickelate Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theory for bilayer nickelate materials, where a large tetragonal field - intrinsic or induced by epitaxial strain - lifts the orbital degeneracy and localizes the $3z^2-r^2$ orbital states. These states host local spins $S=1/2$ bound into singlets by strong interlayer coupling, and their dynamics is described by weakly dispersive singlet-triplet excitations ("triplons"). The charge carriers occupy the wide bands of $x^2-y^2$ symmetry, and their Cooper pairing is mediated by the high-energy triplon excitations. As the $x^2-y^2$ band filling increases, i.e. moving further away from the Ni$^{3+}$ valence state, the indirect Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions between local spins induce spin-density-wave order via triplon condensation. Implications of the model for compressively strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films and electron doped oxychloride Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ are discussed.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in the spin-state crossover materials: Nickelates with planar-coordinated low-spin Ni$^{2+}$ ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study quasi-two-dimensional nickel compounds, where the nickel ions assume Ni$^{2+}$ $d^8$ valence state and feature a low-spin $S=0$ ground state quasidegenerate with $S=1$ ionic excitations. Such a level structure is supported by square-planar coordination of nickel ions or a suitable substitution of apical oxygens. We construct the corresponding singlet-triplet exchange model and explore its phase diagram and excitation spectrum. By hole doping, we further introduce mobile Ni$^{3+}$ $d^7$ ionic configurations with effective spins $S=1/2$, and analyze their interactions with the $d^8$ singlet-triplet background. The interplay with the triplet excitations in the $d^8$ sector is found to have a deep impact on the propagation of the doped hole-like charge carriers and is identified as a powerful source of Cooper pairing among them.</description>

      <title>Pseudocriticality in antiferromagnetic spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak first-order pseudocriticality with approximate scale invariance has been observed in a variety of settings, including the intriguing case of deconfined criticality in 2+1 dimensions. Recently, this has been interpreted as extremely slow flows ("walking behavior") for real-valued couplings in proximity to a bona fide critical point with complex-valued couplings, described by a complex conformal field theory (CFT). Here we study an SU($N$) generalization of the the Heisenberg antiferromagnet, which is a familiar model for deconfined criticality in 2+1 dimensions. We show that in 1+1 dimensions the model is located near a complex CFT, whose proximity can be tuned as a function of $N$. We employ state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo simulations for continuous $N$ along with an improved loop estimator for the R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy based on a nonequilibrium work protocol. These techniques allow us to track the central charge of this model in detail as a function of $N$, where we observe excellent agreement with CFT predictions. Notably, this includes the region $N&gt;2$, where the CFT moves into the complex plane and pseudocritical drifts enable us to recover the real part of the complex central charge with remarkable accuracy. Since the present model with $N=3$ is also equivalent to the spin-1 biquadratic model, our work sheds new light on the dimerized phase of the spin-1 chain, demonstrating that it is pseudocritical and proximate to a complex CFT.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetism and Tightly Bound Cooper Pairs Induced by Kinetic Frustration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetism and superconductivity are often viewed as competing orders in correlated electron systems. Here, we demonstrate that kinetic frustration in hole motion facilitates their coexistence within the square-lattice repulsive Hubbard model. Combining exact analytical solutions on tailored geometries with large-scale numerical simulations, we reveal a robust pairing mechanism: holes on opposite sublattices behave as if they carry opposite effective charges due to spin singlet formation from kinetic frustration. This emergent property suppresses phase separation and fosters a coherent $d$-wave superconducting channel embedded within a long-range antiferromagnetic background. Our findings establish a minimal yet broadly applicable framework for stabilizing strong-coupling superconductivity in doped Mott insulators.</description>

      <title>Update of Hartree--Fock theory for Hubbard-like models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the standard textbook description of (restricted) Hartree--Fock theory for (Fermi) Hubbard-like models is in need of an update, and we present such an update allowing us to correct basic and established results in the condensed matter physics literature that are qualitatively wrong. Our update amounts to adding a test which reliably checks the thermodynamic stability of solutions of Hartree--Fock equations. This stability test makes it possible to detect, by simple means and with certainty, regions in phase space where the model exhibits mixed phases where two conventional phases coexist and translation invariance is broken in complicated ways; in such a mixed phase, unconventional physics is to be expected. Our results show that mixed phases are ubiquitous in Hubbard-like models in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Mott metal-insulator transition in a modified periodic Anderson model: Insights from entanglement entropy and role of short-range spatial correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition is a paradigmatic phenomenon where Coulomb interactions between electrons drive a metal-insulator phase transition. It has been extensively studied within the Hubbard model, where a quantum critical transition occurs at a finite temperature second-order critical point. This work investigates the Mott metal-insulator transition in a modified periodic Anderson model that may be viewed as a three-orbital lattice model including an interacting, localized orbital coupled to a delocalized conduction orbital via a second conduction orbital. This model could also be viewed as a bilayer model involving a conventional periodic Anderson model layer coupled to a metallic layer. Within the dynamical mean field theory, this model possesses a strictly zero temperature quantum critical point separating a Fermi liquid and a Mott insulating phase. By employing a simplified version of the dynamical mean field theory, namely, the two-site or linearized dynamical mean field theory, we provide an analytical estimate of the critical parameter strengths at which the transition occurs at zero temperature. We also provide an analytical estimate of the single-site von Neumann entanglement entropy. This measure can be used as a robust identifier for the phase transition. We extend these calculations to their cluster version to incorporate short-range, non-local spatial correlations and discuss their effects on the transition observed in this model.</description>

      <title>Flat Midgap Topological Surface and Hypersurface Bands without Parameter Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model is extended to the three and higher dimensional systems. Nearly or absolutely flat midgap surface and hypersurface bands are predicted based on the topological analysis, which do not require fine tuning of parameters. By adding the on-site Coulomb interaction for the three dimensional systems, we computationally show that the large difference in the band widths between the surface and the bulk leads to the strongly correlated phenomena, specifically magnetism, confined only on the surface. Possible experimental realizations in solid state materials and metamaterials are discussed.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelastic dynamics of the "spin Jahn-Teller" transition in CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$ has the paradox that low temperature static magnetic order is incompatible with the crystal structure owing to a mirror plane that exactly frustrates magnetic interactions. Despite no observable structural distortion with diffraction, CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$ does magnetically order below $T_{\rm N}$ $\sim$ 25 K with the breaking of spin ground state degeneracy proposed to be a realization of the spin Jahn-Teller effect in analogy to the celebrated orbital Jahn-Teller transition. We apply neutron and Raman spectroscopy to study the dynamics of this transition in CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$. We find anomalous acoustics associated with a symmetry breaking strain that characterizes the spin Jahn-Teller transition. Crucially, the energy of this phonon coincides with the energy scale of the magnetic excitations, and has the same symmetry of an optic mode, observed with Raman spectroscopy, which atypically softens in energy with decreasing temperature. Taken together, we propose that the energetics of the spin Jahn-Teller effect in CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$ are related to cooperative magnetoelastic fluctuations as opposed to conventional soft critical dynamics which typically drive large measurable static displacements.</description>

      <title>Observation of a spin-textured nematic Kondo lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kondo lattice mode, as one of the most fundamental models in condensed matter physics, has been employed to describe a wide range of quantum materials such as heavy fermions, transition metal dichalcogenides and two-dimensional Moire systems. Discovering new phases on Kondo lattice and unveiling their mechanisms are crucial to the understanding of strongly correlated systems. Here, in a layered Kondo magnet USbTe, we observe a spin-textured nematic state and visualize a heavy electronic liquid-crystal phase. Employing scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), we visualize a tetragonal symmetry breaking of heavy electronic states around the Fermi level. Through systematically investigating the temperature and energy dependence of spectroscopic data, we find that the nematic state coincides with the formation of heavy quasi-particles driven by band hybridization. Remarkably, using spin polarized STM, we demonstrate that the nematic state is spin polarized, which not only suggests its intrinsically electronic nature, but also represents the unique magnetic texture of nematic heavy fermions. Our findings unveil a novel correlation-mediated order whose mechanism is inherently tied to Kondo-lattice physics. The observation of heavy nematic states enriches the phase diagram of correlated systems and provides a rare platform to explore the interplay of Kondo physics, spontaneous symmetry breaking and quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Local symmetry breaking and orbital glass behaviour in CoFe2O4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural distortions, orbital correlations, and electronic states in cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) were investigated using complementary characterisation techniques, including SR-XRD, HAXPES, XANES, EXAFS, and Raman spectroscopy. SR-XRD confirms phase purity and reveals a temperature-dependent superlattice reflection between 200 K and 100 K, consistent with the emergence of short-range orbital ordering driven by cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion (JTD). The disappearance of this feature below 100 K signals orbital freezing and the onset of a glass-like orbital state. HAXPES measurements show multiplet splitting and charge-transfer satellite features in the Co and Fe 2p core levels, indicating mixed valence states and strong electron correlations. XANES analysis reveals hybridized p-d states and local coordination distortions. Temperature-dependent EXAFS measurements indicate increasing local disorder-particularly in Fe-O and Fe-Fe octahedral bonds as evidenced by enhanced Debye-Waller factors. These distortions, attributed to cation redistribution and oxygen vacancies, are static and asymmetric, primarily affecting the octahedral sublattice. Notably, signatures of cooperative Jahn-Teller distortions emerge in the intermediate temperature range (200-100 K) and disappear upon further cooling. Raman spectroscopy further supports these findings, revealing phonon anomalies and enhanced spin-phonon coupling in the same temperature range. Magnetic measurements indicate spin reorientation and exchange interaction anomalies that align with the orbital behaviour. Together, these results hint at a frustrated orbital state in CoFe2O4 possibly involving cooperative Jahn-Teller distortions, disrupted long-range coherence, and orbital glass behaviour offering new insights into the coupling of orbital, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom in spinel systems.</description>

      <title>A Josephson wormhole in coupled superconducting Yukawa-SYK metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that two Yukawa-SYK models with a weak tunneling contact can have an exotic hybrid superconducting thermofield-double-like state that is holographically dual to a traversable wormhole connecting two black holes with charged scalar hair. The hybrid superconducting thermo-field-double/wormhole state is distinguishable by anomalous scaling of revival oscillations in the fermionic Green's function, but also in a unique Andreev-revival in the anomalous Green's function. The existence of this TFD/wormhole state surprisingly shows that the some quantum critical effects can survive the phase transition to superconductivity. This Andreev-revival is in principle an accessible signature of the transition to the TFD/wormhole phase detectable in the ac-Josephson current.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first proof of principle that normalizing flows can accurately learn the Boltzmann distribution of the fermionic Hubbard model - a key framework for describing the electronic structure of graphene and related materials. State-of-the-art methods like Hybrid Monte Carlo often suffer from ergodicity issues near the time-continuum limit, leading to biased estimates. Leveraging symmetry-aware architectures as well as independent and identically distributed sampling, our approach resolves these issues and achieves significant speed-ups over traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the thermodynamic limit in quantum spin and dimer models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamic limit is foundational to statistical mechanics, underlying our understanding of many-body phases. It assumes that, as the system size grows infinitely at fixed density of particles, unambiguous macroscopic phases emerge that are independent of the system's boundary shape. We present explicit quantum spin and dimer Hamiltonians whose ground states violate this principle. Our construction relies on the previous mathematical work on classical dimers on the Aztec diamond and the square-octagon fortress, where geometry-dependent phase behaviors are observed in the infinite-size limit. We reverse engineer quantum spin Hamiltonians on the square and the square-octagon lattices whose ground states at the Rokhsar-Kivelson points are described by classical dimer coverings. On diamond-shaped domains, we find macroscopic boundary regions exhibiting distinct quantum phases from those on square-shaped domains. We study the nature of these phases by calculating the dimer-dimer and vison correlators and adapt Kasteleyn matrix based analytical and numerical methods for computing the vison correlator, which are significantly more efficient than standard Monte Carlo techniques. Our results show that the square-octagon lattice supports a single gapped short-range entangled phase, with exponentially decaying dimer correlators and a constant vison correlator. When the same model is considered on a diamond-shaped domain, an additional ordered phase emerges near the corners, where the dimers are in a staggered pattern.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In strongly correlated electron systems, superconductivity and charge density waves often coexist in close proximity, suggesting a deeper relationship between these competing phases. Recent research indicates that these orders can intertwine, with the superconducting order parameter coupling to modulations in the electronic density. To elucidate this interplay, we study a two-dimensional XY model with a periodic modulation of the coupling strength in one spatial direction. Using a combination of tensor network methods and Monte Carlo simulations, we reveal a non-monotonic, dome-like dependence of $T_c$ on the modulation wavelength, with the peak $T_c$ shifting to longer wavelengths as the modulation strength grows. The origin of this phenomenon is traced back to an effective pinning of vortices in the valleys of the modulation, confirmed by a comparison to modulated $q$-state clock models. These findings shed new light on the phase behavior of intertwined superconducting and charge-ordered states, offering a deeper understanding of their complex interactions.</description>

      <title>The Carrollian Kaleidoscope</title>

Abstract: The Carroll group arises in the vanishing speed of light limit of the Poincar\'{e} group and was initially discarded as just a mathematical curiosity. However, recent developments have proved otherwise. Carroll and conformal Carroll symmetries are now ubiquitous, appearing in diverse physical phenomena starting from condensed matter physics to quantum gravity. This review aims to provide the reader a gateway into this fast-developing field. After an introduction and setting the stage with basics of the symmetry in question, we detail the construction of Carrollian and Carrollian Conformal field theories (CCFT).
  We then focus on applications. By far the most popular of these applications is in the context of the construction of holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes (AFS) in terms of a co-dimension one dual CCFT. We review the early work on AFS$_3$ /CCFT$_2$ before delving into an in-depth analysis for the construction of the dual to 4D AFS.
  Two other important sets of applications are in hydrodynamics and in condensed matter physics, which we discuss in detail. Carroll hydrodynamics is introduced as the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics first and then reconstructed from a symmetry based approach. Relations to ultrarelativistic flows and connections to the quark-gluon plasma are discussed with concrete examples of the Bjorken and Gubser flow models. In condensed matter applications, we cover connections to fractons, flat bands, and phase separation in Luttinger liquid models. To conclude, we give very brief outlines of other topics of interest including string theory and black hole horizons.</description>

      <title>Mixed phases in a Fermi--Hubbard model describing altermagnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an extension of the 2D Fermi--Hubbard model, which was recently introduced in [Das et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 263402 (2024)] and shown to describe altermagnetism that can be studied in cold atom systems. Using an updated Hartree--Fock method that can detect instabilities towards phase separation, we show that the model is in a mixed phase in large parts of the parameter regime at half-filling. We argue that the occurrence of a mixed phase is an indication of exotic physics which, in this model, occurs in parameter regimes accessible in cold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in a Chern band: effect of time-reversal-symmetry breaking on superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-reversal-symmetry breaking is generally understood to be detrimental for superconductivity. However, recent experiments found superconductivity emerging out of a normal state showing a finite anomalous Hall effect, indicative of time-reversal-symmetry breaking, in diverse systems from kagome metals, $1T'$-WS$_2$, to twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we study the stability of superconducting orders and the mechanisms that suppress superconductivity in the prototypical anomalous Hall system, the Haldane model, where complex hopping parameters result in loop-current order with a compensated flux pattern. We find that neither spin-singlet nor spin-triplet states are generically suppressed, but the real-space sublattice structure plays a crucial role in the stability of the orders. Interestingly, the nearest-neighbor chiral states of $d\pm id$ or $p\pm i p$ symmetry couple linearly to the flux, such that the two otherwise degenerate chiralities split under finite flux. As an experimental probe to distinguish the various orders in this system, we study the anomalous thermal Hall effect, $\kappa_{xy} / T$, which vanishes at zero temperature for topologically trivial superconducting states, but reaches a finite value corresponding to the Chern number in a topologically non-trivial superconducting state. Our results illustrate that broken time-reversal symmetry through a finite flux is neither generically destructive for superconductivity, nor does it imply non-trivial topological order of the emerging superconducting state. However, in the case of multiple competing pairing channels, the loop-current order can favor a chiral superconducting state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Rydberg tweezer arrays bring novel opportunities for programmable quantum simulations beyond previous capabilities. In this work, we investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms. Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order. Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Nanosculpted 3D helices of a magnetic Weyl semimetal with switchable nonreciprocity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergent properties of materials are defined by the symmetries of their underlying atomic, spin and charge order. The explorations of symmetry breaking effects are therefore usually limited by the intrinsic properties of known, stable materials. In recent years, advances in focused ion beam (FIB) fabrication have enabled the nanostructuring of bulk crystals into ultraprecise transport devices [1-4], facilitating the investigation of geometrical effects on mesoscopic length scales. In this work, we expand such explorations into three-dimensional (3D), curvilinear shapes, by sculpting helical nanostructure devices from single crystals of the high-mobility, centrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ [5,6]. The combination of the imposed chiral geometry and intrinsic ferromagnetism yields nonreciprocal electron transport [7-9]. The high coercivity results in an anomalous, reversable diode effect remnant under zero applied magnetic field, which is orders of magnitude larger than can be explained by a classical self-field mechanism. We argue the enhancement originates from the high carrier mobility and the resulting quasi-ballistic transport: the conduction electron mean free path approaches the length scale of the curvature, resulting in increased asymmetrical scattering at the boundaries. We further demonstrate the inverse effect of the nonreciprocal transport: the field-free, current-induced switching of the magnetisation. The results establish the vast potential of 3D nanosculpting to explore and enrich the functionality of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>A many-body characterization of the fundamental gap in monolayer CrI$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The many-body fixed-node and fixed-phase spin-orbit Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) methods are applied to accurately predict the fundamental gap of monolayer CrI$_3$ - the first experimentally-realized 2D material with intrinsic magnetism. The fundamental gap obtained, 2.9(1)~eV, agrees well with the highest peak in optical spectroscopy measurements and a previous $GW$ result. We numerically show that as expected in DMC the same value of the fundamental gap is obtained in the thermodynamic limit using both neutral promotions and the standard quasiparticle definition of the gap based on the ionization potential and electron affinity. Additional analysis of the differences between density matrices formed in different bases using configuration interaction calculations explains why a single-reference trial wave function can produce an accurate excitation. We find that accounting for electron correlation is more crucial than accounting for spin-orbit effects in determining the fundamental gap. These results highlight how DMC can be used to benchmark 2D material physics and emphasize the importance of using beyond-DFT methods for studying 2D materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The moir\'{e} structure of AB-stacked $\rm{MoTe_2/WSe_2}$ represents a natural platform to realize Kondo lattice models, due to the discrepancy of the bandwidth between the individual layers. Here, we study this system at the commensurate filling of $\nu_{\rm tot}=2$. Our focus is on the $1+1$ filling setting of $\nu_{\rm Mo} =\nu_{\rm W}=1$, which enables a Kondo lattice description. We find a Kondo semimetal due to the sizable intra-orbital hopping among the electrons in the $\rm{MoTe_2}$ layer. The Kondo-driven (emergent) flat band is naturally pinned to the Fermi energy. When combined with the inherent topology of the electronic structure, a topological Kondo semimetal phase ensues. We calculate the valley Hall response and, due to the breaking of inversion symmetry, also identify a spontaneous Hall effect. There is a Berry curvature dodecapole, which leads to a fourth-order spontaneous Hall effect in the perturbative regime of the electric field that is further amplified in the non-perturbative regime. As such, the system provides a tunable setting to simulate topological Kondo semimetals. Finally, we discuss the pathways that connect the physics realized here to the Weyl Kondo semimetals and their proximate phases that have been advanced in recent years in topological Kondo lattice models and materials.</description>

      <title>Suppression of the Mott insulating phase in the particle-hole asymmetric Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the phase diagram of the Mott metal-insulator transition (MIT), focusing on the effects of particle-hole asymmetry (PHA) in the single-band Hubbard model. Our dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) study reveals that the introduction of PHA in the model significantly influences the critical temperature ($T_c$) and interaction strength ($U_c$), as well as the size of the co-existence region of metallic and insulating phases at low temperatures. Specifically, as the system is moved away from particle-hole symmetry, $T_c$ decreases and $U_c$ increases, indicating a suppression of the insulating phase and the strengthening of the metallic behavior. Additionally, the first-order transition line between metallic and insulating phases is better defined in the model with PHA, leading to a reduced co-existence region at $T&lt;T_c$. Moreover, we propose that the MIT can be characterized by the charge density, which serves as a viable alternative to zero-frequency spectral density typically used in DMFT calculations. Our findings provide new insights into the role of particle-hole asymmetry in the qualitative and quantitative characterization of the MIT even in a very simple system.</description>

      <title>A minimal tensor network beyond free fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes a minimal model extending the duality between classical statistical spin systems and fermionic systems beyond the case of free fermions. A Jordan-Wigner transformation applied to a two-dimensional tensor network maps the partition sum of a classical statistical mechanics model to a Grassmann variable integral, structurally similar to the path integral for interacting fermions in two dimensions. The resulting model is simple, featuring only two parameters: one governing spin-spin interaction (dual to effective hopping strength in the fermionic picture), the other measuring the deviation from the free fermion limit. Nevertheless, it exhibits a rich phase diagram, partially stabilized by elements of topology, and featuring three phases meeting at a tricritical point. Besides the interpretation as a spin and fermionic system, the model is closely related to loop gas and vertex models and can be interpreted as a parity-preserving (non-unitary) circuit. Its minimal construction makes it an ideal reference system for studying non-linearities in tensor networks and deriving results by means of duality.</description>

      <title>Thermopower across Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without translational symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15330v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the evolution of low-temperature thermopower across Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions in Kondo lattice models without translational symmetry breaking. This transition moves from a heavy Fermi liquid with a conventional Luttinger-volume large Fermi surface to a 'FL*' state, characterized by a small Fermi surface and a spin liquid with fractionalized excitations. The onset of the large Fermi surface phase is driven by the condensation of a Higgs field that carries a unit gauge charge under an emergent U(1) gauge field. We consider the case with spatially random Kondo exchange, as this leads to strange metal behavior in electrical transport. We find a large asymmetric thermopower in a 'skewed' marginal Fermi liquid, with similarities to the skewed non-Fermi liquid of Georges and Mravlje (arXiv:2102.13224). Our findings are consistent with recent observations in heavy fermion compounds (Z.-Y. Cao et al., arXiv:2408.13604), and describe an enhancement of thermopower on the large Fermi surface side as well as a non-monotonic behavior on the small Fermi surface side. Our results also apply to single-band Hubbard models and the pseudogap transition in the cuprates. In the ancilla framework, single-band models exhibit an inverted Kondo lattice transition: the small Fermi surface pseudogap state corresponds to the condensed Higgs state. This inversion results in an enhancement of thermopower on the pseudogap side in our theory, consistent with observations in the cuprates (C. Collignon et al., arXiv:2011.14927; A. Gourgout et al., arXiv:2106.05959). We argue that these observations support a non-symmetry-breaking Fermi-volume-changing transition as the underlying description of the onset of the pseudogap in the cuprates.</description>

      <title>Observation of Orbital-Selective Dual Modulations in an Anisotropic Antiferromagnetic Kagome Metal TbTi3Bi4</title>

Abstract: Orbital selectivity is pivotal in dictating the phase diagrams of multiorbital systems, with prominent examples including the orbital-selective Mott phase and superconductivity, etc. The intercalation of anisotropic layers represents an effective method for enhancing orbital selectivity and, thereby shaping the low-energy physics of multiorbital systems. Despite its potential, related experimental studies remain limited. In this work, we systematically examine the interplay between orbital selectivity and magnetism in the newly discovered anisotropic kagome TbTi3Bi4 single crystal, and report a unidirectional, orbital-selective band reconstruction within the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. By combining soft X-ray and vacuum ultraviolet angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements with orbital-resolved density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identify that the band reconstruction is a manifestation of the AFM order, driven by a 1/3 nesting instability of the intercalated Tb 5dxz orbitals. Such an orbital-selective modulation leads the unusual momentum-dependent band folding and the emergence of symmetry-protected Dirac cones only at the M1 point. More importantly, the discovery of orbital-selective 3 x 1 AFM order offers crucial insights into the underlying mechanism of the fractional magnetization plateau in this Kagome AFM metal. Our findings not only underscore the essential role of both conducting and localized electrons in determining the magnetic orders of LnTi3Bi4 (Ln = Lanthanide) kagome metals but also offer a pathway for manipulating magnetism through selective control of anisotropic electronic structures.</description>

Abstract: Ferroelectricity has been one major focus in modern fundamental research and technological application. We consider the physical origin of improper ferroelectricity in Mott insulating materials. Beyond the well-known Katsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky's inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya mechanism for the noncollinearly ordered magnets, we point out the induction of the electric polarizations in the multipolar ordered Mott insulators. Using the multiflavor representation for the multipolar magnetic moments, we can show the crossover or transition from the pure inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya mechanism to the pure multipolar origin for the ferroelectricity, and also incorporate the intermediate regime with the mixture of both origins. We expect our results to inspire a reexamination of ferroelectricity in the multipolar-ordered magnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a formalism based on colour symmetry to analyse the momentum-space spin textures of non-collinear antiferromagnets. We show that, out of the spin textures allowed by the magnetic point group, \textcolor{\altcolor} {one can extract a component that is invariant by general rotations in spin space, and can exist in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, in complete analogy to spin textures in altermagnets}. We demonstrate this approach in the case of three complex, non-collinear magnets, Mn$_3$Ir(Ge,Si), Pb$_2$MnO$_4$ and Mn$_3$GaN. For Mn$_3$GaN, we also show that the predictions of colour-symmetry analysis are consistent with density functional theory calculations performed on the same system both with and without spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moir\'e and super-moir\'e materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moir\'e systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moir\'e materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moir\'e systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moir\'e quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Oscillate and Renormalize: Fast Phonons Reshape the Kondo Effect in Flat Band Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the interplay between electron correlations and phonons in an Anderson-Holstein impurity model with an Einstein phonon. When the phonons are slow compared to charge fluctuations (frequency $\omega_0 \ll U/2$, the onsite Coulomb scale $U/2$), we demonstrate analytically that the expected phonon-mediated reduction of interactions is completely suppressed, even in the strong coupling regime. This suppression arises from the oscillator's inability to respond to rapid charge fluctuations, manifested as a compensation effect between the polaronic cloud and the excited-state phonons associated with valence fluctuations. We identify a novel frozen mixed valence phase, above a threshold dimensionless electron-phonon coupling $\alpha^*$ when the phonons are slow, where the static phonon cloud locks the impurity into specific valence configurations, potentially explaining the puzzling coexistence of mixed valence behavior and insulating properties in materials like rust. Conversely, when the phonon is fast ($\omega_0 \gtrsim U/2$), the system exhibits conventional polaronic behavior with renormalized onsite interactions effectively $U_{\text{eff}}$ due to phonon mediated attraction, with additional satellite features in the local spectral function due to phonon excitations. Using numerical renormalization group (NRG) calculations, a fully dynamic renormalization technique, we confirm these behaviors in both regimes. These findings have important implications for strongly correlated systems where phonon energy scales may be comparable to the Coulomb scale, such as in twisted bilayer graphene, necessitating careful consideration of interaction renormalizations in theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Image of helical local moment magnetic order in the STM spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surface tunneling microscope (STM) method probes the itinerant conduction electron spectrum which is influenced by the presence of collective order parameters. It may in fact be used as a tool to obtain important information about their microscopic nature, for example the gap symmetry in unconventional superconductors. Surprisingly it has been found that the STM spectrum can also identify magnetic order of completely localised electrons, e.g., incommensurate helical structure of 4f electron moments, as observed in the compound GdRu$_2$Si$_2$. This is due to the fact that the exchange coupling of conduction states to the localised subsystem reconstructs the itinerant bands which then leaves an imprint on the STM spectrum. We develop a theory based on this idea that shows firstly the appearance of STM satellite peaks at the wave vector of localised moment helical order for the pure surface. Secondly we derive the quasiparticle interference spectrum in Born approximation due to the presence of surface impurities which contains information on the reconstruction process of itinerant states caused by the localised helical order. Furthermore we show that within full $t$-matrix approach impurity bound states are also influenced by the exchange coupling to helical magnetic order.</description>

Abstract: According to Zaanen's interpretation of Homes' empirical law~[Zaanen, {\it Nature} {\bf 430}, 512 (2004)], the superconducting transition temperatures in the cuprates are high because their metallic states are as viscous as quantum mechanics permits. Here, we show that Homes' law in fact implies three key points: (i) the resistivity is linear in temperature in the normal state near the transition temperature; (ii) the dimensionless coefficient of proportionality of the relaxation rate with temperature is of order unity -- the so-called universal Planckian relaxation rate; and (iii) the logarithmically broad applicability of this law arises from an unusually wide range of effective masses throughout the cuprate phase diagram. In fact, a universal Planckian relaxation rate implies Homes' law only if the mechanism of mass renormalization is independent of the Planckian relaxation.</description>

      <title>Upper bound on $T_c$ in a strongly coupled electron-boson superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Migdal-Eliashberg theory (METh) of boson-mediated superconductivity contains a $\sqrt{\lambda}$ divergence in the critical temperature $T_c$ at strong electron-boson coupling $\lambda$. In conventional METh, the strong-coupling regime can be accessed only in the limit that $\lambda_E = \lambda \, \omega_D/\varepsilon_F\ll1$, where $\omega_D$ is the Debye frequency and $\varepsilon_F$ is the Fermi energy. Here we go beyond this restriction in the context of the two-dimensional Yukawa-SYK (Y-SYK) model, which is solvable for arbitrary values of $\lambda_E$. We find that $T_c\approx 0.18 \,\omega_D \sqrt{\lambda}$ for large $\lambda$, provided $\lambda_E$ remains small, and crosses over to a universal value of $T_c \approx 0.04\, \varepsilon_F$ for large $\lambda_E$. The saturation of $T_c$ is due to a self-consistent account of the boson dynamics for large $\lambda_E$ and is arguably qualitatively valid beyond the Y-SYK framework. In particular, depending on the value of $\lambda$, this self-consistent approach leads to pairing that describes multiple classes of quantum critical electronic systems. These results demonstrate how the $\sqrt{\lambda}$ growth of $T_c$ in METh saturates to a universal value independent of $\lambda$ and $\omega_D$, providing an upper bound on the critical temperature at strong electron-boson coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The term altermagnetism has recently been introduced to describe the N\'eel order of a class of materials whose magnetic sublattices are neither related by translation nor inversion. While these materials arguably have large technological potential, little effort has been devoted to studying the universal distinction of this phase of matter compared to collinear antiferromagnetism. Employing a recently proposed minimal microscopic model, we explicitly derive a nonlinear sigma model describing long-wavelength fluctuations of the staggered magnetization in this system, including quantum effects to leading order. The term that distinguishes the altermagnetic nonlinear sigma model from its antiferromagnetic counterpart is an interaction term that derives directly from the Berry phase of the microscopic spin degrees of freedom. Its effects on the one-loop renormalization group flow in $d=2+1$ dimensions are examined. Extending the theory to describe the fermionic excitations of the metallic altermagnet, we find an effective low-energy model of $d$-wave spin-split Dirac fermions interacting with the magnetic fluctuations. Using a Dyson-Schwinger approach, we derive the many-body effects on the dynamical critical scaling due to the competition between the long-range Coulomb interaction and the fluctuations of the staggered magnetization.</description>

Abstract: By utilizing a unitary transformation, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the degeneracy between the even- and odd-parity energy states of the spin-boson model (SBM). Employing the Rayleigh quotient of matrix algebra, we rigorously prove that the ground state energy of the SBM is lower than the systems lowest possible degenerate energy and possesses a definite parity. Based on the necessary and sufficient conditions for parity breaking, we provide an analytical expression for the parity-breaking critical value, which is closely related to the expansion order and computational accuracy. This expression reproduces the SBM phase diagram obtained by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and logarithmic discretization numerical renormalization group (NRG) methods. However, this phase diagram does not characterize the ground state of the system.</description>

Abstract: Achieving strong interactions in fermionic many-body systems is a major theme of research in condensed matter physics. It is well-known that interactions between fermions can be mediated through a bosonic medium, such as a phonon bath or Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Here we show that such induced attraction can be resonantly enhanced when the bosonic medium is a two-component spinor BEC. The strongest interaction is achieved by tuning the boson-boson scattering to the quantum critical spinodal point of the BEC where the sound velocity vanishes. The fermion pairing gap and the superconducting critical temperature can thus be dramatically enhanced. We propose two experimental realizations of this scenario, with exciton-polariton systems in two-dimensional semiconductors and ultracold atomic Bose-Fermi mixtures.</description>

Abstract: The rise of moir\'{e} materials has led to experimental realizations of integer and fractional Chern insulators in small or vanishing magnetic fields. At the same time, a set of minimal conditions sufficient to guarantee a Abelian fractional state in a flat band were identified, namely "ideal" or "vortexable" quantum geometry. Such vortexable bands share essential features with the lowest Landau level, while excluding the need for more fine-tuned aspects such as flat Berry curvature. A natural and important generalization is to ask if such conditions can be extended to capture the quantum geometry of higher Landau levels, particularly the first (1LL), where non-Abelian states at $\nu = 1/2,2/5$ are known to be competitive. The possibility of realizing these states at zero magnetic field , and perhaps even more exotic ones, could become a reality if we could identify the essential structure of the 1LL in Chern bands. In this work, we introduce a precise definition of 1LL quantum geometry, along with a figure of merit that measures how closely a given band approaches the 1LL. We apply the definition to identify two models with 1LL structure -- a toy model of double bilayer twisted graphene and a more realistic model of strained Bernal graphene.</description>

Abstract: Using a state-of-the-art numerical scheme, we show that the Higgs mode under excitation exhibits chirped oscillations and exponential decay when fluctuations are included. This is in stark contrast to conventional BCS collisionless dynamics which predict power-law decay and the absence of chirping. The chirped amplitude mode enables us to determine the local modification of the effective potential even when the system is in a long-lived prethermal state. We then show that this chirped amplitude mode is an experimentally observable quantity since the photoinduced (super)current in pump-probe experiments serves as an efficient proxy for the order parameter dynamics, including the chirped dynamics. Our result is based on the attractive Hubbard model using dynamical mean-field theory within the symmetry-broken state after a excitation across the superconducting gap. Since the collective response involves long timescales, we extend the hierarchical low-rank compression method for nonequilibrium Green's functions to symmetry-broken states and show that it serves as an efficient representation despite long-lived memory kernels.</description>

Abstract: In interacting topological systems, Landau-like order parameters interplay with the band topology of fermions. The physics of domain formation in such systems can get significantly altered due to the presence of topological fermions. In this work we show that coupling a topological fermionic field to a scalar field can drastically modify the nucleation processes of the scalar field. We find that existence of non-trivial fermionic boundary modes on the nucleating droplets of the scalar field leads to substantial quantum corrections to the surface tension. This leads to an increase in the size of the critical nucleus beyond which unrestricted droplet growth happens. To illustrate the phenomena we devise a minimal model of fermions in a Chern insulating system coupled to a classical Ising field in two spatial dimensions. Using a combination of analytic and numerical methods we conclusively demonstrate that topological phases have a characteristic quantum surface tension. Apart from material systems, our work opens up a host of questions regarding the impact of fermionic topological terms on classical phase transitions and associated criticality.</description>

      <title>Vortex wall phase in fractonic XY-plaquette model on square lattice</title>

Abstract: The XY-plaquette model is the most straightforward lattice realization of a broad class of fractonic field theories that host quasiparticles with restricted mobility. The plaquette interaction appears naturally as a ring-exchange term in the low-energy description of exciton Bose liquids, cold atomic gases, and quantum dimer models. Using first-principle Monte Carlo simulations, we study the phase diagram and the vortex dynamics in the XY-plaquette model on a square lattice in two spatial dimensions. In its minimal formulation, the model contains a ring-exchange plaquette term in two spatial dimensions and a standard XY-link term in the (imaginary) time direction. We show that the phase diagram of the minimal XY-plaquette model possesses two phases: (i) a disordered vortex-dominated phase in which a single percolating vortex trajectory occupies the whole 3d spacetime; (ii) a partially disordered phase in which the vortices become partially immobile, with their worldlines strictly confined to one or several infinite two-dimensional planes. The spatial positions and spatial orientations (along $x$ or $y$ axis) of these vortex domain walls appear to be spontaneous. Individual vortices form a disordered system within each vortex domain wall, so the fractal spacetime dimension of vortex trajectories approaches $D_f = 2$. We argue that the appearance of the vortex walls could be interpreted as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of a global internal symmetry in the compact XY-plaquette model.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian-learning quantum magnets with non-local impurity tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07666</link>

Abstract: Impurities in quantum materials have provided successful strategies for learning properties of complex states, ranging from unconventional superconductors to topological insulators. In quantum magnetism, inferring the Hamiltonian of an engineered system becomes a challenging open problem in the presence of complex interactions. Here we show how a supervised machine-learning technique can be used to infer Hamiltonian parameters from atomically engineered quantum magnets by inferring fluctuations of the ground states due to the presence of impurities. We demonstrate our methodology both with a fermionic model with spin-orbit coupling, as well as with many-body spin models with long-range exchange and anisotropic exchange interactions. We show that our approach enables performing Hamiltonian extraction in the presence of significant noise, providing a strategy to perform Hamiltonian learning with experimental observables in atomic-scale quantum magnets. Our results establish a strategy to perform Hamiltonian learning by exploiting the impact of impurities in complex quantum many-body states.</description>

      <title>Evidence for strongly correlated superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct first-principles simulations of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$7$, a nickelate in which a recent series of experiments found signs of high-temperature superconductivity. In the hydrostatic pressure range where superconductivity is observed, we find a significant increase in effective on-site repulsion in the maximally localized Wannier functions comprising the Ni 3$d$ $e_g$ bands crossing the Fermi energy, as determined by density functional theory. We attribute this increase to reduced screening by the spacer La 5$d{x^2 - y^2}$ bands -- an effect that is sensitive to the pressure-driven crystal structure. Our results therefore indicate that the superconducting region in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase diagram coincides with a region of enhanced electron correlations. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations extend these trends to finite temperatures, providing insights into the experimentally observed transition lines. Finally, we leverage intrinsic chemical pressure by applying the methodology to Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>
