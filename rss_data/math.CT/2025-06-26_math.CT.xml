      <title>On preservation of relative resolutions for poset representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of Galois connections (i.e., adjoint pairs between posets) is ubiquitous in mathematics. In representation theory, it is interesting because it naturally induces the adjoint quadruple between the categories of persistence modules (representations) of the posets via Kan extensions. One of central subjects in multiparameter persistent homology analysis is to understand structures of persistence modules. In this paper, we mainly study a class of Galois connections whose left adjoint is the canonical inclusion of a full subposet. We refer to such a subposet as an interior system, with its corresponding right adjoint given by the floor function. In the induced adjoint quadruple, we call the left Kan extension along its floor function the contraction functor. From its construction, it is left adjoint to the induction functor. Under this setting, we firstly prove that this adjoint pair gives an adjoint pair between finitely presentable persistence modules. Moreover, we introduce a special class of interior systems called aligned interior systems, and prove that both induction and contraction functors over them preserve interval-decomposability of modules. Then, we use them to analyze interval covers and resolutions. We also compute interval resolution global dimensions for certain classes of finite posets.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of global representations for families of bounded rank and VI-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A global representation is a compatible collection of representations of the outer automorphism groups of the finite groups belonging to a family $\mathscr{U}$. These arise in classical representation theory, in the study of representation stability, as well as in global homotopy theory. In this paper we begin a systematic study of the derived category $\mathsf{D}(\mathscr{U};k)$ of global representations over fields $k$ of characteristic zero, from the point-of-view of tensor-triangular geometry. We calculate its Balmer spectrum for various infinite families of finite groups including elementary abelian $p$-groups, cyclic groups, and finite abelian $p$-groups of bounded rank. We then deduce that the Balmer spectrum associated to the family of finite abelian $p$-groups has infinite Krull dimension and infinite Cantor--Bendixson rank, illustrating the complex phenomena we encounter. As a concrete application, we provide a complete tt-theoretic classification of finitely generated derived VI-modules. Our proofs rely on subtle information about the growth behaviour of global representations studied in a companion paper, as well as novel methods from non-rigid tt-geometry.</description>

      <title>Shadows are Bicategorical Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.02144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hochschild homology has proved to be an important invariant in algebra and homotopy theory, in particular due to its relevance in algebraic $K$-theory and fixed point theory, leading to the development of numerous variants of the original construction. Ponto introduced a bicategorical axiomatization of Hochschild homology-type invariants, called a shadow, which captures the essential common properties of all known variants of Hochschild homology, such as Morita invariance.
  In this paper we clarify the relationship between shadows and Hochschild homology. After extending the notion of Hochschild homology to bicategories in a natural manner, we prove the existence of a universal shadow on any bicategory $\mathscr{B}$, taking values in the Hochschild homology of $\mathscr{B}$, through which all other shadows on $\mathscr{B}$ factor. Shadows are thus co-represented by a bicategorical version of Hochschild homology. Using the universal shadow on the free adjunction bicategory, we can then establish a universal Morita invariance theorem, of which all known cases are immediate corollaries.
  Building on this understanding of shadows on bicategories, we propose an $\infty$-categorical generalization of shadows as functors out of Hochschild homology of an $(\infty,2)$-category in the sense of Berman. As a first step towards constructing relevant examples of $\infty$-categorical shadows, we define the Hochschild homology of enriched $\infty$-categorical bimodules and prove that they assemble into a shadow.
  As part of this work we compute the Hochschild homology of several important $2$-categories (such as the free adjunction), which can be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Formal extension of noncommutative tensor-triangular support varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a support variety theory defined on the compact part of a monoidal triangulated category, we define an extension to the non-compact part following the blueprint of Benson--Carlson--Rickard, Benson--Iyengar--Krause, Balmer--Favi, and Stevenson. We generalize important aspects of the theory of extended support varieties to the noncommutative case, and give characterizations of when an extended support theory detects the zero object, under certain assumptions. In particular, we show that when the original support variety theory is based on a Noetherian topological space, detects the zero object, satisfies a generalized tensor product property, and comes equipped with a comparison map, then the extended support variety also detects the zero object. In the case of stable categories of finite tensor categories, this gives conditions under which the central cohomological support admits an extension that detects the zero object, confirming part of a recent conjecture made by the second author together with Nakano and Yakimov.</description>

      <title>Univalent Enriched Categories and the Enriched Rezk Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11752v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enriched categories are categories whose sets of morphisms are enriched with extra structure. Such categories play a prominent role in the study of higher categories, homotopy theory, and the semantics of programming languages. In this paper, we study univalent enriched categories. We prove that all essentially surjective and fully faithful functors between univalent enriched categories are equivalences, and we show that every enriched category admits a Rezk completion. Finally, we use the Rezk completion for enriched categories to construct univalent enriched Kleisli categories.</description>
