      <title>Signatures of metal to insulator crossover in the repulsive Fermi Hubbard model through static correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold atom systems provide a rich platform to realize strongly interacting condensed matter systems, and recent progress in fluorescence imaging technique has enabled identification of nontrivial doublon, singlon, and holon correlation functions. We show that these correlators can be used to identify the conditions under which local moments form in an interacting electronic system. Toward this end, we report a determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) study of such correlation functions in the two-dimensional repulsive Fermi Hubbard model on a square lattice as a function of doping, interaction strength and temperature. We find definite signatures of the crossover from small U (band regime) to large U (correlated insulator regime). Our key findings are: (1) An opening of a charge gap in the thermodynamic density of states is accompanied by the appearance of tem-perature insensitive points in the equation of state at finite doping, which can be used to distinguish the band regime in cold atom experiments. (2) Nearest neighbor doublon holon correlations track the opening of charge gap; these compete with density correlation to generate moment moment correlations that show different behavior in the metallic and correlated insulator regime. (3) Non local correlation functions can be used to distinguish between the two regimes, at both and away from half filling. Our results allow comparisons of different correlation functions with recent experimental findings and guide further experimental investigations</description>

      <title>Vison condensation and spinon confinement in a kagome lattice $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid: A numerical study of a quantum dimer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are exotic many-body states featured with long-range entanglement and fractional anyon quasiparticles. Quantum phase transitions of spin liquids are particularly interesting problems related with novel phenomena of anyon condensation and anyon confinement. Here we study a quantum dimer model which implements a transition between a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid ($\mathbb{Z}_2$SL) and a valence bond solid (VBS) on the kagome lattice. The transition is driven by the condensation of vison excitation of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid, which impacts on other anyon excitations especially leading to the confinement of spinon excitations. By numerical exact diagonalization of the dimer model, we directly measure the vison condensation using vison string operators, and explicitly check a confining potential acting on spinon excitations in the VBS state. It is observed that topological degeneracy of the spin liquid state is lifted concomitantly with the vison condensation. The dimer ordering pattern of the VBS state is identified by investigating dimer structure factor. Furthermore, we find an interesting state that exhibits features of spin liquid and VBS simultaneously. We discuss the origin of the mixed behaviors and possible scenarios expected in thermodynamic limit. This work complements the previous analytical studies on the dimer model, Phys. Rev. B 87, 104408 (2013) and Phys. Rev. B 92, 205131 (2015), by providing numerical evidences on the vison condensation and the spinon confinement in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$SL-to-VBS transition.</description>

      <title>Exotic magnetism in perovskite KOsO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new perovskite KOsO3 has been stabilized under high-pressure and high temperature conditions. It is cubic at 500 K (Pm-3m) and undergoes subsequent phase transitions to tetragonal at 320 K (P4/mmm) and rhombohedral (R-3m) at 230 K as shown from refining synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (SXRD) data. The larger orbital overlap integral and the extended wavefunction of 5d electrons in the perovskite KOsO3 allow to explore physics from the regime where Mott and Hund's rule couplings dominate to the state where the multiple interactions are on equal footing. We demonstrate an exotic magnetic ordering phase found by neutron powder diffraction along with physical properties via a suite of measurements including magnetic and transport properties, differential scanning calorimetry, and specific heat, which provide comprehensive information for a system at the crossover from localized to itinerant electronic behavior.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall effect driven by phonon-magnon hybridization in a honeycomb antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The underlying mechanism of the thermal Hall effect (THE) generated by phonons in a variety of insulators is yet to be identified. Here, we report on a sizeable thermal Hall conductivity in NiPS$_3$, a van de Waals stack of honeycomb layers with a zigzag antiferromagnetic order below $T_N$ = 155 K. The longitudinal ($\kappa_{aa}$) and the transverse ($\kappa_{ab}$) thermal conductivities peak at the same temperature and the thermal Hall angle ($\kappa_{ab}/\kappa_{aa}/B$) respects a previously identified bound. The amplitude of $\kappa_{ab}$ is extremely sensitive to the amplitude of magnetization along the $b$-axis, in contrast to the phonon mean free path, which is not at all. We show that the magnon and acoustic phonon bands cross each other along the $b^\ast$ orientation in the momentum space. The exponential temperature dependence of $\kappa_{ab}$ above its peak reveals an energy scale on the order of magnitude of the gap expected to be opened by magnon-phonon hybridization. This points to an intrinsic scenario for THE with possible relevance to other magnetic insulators.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Physical Properties of Crystals through Synthetic Temperature Control: A Case Study for new Polymorphic NbFeTe2 phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growth parameters play a significant role in the crystal quality and physical properties of layered materials. Here we present a case study on a van der Waals magnetic NbFeTe2 material. Two different types of polymorphic NbFeTe2 phases, synthesized at different temperatures, display significantly different behaviors in crystal symmetry, electronic structure, electrical transport, and magnetism. While the phase synthesized at low temperature showing behavior consistent with previous reports, the new phase synthesized at high temperature, has completely different physical properties, such as metallic resistivity, long-range ferromagnetic order, anomalous Hall effect, negative magnetoresistance, and distinct electronic structures. Neutron diffraction reveals out-of-plane ferromagnetism below 70K, consistent with the electrical transport and magnetic susceptibility studies. Our work suggests that simply tuning synthetic parameters in a controlled manner could be an effective route to alter the physical properties of existing materials potentially unlocking new states of matter, or even discovering new materials.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Decoupling of Single Impurity Anderson Model through Auxiliary Majorana Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to study the time evolution of the single impurity Anderson model which exploits a mean field decoupling of the interacting impurity and the non-interacting bath (in form of a chain). This is achieved by the introduction of a pair of auxiliary Majorana fermions between the impurity and the chain. After decoupling, we obtain a self-consistent set of equations for the impurity and chain. First, we study the behavior of the system in equilibrium at zero temperature. We obtain a phase transition as a function of the interaction at the impurity and the coupling between the impurity and the chain between the Kondo regime, where the mean field parameters are zero and, hence, we have a well-defined spin at the impurity, to a phase where mean field parameters acquire finite values leading to a screening of the impurity spin by conduction bath electrons. In the latter case, we observe charge and spin fluctuations at the impurity site. Starting from this equilibrium ground state at zero temperature we quench in the interaction strength at the impurity and/or the hybridization strength between the impurity and the chain and study the time evolution of the system. We find that for quenches to weak to intermediate coupling the system converges to the equilibrium state defined by the final set of parameters after the quench. We analyze the oscillation frequency and as well as the thermalization rate during this quench. A quench to a strong interaction value results in persistent oscillations and a trapping of the system in a non-thermal state. We speculate that these two regimes of different long-time behavior are separated by a dynamical phase transition.</description>

      <title>Bosonic near-CFT$_1$ models from Fock-space fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-AdS$_2$ dynamics arise ubiquitously near the horizon of near-extremal black holes. The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model -- a $p$-local model of fermions -- is the first microscopic model that realizes the dual near-CFT$_1$ dynamics. However, a bosonic near-CFT$_1$ model has remained elusive in the $p$-local approach because such constructions generally suffer from unwanted orderings at low temperatures. Recently, it was pointed out that such near-CFT$_1$ dynamics can quite generally arise if we place a large amount of random fluxes in a many-body Fock space and $p$-locality is not essential. We will use this insight to construct a collection of bosonic near-CFT$_1$ models with a conserved charge. One class of models we wish to highlight are based on canonical bosons with conserved occupation numbers. We further argue that such bosonic models do not suffer from energetic instablities or unwanted low-temperature orderings. Furthermore, canonical bosons allow the number densities to be arbitrarily large, which is impossible in quibt- or fermion-based constructions. This creates a larger variety of scaling regimes for the thermodynamics. For comparison we also consider a second class of charge-conserving models which are based on qubits. The thermodynamic scalings (with respect to conserved charges) of these models are very similar to those of the double-scaled complex SYK model but are free of certain singularities the latter suffers from, even though both are solved by chord diagrams. We also show the level statistics for both models are described by random matrix theory universality down to very low energy.</description>

      <title>Superconducting transition temperatures of pure vanadium and vanadium-titanium alloys in the presence of dynamical electronic correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ordinary superconductors are widely assumed insensitive to small concentrations of random nonmagnetic impurities, whereas strong disorder suppresses superconductivity, ultimately leading to a superconductor-insulator transition. In between these limiting cases, a most fascinating regime may emerge where disorder enhances superconductivity. This effect is discussed here for the $\beta$-phase of vanadium-titanium alloys. Disorder is modeled using the coherent potential approximation while local electronic interactions are treated using dynamical mean-field theory. The McMillan formula is employed to estimate the superconducting transition temperature, showing a maximum at a Ti concentration of around $0.33$ for a local Coulomb interaction $U$ in the range of $2$ to $3$ eV. Our calculations quantitatively agree with the experimentally observed concentration dependent increase of $T_c$, and its maximal value of about $20\%$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Protected Topological Phases of Mixed States in the Doubled Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of symmetry and topology in quantum many-body mixed states has recently garnered significant interest. In a phenomenon not seen in pure states, mixed states can exhibit average symmetries -- symmetries that act on component states while leaving the ensemble invariant. In this work, we systematically characterize symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of short-range entangled (SRE) mixed states of spin systems -- protected by both average and exact symmetries -- by studying their pure Choi states in a doubled Hilbert space, where the familiar notions and tools for SRE and SPT pure states apply. This advantage of the doubled space comes with a price: extra symmetries as well as subtleties around how hermiticity and positivity of the original density matrix constrain the possible SPT invariants. Nevertheless, the doubled space perspective allows us to obtain a systematic classification of mixed-state SPT (MSPT) phases. We also investigate the robustness of MSPT invariants under symmetric finite-depth quantum channels, the bulk-boundary correspondence for MSPT phases, and the consequences of the MSPT invariants for the separability of mixed states and the symmetry-protected sign problem. In addition to MSPT phases, we study the patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of mixed states, including the phenomenon of exact-to-average SSB, and the order parameters that detect them. Mixed state SSB is related to an ingappability constraint on symmetric Lindbladian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos on Edge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the physics of many-body quantum chaotic systems close to their ground states has come under intensified scrutiny. Such studies are motivated by the emergence of model systems exhibiting chaotic fluctuations throughout the entire spectrum (the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model being a renowned representative) as well as by the physics of holographic principles, which likewise unfold close to ground states. Interpreting the edge of the spectrum as a quantum critical point, here we combine a wide range of analytical and numerical methods to the identification and comprehensive description of two different universality classes: the near edge physics of ``sparse'' and the near edge of ``dense'' chaotic systems. The distinction lies in the ratio between the number of a system's random parameters and its Hilbert space dimension, which is exponentially small or algebraically small in the sparse and dense case, respectively. Notable representatives of the two classes are generic chaotic many-body models (sparse) and single particle systems, invariant random matrix ensembles, or chaotic gravitational systems (dense). While the two families share identical spectral correlations at energy scales comparable to the level spacing, the density of states and its fluctuations near the edge are different. Considering the SYK model as a representative of the sparse class, we apply a combination of field theory and exact diagonalization to a detailed discussion of its edge spectrum. Conversely, Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity is our reference model for the dense class, where an analysis of the gravitational path integral and random matrix theory reveal universal differences to the sparse class, whose implications for the construction of holographic principles we discuss.</description>

      <title>General criterion for non-Hermitian skin effects and Application: Fock space skin effects in many body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity enables macroscopic accumulation of bulk states, named non-Hermitian skin effects. The non-Hermitian skin effects are well-established for single-particle systems, but their proper characterization for general systems is elusive. Here, we propose a general criterion of non-Hermitian skin effects, which works for any finite-dimensional system evolved by a linear operator. The applicable systems include many-body systems and network systems. A system meeting the criterion exhibits enhanced non-normality of the evolution operator, accompanied by exceptional characteristics intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Applying the criterion, we discover a new type of non-Hermitian skin effect in many-body systems, which we dub the Fock space skin effect. We also discuss the Fock space skin effect-induced slow dynamics, which gives an experimental signal for the Fock space skin effect.</description>

      <title>A topological material in the III-V family: heteroepitaxial InBi on InAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:1806.03061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: InBi(001) is formed epitaxially on InAs(111)-A by depositing Bi on to an In-rich surface. Angle-resolved photoemission measurements reveal topological electronic surface states, close to the M bar high symmetry point. This demonstrates a heteroepitaxial system entirely in the III-V family with topological electronic properties. InBi shows coexistence of Bi and In surface terminations, in contradiction with other III-V materials. For the Bi termination, the study gives a consistent physical picture of the topological surface electronic structure of InBi(001) terminated by a Bi bilayer rather than a surface formed by splitting to a Bi monolayer termination. Theoretical calculations based on relativistic density functional theory and the one-step model of photoemission clarify the relationship between the InBi(001) surface termination and the topological surface states, supporting a predominant role of the Bi bilayer termination. Furthermore, a tight-binding model based on this Bi bilayer termination with only Bi-Bi hopping terms, and no Bi-In interaction, gives a deeper insight into the spin texture.</description>

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids subject to a periodic drive can display fascinating non-equilibrium heating behavior because of their emergent fractionalized quasi-particles. Here, we investigate a driven Kitaev honeycomb model and examine the dynamics of emergent Majorana matter and $Z_2$ flux excitations. We uncover a distinct two-step heating profile $\textrm{--}$ dubbed fractionalized prethermalization $\textrm{--}$ and a quasi-stationary state with vastly different temperatures for the matter and the flux sectors. We argue that this peculiar prethermalization behavior is a consequence of fractionalization. Furthermore, we discuss an experimentally feasible protocol for preparing a zero-flux initial state of the Kiteav honeycomb model with a low energy density, which can be used to observe fractionalized prethermalization in quantum information processing platforms.</description>

      <title>A comparison of the hidden order transition in URu$_2$Si$_2$ to the $\lambda$-transition in $^4$He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low-temperature states of ambient URu$_2$Si$_2$ and superfluid $^4$He are both characterized by momentum-dependent energy gaps between the ground and excited states. This behavior weakly persists even above the transition temperatures but becomes over-damped (ungapped) because of the number of excitations present at elevated temperature. We show that akin to the normal fluid to superfluid transition in $^4$He, the hidden-order (HO) transition in URu$_2$Si$_2$ can be understood by a change of the ungapped excitations to the gapped, elementary excitations (EE) of the unknown ordered state. These under-damped EEs reflect the basic character and order parameters of the different phase transitions. This view accounts for the full amount of entropy released in these transitions, the jumps in the resistivity and thermal conductivity directly below the transition, as well as the reduction of the Fermi surface. We argue that the behavior in the HO phase is that of a gas of weakly interacting excitations from charge density wave or crystal field states in a similar manner to that of the phonon-roton excitations of the superfluid $^4$He phase. We discuss the influence of applying pressure and magnetic fields within this scenario and the role of the small moment antiferromagnetic clustering in the hidden order phase.</description>

      <title>Scattering theory of mesons in doped antiferromagnetic Mott insulators: Multichannel perspective and Feshbach resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling the underlying pairing mechanism of charge carriers in strongly correlated electrons, starting from a microscopic theory, is among the central challenges of condensed-matter physics. Hereby, the key task is to understand what causes the appearance of superconductivity at comparatively high temperatures upon hole doping an antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulator. Recently, it has been proposed that at strong coupling and low doping, the fundamental one- and two-hole meson-type constituents -- magnetic polarons and bipolaronic pairs -- likely realize an emergent Feshbach resonance producing near-resonant $d_{x^2-y^2}$ interactions between charge carriers. Here, we provide detailed calculations of the proposed scenario by describing the open and closed meson scattering channels in the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model using a truncated basis method. After integrating out the closed channel constituted by bipolaronic pairs, we find $d_{x^2-y^2}$ attractive interactions between open channel magnetic polarons. The closed form of the derived interactions allows us analyze the resonant pairing interactions and we find enhanced (suppressed) attraction for hole (electron) doping in our model. The formalism we introduce provides a framework to analyze the implications of a possible Feshbach scenario, e.g. in the context of BEC-BCS crossover, and establishes a foundation to test quantitative aspects of the proposed Feshbach pairing mechanisms in doped antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>General Shiba mapping for on-site four-point correlation functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By applying the Shiba mapping on the two particle level, we derive the relation between the local four-point correlation functions of bipartite lattice models with on-site electronic repulsion and those of the corresponding models with attractive interaction in the most general setting. In particular, we extend the results of [Phys. Rev. B, 101, 155148 (2020)], which were limited to the rather specific situation of the static limit in strictly particle-hole symmetric models, (i) by explicitly including both magnetic field and different values of the chemical potentials, and (ii) by considering the full dependence of the generalized susceptibilities on the transfer (bosonic) Matsubara frequency. The derived formalism is then applied, as a relevant benchmark, to the Hubbard atom, by investigating the general properties of the divergences of its irreducible vertex functions as a function of chemical potential and applied magnetic field. The resulting phase-diagrams provide an insightful compass for future studies of the breakdown of the self-consistent perturbation expansion beyond high-symmetric regimes.</description>

      <title>Thermal Tensor Network Approach for Spin-Lattice Relaxation in Quantum Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-dimensional quantum magnets, particularly those with strong spin frustration, are characterized by their notable spin fluctuations. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) serves as a sensitive probe of low-energy fluctuations that offers valuable insight into rich magnetic phases and emergent phenomena in quantum magnets. Although experimentally accessible, the numerical simulation of NMR relaxation rates, specifically the spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$, remains a significant challenge. Analytical continuation based on Monte Carlo calculations are hampered by the notorious negative sign for frustrated systems, and the real-time simulations incur significant costs to capture low-energy fluctuations. Here we propose computing the relaxation rate using thermal tensor networks (TTNs), which provides a streamlined approach by calculating its imaginary-time proxy. We showcase the accuracy and versatility of our methodology by applying it to one-dimensional spin chains and two-dimensional lattices, where we find that the critical exponents $\eta$ and $z\nu$ can be extracted from the low-temperature scalings of the simulated $1/T_1$ near quantum critical points. Our results also provide insights into the low-dimensional and frustrated magnetic materials, elucidating universal scaling behaviors in the Ising chain compound CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and revealing the renormalized classical behaviors in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Ba$_8$CoNb$_6$O$_{24}$. We apply the approach to effective model of the family of frustrated magnets AYbCh$_2$ (A = Na, K, Cs, and Ch = O, S, Se), and find dramatic changes from spin ordered to the proposed quantum spin liquid phase. Overall, with high reliability and accuracy, the TTN methodology offers a systematic strategy for studying the intricate dynamics observed across a broad spectrum of quantum magnets and related fields.</description>

      <title>Fractionalization Signatures in the Dynamics of Quantum Spin Liquids</title>

Abstract: We investigate the signatures of fractionalization in quantum spin liquids by studying different phases of the Kitaev honeycomb model in the presence of an out-of-plane magnetic field through which the model becomes non-integrable. Using the infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) ansatz, along with analytical calculations and exact diagonalization, we calculate dynamical signatures of fractionalized particles through spin-spin and dimer-dimer correlations. Our analysis demonstrates the ability of these correlations to discern distinct fractionalized quantum sectors, namely Majorana fermions and the emergent $Z_2$ fluxes, in both the chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase under weak field and the emergent intermediate gapless phase (IGP) under moderate field. Importantly, our calculation reveals the nature of IGP observed at moderate fields, a region of ongoing debate, indicating that this phase is a Majorana metal induced by strong flux fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Amperean superconductivity cannot be induced by deep subwavelength cavities in a two-dimensional material</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.10371v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amperean superconductivity is an exotic phenomenon stemming from attractive effective electron-electron interactions (EEEIs) mediated by a transverse gauge field. Originally introduced in the context of quantum spin liquids and high-Tc superconductors, Amperean superconductivity has been recently proposed to occur at temperatures on the order of 1-20 K in two-dimensional, parabolic-band, electron gases embedded inside deep sub-wavelength optical cavities. In this work, we first generalize the microscopic theory of cavity-induced Amperean superconductivity to the case of graphene and then argue that this superconducting state cannot be achieved in the deep sub-wavelength regime. In the latter regime, indeed, a cavity induces only EEEIs between density fluctuations rather than the current-current interactions which are responsible for Amperean pairing.</description>

      <title>Theory of non-linear diffusion with a physical gapped mode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a system with one conserved charge the charge diffusion is modified by non-linear self-interactions within an effective field theory (EFT) of diffusive fluctuations. We include the slowest ultraviolet (UV) mode, constructing a UV-regulated EFT. The relaxation time of this UV mode is protected from renormalization, as supported by experimental data in a bad metal system. Furthermore, the retarded density-density Green's function acquires four branch points, eventually increasing the range of applicability. We discuss the fate of long-time-tails as well as implications for the quark gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Coupling Driven High-Temperature Superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Under Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The newly discovered high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has attracted a great deal of attentions. The essential ingredient characterizing the electronic properties is the bilayer NiO$_2$ planes coupled by the interlayer bonding of $3d_{z^2}$ orbitals through the intermediate oxygen-atoms. In the strong coupling limit, the low energy physics is described by an intralayer antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interaction $J_{\parallel}$ between $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals and an interlayer one $J_{\perp}$ between $3d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Taking into account Hund's rule on each site and integrating out the $3d_{z^2}$ spin degree of freedom, the system reduces to a single-orbital bilayer $t$-$J$ model based on the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. By employing the slave-boson approach, the self-consistent equations for the bonding and pairing order parameters are solved. Near the physically relevant $\frac{1}{4}$-filling regime (doping $\delta=0.3\sim 0.5$), the interlayer coupling $J_{\perp}$ tunes the conventional single-layer $d$-wave superconducting state to the $s$-wave one. A strong $J_{\perp}$ could enhance the inter-layer superconducting order, leading to a dramatically increased $T_c$. Interestingly, there could exist a finite regime in which an $s+id$ state emerges.</description>

      <title>Critical enhancement of the spin Hall effect by spin fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin Hall (SH) effect, the conversion of the electric current to the spin current along the transverse direction, relies on the relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here, we develop a microscopic theory on the mechanisms of the SH effect in magnetic metals, where itinerant electrons are coupled with localized magnetic moments via the Hund exchange interaction and the SOC. Both antiferromagnetic metals and ferromagnetic metals are considered. It is shown that the SH conductivity can be significantly enhanced by the spin fluctuation when approaching the magnetic transition temperature of both cases. For antiferromagnetic metals, the pure SH effect appears in the entire temperature range, while for ferromagnetic metals, the pure SH effect is expected to be replaced by the anomalous Hall effect below the transition temperature. We discuss possible experimental realizations and the effect of the quantum criticality when the antiferromagnetic transition temperature is tuned to zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Fractonic Quantum Quench in Dipole-constrained Bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quench dynamics in the dipolar Bose-Hubbard model in one dimension where the boson hopping is constrained by dipole conservation and show fractonic dynamics. Quench processes that start deep in the Mott phase and end in the weak Mott phase show light-cone-like spreading in the dipole correlation function but not in the single-boson correlator, which is suppressed due to the dipole conservation. The phase and the group velocities estimated from the dilute-dipolon approximation are in excellent agreement with those of the Time-Dependent Variational Principle method. The quench from the dipole-condensed (DC) phase to the Mott phase shows periodic kinks in the Loschmidt echo and the demise and revival of Bose-condensed peaks in the dipole momentum distribution function, both of which are noted features of dynamical quantum phase transition. The Mott-to-DC quench, on the other hand, shows none of these features despite the quench parameters varying across the equilibrium quantum critical point. Our findings on the fractonic quench dynamics can be checked in the tilted optical lattice experiment.</description>

      <title>Phases of theories with $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 1-form symmetry and the roles of center vortices and magnetic monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the phases of theories which only have a microscopic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 1-form symmetry, starting with a topological BF theory and deforming it in accordance with microscopic symmetry. These theories have a well-defined notion of confinement. Prototypical examples are pure $SU(N)$ gauge theories and $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories. Our analysis shows that the only generic phases are in $d=2$, only the confined phase; in $d=3$, both the confined phase and the topological BF phase; and in $d=4$, the confined phase, the topological BF phase, and a phase with a massless photon. We construct a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory with a deformation which, surprisingly, produces up to $(N-1)$ photons. We give an interpretation of these findings in terms of two competing pictures of confinement -- proliferation of monopoles and proliferation of center vortices -- and conclude that the proliferation of center vortices is a necessary but insufficient condition for confinement, while that of monopoles is both necessary and sufficient.</description>

      <title>Higher-group global symmetry and the bosonic M5 brane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-group symmetries are combinations of higher-form symmetries which appear in various field theories. In this paper, we explain how higher-group symmetries arise in 10d and 11d supergravities when the latter are coupled to brane sources. Motivated by this observation, we study field theories at zero and finite temperature invariant under a class of continuous Abelian higher-group symmetries. We restrict the analysis to the low-energy regime where the dynamical field content exclusively consists of Goldstone fields arising from the spontaneous breaking of higher-group and spacetime symmetries. Invariant quantities are constructed and the phases of matter are classified according to the pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking. With respect to supergravity, we highlight how such Goldstone effective theories provide a symmetry-based interpretation for the theories living on D/M-branes. As an explicit example we construct a 6-group invariant action for the bosonic M5 brane, consistent with the self-duality of the 3-form field strength on the brane. While the self-duality condition in the bosonic case needs to be imposed externally as a constraint at zero temperature, we find an equilibrium effective action for the bosonic M5 brane at finite temperature that inherently implements self-duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall states in moir\'e systems, we consider the possibility of realizing non-Abelian phases in topological minibands. We study a family of moir\'e systems, skyrmion Chern band (SCB) models, which can be realized in two-dimensional semiconductor/magnetic skyrmion heterostructures and also capture the essence of twisted transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayers. We show using many-body exact diagonalization that, in spite of strong Berry curvature variations in momentum space, the non-Abelian Moore-Read state can be realized at half filling of the second miniband. These results demonstrate the feasibility of non-Abelian fractionalization in moir\'e systems without Landau levels and shed light on the desirable conditions for their realization. In particular, we highlight the prospect of realizing the Moore-Read state at filling factor $\nu=3/2$ in twisted semiconductor bilayers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the time-dependent Quantum Geometric Tensor (tQGT) as a comprehensive tool for capturing the geometric character of insulators observable within linear response. We show that tQGT describes the zero-point motion of bound electrons and acts as a generating function for generalized sum rules of electronic conductivity. Therefore, tQGT enables a systematic and basis-independent framework to compute the instantaneous response of insulators, including optical mass, orbital angular momentum, and the dielectric constant in low-energy effective theories. It allows for a consistent approximation across these quantities upon restricting the number of occupied and unoccupied states in an effective low-energy description of an infinite quantum system. We outline how quantum geometry can be generated in periodic systems by lattice interference and examine spectral weight transfer from small frequencies to high frequencies by creating geometrically frustrated flat bands.</description>
