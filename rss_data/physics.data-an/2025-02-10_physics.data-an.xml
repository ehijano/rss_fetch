      <title>SpecTUS: Spectral Translator for Unknown Structures annotation from EI-MS spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compound identification and structure annotation from mass spectra is a well-established task widely applied in drug detection, criminal forensics, small molecule biomarker discovery and chemical engineering.
  We propose SpecTUS: Spectral Translator for Unknown Structures, a deep neural model that addresses the task of structural annotation of small molecules from low-resolution gas chromatography electron ionization mass spectra (GC-EI-MS). Our model analyzes the spectra in \textit{de novo} manner -- a direct translation from the spectra into 2D-structural representation. Our approach is particularly useful for analyzing compounds unavailable in spectral libraries.
  In a rigorous evaluation of our model on the novel structure annotation task across different libraries, we outperformed standard database search techniques by a wide margin. On a held-out testing set, including \numprint{28267} spectra from the NIST database, we show that our model's single suggestion perfectly reconstructs 43\% of the subset's compounds. This single suggestion is strictly better than the candidate of the database hybrid search (common method among practitioners)
  in 76\% of cases. In a~still affordable scenario of~10 suggestions, perfect reconstruction is achieved in 65\%, and 84\% are better than the hybrid search.</description>

      <title>A Mereological Approach to Higher-Order Structure in Complex Systems: from Macro to Micro with M\"obius</title>

Abstract: Relating macroscopic observables to microscopic interactions is a central challenge in the study of complex systems. While current approaches often focus on pairwise interactions, a complete understanding requires going beyond these to capture the full range of possible interactions. We present a unified mathematical formalism, based on the M\"obius inversion theorem, that reveals how different decompositions of a system into parts lead to different, but equally valid, microscopic theories. By providing an exact bridge between microscopic and macroscopic descriptions, this framework demonstrates that many existing notions of interaction, from epistasis in genetics and many-body couplings in physics, to synergy in game theory and artificial intelligence, naturally and uniquely arise from particular choices of system decomposition, or mereology. By revealing the common mathematical structure underlying seemingly disparate phenomena, our work highlights how the choice of decomposition fundamentally determines the nature of the resulting interactions. We discuss how this unifying perspective can facilitate the transfer of insights across domains, guide the selection of appropriate system decompositions, and enable the search for new notions of interaction. To illustrate the latter in practice, we decompose the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and show that our method correctly identifies which variables are responsible for the divergence. In addition, we use Rota's Galois connection theorem to describe coarse-grainings of mereologies, and efficiently derive the renormalised couplings of a 1D Ising model. Our results suggest that the M\"obius inversion theorem provides a powerful and practical lens for understanding the emergence of complex behaviour from the interplay of microscopic parts, with applications across a wide range of disciplines.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal projections of hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10257</link>

Abstract: Projections of hypercubes have been applied to visualize high-dimensional binary state spaces in various scientific fields. Conventional methods for projecting hypercubes, however, face practical difficulties. Manual methods require nontrivial adjustments of the projection basis, while optimization-based algorithms limit the interpretability and reproducibility of the resulting plots. These limitations motivate us to explore theoretically analyzable projection algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA). Here, we investigate the mathematical properties of PCA-projected hypercubes. Our numerical and analytical results show that PCA effectively captures polarized distributions within the hypercubic state space. This property enables the assessment of the asymptotic distribution of projected vertices and error bounds, which characterize the performance of PCA in the projected space. We demonstrate the application of PCA to visualize the hypercubic energy landscapes of Ising spin systems. By adding projected hypercubic edges, these visualizations reveal pathways of correlated spin flips. Our work provides a better understanding of how PCA discovers hidden patterns in high-dimensional binary data.</description>

      <title>On the reconstruction limits of complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network reconstruction consists in retrieving the hidden interaction structure of a system from observations. Many reconstruction algorithms have been proposed, although less research has been devoted to describe their theoretical limitations. In this work, we adopt an information-theoretic perspective and define the reconstructability: The fraction of structural information recoverable from data. The reconstructability depends on the true data generating (TDG) model which is shown to set the reconstruction limit: any algorithm can perform, on average, at best like the TDG model. We show that the reconstructability is related to various performance measures, such as the probability of error and the Jaccard similarity. In an empirical context where the TDG model is unknown, we introduce the reconstruction index as an approximation of the reconstructability. We find that performing model selection is crucial for the validity of the reconstruction index as a proxy of the reconstructability of empirical time series and networks.</description>
