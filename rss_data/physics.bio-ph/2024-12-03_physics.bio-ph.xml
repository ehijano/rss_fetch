      <title>Intermittent turbulent gusts lift eagles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence grounds aircraft and combating it in flight requires energy, yet volant wildlife fly effortlessly even on windy days. The nature of the interactions between soaring birds and transient turbulent gusts is not clear, especially when compared with our understanding of flight in larger and steadier airflows during thermal or dynamic soaring. We show that soaring golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) experienced short upward accelerations indicative of preferential engagement with strong and intermittent turbulent updrafts. The vertical accelerations reflect changes in lift that were as large as 25 standard deviations from the mean, or more than three times the acceleration of gravity, and so large as not to be consistent with gust mitigation or avoidance. These extreme events occurred in short bursts that mimic movement with turbulent vortices. The burst statistics and their symmetries approach those of turbulence toward longer timescales. On the shortest timescales, the bursts break the symmetry of small-scale turbulence in favor of upward accelerations that are more intermittent than turbulence. We introduce a simple nonlinear model that predicts the scale at which symmetry breaks and the stronger intermittency on the smaller scales. These findings suggest a ratcheting mechanism on turbulent gusts and constitute the first quantitative evidence in favor of turbulent gust harvesting by wildlife. An implications is that turbulence is so strong and pervasive as to make unsteady and nonlinear aerodynamics an intrinsic and beneficial aspect of both flapping and soaring flight in the atmospheric boundary layer - one that we need to incorporate in our understanding of the energetics of flight.</description>

      <title>Messenger size optimality in cellular communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living cells presumably employ optimized information transfer methods, enabling efficient communication even in noisy environments. As expected, the efficiency of chemical communications between cells depends on the properties of the molecular messenger. Evidence suggests that proteins from narrow ranges of molecular masses have been naturally selected to mediate cellular communications, yet the underlying communication design principles are not understood. Using a simple physical model that considers the cost of chemical synthesis, diffusion, molecular binding, and degradation, we show that optimal mass values exist that ensure efficient communication of various types of signals. Our findings provide insights into the design principles of biological communications and can be used to engineer chemically communicating biomimetic systems.</description>

      <title>Chemomechanical regulation of growing tissues from a thermodynamically-consistent framework and its application to tumor spheroid growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely recognized that reciprocal interactions between cells and their microenvironment, via mechanical forces and biochemical signaling pathways, regulate cell behaviors during normal development, homeostasis and disease progression such as cancer. However, it is still not well understood how complex patterns of tissue growth emerge. Here, we propose a framework for the chemomechanical regulation of growth based on thermodynamics of continua and growth-elasticity to predict growth patterns. Combining the elastic and chemical energies, we use an energy variational approach to derive a novel formulation that incorporates an energy-dissipating stress relaxation and biochemomechanical regulation of the volumetric growth rate. We validate the model using experimental data from growth of tumor spheroids in confined environments. We also investigate the influence of model parameters, including tissue rearrangement rate, tissue compressibility, strength of mechanical feedback and external mechanical stimuli, on the growth patterns of tumor spheroids.</description>

      <title>Self organisation of invasive breast cancer driven by the interplay of active and passive nematic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In invasive breast cancer, cell clusters of varying sizes and shapes are embedded in the fibrous extracellular matrix (ECM). Although the prevailing view attributes this structure to increasing disorder resulting from loss of function and dedifferentiation, our findings reveal that it arises through a process of active self-organization driven by cancer cell motility. Simulations and histological analyses of tumours from over 2,000 breast cancer patients reveal that motile, aligned cancer cells within clusters move as active nematic aggregates through the surrounding highly aligned ECM fibres, which form a confining, passive nematic phase. Cellular motion leads to cluster splitting and coalescence. The degree of cluster activity, combined with heterogeneity in cell motility, is reflected in specific scaling behaviours for cluster shape, size distribution, and the distance between cluster boundaries and nematic defects in ECM alignment. Increased activity estimates correlate with tumour progression and are associated with a poorer prognosis for patients.</description>

      <title>The matter/life nexus in biological cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical motion has long been at the heart of what humans identify as life. Early thinkers about what differentiates life from inanimate matter connected agency to autonomous motion, a line of thinking that continued until Robert Brown's experiments showed decisively that autonomous motion, and many other physical behaviors and organizational principles, belong to inanimate matter. An incredible trajectory of inquiry for the next 100 years showed that life is characterized by the ability to reproduce, to inherit, to adapt. But throughout this arc, a persistent search continued for that fundamental process, that gain in function from matter to life. Subsequent decades showed that genetic sequence is not enough. The leap occurs somewhere in cells' watery milieu - physicochemical functions unique to life. In this Review, we explore how advances in the last decade have embraced the deep coupling of physics and cellular biochemistry to shed light on the matter/life nexus. Brownian flow physics are more than implicated but rather help instantiate life. The reader will observe in this review many references to works in cell biology - as many or more than in biophysics or fluid mechanics. This is perhaps not as intentional as it is unavoidable in the effort to see how matter becomes life inside the watery compartment of the cell.</description>

      <title>Spatial Clustering of Molecular Localizations with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-molecule localization microscopy generates point clouds corresponding to fluorophore localizations. Spatial cluster identification and analysis of these point clouds are crucial for extracting insights about molecular organization. However, this task becomes challenging in the presence of localization noise, high point density, or complex biological structures. Here, we introduce MIRO (Multimodal Integration through Relational Optimization), an algorithm that uses recurrent graph neural networks to transform the point clouds in order to improve clustering efficiency when applying conventional clustering techniques. We show that MIRO supports simultaneous processing of clusters of different shapes and at multiple scales, demonstrating improved performance across varied datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates MIRO's transformative potential for single-molecule localization applications, showcasing its capability to revolutionize cluster analysis and provide accurate, reliable details of molecular architecture. In addition, MIRO's robust clustering capabilities hold promise for applications in various fields such as neuroscience, for the analysis of neural connectivity patterns, and environmental science, for studying spatial distributions of ecological data.</description>

      <title>Insights into Dermal Permeation of Skin Oil Oxidation Products from Enhanced Sampling Molecular Dynamics Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The oxidation of human sebum, a lipid mixture covering our skin, generates a range of volatile and semi-volatile carbonyl compounds that contribute largely to indoor air pollution in crowded environments. Kinetic models have been developed to gain a deeper understanding of this complex multiphase chemistry, but they rely partially on rough estimates of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, especially those describing skin permeation. Here, we employ atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the translocation of selected skin oil oxidation products through a model stratum corneum membrane. We find these simulations to be non-trivial, requiring extensive sampling with up to microsecond simulation times, in spite of employing enhanced sampling techniques. We identify the high degree of order and stochastic, long-lived temporal asymmetries in the membrane structure as the leading causes for the slow convergence of the free energy computations. Even after tremendous simulation efforts, substantial errors in the free energy profiles remain, which we propagate to membrane permeabilities. These errors are independent of the enhanced sampling technique employed and very likely independent of the precise membrane model.</description>

      <title>Perceived brightness and resolution of holographic augmented reality retinal scan glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Augmented reality display performance depends strongly on features of the human visual system. This is especially true for retinal scan glasses, which use laser beam scanning and transparent holographic optical combiners. Human-centered approaches allow us to go beyond conventional optical metrology and evaluate display performance as it is perceived in actual augmented reality use cases. Here, we first present a theoretical formula for the retinal scan luminance and ambient contrast ratio calculated from optical powers, wavelengths, field of view, and human pupil diameter. As a promising insight we found that the pupil diameter dependence is beneficial in assimilating the virtual image luminance to the ambient luminance. Second, we designed and performed a psychophysical experiment to assess perceived resolution in augmented reality settings using a fully functional retinal scan glasses prototype. We present the results of the trials and illustrate how this approach can be useful in the further development of augmented reality smart glasses.</description>

      <title>Brownian spin-locking effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brownian systems are characterized by spatiotemporal disorder, which arises from the erratic motion of particles driven by thermal fluctuations. When light interacts with such systems, it typically produces unpolarized and uncorrelated fields. Here, we report the observation of a large-scale spin-locking effect of light within a Brownian medium. In an observation direction perpendicular to the incident wave momentum, scattering naturally divides into two diffusion regions, each associated with an opposite spin from the Brownian nanoparticles. This effect arises from the intrinsic spin-orbit interactions of scattering from individual nanoparticles, which ubiquitously generate radiative spin fields that propagate through the Brownian medium with multiple incoherent scattering. It offers a novel experimental platform for exploring macroscale spin behaviors of diffused light, with potential applications in precision metrology for measuring various nanoparticle properties. Our findings may inspire the study of analogous phenomena for different waves from novel spin-orbit interactions in complex disordered systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in machine learning have made its application to anomalous diffusion analysis both essential and inevitable. This review systematically introduces the integration of machine learning techniques for enhanced analysis of anomalous diffusion, focusing on two pivotal aspects: single trajectory characterization via machine learning and representation learning of anomalous diffusion. We extensively compare various machine learning methods, including both classical machine learning and deep learning, used for the inference of diffusion parameters and trajectory segmentation. Additionally, platforms such as the Anomalous Diffusion Challenge that serve as benchmarks for evaluating these methods are highlighted. On the other hand, we outline three primary strategies for representing anomalous diffusion: the combination of predefined features, the feature vector from the penultimate layer of neural network, and the latent representation from the autoencoder, analyzing their applicability across various scenarios. This investigation paves the way for future research, offering valuable perspectives that can further enrich the study of anomalous diffusion and advance the application of artificial intelligence in statistical physics and biophysics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structure and dynamics of important biological quasi-two-dimensional systems, ranging from cytoskeletal gels to tissues, are controlled by nematic order, flow, defects and activity. Continuum hydrodynamic descriptions combined with numerical simulations have been used to understand such complex systems. The development of thermodynamically consistent theories and numerical methods to model active nemato-hydrodynamics is eased by mathematical formalisms enabling systematic derivations and structured-preserving algorithms. Alternative to classical nonequilibrium thermodynamics and bracket formalisms, here we develop a theoretical and computational framework for active nematics based on Onsager's variational formalism to irreversible thermodynamics, according to which the dynamics result from the minimization of a Rayleighian functional capturing the competition between free-energy release, dissipation and activity. We show that two standard incompressible models of active nemato-hydrodynamics can be framed in the variational formalism, and develop a new compressible model for density-dependent active nemato-hydrodynamics relevant to model actomyosin gels. We show that the variational principle enables a direct and transparent derivation not only of the governing equations, but also of the finite element numerical scheme. We exercise this model in two representative examples of active nemato-hydrodynamics relevant to the actin cytoskeleton during wound healing and to the dynamics of confined colonies of elongated cells.</description>

      <title>Liquid Hopfield model: retrieval and localization in multicomponent liquid mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18853v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological mixtures, such as the cellular cytoplasm, are composed of a large number of different components. From this heterogeneity, ordered mesoscopic structures emerge, such as liquid phases with controlled composition. These structures compete with each other for the same components. This raises several questions, such as what types of interactions allow the retrieval of multiple ordered mesoscopic structures, and what are the physical limitations for the retrieval of said structures. In this work, we develop an analytically tractable model for liquids capable of retrieving states with target compositions. We name this model the liquid Hopfield model in reference to corresponding work in the theory of associative neural networks. By solving this model, we show that non-linear repulsive interactions are necessary for retrieval of target structures. We demonstrate that this is because liquid mixtures at low temperatures tend to transition to phases with few components, a phenomenon that we term localization. Taken together, our results demonstrate a trade-off between retrieval and localization phenomena in liquid mixtures.</description>

      <title>Towards Linking Histological Changes to Liver Viscoelasticity: A Hybrid Analytical-Computational Micromechanics Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by elastography that utilizes tissue mechanical properties as biomarkers for liver disease, with the eventual objective of quantitatively linking histopathology and bulk mechanical properties, we develop a micromechanical modeling approach to capture the effects of fat and collagen deposition in the liver. Specifically, we utilize computational homogenization to convert the microstructural changes in hepatic lobule to the effective viscoelastic modulus of the liver tissue, i.e., predict the bulk material properties by analyzing the deformation of repeating unit cell. The lipid and collagen deposition is simulated with the help of ad hoc algorithms informed by histological observations. Collagen deposition is directly included in the computational model, while composite material theory is used to convert fat content to the microscopic mechanical properties, which in turn is included in the computational model. The results illustrate the ability of the model to capture the effect of both fat and collagen deposition on the viscoelastic moduli and represents a step towards linking histopathological changes in the liver to its bulk mechanical properties, which can eventually provide insights for accurate diagnosis with elastography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To determine the precise link between anatomical structure and function, brain studies primarily concentrate on the anatomical wiring of the brain and its topological properties. In this work, we investigate the weighted degree and connection length distributions of the KKI-113 and KKI-18 human connectomes, the fruit fly, and of the mouse retina. We found that the node strength (weighted degree) distribution behavior differs depending on the considered scale. On the global scale, the distributions are found to follow a power-law behavior, with a roughly universal exponent close to 3. However, this behavior breaks at the local scale as the node strength distributions of the KKI-18 follow a stretched exponential, and the fly and mouse retina follow the lognormal distribution, respectively which are indicative of underlying random multiplicative processes and underpins non-locality of learning in a brain close to the critical state. However, for the case of the KKI-113 and the H01 human (1mm$^3$) datasets, the local weighted degree distributions follow an exponentially truncated power-law, which may hint at the fact that the critical learning mechanism may have manifested at the node level too.</description>

Abstract: The geometry and motility of the stomach play a critical role in the digestion of ingested liquid meals. Sleeve gastrectomy, a common type of bariatric surgery used to reduce the size of the stomach, significantly alters the stomach's anatomy and motility, which impacts gastric emptying and digestion. In this study, we use an imaging data-based computational model, StomachSim, to investigate the consequences of sleeve gastrectomy. The pre-operative stomach anatomy was derived from imaging data and the post-sleeve gastrectomy shapes were generated for different resection volumes. We investigate the effect of sleeve sizes and motility patterns on gastric mixing and emptying. Simulations were conducted using an immersed-boundary flow solver, modeling a liquid meal to analyze changes in gastric content mixing and emptying rates. The results reveal that different degrees of volume reduction and impaired gastric motility have complex effects on stomach's mixing and emptying functions, which are important factors in gastric health of the patient. These findings provide insights into the biomechanical effects of sleeve gastrectomy on gastric digestion and emptying functions, highlighting the potential of computational models to inform surgical planning and post-operative management.</description>
