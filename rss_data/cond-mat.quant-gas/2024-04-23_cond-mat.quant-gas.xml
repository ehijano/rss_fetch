      <title>Dynamical properties of Fermi-Fermi mixtures of dipolar and non-dipolar atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical properties of homogeneous Fermi-Fermi mixtures of dipolar and non-dipolar atoms are studied at zero temperature, where dipoles are polarized by an external field. We calculate the density-density correlation functions in a ring-diagram approximation and analyze the pole structure to obtain eigenfrequencies of collective excitations. We first determine stability phase diagrams for the mixtures available in experiments: $^{167}$Er-$^{173}$Yb, $^{167}$Er-$^{6}$Li, $^{161}$Dy-$^{173}$Yb, and $^{161}$Dy-$^{6}$Li systems, and show that the mixtures with larger mass imbalance tend to be more unstable. We then investigate the parameter dependence of an undamped zero sound with an anisotropic real dispersion relation in the stable phase for the $^{161}$Dy-$^{173}$Yb mixture, and the speed of sound exhibits a critical angle of possible propagation with respect to the dipole polarization direction, above which the sound mode disappears in the particle-hole continuum. Since the sound mode is a coherent superposition of density fluctuations of dipolar and non-dipolar atoms, the existence of the sound mode, e.g., the value of the critical angle, is significantly affected by the inter-particle interaction through the density-density correlation between dipolar and non-dipolar atoms. We have also observed such an effect of the inter-particle interaction in the study of a linear response of density fluctuations to an external perturbation.</description>

      <title>Phase separation and metastability in a mixture of spin-1 and spin-2 Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground state and dynamics of a mixture of spin-1 and spin-2 Bose-Einstein condensates of ${}^{87}{\rm{Rb}}$ atoms. For the experimentally measured interaction coefficients, the ground state exhibits phase separation between the spin-1 ferromagnetic state and the spin-2 nematic state. At the interface between them, a partially polarized spin state emerges. The uniformly mixed state of the spin-1 polar state and spin-2 biaxial nematic state is metastable, and the phase separation via nucleation can be triggered by a local perturbation.</description>

      <title>Two-body problem of impurity atoms in dipolar Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarized dipolar Fermi gas shows exotic properties at low temperatures, characterized by an axially-deformed Fermi surface and anisotropic single-particle energy, due to the long-range and anisotropic nature of dipole-dipole interaction. In cold-atom experiments such a system has been realized, e.g., in degenerate gas of Er and Dy atoms. In the case that non-dipolar impurity atoms are introduced in such system, they undergoes an induced interaction mediated by the density fluctuations of the background dipolar Fermi gas. We derive the induced interaction potential to the single-loop order of fluctuations and show that it becomes indeed an anisotropic Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida-type potential which preserves the axial symmetry around the polarization axis. We then solve the two-body problem of impurity atoms interacting via the anisotropic potential and figure out the dependence of bound state and scattering properties on the parameters of dipolar Fermi gas.</description>

      <title>Observation of Hilbert-space fragmentation and fractonic excitations in two-dimensional Hubbard systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relaxation behaviour of isolated quantum systems taken out of equilibrium is among the most intriguing questions in many-body physics. Quantum systems out of equilibrium typically relax to thermal equilibrium states by scrambling local information and building up entanglement entropy. However, kinetic constraints in the Hamiltonian can lead to a breakdown of this fundamental paradigm due to a fragmentation of the underlying Hilbert space into dynamically decoupled subsectors in which thermalisation can be strongly suppressed. Here, we experimentally observe Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) in a two-dimensional tilted Bose-Hubbard model. Using quantum gas microscopy, we engineer a wide variety of initial states and find a rich set of manifestations of HSF involving bulk states, interfaces and defects, i.e., d = 2, 1 and 0 dimensional objects. Specifically, uniform initial states with equal particle number and energy differ strikingly in their relaxation dynamics. Inserting controlled defects on top of a global, non-thermalising chequerboard state, we observe highly anisotropic, sub-dimensional dynamics, an immediate signature of their fractonic nature. An interface between localized and thermalising states in turn displays dynamics depending on its orientation. Our results mark the first observation of HSF beyond one dimension, as well as the concomitant direct observation of fractons, and pave the way for in-depth studies of microscopic transport phenomena in constrained systems</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory for Spontaneously Broken Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a preprint of an open-access book published by Springer Cham. The book gives an up-to-date overview of the physics of spontaneously broken continuous symmetry from the point of view of effective field theory. Upon building up the necessary foundations, the text reviews the classification of Nambu-Goldstone bosons and then focuses on the construction of the effective-field-theoretic description of their dynamics. Both internal and spacetime broken symmetries are covered, including numerous illustrative examples and a few selected applications, worked out in greater detail.</description>

      <title>Designing open quantum systems with known steady states: Davies generators and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a systematic framework for constructing generic models of nonequilibrium quantum dynamics with a target stationary (mixed) state. Our framework identifies (almost) all combinations of Hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics that relax to a steady state of interest, generalizing the Davies' generator for dissipative relaxation at finite temperature to nonequilibrium dynamics targeting arbitrary stationary states. We focus on Gibbs states of stabilizer Hamiltonians, identifying local Lindbladians compatible therewith by constraining the rates of dissipative and unitary processes. Moreover, given terms in the Lindbladian not compatible with the target state, our formalism identifies the operations -- including syndrome measurements and local feedback -- one must apply to correct these errors. Our methods also reveal new models of quantum dynamics: for example, we provide a "measurement-induced phase transition" where measurable two-point functions exhibit critical (power-law) scaling with distance at a critical ratio of the transverse field and rate of measurement and feedback. Time-reversal symmetry -- defined naturally within our formalism -- can be broken both in effectively classical, and intrinsically quantum, ways. Our framework provides a systematic starting point for exploring the landscape of quantum dynamical universality classes, as well as identifying new protocols for quantum error correction.</description>

Abstract: We propose and demonstrate numerically a measurement scheme for complete reconstruction of the 2D quantum wave function of a Bose-Einstein condensate, amplitude and phase, from a time-of-flight measurement. We identify a fundamental ambiguity present in the measurement of phase structures of high-symmetry excitations (e.g., vortices) and show how to overcome it by allowing for different expansion durations in different directions. We demonstrate this approach with the reconstruction of matter-wave vortices and arrays of vortices.</description>

      <title>Controlling quantum vortex dynamics and vortex-antivortex annihilation in Bose-Einstein condensates with optical lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superfluids with strong spatial modulation can be experimentally produced in the area of cold atoms under the influence of optical lattices. Here we address $^{87}$Rb bosons at T=0 K in a flat geometry under the influence of a periodic potential with the Gross-Pitaevskii theory. The statics and dynamics of vortex excitations are studied in the case of one dimensional (1D) and of two dimensional (2D) optical lattices, as function of the intensity of the optical lattice. We compute how the vortex energy depends on the position of its core and the energy barrier that a vortex has to surmount in order to move in the superfluid. The dynamics of a vortex dipole, a pair of vortices of opposite chirality, differ profoundly from the case of a uniform superfluid. In the 1D case, when parallel ridges of density are present, the dynamics depends on the positions of the two vortices. If they are in the same channel between two ridges, then the two vortices approach each other until they annihilate each other in a short time. If the two vortices are in distinct channels the dipole undergoes a rigid translation but with a velocity depending on the intensity of the optical lattice and this translation velocity can even change sign with respect to the case of the uniform superfluid. Superimposed on this translation an oscillatory motion is also present. These oscillatory motions can be both longitudinal, i.e. along the channel, as well as transverse. In all cases the transverse motions are one-side, in the sense that the vortex core never crosses the equilibrium position nearest the starting position. In the case of the 2D lattices we study (square, triangular and honeycomb), the two vortices of a dipole move mainly by jumps between equilibrium positions and approach each other until annihilation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement phase transitions in non-Hermitian Floquet systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The competition between unitary time-evolution and quantum measurements could induce phase transitions in the entanglement characteristics of quantum many-body dynamics. In this work, we reveal such entanglement transitions in the context of non-Hermitian Floquet systems. Focusing on noninteracting fermions in a representative bipartite lattice with balanced gain/loss and under time-periodic quenches, we uncover rich patterns of entanglement transitions due to the interplay between driving and non-Hermitian effects. Specially, we find that the monotonic increase of quenched hopping amplitude could flip the system between volume-law and area-law entangled Floquet phases, yielding alternated entanglement transitions. Meanwhile, the raise of gain/loss strength could trigger area-law to volume-law reentrant transitions in the scaling behavior of steady-state entanglement entropy, which are abnormal and highly unexpected in non-driven systems. Connections between entanglement transitions and parity-time-reversal (PT) transitions in Floquet spectra are further established. Our findings not only build a foundation for exploring entanglement phase transitions in Floquet non-Hermitian setups, but also provide efficient means to engineer and control such transitions by driving fields.</description>

      <title>Structural complexity of snapshots of 2D Fermi-Hubbard systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of quantum gas microscopy for two-dimensional optical lattices has provided an unparalleled tool to study the Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) with ultracold atoms. Spin-resolved projective measurements, or snapshots, have played a significant role in quantifying correlation functions which uncover underlying physical phenomena such as antiferromagnetism at commensurate filling on bipartite lattices, and other charge and spin correlations, as well as dynamical properties at various densities. However, in order to interpret these results and to establish temperature scales, comparison against theory is generally needed. Here, we employ a recent concept, the {\em multi-scale structural complexity}, and show that when computed for the snapshots (of either single spin species, local moments, or total density) it can provide a theory-free property, immediately accessible to experiments. Specifically, after benchmarking results for Ising and XY models, we study the structural complexity of snapshots of the repulsive FHM in the two-dimensional square lattice as a function of doping and temperature. We generate projective measurements using determinant quantum Monte Carlo and compare their complexities against those from the experiment. We demonstrate that these complexities are linked to relevant physical observables such as the entropy and double occupancy. Their behaviors capture the development of correlations and relevant length scales in the system. We provide an open-source code in Python which can be implemented into data analysis routines in experimental settings for the square lattice.</description>

      <title>A Python GPU-accelerated solver for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and applications to many-body cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: TorchGPE is a general-purpose Python package developed for solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). This solver is designed to integrate wave functions across a spectrum of linear and non-linear potentials. A distinctive aspect of TorchGPE is its modular approach, which allows the incorporation of arbitrary self-consistent and time-dependent potentials, e.g., those relevant in many-body cavity QED models. The package employs a symmetric split-step Fourier propagation method, effective in both real and imaginary time. In our work, we demonstrate a significant improvement in computational efficiency by leveraging GPU computing capabilities. With the integration of the latter technology, TorchGPE achieves a substantial speed-up with respect to conventional CPU-based methods, greatly expanding the scope and potential of research in this field.</description>
