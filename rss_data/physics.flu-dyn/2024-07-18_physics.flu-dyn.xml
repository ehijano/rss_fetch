      <title>Symmetry-breaking of turbulent flow due to asymmetric vortex shedding in periodic porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we report new insight into a symmetry-breaking phenomenon that occurs for turbulent flow in periodic porous media composed of cylindrical solid obstacles with circular cross-section. We have used Large Eddy Simulation to investigate the symmetry-breaking phenomenon by varying the porosity (0.57-0.99) and the pore scale Reynolds number (37-1,000). Asymmetrical flow distribution is observed in the intermediate porosity flow regime for values of porosities between 0.8 and 0.9, which is characterized by the formation of alternating low and high velocity flow channels above and below the solid obstacles. These channels are parallel to the direction of the flow. Correspondingly, the microscale vortices formed behind the solid obstacles exhibit a bias in the shedding direction. The transition from symmetric to asymmetric flow occurs in between the Reynolds numbers of 37 (laminar) and 100 (turbulent). A Hopf bifurcation resulting in unsteady oscillatory laminar flow marks the origin of a secondary flow instability arising from the interaction of the shear layers around the solid obstacle. When turbulence emerges, stochastic phase difference in the vortex wake oscillations caused by the secondary flow instability results in flow symmetry breaking. We note that symmetry breaking does not occur for cylindrical solid obstacles with square cross-section due to the presence of sharp vertices in the solid obstacle surface. At the macroscale level, symmetry-breaking results in residual transverse drag force components acting on the solid obstacle surfaces. Symmetry-breaking promotes attached flow on the solid obstacle surface, which is potentially beneficial for improving transport properties at the solid obstacle surface such as convection heat flux.</description>

      <title>Transition to turbulence in the wide-gap spherical Couette system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spherical Couette system consists of two differentially rotating concentric spheres with a fluid filled in between. We study a regime where the outer sphere is rotating rapidly enough so that the Coriolis force is important and the inner sphere is rotating either slower or in the opposite direction with respect to the outer sphere. We numerically study the sudden transition to turbulence at a critical differential rotation seen in experiments at BTU Cottbus - Senftenberg, Germany and investigate its cause. We find that the source of turbulence is the boundary layer on the inner sphere, which becomes centrifugally unstable. We show that this instability leads to generation of small scale structures which lead to turbulence in the bulk, dominated by inertial waves, a change in the force balance near the inner boundary, the formation of a mean flow through Reynolds stresses, and consequently, to an efficient angular momentum transport. We compare our findings with axisymmetric simulations and show that there are significant similarities in the nature of the flow in the turbulent regimes of full 3D and axisymmetric simulations but differences in the evolution of the instability that leads to this transition. We find that a heuristic argument based on a Reynolds number defined using the thickness of the boundary layer as a length scale helps explain the scaling law of the variation of critical differential rotation for transition to turbulence with rotation rate observed in the experiments.</description>

      <title>Threshold for synchronisation and conditional Lyapunov analysis of large eddy simulations for turbulent flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synchronisation between turbulent flows in three dimensional periodic boxes is investigated through conditional and unconditional Lyapunov analyses based on the data obtained with direct numerical simulations and large eddy simulations. By systematic numerical experiments, we find that the leading Lyapunov exponents obtained with large eddy simulations follow the same scaling law as that of filtered perturbations of the real flow, thus should be interpreted as approximations of the latter. Data on the threshold coupling wavenumber for synchronisation show that the synchronisability of coupled turbulent flows is mainly determined by the conditional leading Lyapunov exponents of the slave flow itself, and is insensitive to the nature of the master flow. We present strong evidence to show that the peak wavenumber for the energy spectrum of the leading Lyapunov vector is approximately the same as the threshold wavenumber, corroborating a relationship established recently in rotating turbulence. The threshold wavenumber of large eddy simulations based on canonical subgrid-scale stress models is shown to be different from that of direct numerical simulations, even for the more sophisticated dynamical mixed model. By employing new parametrisation, the threshold wavenumbers are quantified. The care one needs to exercise to interpret the results obtained with large eddy simulations is discussed.</description>

      <title>Droplet breakup and size distribution in an airstream -- effect of inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the morphology and breakup of a droplet as it descends freely from a height and encounters an airstream. The size distributions of the child droplets are analysed using high-speed shadowgraphy and in-line holography techniques. We found that a droplet falling from various heights exhibits shape oscillations due to the intricate interplay between inertia and surface tension forces, leading to significant variations in the radial deformation of the droplet, influencing the breakup dynamics under an identical airstream condition. Specifically, the droplet undergoes vibrational breakup when introduced at a location slightly above the air nozzle. In contrast, as the release height of the droplet increases, keeping the Weber number defined based on the velocity of the airstream fixed, a dynamic interplay between the inertia of the droplet and the aerodynamic flow field comes into play, resulting in a sequence of breakup modes transitioning from vibrational breakup to retracting bag breakup, bag breakup, bag-stamen, retracting bag-stamen breakup, and eventually returning to vibrational breakup. Our experiments also reveal that the size distribution resulting from retracting bag breakup primarily arises from rim and node fragmentation, leading to a bimodal distribution. In contrast, bag and bag-stamen breakups yield a tri-modal size distribution due to the combined contributions of bag, rim, and node breakup mechanisms. Furthermore, we utilize a theoretical model that incorporates the effective Weber number, considering different release heights. This model accurately predicts the size distribution of the child droplets resulting from the various breakup modes observed in our experiments.</description>

      <title>Water drop impact on thin viscous oil layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted experimental investigations into the short-term and long-term impact dynamics of pure water drops on silicone oil-coated surfaces. Our observations revealed distinct phases: initially, rapid maximal spreading followed by retraction, subsequent oscillations characterized by a relatively stable contact angle, and a final phase involved the gradual spreading of the drop on the underlying solid surface due to the rupturing of the oil layer. The maximal spreading radius follows $We^{1/4}$ scaling, where $We$ is the Weber number, independent of the viscosity of the underlying oil layer. By introducing fluorescent tracer particles in the oil, we noted that the drop expanded over the oil layer during the initial spreading without displacing oil. Subsequently, as the oscillations dampen, the drop ruptures the oil layer, initiating a dewetting process and spreads over the solid surface, leaving a tiny oil droplet under the water drop. Upon completion of this dewetting process, the onset time for the drop spreading nonlinearly increased with the oil layer thickness as $\sim d_o^2$, which we attribute to the dewetting dynamics. Our findings unveil intriguing dynamics of water drops impacting on oil-coated surfaces.</description>

      <title>Interface-induced turbulence in viscous binary fluid mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of interface-induced turbulence, an emergent nonequilibrium statistically steady state (NESS) with spatiotemporal chaos, which is induced by interfacial fluctuations in low-Reynolds-number binary-fluid mixtures. We uncover the properties of this NESS via direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of cellular flows in the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) equations for binary fluids. We show that, in this NESS, the shell-averaged energy spectrum $E(k)$ is spread over several decades in the wavenumber $k$ and it exhibits a power-law region, indicative of turbulence but without a conventional inertial cascade. To characterize the statistical properties of this turbulence, we compute, in addition to $E(k)$, the time series $e(t)$ of the kinetic energy and its power spectrum, scale-by-scale energy transfer as a function of $k$, and the energy dissipation resulting from interfacial stresses. Furthermore, we analyze the mixing properties of this low-Reynolds-number turbulence via the mean-square displacement (MSD) of Lagrangian tracer particles, for which we demonstrate diffusive behavior at long times, a hallmark of strong mixing in turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Droplet impact and splitting behaviour on superhydrophobic wedges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an extensive computational and experimental investigation of droplet impact and subsequent splitting hydrodynamics on superhydrophobic wedges. 2D and necessary 3D simulations using the volume of fluid method, backed with experimentations, have been performed to predict the droplet impact, spreading, split up, retraction against sliding, and daughter droplet lift off events from the SH wedge. In particular, we examine how the wedge angle , wedge asymmetry , Weber number and normalized Bond number influence the post-impact dynamics. We observe that for symmetric wedges, the maximum spread factor of the droplet decreases with an increase in wedge angle at a fixed We. At high wedge angles, the sharp steepness of the wedge causes less contact area for the droplet to spread. For the asymmetric wedges, it has been noted that beta max increases with an increase in the We due to the higher inertial forces of the droplet against sliding. Furthermore, the increases with an increase in Bo at a fixed We due to the dominance of the gravitational force over the capillary force of the droplet. It has been also found that at the same Bo, the increases with an increase in We due to the dominance of inertial forces over the capillary forces. The split volume of daughter droplets during the split up stage for different symmetric and asymmetric wedge angles has been discussed. In general, our 2D simulations agree well with the experiments for a major part of the droplet lifetime. Further, we have conducted a detailed 3D simulation based energy budget analysis to estimate the temporal evolution of the various energy components at different post impact hydrodynamic regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the time-dependent regularized 13-moment equations for general elastic collision models under the linear regime. Detailed derivation shows the proposed equations have super-Burnett order for small Knudsen numbers, and the moment equations enjoy a symmetric structure. A new modification of Onsager boundary conditions is proposed to ensure stability as well as the removal of undesired boundary layers. Numerical examples of one-dimensional channel flows is conducted to verified our model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lubricated motion of an object near a deformable boundary presents striking subtleties arising from the coupling between the elasticity of the boundary and lubricated flow, including but not limited to the emergence of a lift force acting on the object despite the zero Reynolds number. In this study, we characterize the hydrodynamic forces and torques felt by a sphere translating in close proximity to a fluid interface, separating the viscous medium of the sphere's motion from an infinitely-more-viscous medium. We employ lubrication theory and perform a perturbation analysis in capillary compliance. The dominant response of the interface owing to surface tension results in a long-ranged interface deformation, which leads to a modification of the forces and torques with respect to the rigid reference case, that we characterise in details with scaling arguments and numerical integrations.</description>

      <title>The long way of a viscous vortex dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the evolution of a viscous vortex dipole in $R^2$ originating from a pair of point vortices with opposite circulations. At high Reynolds number $Re &gt;&gt; 1$, the dipole can travel a very long way, compared to the distance between the vortex centers, before being slowed down and eventually destroyed by diffusion. In this regime we construct an accurate approximation of the solution in the form of a two-parameter asymptotic expansion involving the aspect ratio of the dipole and the inverse Reynolds number. We then show that the exact solution of the Navier-Stokes equations remains close to the approximation on a time interval of length $O(Re^\sigma)$, where $\sigma &lt; 1$ is arbitrary. This improves upon previous results which were essentially restricted to $\sigma = 0$. As an application, we provide a rigorous justification of an existing formula which gives the leading order correction to the translation speed of the dipole due to finite size effects.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Sound in a Tunable Fermi Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landau's Fermi-liquid (FL) theory has been successful at the phenomenological description of the normal phase of many different Fermi systems. Using a dilute atomic Fermi fluid with tunable interactions, we investigate the microscopic basis of Landau's theory with a system describable from first principles. We study transport properties of an interacting Fermi gas by measuring its density response to a periodic external perturbation. In an ideal Fermi gas, we measure for the first time the celebrated Lindhard function. As the system is brought from the collisionless to the hydrodynamic regime, we observe the emergence of sound, and find that the experimental observations are quantitatively understood with a first-principle transport equation for the FL. When the system is more strongly interacting, we find deviations from such predictions. Finally, we observe the shape of the quasiparticle excitations directly from momentum-space tomography and see how it evolves from the collisionless to the collisional regime. Our study establishes this system as a clean platform for studying Landau's theory of the FL and paves the way for extending the theory to more exotic conditions, such as nonlinear dynamics and FLs with strong correlations in versatile settings.</description>

      <title>Roughness-induced transition and turbulent wedge spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.05323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boundary layer transition triggered by a discrete roughness element generates a turbulent wedge that spreads laterally as it proceeds downstream. Historical literature reports the spreading half angle is approximately 6$^{\circ}$ in zero-pressure gradient flows regardless of Reynolds number and roughness shape. Recent simulations and experiments have sought to explain the lateral-spreading mechanism and have observed high- and low-speed streaks along the flanks of the wedge that appear central to the spreading process. To better elucidate the roles of Reynolds number and of streaks, a naphthalene flow-visualization survey and hotwire measurements are conducted over a wider range of Reynolds numbers and longer streamwise domain than previous experiments. The naphthalene results show that, while the mean spreading angle is consistent with the historical literature, there may be a weak dependency on $x$-based Reynolds number, which emerges as a result of the large sample size of the survey. The distance between the roughness element and the wedge origin exhibits a clear trend with the roughness-height-based Reynolds number. The hotwire measurements explain that this difference originates from whether breakdown occurs first in the central lobe or flanking streaks of the turbulent wedge. This observation highlights different transition dynamics at play within the supercritical regime. In agreement with past experiments, the hotwire measurements reveal that breakdown occurs in the wall normal shear layer above low-speed streaks. Due to the elongated streamwise extent of this experiment, secondary streak dynamics are also uncovered. A high-speed streak is produced directly downstream of the initiating low-speed streak. Subsequently, a new low-speed streak is observed outboard of the previous high-speed streak. This self-sustaining process is the driving mechanism of turbulent wedge spreading.</description>

Abstract: We report on the melting dynamics of frozen olive oil in quiescent water for Rayleigh numbers up to $10^9$. The density difference results in an upward buoyancy-driven flow of liquid oil forming a thin film around the frozen oil. We experimentally investigate flat, cylindrical, and spherical shapes and we derive theoretical expressions for the local film thickness, velocity, and the local melt rate for these three canonical geometries. Our theoretical models compare favourably with our experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Purcell-type microswimmers with active-elastic joints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purcell's planar three-link microswimmer is a classic model of swimming in low-Reynolds-number fluid, inspired by motion of flagellated microorganisms. Many works analyzed this model, assuming that the two joint angles are directly prescribed in phase-shifted periodic inputs. In this work, we study a more realistic scenario by considering an extension of this model which accounts for joints' elasticity and mechanical actuation of periodic torques, so that the joint angles are dynamically evolving. Numerical analysis of the swimmer's dynamics reveals multiplicity of periodic solutions, depending on parameters of the inputs - frequency and amplitude of excitation, joints' stiffness ratio, as well as joint's activation. We numerically study swimming direction reversal, as well as bifurcations, stability transitions, and symmetry breaking of the periodic solutions, which represent the effect of buckling instability observed in swimming microorganisms. The results demonstrate that this variant of Purcell's simple model displays rich nonlinear dynamic behavior with actuated-elastic joints. Similar results are also obtained when studying an extended model of a six-link microswimmer.</description>

      <title>Regimes of stratified turbulence at low Prandtl number</title>

Abstract: Quantifying transport by strongly stratified turbulence in low Prandtl number ($Pr$) fluids is critically important for the development of better models for the structure and evolution of stellar and planetary interiors. Motivated by recent numerical simulations showing strongly anisotropic flows suggestive of scale-separated dynamics, we perform a multiscale asymptotic analysis of the governing equations. We find that, in all cases, the resulting slow-fast systems take a quasilinear form. Our analysis also reveals the existence of several distinct dynamical regimes depending on the emergent buoyancy Reynolds and P\'eclet numbers, $Re_b = \alpha^2 Re$ and $Pe_b = Pr Re_b$, respectively, where $\alpha$ is the aspect ratio of the large-scale turbulent flow structures, and $Re$ is the outer scale Reynolds number. Scaling relationships relating the aspect ratio, the characteristic vertical velocity, and the strength of the stratification (measured by the Froude number $Fr$) naturally emerge from the analysis. When $Pe_b \ll \alpha$, the dynamics at all scales is dominated by buoyancy diffusion, and our results recover the scaling laws empirically obtained from direct numerical simulations by Cope et al. (2020). For $Pe_b \ge O(1)$, diffusion is negligible (or at least subdominant) at all scales and our results are consistent with those of Chini et al. (2022) for strongly stratified geophysical turbulence at $Pr = O(1)$. Finally, we have identified a new regime for $\alpha \ll Pe_b \ll 1$, in which slow, large scales are diffusive while fast, small scales are not. We conclude by presenting a map of parameter space that clearly indicates the transitions between isotropic turbulence, non-diffusive stratified turbulence, diffusive stratified turbulence and viscously-dominated flows, and by proposing parameterisations of the buoyancy flux, mixing efficiency and turbulent diffusion coefficient.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Priors with Application to Boundary Layer Velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most popular recent areas of machine learning predicates the use of neural networks augmented by information about the underlying process in the form of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). These physics-informed neural networks are obtained by penalizing the inference with a PDE, and have been cast as a minimization problem currently lacking a formal approach to quantify the uncertainty. In this work, we propose a novel model-based framework which regards the PDE as a prior information of a deep Bayesian neural network. The prior is calibrated without data to resemble the PDE solution in the prior mean, while our degree in confidence on the PDE with respect to the data is expressed in terms of the prior variance. The information embedded in the PDE is then propagated to the posterior yielding physics-informed forecasts with uncertainty quantification. We apply our approach to a simulated viscous fluid and to experimentally-obtained turbulent boundary layer velocity in a water tunnel using an appropriately simplified Navier-Stokes equation. Our approach requires very few observations to produce physically-consistent forecasts as opposed to non-physical forecasts stemming from non-informed priors, thereby allowing forecasting complex systems where some amount of data as well as some contextual knowledge is available.</description>

      <title>Assessment of models for nonlinear oscillatory flow through a hexagonal sphere pack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review models for unsteady porous media flow in the volume-averaging framework and we discuss the theoretical relations between the models and the definition of the model coefficients (and the uncertainty therein). The different models are compared against direct numerical simulations of oscillatory flow through a hexagonal sphere pack. The model constants are determined based on their definition in terms of the Stokes flow, the potential flow and steady nonlinear flow. Thus, the discrepancies between the model predictions and the simulation data can be attributed to shortcomings of the models' parametrisation.
  We found that an extension of the dynamic permeability model of Pride et al. [Physical Review B 47(9), 1993] with a Forchheimer-type nonlinearity performs very well for linear flow and for nonlinear flow at low and medium frequencies, but the Forchheimer term with a coefficient obtained from the steady-state overpredicts the nonlinear drag at high frequencies. The model reduces to the unsteady Forchheimer equation with an acceleration coefficient based on the static viscous tortuosity for low frequencies.
  The unsteady Forchheimer equation with an acceleration coefficient based on the high frequency limit of the dynamic tortuosity has large errors for linear flow at medium and high frequencies, but low errors for nonlinear flow at all frequencies. This is explained by an error cancellation between the inertial and the nonlinear drag.</description>

      <title>Passive viscous flow selection via fluid-induced buckling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the buckling of a clamped beam immersed in a creeping flow within a rectangular channel. Via a combination of precision experiments, simulations, and theoretical modeling, we show how the instability depends on a pressure feedback mechanism and rationalize it in terms of dimensionless parameters. As the beam can bend until touching the wall above a critical flow rate, we finally demonstrate how the system can be used as a tunable passive flow selector, effectively redirecting the flow within a designed hydraulic circuit.</description>

      <title>Modeling drop deformations and rheology of dilute to dense emulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We highlight the current state-of-the-art in modeling emulsion rheology, ranging from dilute to jammed dense systems. We focus on analytical and numerical methods developed for calculating, computing, and tracking drop deformation en route to developing constitutive models for flowing emulsions. We identify material properties and dimensionless parameters, collate the small deformation theories and resulting expressions for viscometric quantities, list theoretical and numerical methods, and take stock of challenges for capturing connections between drop deformation, morphology, and rheology of emulsions. We highlight the substantial progress in providing quantitative descriptions of the rheological response using analytical theories, dimensional analysis, and powerful computational fluid dynamics to determine how macroscopic rheological properties emerge from microscopic features, including deformation and dynamics of non-interacting or interacting drops and molecular aspects that control the interfacial properties.</description>

      <title>Composite solutions to a liquid bilayer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article continues the research initiated in [17]. We derive explicit formulae for the leading order profiles of eleven types of stationary solutions to a one-dimensional two-layer thin-film liquid model considered with an intermolecular potential depending on both layer heights. The found solutions are composed of the repeated elementary blocks (bulk, contact line and ultra-thin film ones) being consistently asymptotically matched together. We show that once considered on a finite interval with Neumann boundary conditions these stationary solutions are either dynamically stable or weakly translationally unstable. Other composite solutions are found to be numerically unstable and rather exhibit complex coarsening dynamics.</description>
