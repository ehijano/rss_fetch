      <title>Enhanced Prediction of Multi-Agent Trajectories via Control Inference and State-Space Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of autonomous systems, accurately predicting the trajectories of nearby vehicles and pedestrians is crucial for ensuring both safety and operational efficiency. This paper introduces a novel methodology for trajectory forecasting based on state-space dynamic system modeling, which endows agents with models that have tangible physical implications. To enhance the precision of state estimations within the dynamic system, the paper also presents a novel modeling technique for control variables. This technique utilizes a newly introduced model, termed "Mixed Mamba," to derive initial control states, thereby improving the predictive accuracy of these variables. Moverover, the proposed approach ingeniously integrates graph neural networks with state-space models, effectively capturing the complexities of multi-agent interactions. This combination provides a robust and scalable framework for forecasting multi-agent trajectories across a range of scenarios. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that this model outperforms several established benchmarks across various metrics and datasets, highlighting its significant potential to advance trajectory forecasting in autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>One-shot Video Imitation via Parameterized Symbolic Abstraction Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning to manipulate dynamic and deformable objects from a single demonstration video holds great promise in terms of scalability. Previous approaches have predominantly focused on either replaying object relationships or actor trajectories. The former often struggles to generalize across diverse tasks, while the latter suffers from data inefficiency. Moreover, both methodologies encounter challenges in capturing invisible physical attributes, such as forces. In this paper, we propose to interpret video demonstrations through Parameterized Symbolic Abstraction Graphs (PSAG), where nodes represent objects and edges denote relationships between objects. We further ground geometric constraints through simulation to estimate non-geometric, visually imperceptible attributes. The augmented PSAG is then applied in real robot experiments. Our approach has been validated across a range of tasks, such as Cutting Avocado, Cutting Vegetable, Pouring Liquid, Rolling Dough, and Slicing Pizza. We demonstrate successful generalization to novel objects with distinct visual and physical properties.</description>

      <title>Environment-Centric Active Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To handle unintended changes in the environment by agents, we propose an environment-centric active inference EC-AIF in which the Markov Blanket of active inference is defined starting from the environment. In normal active inference, the Markov Blanket is defined starting from the agent. That is, first the agent was defined as the entity that performs the "action" such as a robot or a person, then the environment was defined as other people or objects that are directly affected by the agent's "action," and the boundary between the agent and the environment was defined as the Markov Blanket. This agent-centric definition does not allow the agent to respond to unintended changes in the environment caused by factors outside of the defined environment. In the proposed EC-AIF, there is no entity corresponding to an agent. The environment includes all observable things, including people and things conventionally considered to be the environment, as well as entities that perform "actions" such as robots and people. Accordingly, all states, including robots and people, are included in inference targets, eliminating unintended changes in the environment. The EC-AIF was applied to a robot arm and validated with an object transport task by the robot arm. The results showed that the robot arm successfully transported objects while responding to changes in the target position of the object and to changes in the orientation of another robot arm.</description>

      <title>Courteous MPC for Autonomous Driving with CBF-inspired Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With more autonomous vehicles (AVs) sharing roadways with human-driven vehicles (HVs), ensuring safe and courteous maneuvers that respect HVs' behavior becomes increasingly important. To promote both safety and courtesy in AV's behavior, an extension of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs)-inspired risk evaluation framework is proposed in this paper by considering both noisy observed positions and velocities of surrounding vehicles. The perceived risk by the ego vehicle can be visualized as a risk map that reflects the understanding of the surrounding environment and thus shows the potential for facilitating safe and courteous driving. By incorporating the risk evaluation framework into the Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme, we propose a Courteous MPC for ego AV to generate courteous behaviors that 1) reduce the overall risk imposed on other vehicles and 2) respect the hard safety constraints and the original objective for efficiency. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed Courteous MPC via theoretical analysis and simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Towards Human-Robot Teaming through Augmented Reality and Gaze-Based Attention Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots are now increasingly integrated into various real world applications and domains. In these new domains, robots are mostly employed to improve, in some ways, the work done by humans. So, the need for effective Human-Robot Teaming (HRT) capabilities grows. These capabilities usually involve the dynamic collaboration between humans and robots at different levels of involvement, leveraging the strengths of both to efficiently navigate complex situations. Crucial to this collaboration is the ability of robotic systems to adjust their level of autonomy to match the needs of the task and the human team members.
  This paper introduces a system designed to control attention using HRT through the use of ground robots and augmented reality (AR) technology. Traditional methods of controlling attention, such as pointing, touch, and voice commands, sometimes fall short in precision and subtlety. Our system overcomes these limitations by employing AR headsets to display virtual visual markers. These markers act as dynamic cues to attract and shift human attention seamlessly, irrespective of the robot's physical location.</description>

      <title>SIMPNet: Spatial-Informed Motion Planning Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current robotic manipulators require fast and efficient motion-planning algorithms to operate in cluttered environments. State-of-the-art sampling-based motion planners struggle to scale to high-dimensional configuration spaces and are inefficient in complex environments. This inefficiency arises because these planners utilize either uniform or hand-crafted sampling heuristics within the configuration space. To address these challenges, we present the Spatial-informed Motion Planning Network (SIMPNet). SIMPNet consists of a stochastic graph neural network (GNN)-based sampling heuristic for informed sampling within the configuration space. The sampling heuristic of SIMPNet encodes the workspace embedding into the configuration space through a cross-attention mechanism. It encodes the manipulator's kinematic structure into a graph, which is used to generate informed samples within the framework of sampling-based motion planning algorithms. We have evaluated the performance of SIMPNet using a UR5e robotic manipulator operating within simple and complex workspaces, comparing it against baseline state-of-the-art motion planners. The evaluation results show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed planner compared to the baseline planners.</description>

      <title>Informational Embodiment: Computational role of information structure in codes and robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The body morphology plays an important role in the way information is perceived and processed by an agent. We address an information theory (IT) account on how the precision of sensors, the accuracy of motors, their placement, the body geometry, shape the information structure in robots and computational codes. As an original idea, we envision the robot's body as a physical communication channel through which information is conveyed, in and out, despite intrinsic noise and material limitations. Following this, entropy, a measure of information and uncertainty, can be used to maximize the efficiency of robot design and of algorithmic codes per se. This is known as the principle of Entropy Maximization (PEM) introduced in biology by Barlow in 1969. The Shannon's source coding theorem provides then a framework to compare different types of bodies in terms of sensorimotor information. In line with PME, we introduce a special class of efficient codes used in IT that reached the Shannon limits in terms of information capacity for error correction and robustness against noise, and parsimony. These efficient codes, which exploit insightfully quantization and randomness, permit to deal with uncertainty, redundancy and compacity. These features can be used for perception and control in intelligent systems. In various examples and closing discussions, we reflect on the broader implications of our framework that we called Informational Embodiment to motor theory and bio-inspired robotics, touching upon concepts like motor synergies, reservoir computing, and morphological computation. These insights can contribute to a deeper understanding of how information theory intersects with the embodiment of intelligence in both natural and artificial systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Iterative Value Conversion: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Neurochip-driven Edge Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A neurochip is a device that reproduces the signal processing mechanisms of brain neurons and calculates Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with low power consumption and at high speed. Thus, neurochips are attracting attention from edge robot applications, which suffer from limited battery capacity. This paper aims to achieve deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that acquires SNN policies suitable for neurochip implementation. Since DRL requires a complex function approximation, we focus on conversion techniques from Floating Point NN (FPNN) because it is one of the most feasible SNN techniques. However, DRL requires conversions to SNNs for every policy update to collect the learning samples for a DRL-learning cycle, which updates the FPNN policy and collects the SNN policy samples. Accumulative conversion errors can significantly degrade the performance of the SNN policies. We propose Robust Iterative Value Conversion (RIVC) as a DRL that incorporates conversion error reduction and robustness to conversion errors. To reduce them, FPNN is optimized with the same number of quantization bits as an SNN. The FPNN output is not significantly changed by quantization. To robustify the conversion error, an FPNN policy that is applied with quantization is updated to increase the gap between the probability of selecting the optimal action and other actions. This step prevents unexpected replacements of the policy's optimal actions. We verified RIVC's effectiveness on a neurochip-driven robot. The results showed that RIVC consumed 1/15 times less power and increased the calculation speed by five times more than an edge CPU (quad-core ARM Cortex-A72). The previous framework with no countermeasures against conversion errors failed to train the policies. Videos from our experiments are available: https://youtu.be/Q5Z0-BvK1Tc.</description>

      <title>Identification and validation of the dynamic model of a tendon-driven anthropomorphic finger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the absence of an identification framework to quantify a comprehensive dynamic model of human and anthropomorphic tendon-driven fingers, which is necessary to investigate the physiological properties of human fingers and improve the control of robotic hands. First, a generalized dynamic model was formulated, which takes into account the inherent properties of such a mechanical system. This includes rigid-body dynamics, coupling matrix, joint viscoelasticity, and tendon friction. Then, we propose a methodology comprising a series of experiments, for step-wise identification and validation of this dynamic model. Moreover, an experimental setup was designed and constructed that features actuation modules and peripheral sensors to facilitate the identification process. To verify the proposed methodology, a 3D-printed robotic finger based on the index finger design of the Dexmart hand was developed, and the proposed experiments were executed to identify and validate its dynamic model. This study could be extended to explore the identification of cadaver hands, aiming for a consistent dataset from a single cadaver specimen to improve the development of musculoskeletal hand models.</description>

      <title>cc-DRL: a Convex Combined Deep Reinforcement Learning Flight Control Design for a Morphing Quadrotor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In comparison to common quadrotors, the shape change of morphing quadrotors endows it with a more better flight performance but also results in more complex flight dynamics. Generally, it is extremely difficult or even impossible for morphing quadrotors to establish an accurate mathematical model describing their complex flight dynamics. To figure out the issue of flight control design for morphing quadrotors, this paper resorts to a combination of model-free control techniques (e.g., deep reinforcement learning, DRL) and convex combination (CC) technique, and proposes a convex-combined-DRL (cc-DRL) flight control algorithm for position and attitude of a class of morphing quadrotors, where the shape change is realized by the length variation of four arm rods. In the proposed cc-DRL flight control algorithm, proximal policy optimization algorithm that is a model-free DRL algorithm is utilized to off-line train the corresponding optimal flight control laws for some selected representative arm length modes and hereby a cc-DRL flight control scheme is constructed by the convex combination technique. Finally, simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness and merit of the proposed flight control algorithm.</description>

      <title>Complete Autonomous Robotic Nasopharyngeal Swab System with Evaluation on a Stochastically Moving Phantom Head</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of autonomous robotics to close-contact healthcare tasks has a clear role for the future due to its potential to reduce infection risks to staff and improve clinical efficiency. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab sample collection for diagnosing upper-respiratory illnesses is one type of close contact task that is interesting for robotics due to the dexterity requirements and the unobservability of the nasal cavity. We propose a control system that performs the test using a collaborative manipulator arm with an instrumented end-effector to take visual and force measurements, under the scenario that the patient is unrestrained and the tools are general enough to be applied to other close contact tasks. The system employs a visual servo controller to align the swab with the nostrils. A compliant joint velocity controller inserts the swab along a trajectory optimized through a simulation environment, that also reacts to measured forces applied to the swab. Additional subsystems include a fuzzy logic system for detecting when the swab reaches the nasopharynx and a method for detaching the swab and aborting the procedure if safety criteria is violated. The system is evaluated using a second robotic arm that holds a nasal cavity phantom and simulates the natural head motions that could occur during the procedure. Through extensive experiments, we identify controller configurations capable of effectively performing the NP swab test even with significant head motion, which demonstrates the safety and reliability of the system.</description>

      <title>Do Mistakes Matter? Comparing Trust Responses of Different Age Groups to Errors Made by Physically Assistive Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trust is a key factor in ensuring acceptable human-robot interaction, especially in settings where robots may be assisting with critical activities of daily living. When practically deployed, robots are bound to make occasional mistakes, yet the degree to which these errors will impact a care recipient's trust in the robot, especially in performing physically assistive tasks, remains an open question. To investigate this, we conducted experiments where participants interacted with physically assistive robots which would occasionally make intentional mistakes while performing two different tasks: bathing and feeding. Our study considered the error response of two populations: younger adults at a university (median age 26) and older adults at an independent living facility (median age 83). We observed that the impact of errors on a users' trust in the robot depends on both their age and the task that the robot is performing. We also found that older adults tend to evaluate the robot on factors unrelated to the robot's performance, making their trust in the system more resilient to errors when compared to younger adults. Code and supplementary materials are available on our project webpage.</description>

      <title>Multi-finger Manipulation via Trajectory Optimization with Differentiable Rolling and Geometric Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameterizing finger rolling and finger-object contacts in a differentiable manner is important for formulating dexterous manipulation as a trajectory optimization problem. In contrast to previous methods which often assume simplified geometries of the robot and object or do not explicitly model finger rolling, we propose a method to further extend the capabilities of dexterous manipulation by accounting for non-trivial geometries of both the robot and the object. By integrating the object's Signed Distance Field (SDF) with a sampling method, our method estimates contact and rolling-related variables and includes those in a trajectory optimization framework. This formulation naturally allows for the emergence of finger-rolling behaviors, enabling the robot to locally adjust the contact points. Our method is tested in a peg alignment task and a screwdriver turning task, where it outperforms the baselines in terms of achieving desired object configurations and avoiding dropping the object. We also successfully apply our method to a real-world screwdriver turning task, demonstrating its robustness to the sim2real gap.</description>

      <title>Ten Problems in Geobotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12657v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots sense, move and act in the physical world. It is therefore natural that algorithmic problems in robotics and automation have a geometric component, often central to the problem. Below we review ten challenging problems at the intersection of robotics and computational geometry -- let's call this intersection Geobotics. What is common to most of these problems is that the prevalent algorithmic techniques used in robotics do not seem suitable for solving them, or at least do not suggest quality guarantees for the solution. Solving some of them, even partially, can shed light on less well-understood aspects of computation in robotics.</description>

Abstract: Category-level object pose and shape estimation from a single depth image has recently drawn research attention due to its wide applications in robotics and self-driving. The task is particularly challenging because the three unknowns, object pose, object shape, and model-to-measurement correspondences, are compounded together but only a single view of depth measurements is provided. The vast majority of the prior work heavily relies on data-driven approaches to obtain solutions to at least one of the unknowns and typically two, running with the risk of failing to generalize to unseen domains. The shape representations used in the prior work also mainly focus on point cloud and signed distance field (SDF). In stark contrast to the prior work, we approach the problem using an iterative estimation method that does not require learning from any pose-annotated data. In addition, we adopt a novel mesh-based object active shape model that has not been explored by the previous literature. Our algorithm, named ShapeICP, has its foundation in the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm but is equipped with additional features for the category-level pose and shape estimation task. The results show that even without using any pose-annotated data, ShapeICP surpasses many data-driven approaches that rely on the pose data for training, opening up new solution space for researchers to consider.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Reinforcement Learning for Robots Collaborating with Humans</title>

Abstract: Robot assistants for older adults and people with disabilities need to interact with their users in collaborative tasks. The core component of these systems is an interaction manager whose job is to observe and assess the task, and infer the state of the human and their intent to choose the best course of action for the robot. Due to the sparseness of the data in this domain, the policy for such multi-modal systems is often crafted by hand; as the complexity of interactions grows this process is not scalable. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to learn the robot policy. In contrast to the dialog systems, our agent is trained with a simulator developed by using human data and can deal with multiple modalities such as language and physical actions. We conducted a human study to evaluate the performance of the system in the interaction with a user. Our designed system shows promising preliminary results when it is used by a real user.</description>

      <title>Field Testing of a Stochastic Planner for ASV Navigation Using Satellite Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a multi-sensor navigation system for autonomous surface vessels (ASV) intended for water-quality monitoring in freshwater lakes. Our mission planner uses satellite imagery as a prior map, formulating offline a mission-level policy for global navigation of the ASV and enabling autonomous online execution via local perception and local planning modules. A significant challenge is posed by the inconsistencies in traversability estimation between satellite images and real lakes, due to environmental effects such as wind, aquatic vegetation, shallow waters, and fluctuating water levels. Hence, we specifically modelled these traversability uncertainties as stochastic edges in a graph and optimized for a mission-level policy that minimizes the expected total travel distance. To execute the policy, we propose a modern local planner architecture that processes sensor inputs and plans paths to execute the high-level policy under uncertain traversability conditions. Our system was tested on three km-scale missions on a Northern Ontario lake, demonstrating that our GPS-, vision-, and sonar-enabled ASV system can effectively execute the mission-level policy and disambiguate the traversability of stochastic edges. Finally, we provide insights gained from practical field experience and offer several future directions to enhance the overall reliability of ASV navigation systems.</description>

      <title>AirPilot: A PPO-based DRL Auto-Tuned Nonlinear PID Drone Controller for Robust Autonomous Flights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Navigation precision, speed and stability are crucial for safe Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flight maneuvers and effective flight mission executions in dynamic environments. Different flight missions may have varying objectives, such as minimizing energy consumption, achieving precise positioning, or maximizing speed. A controller that can adapt to different objectives on the fly is highly valuable. Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controllers are one of the most popular and widely used control algorithms for drones and other control systems, but their linear control algorithm fails to capture the nonlinear nature of the dynamic wind conditions and complex drone system. Manually tuning the PID gains for various missions can be time-consuming and requires significant expertise. This paper aims to revolutionize drone flight control by presenting the AirPilot, a nonlinear Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) - enhanced Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) drone controller using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). AirPilot controller combines the simplicity and effectiveness of traditional PID control with the adaptability, learning capability, and optimization potential of DRL. This makes it better suited for modern drone applications where the environment is dynamic, and mission-specific performance demands are high. We employed a COEX Clover autonomous drone for training the DRL agent within the simulator and implemented it in a real-world lab setting, which marks a significant milestone as one of the first attempts to apply a DRL-based flight controller on an actual drone. Airpilot is capable of reducing the navigation error of the default PX4 PID position controller by 90%, improving effective navigation speed of a fine-tuned PID controller by 21%, reducing settling time and overshoot by 17% and 16% respectively.</description>

      <title>PreAfford: Universal Affordance-Based Pre-Grasping for Diverse Objects and Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation with two-finger grippers is challenged by objects lacking distinct graspable features. Traditional pre-grasping methods, which typically involve repositioning objects or utilizing external aids like table edges, are limited in their adaptability across different object categories and environments. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PreAfford, a novel pre-grasping planning framework incorporating a point-level affordance representation and a relay training approach. Our method significantly improves adaptability, allowing effective manipulation across a wide range of environments and object types. When evaluated on the ShapeNet-v2 dataset, PreAfford not only enhances grasping success rates by 69% but also demonstrates its practicality through successful real-world experiments. These improvements highlight PreAfford's potential to redefine standards for robotic handling of complex manipulation tasks in diverse settings.</description>

      <title>Servo Integrated Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Overactuated Tiltable-Quadrotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing a servo to tilt each rotor transforms quadrotors from underactuated to overactuated systems, allowing for independent control of both attitude and position, which provides advantages for aerial manipulation. However, this enhancement also introduces model nonlinearity, sluggish servo response, and limited operational range into the system, posing challenges to dynamic control. In this study, we propose a control approach for tiltable-quadrotors based on nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). Unlike conventional cascade methods, our approach preserves the full dynamics without simplification. It directly uses rotor thrust and servo angle as control inputs, where their limited working ranges are considered input constraints. Notably, we incorporate a first-order servo model within the NMPC framework. Simulation reveals that integrating the servo dynamics is not only an enhancement to control performance but also a critical factor for optimization convergence. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we fabricate a tiltable-quadrotor and deploy the algorithm onboard at 100 Hz. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate rapid, robust, and smooth pose-tracking performance.</description>

      <title>"Golden Ratio Yoshimura" for Meta-Stable and Massively Reconfigurable Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Yoshimura origami is a classical folding pattern that has inspired many deployable structure designs. Its applications span from space exploration, kinetic architectures, and soft robots to even everyday household items. However, despite its wide usage, Yoshimura has been fixated on a set of design constraints to ensure its flat-foldability. Through extensive kinematic analysis and prototype tests, this study presents a new Yoshimura that intentionally defies these constraints. Remarkably, one can impart a unique meta-stability by using the Golden Ratio angle to define the triangular facets of a generalized Yoshimura. As a result, when its facets are strategically popped out, a ``Golden Ratio Yoshimura'' boom with $m$ modules can be theoretically reconfigured into $8^m$ geometrically unique and load-bearing shapes. This result not only challenges the existing design norms but also opens up a new avenue to create deployable and versatile structural systems.</description>

      <title>Tactile-Morph Skills: Energy-Based Control Meets Data-Driven Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation is essential for modernizing factories and automating industrial tasks like polishing, which require advanced tactile abilities. These robots must be easily set up, safely work with humans, learn tasks autonomously, and transfer skills to similar tasks. Addressing these needs, we introduce the tactile-morph skill framework, which integrates unified force-impedance control with data-driven learning. Our system adjusts robot movements and force application based on estimated energy levels for the desired trajectory and force profile, ensuring safety by stopping if energy allocated for the control runs out. Using a Temporal Convolutional Network, we estimate the energy distribution for a given motion and force profile, enabling skill transfer across different tasks and surfaces. Our approach maintains stability and performance even on unfamiliar geometries with similar friction characteristics, demonstrating improved accuracy, zero-shot transferable performance, and enhanced safety in real-world scenarios. This framework promises to enhance robotic capabilities in industrial settings, making intelligent robots more accessible and valuable.</description>

      <title>iMTSP: Solving Min-Max Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem with Imperative Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00285v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a Min-Max Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP), where the goal is to find a set of tours, one for each agent, to collectively visit all the cities while minimizing the length of the longest tour. Though MTSP has been widely studied, obtaining near-optimal solutions for large-scale problems is still challenging due to its NP-hardness. Recent efforts in data-driven methods face challenges of the need for hard-to-obtain supervision and issues with high variance in gradient estimations, leading to slow convergence and highly suboptimal solutions. We address these issues by reformulating MTSP as a bilevel optimization problem, using the concept of imperative learning (IL). This involves introducing an allocation network that decomposes the MTSP into multiple single-agent traveling salesman problems (TSPs). The longest tour from these TSP solutions is then used to self-supervise the allocation network, resulting in a new self-supervised, bilevel, end-to-end learning framework, which we refer to as imperative MTSP (iMTSP). Additionally, to tackle the high-variance gradient issues during the optimization, we introduce a control variate-based gradient estimation algorithm. Our experiments showed that these innovative designs enable our gradient estimator to converge 20% faster than the advanced reinforcement learning baseline and find up to 80% shorter tour length compared with Google OR-Tools MTSP solver, especially in large-scale problems (e.g. 1000 cities and 15 agents).</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Consensus-Based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Robot Cooperation Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), the Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) framework is pivotal but struggles due to a gap: global state guidance in training versus reliance on local observations in execution, lacking global signals. Inspired by human societal consensus mechanisms, we introduce the Hierarchical Consensus-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HC-MARL) framework to address this limitation. HC-MARL employs contrastive learning to foster a global consensus among agents, enabling cooperative behavior without direct communication. This approach enables agents to form a global consensus from local observations, using it as an additional piece of information to guide collaborative actions during execution. To cater to the dynamic requirements of various tasks, consensus is divided into multiple layers, encompassing both short-term and long-term considerations. Short-term observations prompt the creation of an immediate, low-layer consensus, while long-term observations contribute to the formation of a strategic, high-layer consensus. This process is further refined through an adaptive attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts the influence of each consensus layer. This mechanism optimizes the balance between immediate reactions and strategic planning, tailoring it to the specific demands of the task at hand. Extensive experiments and real-world applications in multi-robot systems showcase our framework's superior performance, marking significant advancements over baselines.</description>

      <title>Solving Robotics Problems in Zero-Shot with Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Wonderful Team, a multi-agent visual LLM (VLLM) framework for solving robotics problems in the zero-shot regime. By zero-shot we mean that, for a novel environment, we feed a VLLM an image of the robot's environment and a description of the task, and have the VLLM output the sequence of actions necessary for the robot to complete the task. Prior work on VLLMs in robotics has largely focused on settings where some part of the pipeline is fine-tuned, such as tuning an LLM on robot data or training a separate vision encoder for perception and action generation. Surprisingly, due to recent advances in the capabilities of VLLMs, this type of fine-tuning may no longer be necessary for many tasks. In this work, we show that with careful engineering, we can prompt a single off-the-shelf VLLM to handle all aspects of a robotics task, from high-level planning to low-level location-extraction and action-execution. Wonderful Team builds on recent advances in multi-agent LLMs to partition tasks across an agent hierarchy, making it self-corrective and able to effectively partition and solve even long-horizon tasks. Extensive experiments on VIMABench and real-world robotic environments demonstrate the system's capability to handle a variety of robotic tasks, including manipulation, visual goal-reaching, and visual reasoning, all in a zero-shot manner. These results underscore a key point: vision-language models have progressed rapidly in the past year, and should strongly be considered as a backbone for robotics problems going forward.</description>
