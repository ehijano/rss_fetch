      <title>Superuniversal Statistics of Complex Time-Delays in Non-Hermitian Scattering Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wigner-Smith time-delay of flux conserving systems is a real quantity that measures how long an excitation resides in an interaction region. The complex generalization of time-delay to non-Hermitian systems is still under development, in particular, its statistical properties in the short-wavelength limit of complex chaotic scattering systems has not been investigated. From the experimentally measured multi-port scattering ($S$)-matrices of one-dimensional graphs, a two-dimensional billiard, and a three-dimensional cavity, we calculate the complex Wigner-Smith ($\tau_{WS}$), as well as each individual reflection ($\tau_{xx}$) and transmission ($\tau_{xy}$) time-delays. The complex reflection time-delay differences ($\tau_{\delta R}$) between each port are calculated, and the transmission time-delay differences ($\tau_{\delta T}$) are introduced for systems exhibiting non-reciprocal scattering. Large time-delays are associated with coherent perfect absorption, reflectionless scattering, slow light, and uni-directional invisibility. We demonstrate that the large-delay tails of the distributions of the real and imaginary parts of each of these time-delay quantities are superuniversal, independent of experimental parameters: uniform attenuation $\eta$, number of scattering channels $M$, wave propagation dimension $\mathcal{D}$, and Dyson symmetry class $\beta$. This superuniversality is in direct contrast with the well-established time-delay statistics of unitary scattering systems, where the tail of the $\tau_{WS}$ distribution depends explicitly on the values of $M$ and $\beta$. Due to the direct analogy of the wave equations, the time-delay statistics described in this paper are applicable to any non-Hermitian wave-chaotic scattering system in the short-wavelength limit, such as quantum graphs, electromagnetic, optical and acoustic resonators, etc.</description>

      <title>Non-linearity and chaos in the kicked top</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical chaos arises from the inherent non-linearity of dynamical systems. However, quantum maps are linear; therefore, the definition of chaos is not straightforward. To address this, we study a quantum system that exhibits chaotic behavior in its classical limit: the kicked top model, whose classical dynamics are governed by Hamilton's equations on phase space, whereas its quantum dynamics are described by the Schr\"odinger equation in Hilbert space. We explore the critical degree of non-linearity signifying the onset of chaos in the kicked top by modifying the original Hamiltonian so that the non-linearity is parametrized by a quantity $p$. We find two distinct behaviors of the modified kicked top depending on the value of $p$. Chaos intensifies as $p$ varies within the range of $1\leq p \leq 2$, whereas it diminishes for $p &gt; 2$, eventually transitioning to a purely regular oscillating system as $p$ tends to infinity. We also comment on the complicated phase space structure for non-chaotic dynamics. Our investigation sheds light on the relationship between non-linearity and chaos in classical systems, offering insights into their dynamic behavior.</description>

      <title>Multi-winged Lorenz attractors due to bifurcations of a periodic orbit with multipliers $(-1,i,-i)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that bifurcations of periodic orbits with multipliers $(-1,i,-i)$ can lead to the birth of pseudohyperbolic (i.e., robustly chaotic) Lorenz-like attractors of three different types: one is a discrete analogue of the classical Lorenz attractor, and the other two are new. We call them two- and four-winged ``Sim\'o angels''. These three attractors exist in an orientation-reversing, three-dimensional, quadratic H\'enon map. Our analysis is based on a numerical study of a normal form for this bifurcation, a three-dimensional system of differential equations with a Z4-symmetry. We investigate bifurcations in the normal form and describe those responsible for the emergence of the Lorenz attractor and the continuous-time version of the Simo angels. Both for the normal form and the 3D H\'enon map, we have found open regions in the parameter space where the attractors are pseudohyperbolic, implying that for every parameter value from these regions every orbit in the attractor has positive top Lyapunov exponent.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Propagation of Non-Gaussian Uncertainties: Theory and Applications to Spacecraft Trajectory Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for propagating uncertainties in dynamical systems building on high-order Taylor expansions of the flow and moment-generating functions (MGFs). Unlike prior methods that focus on Gaussian distributions, our approach leverages the relationship between MGFs and distribution moments to extend high-order uncertainty propagation techniques to non-Gaussian scenarios. This significantly broadens the applicability of these methods to a wider range of problems and uncertainty types. High-order moment computations are performed one-off and symbolically, reducing the computational burden of the technique to the calculation of Taylor series coefficients around a nominal trajectory, achieved by efficiently integrating the system's variational equations. Furthermore, the use of the proposed approach in combination with event transition tensors, allows for accurate propagation of uncertainties at specific events, such as the landing surface of a celestial body, the crossing of a predefined Poincar\'e section, or the trigger of an arbitrary event during the propagation. Via numerical simulations we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various astrodynamics applications, including the unperturbed and perturbed two-body problem, and the circular restricted three-body problem, showing that it accurately propagates non-Gaussian uncertainties both at future times and at event manifolds.</description>

      <title>Complexity of two-level systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complexity of two-level systems, e.g. spins, qubits, magnetic moments etc, are analysed based on the so-called correlational entropy in the case of pure quantum systems and the thermal entropy in case of thermal equilibrium that are suitable quantities essentially free from basis dependence. The complexity is defined as the difference between the Shannon-entropy and the second order R\'enyi-entropy, where the latter is connected to the traditional participation measure or purity. It is shown that the system attains maximal complexity for special choice of control parameters, i.e. strength of disorder either in the presence of noise of the energy states or the presence of disorder in the off diagonal coupling. It is shown that such a noise or disorder dependence provides a basis free analysis and gives meaningful insights. We also look at similar entropic complexity of spins in thermal equilibrium for a paramagnet at finite temperature, $T$ and magnetic field $B$, as well as the case of an Ising model in the mean-field approximation. As a result all examples provide important evidence that the investigation of the entropic complexity parameters help to get deeper understanding in the behavior of these systems.</description>

      <title>Momentum dependent quantum Ruelle-Pollicott resonances in translationally invariant many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Ruelle-Pollicott resonances in translationally invariant quantum many-body systems via spectra of momentum-resolved operator propagator on infinite systems. Momentum dependence gives insight into decay of correlation functions, showing that, depending on their symmetries, different correlation functions in general decay with different rates. Focusing on the kicked Ising model the spectrum seems to be typically composed of an annular random matrix like ring whose size we theoretically predict, and few isolated resonances. We identify several interesting regimes, including a mixing regime with a power-law decay of correlation functions. In that regime we also observe a huge difference in time-scales of different correlation functions. An exact expression for the singular values of the operator propagator is conjectured, showing that it becomes singular at a special point.</description>

      <title>Interacting internal waves explain global patterns of interior ocean mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Across the stable density stratification of the abyssal ocean, deep dense water is slowly propelled upward by sustained, though irregular, turbulent mixing. The resulting mean upwelling determines large-scale oceanic circulation properties like heat and carbon transport. In the ocean interior, this turbulent mixing is caused mainly by breaking internal waves: generated predominantly by winds and tides, these waves interact nonlinearly, transferring energy downscale, and finally become unstable, break and mix the water column. This paradigm, long parameterized heuristically, still lacks full theoretical explanation. Here, we close this gap using wave-wave interaction theory with input from both localized and global observations. We find near-ubiquitous agreement between first-principle predictions and observed mixing patterns in the global ocean interior. Our findings lay the foundations for a wave-driven mixing parameterization for ocean general circulation models that is entirely physics-based, which is key to reliably represent future climate states that could differ substantially from today's.</description>

      <title>Mean field coupled dynamical systems: Bifurcations and phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a bifurcation theory for infinite dimensional systems satisfying abstract hypotheses that are tailored for applications to mean field coupled chaotic maps. Our abstract theory can be applied to many cases, from globally coupled expanding maps to globally coupled Axiom A diffeomorphisms. To illustrate the range of applicability, we analyze an explicit example consisting of globally coupled Anosov diffeomorphisms. For such an example, we classify all the invariant measures as the coupling strength varies; we show which invariant measures are physical, and we prove that the existence of multiple invariant physical measures is a purely infinite dimensional phenomenon, i.e., the model exhibits phase transitions in the sense of statistical mechanics.</description>
