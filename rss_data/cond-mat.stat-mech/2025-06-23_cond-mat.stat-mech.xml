      <title>Finite time path field theory and a new type of universal quantum spin chain quench behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss different quench protocols for Ising and XY spin chains in a transverse magnetic field. With a sudden local magnetic field quench as a starting point, we generalize our approach to a large class of local non-sudden quenches. Using finite time path field theory perturbative methods, we show that the difference between the sudden quench and a class of quenches with non-sudden switching on the perturbation vanishes exponentially with time, apart from non-substantial modifications that are systematically accounted for. As the consequence of causality and analytic properties of functions describing the discussed class of quenches, this is true at any order of perturbation expansion and thus for the resummed perturbation series. The only requirements on functions describing the perturbation strength switched on at a finite time t=0 are: (1) their Fourier transform f(p) is a function that is analytic everywhere in the lower complex semiplane, except at the simple pole at p=0 and possibly others with Im (p) &lt; 0, and (2) that f(p)/p converges to zero at infinity in the lower complex semiplane. Prototypical function of this class is tanh(eta t), to which the perturbation strength is proportional after the switching on time t=0. In the limit of large eta, such a perturbation approaches the case of a sudden quench. It is shown that, because of this new type of universal behaviour of Loschmidt echo that emerges in exponentially short time scale, our previous results (Kui\'c, D. et al. Universe 2024, 10, 384) for the sudden local magnetic field quench of Ising and XY chains, obtained by resummation of the perturbative expansion, extend in the long time limit to all non-sudden quench protocols in this class, with non-substantial modifications systematically taken into account. We also show that analogous universal behaviour exists in disorder quenches, and ultimately global ones.</description>

      <title>The free propagator of strongly anisotropic systems with free surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A brief overview of fluctuation-induced forces in statistical systems with film geometry at the critical point and the calculation of Casimir amplitudes, which characterize these forces quantitatively, is presented. Particular attention is paid to the special features of strongly anisotropic $m$-axis systems at the Lifshitz point, specifically, in the case of a "$perpendicular$" orientation of surfaces with free boundary conditions. Beyond the simplest one-loop approximation, calculations of Casimir amplitudes are impossible without knowledge of the Gaussian propagator, which corresponds to the lines of Feynman diagrams in the perturbation theory. We present an explicit expression for such a propagator in the case of an anisotropic system confined by parallel surfaces $perpendicular$ to one of the anisotropy axes. Using this propagator, we reproduce the one-loop result derived earlier in an essentially different way. The knowledge of the propagator provides the possibility of higher-order calculations in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Wealth Thermalization Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the wealth thermalization hypothesis according to which the wealth shared in a country or the whole world is described by the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution with two conserved quantities of system wealth and norm or number of agents. This distribution depends on a dimensional parameter being the ratio of system total wealth and its dispersion range determined by highest revenues. At relatively small values of this ratio there is a formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, well studied in such physical systems as multimode optical fibers. This leads to a huge fraction of poor households and a small oligarchic fraction which monopolizes a dominant fraction of total wealth thus generating a strong inequality in human society. We show that this thermalization gives a good description of real data of Lorenz curves of US, UK, the whole world and capitalization of S\&amp;P500 companies at New York Stock Exchange. Possible actions for inequality reduction are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Non-algebraic first return probability of a stretched random walk near a convex boundary and its effect on adsorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $N$-step random walk, stretched in the vicinity of a disc (in 2D) or a sphere (in 3D) of radius $R$, demonstrates a non-algebraic stretched exponential decay $P_N\sim \exp\left(-{\rm const}\, N^{1/3}\right)$ for the first return probability $P_N$ in the double-scaling limit $N=\frac{L}{a}\gg 1, \frac{R}{a}\gg 1$ conditioned that $\frac{L}{R}=c={\rm const}$. Stretching means that the length of the walk, $L=Na$ (where $a$ is the unit step length) satisfies the condition $L = cR$, where $c &gt; \pi$. Both analytic and numerical evidences of the non-algebraic behavior of $P_N$ are provided. Considering the model of a polymer loop stretched ("inflated") by external force, we show that non-algebraic behavior of $P_N$ affects the adsorption of a polymer at the boundary of a sticky disc in 2D, manifesting in a first order localization transition.</description>

      <title>An Extended Model of Fractional-Dimensional Space for Anisotropic Solids with Deformed Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we extend a fractional-dimensional space model for anisotropic solids by incorporating a q-deformed derivative operator, inspired by Tsallis' nonadditive entropy framework. This generalization provides an analytical framework for exploring anisotropic thermal properties, within a unified and flexible mathematical formalism. We derive modified expressions for the phonon density of states and specific heat capacity, highlighting the impact of the deformation parameters on thermodynamic behavior. We apply the model to various solid-state materials, achieving excellent agreement with experimental data, across a wide temperature range and demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing anisotropic and subextensive effects in real systems.</description>

      <title>Two dimensional Coulomb gas in a non-conservative trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium steady state of a two dimensional Coulomb gas under the action of an anisotropic harmonic trapping potential along with a non-conservative rotational force. In the case without rotation, the equilibrium (zero temperature) steady state has a uniform density supported over a a static elliptical droplet. The addition of a rotational force drives the system into a nonequilibrium steady state where the density is still uniform inside an ellipse, but the ellipse gets tilted by a a fixed angle compared to the non-rotational case. In addition, a nonzero current is generated inside the droplet which run concentrically to the droplet boundary. For large rotational force, the droplet develops a purely circular form. Our results are predicted by a simple hydrodynamic calculation and are confirmed by numerical simulations and provide a full understanding of a novel driven non-equilibrium state in a strongly interacting system.</description>

      <title>Stability of universal properties against perturbations of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the stability of universal properties at continuous phase transitions against perturbations of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm used to simulate the system. We consider the three dimensional XY model as test bed, and both local (single site Metropolis) and global (single cluster) updates, introducing deterministic truncation-like perturbations and stochastic perturbations in the acceptance probabilities. In (almost) all the cases we find a remarkable stability of the universal properties, even against large perturbations of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, with critical exponents and scaling curves consistent with those of the standard XY model within statistical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium orders in parametrically driven field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driving quantum materials with coherent light has proven a powerful platform to realize a plethora of interesting phases and transitions, ranging from ferroelectricity to superconductivity and limit cycles in pumped magnonics. In this paper we develop the field theoretical framework to describe nonequilibrium phases that emerge in systems pumped by rapid parametric drives. We consider paradigmatic O(N) models that describe the long-wavelength fluctuations of ordering fields in many condensed matter set ups. We show that rapid parametric driving of these models can induce an effective pump mechanism in the long wavelength regime through nonlinear scattering. This induces a nonequilibrium transition into a time-crystalline phase.</description>

      <title>Weyl's Relations, Integrable Matrix Models and Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from a generalization of Weyl's relations in finite dimension $N$, we show that the Heisenberg commutation relations can be satisfied in a specific $N-1$ dimensional subspace, and display a linear map for projecting operators to this subspace. This setup is used to construct a hierarchy of parameter-dependent commuting matrices in $N$ dimensions. This family of commuting matrices is then related to Type-1 matrices representing quantum integrable models. The commuting matrices find an interesting application in quantum computation, specifically in Grover's database search problem. Each member of the hierarchy serves as a candidate Hamiltonian for quantum adiabatic evolution and, in some cases, achieves higher fidelity than standard choices -- thus offering improved performance.</description>

      <title>Coupled Entropy: A Goldilocks Generalization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics (NSM) has developed into a powerful toolset for modeling and analyzing complex systems. Despite its many successes, a puzzle arose early in its development. The constraints on the Tsallis entropy are in the form of an escort distribution with elements proportional to $p_i^q$, but this same factor within the Tsallis entropy function is not normalized. This led to consideration of the Normalized Tsallis Entropy (NTE); however, the normalization proved to make the function unstable. I will provide evidence that the coupled entropy, which divides NTE by $1 + d\kappa$, where $d$ is the dimension and $\kappa$ is the coupling, may provide the necessary robustness necessary for applications like machine learning. The definition for the coupled entropy and its maximizing distributions, the coupled exponential family, arises from clarifying how the number of independent random variables $(q)$ is composed of the nonlinear properties of complex systems, $q=1+\frac{\alpha\kappa}{1+d\kappa}$, where $\alpha$ is the nonlinear parameter governing the shape of distributions near their location and $\kappa$ is the parameter determining the asymptotic tail decay. Foundationally, for complex systems, the coupling is the measure of nonlinearity inducing non-exponential distributions and the degree of nonadditivity entropy. As such, the coupling is a strong candidate as a measure of statistical complexity.</description>

      <title>Specific-heat anomaly in frustrated magnets with vacancy defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by frustrated magnets and spin-liquid-candidate materials, we study the thermodynamics of a 2D geometrically frustrating magnet with vacancy defects. The presence of vacancies imposes constraints on the bulk spins, which freezes some of the degrees of freedom in the system at low temperatures. With increasing temperature, these constraints get relaxed, resulting in an increase in the system's entropy. This leads to the emergence of a peak in the heat capacity $C(T)$ of the magnet at a temperature determined by the concentration of the vacancy defects. To illustrate the emergence of such an anomaly, we compute analytically the heat capacity of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) Ising model on the triangular lattice with vacancy defects. The presence of the vacancy leads to a peak in $C(T)$ at the temperature $T_\text{imp}=-6J/\ln n_\text{imp}$, where $J$ is the AFM coupling between the spins and $n_\text{imp}$ is the fraction of the missing sites.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Hysteresis Experiments Performed on Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealers have emerged as versatile and controllable platforms for experimenting on exotic spin systems that model quantum materials. However, quantum annealing experiments have yet to explore magnetic memory and hysteresis, features seemingly at odds with hardware designed to escape metastable states via quantum tunneling, favoring forgetfulness. Here, we present a general protocol to experiment on magnetic hysteresis in a transverse-field Ising model. We implement it on three D-Wave superconducting flux qubit annealers, using up to thousands of spins, and explore both ferromagnetic and disordered Ising models across contrasting graph topologies. Crucially, we observe robust memory retention in hysteresis loops, establishing quantum annealers as a platform for probing non-equilibrium emergent magnetic phenomena. This approach enables many topics of future exploration including return point memory and hysteresis in frustrated or topologically ordered systems, thus broadening the role of analog quantum computers into foundational questions in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Sedimentation equilibrium as a probe of the pressure equation of state of active colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical and computational framework for extracting the pressure equation of state (EoS) of an active suspension from its steady-state sedimentation profile. As EoSs are prerequisites for many theories in active matter, determining how pressure depends on key parameters such as density, activity, and interparticle interactions is essential to make quantitative predictions relevant to materials design and engineering applications. Focusing on the one-dimensional active Brownian particle (1D-ABP) model, we show that the pressure measured in a homogeneous periodic system can be recovered from the spatial profiles established in sedimentation equilibrium. Our approach is based on exact mechanical considerations and provides a direct route for determining pressure from experimentally measurable quantities. This work compares sedimentation-derived equations of state with those obtained from periodic simulations, establishing a foundation for using sedimentation as a generic tool to characterize the behavior of active suspensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Why are human societies unstable? Theories based on the observation of recurring patterns in historical data indicate that economic inequality, as well as social factors are key drivers. So far, models of this phenomenon are more macroscopic in nature. However, basic mechanisms at work could be accessible to minimal mathematical models. Here we combine a simple mechanism for economic growth with a mechanism for the spreading of social dissatisfaction. Broad wealth distributions generated by the economic mechanism eventually trigger social unrest and the destruction of wealth, leading to an emerging pattern of boom and bust. We find that the model time scales compare well with empirical data. The model emphasizes the role of broad (power law) wealth distributions for dynamical social phenomena.</description>

      <title>Mechanical inhibition of dissipation in a thermodynamically consistent active solid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of active solids offers a window into the mechanics and thermodynamics of dense living matter. A key aspect of the non-equilibrium dynamics of such active systems is a mechanistic description of how the underlying mechano-chemical couplings arise, which cannot be resolved in models that are phenomenologically constructed. Here, we follow a bottom-up theoretical approach to develop a thermodynamically consistent active solid (TCAS) model, and uncover a non-trivial cross-talk that naturally ensues between mechanical response and dissipation. In particular, we show that dissipation reaches a maximum at finite stresses, while it is inhibited under large stresses, effectively reverting the system to a passive state. Our findings establish a mechanism potentially responsible for the non-monotonic behaviour observed in recent experimental measurements of entropy production rate in an actomyosin material.</description>

      <title>Thermal Uhlmann-Chern Number: Bridging Pure and Mixed States</title>

Abstract: Topological properties of quantum systems at finite temperatures, described by mixed states, pose significant challenges due to the triviality of the Uhlmann bundle. We introduce the thermal Uhlmann-Chern number, a generalization of the Chern number, to characterize the topological properties of mixed states. By inserting the density matrix into the Chern character, we introduce the thermal Uhlmann-Chern number, a generalization of the Chern number that reduces to the pure-state value in the zero-temperature limit and vanishes at infinite temperature, providing a framework to study the temperature-dependent evolution of topological features in mixed states. We provide, for the first time, a rigorous mathematical proof that the first- and higher-order Uhlmann-Chern numbers converge to the corresponding Chern numbers in the zero-temperature limit, differing only by a factor of $1/D$ for $D$-fold degenerate ground states. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through applications to a two-level system, the coherent state model, the 2D Haldane model, and a four-band model, highlighting the temperature-dependent behavior of topological invariants. Our results establish a robust bridge between the topological properties of pure and mixed states, offering new insights into finite-temperature topological phases.</description>

      <title>Measurement induced scrambling and emergent symmetries in random circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is affected by unitary evolution, which spreads the entanglement through the whole system, and also by measurements, which usually tends to disentangle subsystems from the rest. Their competition has been known to result in the measurement-induced phase transition. But more intriguingly, measurement alone has the ability to drive a system into different entanglement phases. In this work, we map the entanglement evolution under unitaries and/or measurements into a classical spin problem. This framework is used to understand a myriad of random circuit models analytically, including measurement-induced and measurement-only transitions. Regarding many-body joint measurements, a lower bound of measurement range that is necessary for a global scrambled phase is derived. Moreover, emergent continuous symmetries (U(1) or SU(2)) are discovered in some random measurement models in the large-$d$ (qudit dimension) limit. The emergent continuous symmetry allows a variety of spin dynamics phenomena to find their counterparts in random circuit models.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Gibbs measures of disordered crystals up to the solid-liquid phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the configuration space and the Gibbs measure of thermally disordered condensed matter systems has been a long standing problem. The challenge is to avoid the Gibbs paradox, which forbids any ordering or labeling of the atoms. Our key observation is that the lattice of a thermally disordered condensed matter system, in either solid, liquid or gas phase, can be fully reconstructed from the Voronoi cells of the atoms alone, even if these Voronoi cells are disassembled and randomly scrambled. In the example of the crystalline phase of silicon, the statistics of the Voronoi cells reveals the existence of four, and only four, large facets that are present with probability one for all temperatures up to the solid-liquid melting line. These four largest facets, which separate nearest-neighboring atoms, can be also be used to reconstruct the lattice of the crystal. Hence, their collection supplies the optimal representation of the configuration of the crystal. We conjecture that the existence of Voronoi facets that, despite their large thermal fluctuations, survive with probability one up to the melting temperature, is the fundamental signature of the crystalline solid phase and therefore key to quantifying the Gibbs measure over the entire solid phase.</description>

      <title>Doping-induced Polyamorphic Transitions in Fluorite Oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorite oxides such as HfO$_2$ exhibit rich and tunable phase behavior, making them promising candidates for next generation electronic devices. A key challenge is to design amorphous HfO$_2$-based high-$k$ materials with both structural and performance stability. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations supported by experimental measurements, we reveal that Ba doping stimulates a polyamorphic transition in HfO$_2$, yielding a semi-ordered amorphous (SA) phase characterized by disordered oxygens embedded within an ordered metal sublattice. We find that this phase arises from degenerate short-range symmetry breaking modes, consistent with Pauling's parsimony rule. Notably, the SA structure is thermodynamically stable and displays a wider bandgap and higher dielectric constant than conventional random-packing amorphous structure, owing to suppressed subgap states and increased Born effective charges. We further demonstrate that this structural motif generalizes to Ba-, Sr-, and Ca-doped HfO$_2$ and ZrO$_2$, establishing a broadly applicable strategy for designing high-performance amorphous dielectrics.</description>

      <title>R\'{e}nyi and Shannon mutual information in critical and decohered critical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a critical many-body system by introducing a R\'{e}nyi generalized mutual information, connecting between R\'{e}nyi mutual information and R\'{e}nyi Shannon mutual information. This R\'{e}nyi generalized mutual information can offer more experimentally accessible alternative than the conventional entanglement entropy. As a critical many-body state, we focus on the critical transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) described by the Ising conformal field theory (CFT). We show that even if we modify the non-selective projective measurement assumed in R\'{e}nyi Shannon mutual information by replacing the measurement into decoherence by environment, the R\'{e}nyi generalized Shannon mutual information maintains the CFT properties such as subsystem CFT scaling law and its central charge observed through both the conventional R\'{e}nyi Shannon mutual information and R\'{e}nyi mutual information. Furthermore, we apply a local decoherence to the critical ground state of the TFIM and numerically observe the R\'{e}nyi generalized mutual information by changing the parameter controlling environment effect (corresponding to the strength of measurement) in the R\'{e}nyi generalized mutual information and the strength of the decoherence to which the entire system subjects. We find that R\'{e}nyi-$2$ type central charge connected to the central charge is fairly robust, indicating the strong robustness of the Ising CFT properties against local decoherence by environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study monitored quantum dynamics of infinite-range interacting bosonic systems in the thermodynamic limit. We show that under semiclassical assumptions, the quantum fluctuations along single monitored trajectories adopt a deterministic limit for both quantum-jump and state-diffusion unravelings, and can be exactly solved. In particular, the hierarchical structure of the equations of motion explains the coincidence of entanglement phase transitions and dissipative phase transitions found in previous finite-size numerical studies. We illustrate the findings on a Bose-Hubbard dimer and a collective spin system.</description>

      <title>Wetting and Pattern Formation in Non-Reciprocal Ternary Phase Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions are among the simplest mechanisms that drive a physical system out of thermal equilibrium, leading to novel phenomena such as oscillatory pattern formation. In this paper, we introduce a ternary phase separation model, with non-reciprocal interactions between two of the three phases and a spectator phase that mimics a boundary. Through numerical simulations, we uncover three distinct phase behaviours: a quasi-static regime, characterized by well-defined non-equilibrium contact angles at the three phase contact line; a limit cycle regime, with the three bulk phases rotating around the three phase contact line; and a travelling wave regime, featuring persistent directional motion. We complement our numerical findings with analytical examination of linear stability and the wave propagation speed near equilibrium. Our model provides a minimal framework for extending classical equilibrium wetting theory to active and non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics of finite three-dimensional Yukawa clusters in complex plasmas : Newtonian versus Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure and dynamics of a harmonically confined three dimensional finite dust cluster are investigated via both Langevin Dynamics (LD) and frictionless Molecular Dynamics (fMD) simulation. The static structure of the system is analyzed through the Radial Distribution Function, Center-two-particle correlation function(C2P) and angular correlation function. The intra-shell angular correlation, Radial Distribution Function and C2P remains largely unaffected by the dynamics employed. However, the inter-shell angular correlation exhibits sharp peaks at irregular angular intervals in fMD which are not seen in LD indicating strongly correlated motion of the two spherical shells in the cluster in fMD. The single particle dynamics of the cluster is characterized by the Van - Hove self autocorrelation function and Mean Squared Displacement (MSD). Notably, the Van - Hove autocorrelation function in fMD simulations exhibits narrower width and higher peak height as compared to the LD simulations, suggesting greater particle mobility in LD. Trajectory analysis reveals a rotational motion of the particles about a common axis in fMD which disappears with progressively increasing friction coefficient. We show that the disappearance of rotational motion with the introduction of neutral friction in the dynamics is due to the much faster relaxation of the interparticle distance as well as interparticle angular separation in LD as compared to fMD.</description>

      <title>Role of bubble positioning in force induced melting of DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of bubble positioning in the force-induced melting of double-stranded DNA using two distinct approaches: Brownian Dynamics simulations and the Gaussian Network Model. We isolate the effect of bubble positioning by using DNA molecules with 50% AT - 50% GC base-pair composition which ensures constant enthalpy. Our results reveal that it is not just the sequence itself, but its specific arrangement that influences DNA stability. We examine two types of DNA sequences containing a block of either AT or GC base-pairs, resulting in the formation of a large bubble or a smaller bubble within the DNA, respectively. By systematically shifting these blocks along the strand, we investigate how their positioning influences the force-temperature phase diagram of DNA. Our Brownian dynamics simulations reveal that, at high forces, melting of the entire DNA strand is initiated after stretching $\approx 9$ GC base-pairs, independent of the specific base-pair sequence. In contrast, no such characteristic length scale is observed in the Gaussian network model. Our study suggests that free strand entropy plays a significant role in determining the force-temperature phase diagram of the DNA.</description>

      <title>Theory of Irreversibility in Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06183v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the longstanding challenge in quantum many-body theory of reconciling unitary dynamics with irreversible relaxation. In classical chaos, the unitary evolution operator develops Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances inside the unit circle in the continuum limit, leading to mixing. In the semiclassical limit, chaotic single-particle quantum systems relax with the same RP resonances. In contrast, the theory of quantum many-body RP resonances and their link to irreversibility remain underdeveloped. Here, we relate the spectral form factor to the sum of autocorrelation functions and, in generic many-body lattice systems without conservation laws, argue that all quantum many-body RP resonances converge inside the unit disk, highlighting the role of nonunitary and the thermodynamic limit. While we conjecture this picture to be general, we analytically prove the emergence of irreversibility in the random phase model (RPM), a paradigmatic Floquet quantum circuit model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension. To this end, we couple it to local environments and compute the exact time evolution of autocorrelation functions, the dissipative form factor, and out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs). Although valid for any dissipation strength, we then focus on weak dissipation to clarify the origin of irreversibility in unitary systems. When the dissipationless limit is taken after the thermodynamic limit, the unitary quantum map develops an infinite tower of decaying RP resonances -- chaotic systems display so-called anomalous relaxation. We also show that the OTOC in the RPM can undergo a two-stage relaxation and that during the second stage, the approach to the stationary value is again controlled by the leading RP resonance.

      <description>arXiv:2504.11371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A prediction makes a claim about a system's future given knowledge of its past. A retrodiction makes a claim about its past given knowledge of its future. The bidirectional machine is an ambidextrous hidden Markov chain that does both optimally by making explicit in its state structure all statistical correlation in a stochastic process. We introduce an informational taxonomy to profile these correlations via a suite of multivariate information measures. While prior results laid out the different kinds of information contained in isolated measurement of a bit, the associated informations were challenging to calculate explicitly. Overcoming this via bidirectional machine states, we expand that analysis to prediction and retrodiction. The result highlights fourteen new interpretable and calculable measures that characterize a process' informational structure. In addition, we introduce a labeling and indexing scheme that systematizes information-theoretic analyses of complex multivariate systems. Operationalizing this, we provide algorithms to directly calculate all of these quantities in closed form for finitely-modeled processes.</description>

Abstract: We consider a coupled system mimicking opinion formation under the influence of a group of $q$ neighbors ($q$-lobby) that consists of an Ising part governed by temperature-like parameter $T$ and a voter dynamics parameterized by noise probability $p$ (independence of choice). Using rigorous analytical calculations backed by extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we examine the interplay between these two quantities. Based on the theory of phase transitions, we derive the relation between $T$ and $p$ at the critical line dividing the ordered and disordered phases, which takes a very simple and generic form $T(p-a)=b$ in the high temperature limit. For specific lobby sizes, we show where the temperature are noise are balanced, and we hint that for large $q$, the temperature-like dynamics prevails.</description>

Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) have been studied in the extended XY model under both noiseless and noisy linear driven staggered field cases. In the time-independent staggered field case, the model exhibits a single critical point where the transition occurs from the spin-liquid phase to the antiferromagnetic phase. In the noiseless ramp case, unlike the transverse field XY model where DQPT always occurs for a quench crossing the single critical point, there is a critical sweep velocity above which the kinks corresponding to a DQPT are completely removed. Furthermore, in this case there are only two critical modes whose excitation probability is one-half. In the presence of a Gaussian white noise, we find that this critical sweep velocity decreases by increasing the noise strength, and scales linearly with the square of the noise intensity. A surprising result occurs when the noise intensity and sweep velocity are about the same order of magnitude, the number of critical modes is significantly increased, signalling a region with multiple critical modes. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the scaling of the dynamical free energy near the DQPTs time is the same for both noiseless and noisy ramp quenches.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phase diagram of the Quantum Ising model with Cluster Interaction Under Noisy and Noiseless Driven field</title>

Abstract: In most lattice models, gap closing typically occurs at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. In the transverse field Ising model with cluster interaction, besides the gap closing at high-symmetry points, the gap closing at the quantum phase transition between paramagnetic and cluster phases of the model can be moved by tuning the strength of the cluster interaction. We take advantage of this property to examine the nonequilibrium dynamics of the model in the framework of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) after a noiseless and noisy ramp of the transverse magnetic field. The numerical results show that DQPTs always happen if the starting or ending point of the quench field is restricted between two critical points. In other ways, there is always critical sweep velocity above which DQPTs disappear. Our finding reveals that noise modifies drastically the dynamical phase diagram of the model. We find that the critical sweep velocity decreases by enhancing the noise intensity and scales linearly with the square of noise intensity for weak and strong noise. Moreover, the region with multi-critical modes induced in the dynamical phase diagram by noise.

      <description>arXiv:2506.15121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a generative modeling framework for thermodynamic computing, in which structured data is synthesized from noise by the natural time evolution of a physical system governed by Langevin dynamics. While conventional diffusion models use neural networks to perform denoising, here the information needed to generate structure from noise is encoded by the dynamics of a thermodynamic system. Training proceeds by maximizing the probability with which the computer generates the reverse of a noising trajectory, which ensures that the computer generates data with minimal heat emission. We demonstrate this framework within a digital simulation of a thermodynamic computer. If realized in analog hardware, such a system would function as a generative model that produces structured samples without the need for artificially-injected noise or active control of denoising.</description>

      <title>First Exit Times of Harmonically Trapped Particles: A Didactic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3598</link>
      <description>arXiv:1411.3598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revise the classical problem of characterizing first exit times of a harmonically trapped particle whose motion is described by one- or multi-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We start by recalling the main derivation steps of a propagator using Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations. The mean exit time, the moment-generating function, and the survival probability are then expressed through confluent hypergeometric functions and thoroughly analyzed. We also present a rapidly converging series representation of confluent hypergeometric functions that is particularly well suited for numerical computation of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the governing Fokker-Planck operator. We discuss several applications of first exit times such as detection of time intervals during which motor proteins exert a constant force onto a tracer in optical tweezers single-particle tracking experiments; adhesion bond dissociation under mechanical stress; characterization of active periods of trend following and mean-reverting strategies in algorithmic trading on stock markets; relation to the distribution of first crossing times of a moving boundary by Brownian motion. Some extensions are described, including diffusion under quadratic double-well potential and anomalous diffusion.</description>

      <title>On the map-territory fallacy fallacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a meta-theory of the usage of the free energy principle (FEP) and examines its scope in the modelling of physical systems. We consider the so-called `map-territory fallacy' and the fallacious reification of model properties. By showing that the FEP is a consistent, physics-inspired theory of inferences of inferences, we disprove the assertion that the map-territory fallacy contradicts the principled usage of the FEP. As such, we argue that deploying the map-territory fallacy to criticise the use of the FEP and Bayesian mechanics itself constitutes a fallacy: what we call the {\it map-territory fallacy fallacy}. In so doing, we emphasise a few key points: the uniqueness of the FEP as a model of particles or agents that model their environments; the restoration of convention to the FEP via its relation to the principle of constrained maximum entropy; the `Jaynes optimality' of the FEP under this relation; and finally, the way that this meta-theoretical approach to the FEP clarifies its utility and scope as a formal modelling tool. Taken together, these features make the FEP, uniquely, {\it the} ideal model of generic systems in statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Information Capacity in Random Circuits and Hamiltonian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the information capacity of open quantum systems, focusing on the effective channels formed by the subsystem of random quantum circuits and quantum Hamiltonian evolution. By analyzing the subsystem information capacity, which is closely linked to quantum coherent information of these effective quantum channels, we uncover a diverse range of dynamical and steady behaviors depending on the types of evolution. Therefore, the subsystem information capacity serves as a valuable tool for studying the intrinsic nature of various dynamical phases, such as integrable, localized, thermalized, and topological systems. We also reveal the impact of different initial information encoding schemes on information dynamics including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. To support our findings, we provide representative examples for numerical simulations, including random quantum circuits with or without mid-circuit measurements, random Clifford Floquet circuits, free and interacting Aubry-Andr\'e models, and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models. These numerical results are further quantitatively explained using the effective statistical model mapping and the quasiparticle picture in the cases of random circuits and non-interacting Hamiltonian dynamics, respectively.</description>

      <title>Finite size scaling of survival statistics in metapopulation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial metapopulation models are fundamental to theoretical ecology, enabling to study how landscape structure influences global species dynamics. Traditional models, including recent generalizations, often rely on the deterministic limit of stochastic processes, assuming large population sizes. However, stochasticity - arising from dispersal events and population fluctuations - profoundly shapes ecological dynamics. In this work, we extend the classical metapopulation framework to account for finite populations, examining the impact of stochasticity on species persistence and dynamics. Specifically, we analyze how the limited capacity of local habitats influences survival, deriving analytical expressions for the finite-size scaling of the survival probability near the critical transition between survival and extinction. Crucially, we demonstrate that the deterministic metapopulation capacity plays a fundamental role in the statistics of survival probability and extinction time moments. These results provide a robust foundation for integrating demographic stochasticity into classical metapopulation models and their extensions.</description>

      <title>Metamaterials that learn to change shape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning to change shape is a fundamental strategy of adaptation and evolution of living organisms, from bacteria and cells to tissues and animals. Human-made materials can also exhibit advanced shape morphing capabilities, but lack the ability to learn. Here, we build metamaterials that can learn complex shape-changing responses using a contrastive learning scheme. By being shown examples of the target shape changes, our metamaterials are able to learn those shape changes by progressively updating internal learning degrees of freedom -- the local stiffnesses. Unlike traditional materials that are designed once and for all, our metamaterials have the ability to forget and learn new shape changes in sequence, to learn multiple shape changes that break reciprocity, and to learn multistable shape changes, which in turn allows them to perform reflex gripping actions and locomotion. Our findings establish metamaterials as an exciting platform for physical learning, which in turn opens avenues for the use of physical learning to design adaptive materials and robots.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable models for universal operator growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum observables of generic many-body systems exhibit a universal pattern of growth in the Krylov space of operators. This pattern becomes particularly manifest in the Lanczos basis, where the evolution superoperator assumes the tridiagonal form. According to the universal operator growth hypothesis, the nonzero elements of the superoperator, known as Lanczos coefficients, grow asymptotically linearly. We introduce and explore broad families of Lanczos coefficients that are consistent with the universal operator growth and lead to the exactly solvable dynamics. Within these families, the subleading terms of asymptotic expansion of the Lanczos sequence can be controlled and fine-tuned to produce diverse dynamical patterns. For one of the families, the Krylov complexity is computed exactly.</description>

      <title>The effect of preferential node deletion on the structure of networks that evolve via preferential attachment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present analytical results for the effect of preferential node deletion on the structure of networks that evolve via node addition and preferential attachment. To this end, we consider a preferential-attachment-preferential-deletion (PAPD) model, in which at each time step, with probability $P_{\rm add}$ there is a growth step where an isolated node is added to the network, followed by the addition of $m$ edges, where each edge connects a node selected uniformly at random to a node selected preferentially in proportion to its degree. Alternatively, with probability $P_{\rm del}=1-P_{\rm add}$ there is a contraction step, in which a preferentially selected node is deleted and its links are erased. The balance between the growth and contraction processes is captured by the growth/contraction rate $\eta=P_{\rm add}-P_{\rm del}$. For $0 &lt; \eta \le 1$ the overall process is of network growth, while for $-1\le\eta&lt;0$ the overall process is of network contraction. Using the master equation and the generating function formalism, we study the time-dependent degree distribution $P_t(k)$. It is found that for each value of $m&gt;0$ there is a critical value $\eta_c(m)=-(m-2)/(m+2)$ such that for $\eta_c(m)&lt;\eta\le1$ the degree distribution $P_t(k)$ converges towards a stationary distribution $P_{\rm st}(k)$. In the special case of pure growth, where $\eta=1$, the model is reduced to a preferential attachment growth model and $P_{\rm st}(k)$ exhibits a power-law tail, which is a characteristic of scale-free networks. In contrast, for $\eta_c(m)&lt;\eta&lt;1$ the distribution $P_{\rm st}(k)$ exhibits an exponential tail, which has a well-defined scale.This implies a phase transition at $\eta=1$, in contrast with the preferential-attachment-random-deletion (PARD) model [B. Budnick, O. Biham and E. Katzav, J. Stat. Mech. 013401 (2025)], in which the power-law tail remains intact as long as $\eta&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Free Probability in a Minimal Quantum Circuit Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical developments in many-body quantum systems motivate the study of their out-of-equilibrium properties through multi-time correlation functions. We consider the dynamics of higher-order out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in a minimal circuit model for quantum dynamics. This model mimics the dynamics of a structured subsystem locally coupled to a maximally random environment. We prove the exponential decay of all higher-order OTOCs and fully characterize the relevant time scales, showing how local operators approach free independence at late times. We show that the effects of the environment on the local subsystem can be captured in a higher-order influence matrix, which allows for a Markovian description of the dynamics provided an auxiliary degree of freedom is introduced. This degree of freedom directly yields a dynamical picture for the OTOCs in terms of free cumulants from free probability, consistent with recent predictions from the full eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). This approach and the relevant influence matrix are expected to be applicable in more general settings and present a first step to characterizing quantum memory in higher-order OTOCs.</description>
