      <title>From Static to Dynamic: Exploring Temporal Networks in Systems Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network science has become an essential interdisciplinary tool for understanding complex biological systems. However, because these systems undergo continuous, often stimulus-driven changes in both structure and function, traditional static network approaches frequently fall short in capturing their dynamic nature. Dynamic network analysis (DNA) addresses this limitation and offers a powerful framework to investigate these evolving relationships. This work focuses on temporal networks, a central paradigm within DNA, as an effective approach for modelling time-resolved changes in biological systems. While DNA has gained traction in domains like social and communication sciences, its integration in biology has been more gradual, hindered by data limitations and the need for domain-specific adaptations. Aimed at supporting researchers, particularly those new to the field, the review offers an integrative overview of the diverse and multidisciplinary landscape of DNA, with a focus on temporal networks in systems biology. I begin by clarifying foundational terminology and concepts, then present a multi-scale perspective spanning microscale (nodes and edges), mesoscale (motifs and communities), and macroscale (global topology) analyses. Finally, I explore analytical strategies and computational tools suited to various research objectives, including methods for detecting structural shifts, assessing network similarity, tracking module evolution, and predictive modelling of future network states.</description>

      <title>Near-critical gene expression in embryonic boundary precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embryonic development relies on the formation of sharp, precise gene expression boundaries. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, boundary formation has been proposed to occur at a dynamical critical point. Yet, in the paradigmatic case of the hunchback (hb) gene, evidence suggests that boundary formation occurs in a bistable regime, not at the dynamical critical point. We develop a minimal model for hb expression and identify a single parameter that tunes the system from its monostable regime to its bistable regime, crossing the critical point in between. We find that boundary precision is maximized when the system is weakly bistable--near, but not at, the critical point--optimally negotiating the tradeoff between two key effects of bistability: sharpening the boundary and amplifying its noise. Incorporating the diffusion of Hb proteins into our model, we show that boundary precision is maximized simultaneously at an optimal degree of bistability and an optimal diffusion strength. Our work elucidates design principles of precise boundary formation and has general implications for pattern formation in multicellular systems.</description>
