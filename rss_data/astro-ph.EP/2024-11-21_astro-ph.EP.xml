      <title>The GAPS Programme at TNG. LXV. Precise density measurement of TOI-1430 b, a young planet with an evaporating atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-sized exoplanets in tight orbits around young stars (10-1000 Myr) give us the opportunity to investigate the mechanisms that led to their formation, the evolution of their physical and orbital properties and, especially, of their atmospheres. Thanks to the all-sky survey carried out by TESS, many of these exoplanets have been discovered and have subsequently been characterized with dedicated follow-up observations. In the context of a collaboration among the GAPS, TKS and CPS teams, we measured with a high level of precision the mass and the radius of TOI-1430 b, a young (~700 Myr) exoplanet with an escaping He atmosphere orbiting the K-dwarf star HD 235088 (TOI-1430). By adopting appropriate stellar parameters, which were measured in this work, we were able to simultaneously model the signals due to strong stellar activity and the transiting planet TOI-1430 b in both photometric and spectroscopic series. This allowed us to measure the density of the planet with high precision, and reconstruct the evolution of its atmosphere. TOI-1430 is an active K-dwarf star born 700+/-150 Myr ago and rotates in ~12 d. It hosts a mini-Neptune whose orbital period is Pb=7.434133+/-0.000004 d. Thanks to long-term monitoring of this target performed with TESS, HARPS-N, HIRES, and APF, we estimated a radius Rb=1.98+/-0.07 $R_{\oplus}$, a mass Mb=4.2+/-0.8 $M_{\oplus}$, and thus a planetary density $\rho$b=0.5+/-0.1 $\rho_{\oplus}$. TOI-1430 b is hence a low-density mini-Neptune with an extended atmosphere, at the edge of the radius gap. Because this planet is known to have an evaporating atmosphere of He, we reconstructed its atmospheric history. Our analysis supports the scenario in which, shortly after its birth, TOI-1430 b may have been super-puffy, with a radius 5x-13x and a mass 1.5x-2x that of today; in ~200 Myr from now, TOI-1430 b should lose its envelope, showing its Earth-size core.</description>

      <title>Streams and Bubbles: Tidal Shaping of Planetary Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12895v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets lose mass to atmospheric outflows, and this mass loss is thought to be central in shaping the bimodal population of gaseous giant and rocky terrestrial exoplanets in close orbits. We model the escape of planetary atmospheres in three dimensional gas dynamic simulations in order to study their emergent morphology. Planetary outflows show a range of shapes from fast, isotropic outflows bounded by bow shocks to slower motion confined to thin streams. We show that a crucial factor is the role of the tidal gravity and orbiting reference frame in which planets lose mass. Flows can be characterized by the dimensionless Rossby number evaluated at the scale of the Hill sphere. Flows with a low Rossby number are significantly deviated and shaped by the stellar gravity, while those with a high Rossby number are comparatively unaffected. Rossby number alone is sufficient to predict outflow morphology as well as kinematic gradients across transit. The known exoplanet population should span a range of outflow Rossby numbers and thus shapes. We can use this information to constrain outflow physics and to inform observing strategies.</description>

      <title>Comet ATLAS (C/2024 S1) -- Second Ground-Based Discovery of a Kreutz Sungrazer in Thirteen Years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comet ATLAS (C/2024 S1) is a bright dwarf sungrazer, the second Kreutz comet discovery from the ground this century, 13 years after comet Lovejoy (C/2011 W3). The Population II membership of comet ATLAS sets it apart from the overwhelming majority of other bright dwarf sungrazers, most of them classified as members of Populations I, Pe, or Pre-I in the context of the contact-binary model. The new sungrazer might be closely related to comet du Toit (C/1945 X1), but most exciting is the possibility that it is a fragment of the parent comet of the Great September Comet of 1882 (C/1882 R1) and comet Ikeya-Seki (C/1965 S1). However, this scenario requires that the original orbital period of comet ATLAS -- rather poorly known at present -- be 886 yr. If its orbital period should turn out to be decidedly shorter, another scenario involving a 13th-century sungrazer should be preferred instead. More work on the orbit needs to be done. The apparent contradiction between the discovery of comet ATLAS and previous failures to find any dwarf Kreutz sungrazers in images taken with large ground-based telescopes at moderate heliocentric distances is explained by the propensity of Population II dwarf comets for outbursts, acting in collusion with extremely rare occurrences of these objects. Also addressed are the dynamical properties of perihelion fragmentation as well as the nature and timing of the expected 21st-century cluster of Kreutz comets, swarms of dwarf sungrazers, and related issues.</description>

      <title>Impact of Jupiter's heating and self-shadowing on the Jovian circumplanetary disk structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13351v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deciphering the structure of the circumplanetary disk that surrounded Jupiter at the end of its formation is key to understanding how the Galilean moons formed. Three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations have shown that this disk was optically thick and significantly heated to very high temperatures due to the intense radiation emitted by the hot, young planet. Analyzing the impact of Jupiter's radiative heating and shadowing on the structure of the circumplanetary disk can provide valuable insights into the conditions that shaped the formation of the Galilean moons. To assess the impact of Jupiter's radiative heating and shadowing, we have developed a two-dimensional quasi-stationary circumplanetary disk model and used a grey atmosphere radiative transfer method to determine the thermal structure of the disk. We find that the circumplanetary disk self-shadowing has a significant effect, with a temperature drop of approximately 100 K in the shadowed zone compared to the surrounding areas. This shadowed zone, located around 10 Jupiter radii, can act as a cold trap for volatile species such as NH$_3$, CO$_2$ and H$_2$S. The existence of these shadows in Jupiter's circumplanetary disk may have influenced the composition of the building blocks of the Galilean moons, potentially shaping their formation and characteristics. Our study suggests that the thermal structure of Jupiter's circumplanetary disk, particularly the presence of cold traps due to self-shadowing, may have played a crucial role in the formation and composition of the Galilean moons.</description>

      <title>Small and Close-In Planets are Uncommon around A-type Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kepler and K2 missions enabled robust calculations of planet occurrence rates around FGKM-type stars. However, these missions observed too few stars with earlier spectral types to tightly constrain the occurrence rates of planets orbiting hotter stars. Using TESS, we calculate the occurrence rate of small ($1 \, R_\oplus &lt; R_{\rm p} &lt; 8 \, R_\oplus$), close-in ($P_{\rm orb} &lt; 10$~days) planets orbiting A-type stars for the first time. We search a sample of 20,257 bright ($6 &lt; T &lt; 10$) A-type stars for transiting planets using a custom pipeline and vet the detected signals, finding no reliable small planets. We characterize the pipeline completeness using injection/recovery tests and determine the $3\sigma$ upper limits of the occurrence rates of close-in sub-Saturns ($4 \, R_\oplus &lt; R_{\rm p} &lt; 8 \, R_\oplus$), sub-Neptunes ($2 \, R_\oplus &lt; R_{\rm p} &lt; 4 \, R_\oplus$), and super-Earths ($1 \, R_\oplus &lt; R_{\rm p} &lt; 2 \, R_\oplus$). We find upper limits of $2.2 \pm 0.4$ sub-Saturns and $9.1 \pm 1.8$ sub-Neptunes per 1000 A-type stars, which may be more than $3\times$ and $6\times$ lower than \textit{Kepler}-era estimates for Sun-like stars. We calculate an upper limit of $186 \pm 34$ super-Earths per 1000 A-type stars, which may be more than $1.5\times$ lower than that for M dwarfs. Our results hint that small, close-in planets become rarer around early-type stars and that their occurrence rates decrease faster than that of hot Jupiters with increasing host star temperature. We discuss plausible explanations for these trends, including star-disk interactions and enhanced photoevaporation of planet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Assessing the processes behind planet engulfment and its imprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Throughout a planetary system's formation evolution, some of the planetary material may end up falling into the host star and be engulfed by it, leading to a potential variation of the stellar composition. The present study explores how planet engulfment may impact the chemical composition of the stellar surface and discusses what would be the rate of events with an observable imprint, for Sun-like stars. We use data from the NGPPS calculations by the Generation III Bern model to analyse the conditions under which planet engulfment may occur. Additionally, we use stellar models computed with Cesam2k20 to account for how the stellar internal structure and its processes may affect the dilution of the signal caused by planet engulfment. Our results show that there are three different phases associated to different mechanisms under which engulfment events may happen. Moreover, systems that undergo planet engulfment are more likely to come from protoplanetary disks that are more massive and more metal-rich than non-engulfing systems. Engulfment events leading to an observable signal happen after the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk when the convective envelope of the stars becomes thinner. With the stellar convective layer shrinking as the star evolves in the main sequence, they display a higher variation of chemical composition, which also correlates with the amount of engulfed material. By accounting for the physical processes happening in the stellar interior and in the optimistic case of being able to detect variations above 0.02 dex in the stellar composition, we find an engulfment rate no higher than $20\%$ for Sun-like stars that may reveal detectable traces of planet engulfment. Engulfment events that lead to an observable variation of the stellar composition are rare due to the specific conditions required to result in such signatures.</description>

      <title>Comet 289P/Blanpain: Near-Perihelion Activity and the Phoenicids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present NEOWISE observations of Jupiter family comet 289P/Blanpain, the parent body of the Phoenicid meteoroid stream. Near-infrared images at 3.4$\mu$m ($W1$) and 4.6$\mu$m ($W2$) were obtained near perihelion on two occasions: UT 2019-10-30 (inbound, heliocentric distance $R_{\rm h}$ = 1.20 au) and UT 2020-01-11/12 (outbound, $R_{\rm h}$ = 1.01 au). To assess faint activity, we establish constraints on dust production driven by the limited sublimating area of water ice, based on studies of the 1956 Phoenicids. The ejected dust mass is $M_{\rm d}$ = 4100 $\pm$ 200 kg (inbound) and 1700 $\pm$ 200 kg (outbound), respectively. The dust production rates are $Q_{\rm dust}$ = 0.01$-$0.02 kg s$^{-1}$, corresponding to dust-to-gas production ratio 2 $\leqslant\,f_{\rm dg}\,\leqslant$ 6. The resulting fractional active area, $f_{\rm A}$ = 3.8 $\pm$ 1.9 $\times 10^{-5}$, is the smallest yet reported. The absence of 4.6$\mu$m ($W2$) excess suggests that 289P contains negligible amounts of CO$_2$ and CO. Time-resolved analysis of weighted mean of $W1$ and $W2$ magnitudes finds a distinctive peak amplitude in the light curve having a rotational period $P_{\rm rot}$ = 8.8536 $\pm$ 0.3860 hr, however, further verification is needed. The perihelion-normalized nongravitational acceleration, $\alpha_{\rm NG}^\prime$ = 3.1 $\times$ 10$^{-6}$, is approximately an order of magnitude smaller than the trend observed for well-studied comets, consistent with weak outgassing. Current dust production from 289P, regardless of plausible assumptions for particle size and distribution, is an order of magnitude too small to produce the Phoenicid stream within its $\sim$300 yr dynamical lifetime. This suggests another mass supply, probably in 1743$-$1819, rapid rotational destruction of a sub-km precursor body, resulting in fragments equaling the mass of an object with radius $\sim$ 100 m.</description>

      <title>Multi-Mission Observations of Relativistic Electrons and High-Speed Jets Linked to Shock Generated Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shock-generated transients, such as hot flow anomalies (HFAs), upstream of planetary bow shocks, play a critical role in electron acceleration. Using multi-mission data from NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) and ESA's Cluster missions, we demonstrate the transmission of HFAs through Earth's quasi-parallel bow shock, associated with acceleration of electrons up to relativistic energies. Energetic electrons, initially accelerated upstream, are shown to remain broadly confined within the transmitted transient structures downstream, where betatron acceleration further boosts their energy due to elevated compression levels. Additionally, high-speed jets form at the compressive edges of HFAs, exhibiting a significant increase in dynamic pressure and potentially contributing to driving further localized compression. Our findings emphasize the efficiency of quasi-parallel shocks in driving particle acceleration far beyond the immediate shock transition region, expanding the acceleration region to a larger spatial domain. Finally, this study underscores the importance of multi-scale observational approach in understanding the convoluted processes behind collisionless shock physics and their broader implications.</description>

      <title>Grain Size in the Class I Protostellar System TMC-1A Constrained with ALMA and VLA Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The disk mass and substructure in young stellar objects suggest that planet formation may start at the protostellar stage through the growth of dust grains. To accurately estimate the grain size at the protostellar stage, we have observed the Class I protostar TMC-1A using the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at the Q (7 mm) and Ka (9 mm) bands at a resolution of ~0.2" and analyzed archival data of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at Band 6 (1.3 mm) and 7 (0.9 mm) that cover the same spatial scale. The VLA images show a compact structure with a size of ~25 au and a spectral index of ~2.5. The ALMA images show compact and extended structures with a spectral index of ~2 at the central ~40 au region and another index of ~3.3 in the outer region. Our SED analysis using the observed fluxes at the four bands suggests one branch with a small grain size of ~0.12 mm and another with a grown grain size of ~4 mm. We also model polarized dust continuum emission adopting the two grain sizes and compare them with an observational result of TMC-1A, suggesting that the small grain size is preferable to the grown grain size. The small grain size implies gravitational instability in the TMC-1A disk, which is consistent with a spiral-like component recently identified.</description>

      <title>Database Design for SpExoDisks: A Database &amp; Web Portal for Spectra of Exoplanet-Forming Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data access -- or the availability of new and archival data for use by the larger community -- is key for scientific advancement. How data is presented, searched, and formatted determines accessibility and it can be difficult to find a solution that fits the needs of a given subdiscipline. We present a generalized roadmap for developing a specialty astronomy database with web application based on the development of the SpExoDisks (Spectra of Exoplanet forming Disks) database (spexodisks.com), which provides infrared spectra of protoplanetary disks. Expertise in an astronomy subdiscipline can provide two necessary components for creating a database: access to a large volume of specialized data and knowledge of how that data should be presented to the community. However, there are a variety of steps and decisions for database development that can fall outside astronomy expertise. Here we offer generalized discussions on design and process that are accompanied by real-world examples from the SpExoDisks developer team and website. Starting from the database portal design and data organization, we demonstrate on-demand data distribution and query using publicly accessible database software. These systems support interactive visualizations such that users can explore spectra directly from their browsers. We also offer details that show how the technical concepts in SpExoDisks are implemented, particularly emphasizing sustainability and long-term management of the codebase and processes. Finally, we illustrate the utility that a specialty website can offer to the community by providing a specific example of how the combined spectra from SpExoDisks can enhance our understanding of protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Origin of Mars's moons by disruptive partial capture of an asteroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of Mars's small moons, Phobos and Deimos, remains unknown. They are typically thought either to be captured asteroids or to have accreted from a debris disk produced by a giant impact. Here, we present an alternative scenario wherein fragments of a tidally disrupted asteroid are captured and evolve into a collisional proto-satellite disk. We simulate the initial disruption and the fragments' subsequent orbital evolution. We find that tens of percent of an unbound asteroid's mass can be captured and survive beyond collisional timescales, across a broad range of periapsis distances, speeds, masses, spins, and orientations in the Sun--Mars frame. Furthermore, more than one percent of the asteroid's mass could evolve to circularise in the moons' accretion region. This implies a lower mass requirement for the parent body than that for a giant impact, which could increase the likelihood of this route to forming a proto-satellite disk that, unlike direct capture, could also naturally explain the moons' orbits. These three formation scenarios each imply different properties of Mars's moons to be tested by upcoming spacecraft missions.</description>

Abstract: Discoveries of close-in young puffy (R$_{\rm p} \gtrsim$ 6 R$_\oplus$) planets raise the question of whether they are bona fide hot Jupiters or puffed-up Neptunes, potentially placing constraints on the formation location and timescale of hot Jupiters. Obtaining mass measurements for these planets is challenging due to stellar activity and noisy spectra. Therefore, we aim to provide independent theoretical constraints on the masses of these young planets based on their radii, incident fluxes, and ages, benchmarking to the planets of age $&lt;$1 Gyr detected by \textit{Kepler}, \textit{K2} and \textit{TESS}. Through a combination of interior structure models, considerations of photoevaporative mass loss, and empirical mass-metallicity trends, we present the range of possible masses for 22 planets of age $\sim$10-900 Myr and radii $\sim$6-16 R$_\oplus$. We generally find that our mass estimates are in agreement with the measured masses and upper limits where applicable. There exist some outliers including super-puffs Kepler-51 b, c and V1298 Tau d, b, e, for which we outline their likely formation conditions. Our analyses demonstrate that most of the youngest planets ($\lesssim$ 100 Myr) tend to be puffed-up, Neptune-mass planets, while the true hot Jupiters are typically found around stars aged at least a few hundred Myr, suggesting the dominant origin of hot Jupiters to be late-stage high eccentricity migration.</description>

      <title>Surface accretion as a dust retention mechanism in protoplanetary disks. I. Formulation and proof-of-concept simulations</title>

Abstract: Planetesimal formation via the streaming and gravitational instabilities of dust in protoplanetary disks requires a local enhancement of the dust-to-gas mass ratio. Radial drift of large grains toward pressure bumps in gas disks is a plausible mechanism for achieving the required dust concentration. However, recent millimeter disk observations suggest that the maximum sizes of dust grains in these disks are considerably smaller than predicted by dust evolution models that assume sticky grains. This indicates that the grains may be more strongly coupled to the gas and hence drift more slowly than previously anticipated. In this study, we propose a new dust retention mechanism that enables an enhancement of the dust-to-gas mass ratio in disks with slowly drifting grains. This mechanism assumes that a surface accretion flow driven by magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) winds removes disk gas while retaining the slowly drifting grains below the flow. This process is expected to occur when the timescale of gas removal is shorter than the timescale of dust radial advection. To test this, we develop a radially one-dimensional framework for the transport of gas and dust in a disk with a vertically nonuniform accretion structure. Using this framework, we simulate the growth, fragmentation, and radial transport of dust grains in surface-accreting disks. Our simulations confirm a significant enhancement of the midplane dust-to-gas mass ratio when the predicted conditions for dust retention are met. Dust retention by MHD-driven surface accretion flows may thus pave the way for planetesimal formation from poorly sticky grains.</description>

      <title>Modeling protoplanetary disk heating by planet-induced spiral shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the heating of protoplanetary disks caused by shocks associated with spiral density waves induced by an embedded planet. Using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the dependence of shock heating rates on various disk and planetary parameters. Our results show that the shock heating rates are primarily influenced by the planet's mass and the disk's viscosity, while being insensitive to the thermal relaxation rate and the radial profiles of the disk's surface density and sound speed. We provide universal empirical formulas for the shock heating rates produced by the primary and secondary spiral arms as a function of orbital radius, viscosity parameter $\alpha$, and planet-to-star mass ratio $q$. The obtained formulas are accurate within a factor of a few for a moderately viscous and adiabatic disk with a planet massive enough that its spiral arms are strongly nonlinear. Using these universal relations, we show that shock heating can overwhelm viscous heating when the disk viscosity is low ($\alpha \lesssim 10^{-3}$) and the planet is massive ($q \gtrsim 10^{-3}$). Our empirical relations for the shock heating rates are simple and can be easily implemented into radially one-dimensional models of gas and dust evolution in protoplanetary disks.</description>
