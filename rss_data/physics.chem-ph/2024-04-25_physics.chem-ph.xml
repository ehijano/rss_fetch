      <title>A Rotational/Roto-translational Constraint Method for Condensed Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In condensed matter physics, particularly in perovskite materials, the rotational motion of molecules and ions is associated with important issues such as ion conduction mechanism. Constrained Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations offer a means to separate translational, vibrational, and rotational motions, enabling the independent study of their effects. In this study, we introduce a rotational and roto-translational constraint algorithm based on the Velocity Verlet integrator, which has been implemented into a homebrew version of the CP2K package. The MD results show that our program can selectively constrain the molecules and ions in the system and support long-time MD runs. The algorithm can help the future study of important rotation related dynamic problems in condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Computational Design of Boron-Free Triangular Molecules with Inverted Singlet-Triplet Energy Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel, computationally designed, class of triangular-shape organic molecules with an inverted singlet-triplet (IST) energy gap is investigated with the aid of ab initio methods of electronic structure theory. The considered molecular systems have a form of cyclic oligomers and their common feature is electronic conjugation localized along the molecular rim. Analysis of vertical transition energies from the electronic ground state, as well as from the lowest excited singlet and triplet states of selected molecules, is conducted. The results underscore the significance of optimizing excited-state geometries in theoretical models to accurately describe the optoelectronic properties of the IST molecules, particularly in relation to their applications in OLEDs.</description>

      <title>The generalized method of separation of variables for diffusion-influenced reactions: Irreducible Cartesian tensors technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated through various applications of the trapping diffusion-influenced reactions theory in physics, chemistry and biology, this paper deals with irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICT) technique within the scope of the generalized method of separation of variables (GMSV). Presenting a survey from the basic concepts of the theory, we spotlight the distinctive features of the above approach against known in literature similar techniques. The classical solution to the stationary diffusion equation under appropriate boundary conditions is represented as a series in the ICT. By means of proved translation addition theorem we straightforwardly reduce the general boundary value diffusion problem for $N$ spherical sinks to the corresponding resolving infinite system of linear algebraic equations with respect to unknown tensor coefficients. These coefficients comprise explicit dependence on the arbitrary three-dimensional configurations of $N$ sinks with different radii and surface reactivities. Specific application of the ICT technique is illustrated by some numerical calculations for the reactions, occurring in the arrays of two and three spherical sinks. For the first time we treat the statement and solution to the above reaction-diffusion problem, applying the smooth manifold concept.</description>

      <title>Unitary Basis Transformations in Mixed Quantum-Classical Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common approach to minimizing the cost of quantum computations is by transforming a quantum system into a basis that can be optimally truncated. Here, we derive classical equations of motion subjected to similar unitary transformations, and propose their integration into mixed quantum-classical dynamics, enabling this class of methods to be applied within arbitrary bases for both the quantum and classical coordinates. To this end, canonical positions and momenta are combined into a set of complex-valued classical coordinates amenable to unitary transformations. We demonstrate the potential of the resulting approach by means of surface hopping calculations of an electronic carrier scattering onto a single impurity in the presence of phonons. Appropriate basis transformations, capturing both the localization of the impurity and the delocalization of higher-energy excitations, are shown to faithfully capture the dynamics within a fraction of the classical and quantum basis sets.</description>

      <title>Quantification of classical and non-classical crystallization pathways in calcite precipitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.11731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystal precipitation from aqueous solution occurs through multiple pathways. Besides the classical ion-by-ion addition, non-classical crystallization mechanisms, such as multi-ion polymer and nano-particle attachment, could be of great significance under certain circumstances. These non-classical crystallization processes have been observed with advanced microscopy, yet detailed quantification of their contribution in mineral precipitation remains challenging. Building from paired Ca and Sr isotope observations, we develop a new theoretical framework to quantify the relative contribution of classical and non-classical crystallization pathways on the precipitation of the calcium carbonate mineral calcite, one of the most common precipitates in nature. We demonstrate that the classical (ion-by-ion) crystallization pathway alone is insufficient to account for the observed isotope behaviors and, thus, the entire calcite precipitation process. We present a new kinetic surface reaction model to incorporate the non-classical crystallization pathway. This new model, for the first time, enables the detailed characterization of the roles of classical and non-classical crystallization mechanisms in calcite precipitation. The results suggest that the relative contribution of non-classical crystallization pathways increases with saturation state and can, under high supersaturation levels, be comparable to or greater than precipitation driven by the classical crystallization pathway. The presented theoretical framework readily explains observed trace element partitioning and isotope fractionation behaviors during calcite precipitation and can be further expanded onto other mineral systems to gain insights into crystal growth mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Unveiling interatomic distances influencing the reaction coordinates in alanine dipeptide isomerization: An explainable deep learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work shows that the free energy landscape associated with alanine dipeptide isomerization can be effectively represented by specific interatomic distances without explicit reference to dihedral angles. Conventionally, two stable states of alanine dipeptide in vacuum, i.e., C$7_{\mathrm{eq}}$ ($\beta$-sheet structure) and C$7_{\mathrm{ax}}$ (left handed $\alpha$-helix structure), have been primarily characterized using the main chain dihedral angles, $\varphi$ (C-N-C$_\alpha$-C) and $\psi$ (N-C$_\alpha$-C-N). However, our recent deep learning combined with "Explainable AI" (XAI) framework has shown that the transition state can be adequately captured by a free energy landscape using $\varphi$ and $\theta$ (O-C-N-C$_\alpha$) [T. Kikutsuji, et al. J. Chem. Phys. 156, 154108 (2022)]. In perspective of extending these insights to other collective variables, a more detailed characterization of transition state is required. In this work, we employ the interatomic distances and bond angles as input variables for deep learning, rather than the conventional and more elaborate dihedral angles. Our approach utilizes deep learning to investigate whether changes in the main chain dihedral angle can be expressed in terms of interatomic distances and bond angles. Furthermore, by incorporating XAI into our predictive analysis, we quantified the importance of each input variable and succeeded in clarifying the specific interatomic distance that affects the transition state. The results indicate that constructing a free energy landscape based on using the identified interatomic distance can clearly distinguish between the two stable states and provide a comprehensive explanation for the energy barrier crossing.</description>

      <title>Classifying fermionic states via many-body correlation measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the structure of quantum correlations in a many-body system is key to its computational treatment. For fermionic systems, correlations can be defined as deviations from Slater determinant states. The link between fermionic correlations and efficient computational physics methods is actively studied but remains ambiguous. We make progress in establishing this connection mathematically. In particular, we find a rigorous classification of states relative to $k$-fermion correlations, which admits a computational physics interpretation. Correlations are captured by a measure $\omega_k$, a function of $k$-fermion reduced density matrix that we call twisted purity. Vanishing of $\omega_k$ for a given $k$ puts the state in a class $G_k$ of correlated states. Sets $G_k$ are nested in $k$, Slater determinants correspond to $k = 1$. Various physically relevant states are in or close to $G_{k=O(1)}$, including truncated configuration-interaction states, perturbation series around Slater determinants, and some nonperturbative eigenstates of the 1D Hubbard model. For each $k = O(1)$, we give an explicit ansatz with a polynomial number of parameters that covers all states in $G_k$. Potential applications of this ansatz and its connections to the coupled-cluster wavefunction are discussed.</description>

      <title>Materials Properties Prediction (MAPP): Empowering the prediction of material properties solely based on chemical formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting material properties has always been a challenging task in materials science. With the emergence of machine learning methodologies, new avenues have opened up. In this study, we build upon our recently developed Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to construct models that predict four distinct material properties. Our graph model represents materials as element graphs, with chemical formula serving as the only input. This approach ensures permutation invariance, offering a robust solution to prior limitations. By employing bootstrap methods to train on this individual GNN, we further enhance the reliability and accuracy of our predictions. With multi-task learning, we harness the power of extensive datasets to boost the performance of smaller ones. We introduce the inaugural version of the Materials Properties Prediction (MAPP) framework, empowering the prediction of material properties solely based on chemical formulas.</description>

      <title>Fast emulation of fermionic circuits with matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17657v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a matrix product state (MPS) extension for the Fermionic Quantum Emulator (FQE) software library. We discuss the theory behind symmetry adapted matrix product states for approximating many-body wavefunctions of spin-1/2 fermions, and we present an open-source, MPS-enabled implementation of the FQE interface (MPS-FQE). The software uses the open-source pyblock3 and block2 libraries for most elementary tensor operations, and it can largely be used as a drop-in replacement for FQE that allows for more efficient, but approximate, emulation of larger fermionic circuits. Finally, we show several applications relevant to both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum algorithms where approximate emulation of larger systems is expected to be useful: characterization of state preparation strategies for quantum phase estimation, the testing of different variational quantum eigensolver Ans\"atze, the numerical evaluation of Trotter errors, and the simulation of general quantum dynamics problems. In all these examples, approximate emulation with MPS-FQE allows us to treat systems that are significantly larger than those accessible with a full statevector emulator.</description>

      <title>X marks the spot: accurate energies from intersecting extrapolations of continuum quantum Monte Carlo data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the application of an extrapolative method that yields very accurate total and relative energies from variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (VMC and DMC) results. For a trial wave function consisting of a small configuration interaction (CI) wave function obtained from full CI quantum Monte Carlo and reoptimized in the presence of a Jastrow factor and an optional backflow transformation, we find that the VMC and DMC energies are smooth functions of the sum of the squared coefficients of the initial CI wave function, and that quadratic extrapolations of the non-backflow VMC and backflow DMC energies intersect within uncertainty of the exact total energy. With adequate statistical treatment of quasi-random fluctuations, the extrapolate and intersect with polynomials of order two (XSPOT) method is shown to yield results in agreement with benchmark-quality total and relative energies for the C2, N2, CO2, and H2O molecules, as well as for the C2 molecule in its first electronic singlet excited state, using only small CI expansion sizes.</description>

      <title>Proposal on the Calculation of the Ionisation-Cluster Size Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A stochastic model for the calculation of the ionisation-cluster size distribution in nanodosimetry is proposed. It is based on a canonical ensemble and derives from the well-known nuclear droplet model. It is able to describe the ionisation-cluster size distributions caused by electrons. It can easily be extented to light ions. In principle, the model has no free parameters. The model especially can be seen as a refinement to B. Grosswendts model. It is shown that it leads to a cluster-size distribution function F2 being more similar to of the yield of double-strand breaks in the DNA than the one calculated by B. Grosswendt. However, the results are still subject to major uncertainties. The focus of this work is on presenting the model and demonstrating its feasibility.</description>

      <title>Control of proton transport and hydrogenation in double-gated graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphene's basal plane can function as a perfectly selective barrier permeable to protons but impermeable to all ions and gases, stimulating its use in applications such as membranes, catalysis and isotope separation. Protons can also chemically adsorb on graphene and hydrogenate it, inducing a conductor-insulator transition intensely explored in graphene electronic devices. However, both processes face energy barriers that in the case of proton transport motivate strategies to accelerate it, such as introducing vacancies, incorporating catalytic metals or chemically functionalising the lattice, but these can compromise other properties like ion selectivity or mechanical stability. Here we show that independent control of the electric field E~V nm-1 and charge carrier density n~10^14 cm-2 in double gated graphene allows decoupling proton transport from lattice hydrogenation and can accelerate proton transport such that it approaches the limiting electrolyte current in our devices. Proton transport and hydrogenation can be driven selectively with precision and robustness that enables proton-based logic-and-memory graphene devices with orders-of-magnitude on-off ratios. Our results show that field effects can accelerate and decouple electrochemical processes in double-gated 2D crystals and demonstrate the possibility of mapping such processes as a function of E and n - a fundamentally different technique to study 2D electrode-electrolyte interfaces.</description>
