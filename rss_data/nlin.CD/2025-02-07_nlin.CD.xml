      <title>Using Lagrangian descriptors to reveal the phase space structure of dynamical systems described by fractional differential equations: Application to the Duffing oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We showcase the utility of the Lagrangian descriptors method in qualitatively understanding the underlying dynamical behavior of dynamical systems governed by fractional-order differential equations. In particular, we use the Lagrangian descriptors method to study the phase space structure of the unforced and undamped Duffing oscillator when its time evolution is governed by fractional-order differential equations. In our study, we implement two types of fractional derivatives, namely the standard Gr\"unwald-Letnikov method, which is a finite difference approximation of the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative, and a Gr\"unwald-Letnikov method with a correction term that approximates the Caputo fractional derivative. While there is no issue with forward-time integrations needed for the evaluation of Lagrangian descriptors, we discuss in detail ways to perform the non-trivial task of backward-time integrations and implement two methods for this purpose: a `nonlocal implicit inverse' technique and a `time-reverse inverse' approach. We analyze the differences in the Lagrangian descriptors results due to the two backward-time integration approaches, discuss the physical significance of these differences, and eventually argue that the nonlocal implicit inverse implementation of the Gr\"unwald-Letnikov fractional derivative manages to reveal the phase space structure of fractional-order dynamical systems correctly.</description>

      <title>Leading and beyond leading-order spectral form factor in chaotic quantum many-body systems across all Dyson symmetry classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the emergence of random matrix theory (RMT) spectral correlations in the chaotic phase of generic periodically kicked interacting quantum many-body systems by analytically calculating spectral form factor (SFF), $K(t)$, up to two leading orders in time, $t$. We explicitly consider the presence or absence of time reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) symmetry to investigate all three Dyson's symmetry classes. Our derivation only assumes random phase approximation to enable ensemble average. For $\mathcal{T}$-invariant systems with $\mathcal{T}^2=1$, we show that beyond the Thouless time $t^*$, the SFF takes the form $K(t)\simeq 2t-2t^2/\mathcal{N}$ up to second order in time, where $\mathcal{N}$ is the Hilbert space dimension. This is identical to the result from circular orthogonal ensemble of RMT. In the absence of $\mathcal{T}$-symmetry, we show that $K(t)\simeq t$ beyond $t^*$, and there is no universal term in the second order, unlike the $\mathcal{T}^2=1$ case, in agreement with the result of circular unitary ensemble. For $\mathcal{T}$-invariant systems with $\mathcal{T}^2=-1$, we show that $K(t)\simeq 2t+2t^2/\mathcal{N}$ up to two orders in time beyond $t^*$, in agreement with the result of circular symplectic ensemble. In all three cases, the system-size, $L$, scaling of $t^*$ is determined by eigenvalues of a doubly stochastic matrix $\mathcal{M}$. For strongly interacting fermionic chains, $\mathcal{M}$ is $SU(2)$ invariant in all three cases, leading to $t^*\propto L^2$ in the presence of $U(1)$ symmetry. In the absence of $U(1)$ symmetry, we find $t^*\propto L^0$, due to gapped non-degenerate second-largest eigenvalue of $\mathcal{M}$ or $t^*\propto \ln(L)$ due to gapped second-largest eigenvalue with degeneracy $\propto L^\zeta$. Our calculation of SFF is plausible in higher space dimensions as well, where similar system-size scalings of $t^*$ can be obtained.</description>

      <title>Control Strategy for Generalized Synchrony in Coupled Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical systems can be coupled in a manner that is designed to drive the resulting dynamics onto a specified lower dimensional submanifold in the phase space of the combined system. On the submanifold, the variables of the two systems have a well-defined unique functional relationship. This process can thus be viewed as a control technique that ensures generalized synchronization. Depending on the nature of the dynamical systems and the specified submanifold, different coupling functions can be derived in order to achieve a desired control objective. We discuss the circuit implementations of this strategy in representative examples of coupled chaotic dynamical systems, namely Lorenz oscillators</description>

      <title>Krylov fractality and complexity in generic random matrix ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Krylov space methods provide an efficient framework for analyzing the dynamical aspects of quantum systems, with tridiagonal matrices playing a key role. Despite their importance, the behavior of such matrices from chaotic to integrable states, transitioning through an intermediate phase, remains unexplored. We aim to fill this gap by considering the properties of the tridiagonal matrix elements and the associated basis vectors for appropriate random matrix ensembles. We utilize the Rosenzweig-Porter model as our primary example, which hosts a fractal regime in addition to the ergodic and localized phases. We discuss the characteristics of the matrix elements and basis vectors across the three (ergodic, fractal, and localized) regimes and introduce tools to identify the transition points. The exact expressions of the Lanczos coefficients are provided in terms of $q$-logarithmic function across the full parameter regime. The numerical results are corroborated with analytical reasoning for certain features of the Krylov spectra. Additionally, we investigate the Krylov state complexity within these regimes, showcasing the efficacy of our methods in pinpointing these transitions.</description>

      <title>Many-body adiabatic passage: Instability, chaos, and quantum classical correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic passage in systems of interacting bosons is substantially affected by interactions and inter-particle entanglement. We consider STIRAP-like schemes in Bose-Hubbard chains that exhibit low-dimensional chaos (a 3 site chain), and high-dimensional chaos (more than 3 sites). The dynamics that is generated by a transfer protocol exhibits striking classical and quantum chaos fingerprints that are manifest in the mean-field classical treatment, in the truncated-Wigner semiclassical treatment, and in the full many-body quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation Analysis of Predator-Prey System using Conformable Fractional Order Discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, conformal fractional order discretization [20, 24, 25] is used to analyze bifurcation analysis and stability of a predator-prey system. A continuous model has been discretized into a discrete one while preserving the fractional-order dynamics. This allows us to look more closely at the stability properties of the system and bifurcation phenomena, including period-doubling and Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. Through numerical and theoretical methods, this research investigated how the modification in system parameters affects the overall dynamics, which may have implications for ecological management and conservation strategies.</description>
