      <title>Self-Balancing of Cell Populations via Martingale Turnover with Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanisms underlying adaptive control in biological systems, such as intestinal immune regulation, remain poorly understood, despite detailed knowledge of their regulatory networks. Here, we propose an alternative to traditional deterministic regulation. We theoretically demonstrate that stochastic martingale turnover, in which cells proliferate through mutual competition and decay without component-specific control, naturally converges to an appropriate population balance characterized by a low probability of cell loss. This compositional change is described by a modified Langevin equation, where conserved mass is replaced by a dynamic variable representing the fitness of the current composition. A random walk model with step lengths that shorten near the target, together with its mathematical solution, demonstrates entropy increase under favorable conditions. Thus, we propose a fundamental principle for autonomous biological control.</description>

      <title>Hopf-Induced Desynchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of synchrony essentially underlies the functionality of many systems across physics, biology and engineering. In all established synchronization phase transitions so far, a stable synchronous state is connected to a stable incoherent state: For continuous transitions, stable synchrony directly connects to stable incoherence at a critical point, whereas for discontinuous transitions, stable synchrony is connected to stable incoherence via an additional unstable branch. Here we present a novel type of transition between synchrony and incoherence where the synchronous state does not connect to the state of incoherence. We uncover such transitions in the complexified Kuramoto model with their variables and coupling strength parameter analytically continued. Deriving a self-consistency equation for a quaternion order parameter that we propose helps to mathematically pin down the mechanisms underlying this transition type. Local numerical analysis suggests that the transition is linked to a Hopf bifurcation destabilizing synchrony, in contrast to branching point bifurcations established for the transition between synchrony and incoherence so far.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and Legendre Duality in Optimal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimality principles in nonequilibrium transport networks are linked to a thermodynamic formalism based on generalized transport potentials endowed with Legendre duality and related contact structure. This allows quantifying the distance from non-equilibrium operating points, analogously to thermodynamic availability as well as to shed light on optimality principles in relation to different imposed constraints. Extremizations of generalized dissipation and entropy production appear as special cases that require power-law resistances and -- for entropy production -- also isothermal conditions. Changes in stability of multiple operating points are interpreted as phase transitions based on non-equilibrium equations of state, while cost-based optimization of transport properties reveals connections to the generalized dissipation in the case of power law costs and linear resistance law, but now with typically unstable operating points which give rise to branched optimal transport.</description>

      <title>Saltatory targeting strategy in rock-paper-scissors models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore how strategic leaps alter the classic rock-paper-scissors dynamics in spatially structured populations. In our model, individuals can expend energy reserves to jump toward regions with a high density of individuals of the species they dominate in the spatial game. This enables them to eliminate the target organisms and gain new territory, promoting species proliferation. Through stochastic, lattice-based simulations, we show that even when the energy allocated to jumping, as opposed to random walking, is low, there is a significant shift in the cyclic dominance balance. This arises from the increased likelihood of the leaping species successfully acquiring territory. Due to the cyclical nature of the game, the dominant species becomes the one that is superior to the jumping species. We investigate how spatial patterns are affected and calculate the changes in characteristic length scales. Additionally, we quantify how saltatory targeting reshapes spatial correlations and drives shifts in population dominance. Finally, we estimate the coexistence probability and find evidence that this behavioural strategy may promote biodiversity among low-mobility organisms but jeopardise long-term coexistence in the case of high-mobility dispersal. These results underscore the profound impact of novel foraging tactics on community structure and provide concrete parameters for ecologists seeking to incorporate behavioural innovation into ecosystem models.</description>

      <title>A framework for the use of generative modelling in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11630v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. Using the FEP allows us to model the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations among subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations among subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the `explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy gradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.</description>

      <title>Harnessing omnipresent oscillator networks as computational resource</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nature is pervaded with oscillatory dynamics. In networks of coupled oscillators patterns can arise when the system synchronizes to an external input. Hence, these networks provide processing and memory of input. We present a universal framework for harnessing oscillator networks as computational resource. This computing framework is introduced by the ubiquitous model for phase-locking, the Kuramoto model. We force the Kuramoto model by a nonlinear target-system, then after substituting the target-system with a trained feedback-loop it emulates the target-system. Our results are two-fold. Firstly, the trained network inherits performance properties of the Kuramoto model, where all-to-all coupling is performed in linear time with respect to the number of nodes and parameters for synchronization are abundant. The latter implies that the network is generically successful since the system learns via sychronization. Secondly, the learning capabilities of the oscillator network, which describe a type of collective intelligence, can be explained using Kuramoto model's order parameter. In summary, this work provides the foundation for utilizing nature's oscillator networks as a new class of information processing systems.</description>
