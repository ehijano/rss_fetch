      <title>SAFuzz: Semantic-Guided Adaptive Fuzzing for LLM-Generated Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While AI-coding assistants accelerate software development, current testing frameworks struggle to keep pace with the resulting volume of AI-generated code. Traditional fuzzing techniques often allocate resources uniformly and lack semantic awareness of algorithmic vulnerability patterns, leading to inefficient resource usage and missed vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, we present a hybrid testing framework that leverages LLM-guided adaptive fuzzing to detect algorithmic vulnerabilities efficiently. Our system SAFuzz integrates prompt-based behavioral diversification, harness generation with problem-specific oracles, and an LLM-based predictor to enable adaptive resource allocation and dynamic early stopping. Evaluating SAFuzz on CSES algorithmic problems, we improve vulnerability discrimination precision from 77.9% to 85.7% and achieve a 1.71x reduction in time cost compared to SOTA GreenFuzz while maintaining comparable recall. We further observe that combining our approach with existing unit test generation methods yields complementary gains, increasing the bug detection recall from 67.3% to 79.5%.</description>

      <title>SWE-MiniSandbox: Container-Free Reinforcement Learning for Building Software Engineering Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training software engineering (SWE) agents, but existing pipelines typically rely on per-task containers for isolation. At scale, pre-built container images incur substantial storage overhead, slow environment setup, and require container-management privileges. We propose SWE-MiniSandbox, a lightweight, container-free method that enables scalable RL training of SWE agents without sacrificing isolation. Instead of relying on per-instance containers, SWE-MiniSandbox executes each task in an isolated workspace backed by kernel-level mechanisms, substantially reducing system overhead. It leverages lightweight environment pre-caching techniques to eliminate the need for bulky container images. As a result, our approach lowers disk usage to approximately 5\% of that required by container-based pipelines and reduces environment preparation time to about 25\% of the container baseline. Empirical results demonstrate that SWE-MiniSandbox achieves evaluation performance comparable to standard container-based pipelines. By removing the dependency on heavy container infrastructure, SWE-MiniSandbox offers a practical and accessible foundation for scaling RL-based SWE agents, particularly in resource-constrained research environments.</description>

      <title>Patient Digital Twins for Chronic Care: Technical Hurdles, Lessons Learned, and the Road Ahead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chronic diseases constitute the principal burden of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs worldwide, yet current health systems remain fragmented and predominantly reactive. Patient Medical Digital Twins (PMDTs) offer a paradigm shift: holistic, continuously updated digital counterparts of patients that integrate clinical, genomic, lifestyle, and quality-of-life data. We report early implementations of PMDTs via ontology-driven modeling and federated analytics pilots. Insights from the QUALITOP oncology study and a distributed AI platform confirm both feasibility and challenges: aligning with HL7 FHIR and OMOP standards, embedding privacy governance, scaling federated queries, and designing intuitive clinician interfaces. We also highlight technical gains, such as automated reasoning over multimodal blueprints and predictive analytics for patient outcomes. By reflecting on these experiences, we outline actionable insights for software engineers and identify opportunities, such as DSLs and model-driven engineering, to advance PMDTs toward trustworthy, adaptive chronic care ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Agent-Diff: Benchmarking LLM Agents on Enterprise API Tasks via Code Execution with State-Diff-Based Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Agent-Diff, a novel benchmarking framework for evaluating agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) on real-world tasks that execute code via external APIs. Agentic LLM performance varies due to differences in models, external tool access, prompt structures, and agentic frameworks. Benchmarks must make fundamental trade-offs between a sandboxed approach that controls for variation in software environments and more ecologically valid approaches employing real services. Agent-Diff attempts to capture the desirable features of both of these approaches by including access to the real API interfaces for software services while sandboxing the environment in which calls are made, processed, and evaluated. This approach relies on two key innovations. The first is a novel state-diff contract, which separates process from outcome - rather than fuzzy trace or parameter matching, we define task success as whether the expected change in environment state was achieved. The second is a novel sandbox that provides a standardized scripting layer that all models use to execute code against external APIs (Slack, Box, Linear, Google Calendar). Thus, we can evaluate different agentic LLMs against a standardized set of contracts using a unified sandbox while still evaluating their performance on real-world service interfaces. Using the Agent-Diff framework, we provide benchmarks for nine LLMs across 224 tasks utilizing enterprise software workflows. In addition, we evaluate the robustness of the framework with ablation experiments to assess the contribution of access to API documentation on benchmark performance.

      <title>Improving the Robustness of Large Language Models for Code Tasks via Fine-tuning with Perturbed Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: In the fast-paced evolution of software development, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for tasks such as code generation, completion, analysis, and bug fixing. Ensuring the robustness of these models against potential vulnerabilities from handling diverse inputs is critical, as variations in input can lead to incorrect or insecure code outputs.
  Objective: This work aims to improve the robustness of LLMs for coding-related tasks against potential adversarial inputs. Specifically, we investigate how fine-tuning LLMs with perturbed datasets impacts their robustness against input perturbations.
  Method: We systematically evaluated LLM robustness by fine-tuning models using datasets perturbed at character-level, word-level, and sentence-level, comparing results against base models and models fine-tuned on unperturbed datasets.
  Results: Fine-tuning LLMs with perturbed datasets significantly improves model robustness (RD usually drops around 4\% - 6\%), especially for models with relatively weak robustness. However, this fine-tuning process typically results in a slight performance decrease (pass@1 usually drops around 1\% - 3\%) compared to fine-tuning with unperturbed datasets, although occasional performance improvements are observed.
  Conclusion \&amp; Implications: Fine-tuning LLMs for coding tasks with perturbed data effectively enhances their robustness at the cost of a minor performance reduction, emphasizing the importance of balancing the robustness and performance of LLMs for coding applications.</description>

      <title>A Grounded Theory of Debugging in Professional Software Engineering Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Debugging is a central yet complex activity in software engineering. Prior studies have documented debugging strategies and tool usage, but little theory explains how experienced developers reason about bugs in large, real-world codebases. We conducted a qualitative study using a grounded theory approach. We observed seven professional developers and five professional live-coding streamers working on 17 debugging tasks in their own codebases, capturing diverse contexts of debugging. We theorize debugging as a structured, iterative diagnostic process in which programmers update a mental model of the system to guide information gathering. Developers gather information by alternating between navigation and execution strategies, employing forward and backward tracing modes of reasoning and adapting these approaches according to codebase context, complexity, and familiarity. Developers also gather external resources to complement code-based evidence, with their experience enabling them to systematically construct a mental model. We contribute a grounded theory of professional debugging that surfaces the human-centered dimensions of the practice, with implications for tool design and software engineering education.</description>

      <title>Addressing OSS Community Managers' Challenges in Contributor Retention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-source software (OSS) community managers face significant challenges in retaining contributors, as they must monitor activity and engagement while navigating complex dynamics of collaboration. Current tools designed for managing contributor retention (e.g., dashboards) fall short by providing retrospective rather than predictive insights to identify potential disengagement early. Without understanding how to anticipate and prevent disengagement, new solutions risk burdening community managers rather than supporting retention management. Following the Design Science Research paradigm, we employed a mixed-methods approach for problem identification and solution design to address contributor retention. To identify the challenges hindering retention management in OSS, we conducted semi-structured interviews, a multi-vocal literature review, and community surveys. Then through an iterative build-evaluate cycle, we developed and refined strategies for diagnosing retention risks and informing engagement efforts. We operationalized these strategies into a web-based prototype, incorporating feedback from 100+ OSS practitioners, and conducted an in situ evaluation across two OSS communities. Our study offers (1) empirical insights into the challenges of contributor retention management in OSS, (2) actionable strategies that support OSS community managers' retention efforts, and (3) a practical framework for future research in developing or validating theories about OSS sustainability.</description>

      <title>Search-Based Quantum Program Testing via Commuting Pauli String</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum software testing is important for reliable quantum software engineering. Despite recent advances, existing quantum software testing approaches rely on simple test inputs and statistical oracles, costly program specifications, and limited validation on real quantum computers. To address these challenges, we propose SB-QOPS, a search-based quantum program testing approach via commuting Pauli strings. SB-QOPS, as a direct extension to a previously proposed QOPS approach, redefines test cases in terms of Pauli strings and introduces a measurement-centric oracle that exploits their commutation properties, enabling effective testing of quantum programs while reducing the need for full program specifications. By systematically exploring the search space through an expectation-value-based fitness function, SB-QOPS improves test budget utilization and increases the likelihood of uncovering subtle faults. We conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation on quantum circuits of up to 29 qubits on real quantum computers and emulators. We assess three search strategies: Genetic Algorithm, Hill Climbing, and the (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm, and evaluate SB-QOPS under both simulated and real noisy conditions. Experiments span three quantum computing platforms: IBM, IQM, and Quantinuum. Results show that SB-QOPS significantly outperforms QOPS, achieving a fault-detection score of 100% for circuits up to 29 qubits, and demonstrating portability across quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>How Smart Is Your GUI Agent? A Framework for the Future of Software Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GUI agents are rapidly becoming a new interaction to software, allowing people to navigate web, desktop and mobile rather than execute them click by click. Yet ``agent'' is described with radically different degrees of autonomy, obscuring capability, responsibility and risk. We call for conceptual clarity through GUI Agent Autonomy Levels (GAL), a six-level framework that makes autonomy explicit and helps benchmark progress toward trustworthy software interaction.</description>

      <title>Do Not Treat Code as Natural Language: Implications for Repository-Level Code Generation and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models for code (CodeLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in standalone code completion and generation, sometimes even surpassing human performance, yet their effectiveness diminishes in repository-level settings where cross-file dependencies and structural context are essential. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches often borrow strategies from NLP, relying on chunking-based indexing and similarity-based retrieval. Chunking results in the loss of coherence between code units and overlooks structural relationships, while similarity-driven methods frequently miss functionally relevant dependencies such as helper functions, classes, or global variables. To address these limitations, we present Hydra, a repository-level code generation framework that treats code as structured code rather than natural language. Our approach introduces (i) a structure-aware indexing strategy that represents repositories as hierarchical trees of functions, classes, and variables, preserving code structure and dependencies, (ii) a lightweight dependency-aware retriever (DAR) that explicitly identifies and retrieves the true dependencies required by a target function, and (iii) a hybrid retrieval mechanism that combines DAR with similarity-based retrieval to provide both essential building blocks and practical usage examples. Extensive experiments on the challenging DevEval and RepoExec benchmarks, both requiring function implementation from real-world repositories with complex large repository context, show that Hydra achieves state-of-the-art performance across open- and closed-source CodeLLMs. Notably, our method establishes a new state of the art in repository-level code generation, surpassing strongest baseline by over 5% in Pass@1 and even enabling smaller models to match or exceed the performance of much larger ones that rely on existing retrievers.</description>

      <title>Beyond Code: Empirical Insights into How Team Dynamics Influence OSS Project Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-source software (OSS) development relies on effective collaboration among distributed contributors. Yet, current OSS project recommendation systems primarily emphasize technical attributes, overlooking the collaboration and community aspects that influence contributors' decisions to join and remain in projects. This study investigates how team dynamics within OSS communities influence project selection and how these preferences vary across contributors' motivations. We conducted an online survey with 198 OSS practitioners, combining quantitative and qualitative analyses to capture contributors' perceptions of team dynamics. The results reveal that communication-related team dynamics such as responsiveness, tone, and clarity of replies are consistently prioritized across practitioners. However, the relative importance of these team dynamics differs according to contributors' motivations. For instance, practitioners motivated by gaining reputation or networking preferred inclusive project communities that encouraged diverse participation. These findings highlight that understanding how team dynamics align with contributors' motivations provides valuable insights into practitioners' project selection behaviour. Those insights can inform the design of future human-aware project recommendation systems that better account for social collaboration quality and motivational fit.</description>

      <title>WebTestPilot: Agentic End-to-End Web Testing against Natural Language Specification by Inferring Oracles with Symbolized GUI Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual language model (VLM) agents show great promise in automating end-to-end (E2E) web testing against requirements in natural language. However, the probabilistic nature of language models can have inherent hallucinations. Therefore, given a detected inconsistency between the requirement and the web application, it is hard to distinguish whether it stems from the hallucination or a real application bug. Addressing this issue presents two core technical challenges: the implicit oracle inference challenge, where the agent must act as its own oracle to implicitly decide if the application's behavior is correct without guidance, and the probabilistic inference challenge, where an LLM's inconsistent reasoning undermines its trustworthiness as an oracle. Existing LLM-based approaches fail to capture such implicit oracles, either by treating any page navigation that doesn't crash as a success, or by checking each state in isolation, thus missing bugs dependent on context from prior steps.
  We introduce WebTestPilot, an LLM-based agent designed to address these challenges. WebTestPilot uses (1) a symbolization layer which detects and symbolizes critical GUI elements on the web application into symbols (i.e., variables) and (2) translates natural language specification into a sequence of steps, each of which is equipped with inferred pre- and post-conditions over the symbols as an oracle. This oracle captures data, temporal, and causal dependencies, enabling the validation of implicit requirements. To advance research in this area, we build a benchmark of bug-injected web apps for evaluating NL-to-E2E testing. The results show that WebTestPilot achieves a task completion rate of 99%, with 96% precision and 96% recall in bug detection, outperforming the best baseline (+70 precision, +27 recall). The agent generalizes across diverse natural language inputs and model scales.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Language Models to Discover Evidence-Based Actions for OSS Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When successful, Open Source Software (OSS) projects create enormous value, but most never reach a sustainable state. Recent work has produced accurate models that forecast OSS sustainability, yet these models rarely tell maintainers what to do: their features are often high-level socio-technical signals that are not directly actionable. Decades of empirical software engineering research have accumulated a large but underused body of evidence on concrete practices that improve project health.
  We close this gap by using LLMs as evidence miners over the SE literature. We design a RAG-pipeline and a two-layer prompting strategy that extract researched actionables (ReACTs): concise, evidence-linked recommendations mapping to specific OSS practices. In the first layer, we systematically explore open LLMs and prompting techniques, selecting the best-performing combination to derive candidate ReACTs from 829 ICSE and FSE papers. In the second layer, we apply follow-up prompting to filter hallucinations, extract impact and evidence, and assess soundness and precision.
  Our pipeline yields 1,922 ReACTs, of which 1,312 pass strict quality criteria and are organized into practice-oriented categories connectable to project signals from tools like APEX. The result is a reproducible, scalable approach turning scattered research findings into structured, evidence-based actions guiding OSS projects toward sustainability.</description>

      <title>AmbiBench: Benchmarking Mobile GUI Agents Beyond One-Shot Instructions in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarks are paramount for gauging progress in the domain of Mobile GUI Agents. In practical scenarios, users frequently fail to articulate precise directives containing full task details at the onset, and their expressions are typically ambiguous. Consequently, agents are required to converge on the user's true intent via active clarification and interaction during execution. However, existing benchmarks predominantly operate under the idealized assumption that user-issued instructions are complete and unequivocal. This paradigm focuses exclusively on assessing single-turn execution while overlooking the alignment capability of the agent. To address this limitation, we introduce AmbiBench, the first benchmark incorporating a taxonomy of instruction clarity to shift evaluation from unidirectional instruction following to bidirectional intent alignment. Grounded in Cognitive Gap theory, we propose a taxonomy of four clarity levels: Detailed, Standard, Incomplete, and Ambiguous. We construct a rigorous dataset of 240 ecologically valid tasks across 25 applications, subject to strict review protocols. Furthermore, targeting evaluation in dynamic environments, we develop MUSE (Mobile User Satisfaction Evaluator), an automated framework utilizing an MLLM-as-a-judge multi-agent architecture. MUSE performs fine-grained auditing across three dimensions: Outcome Effectiveness, Execution Quality, and Interaction Quality. Empirical results on AmbiBench reveal the performance boundaries of SoTA agents across different clarity levels, quantify the gains derived from active interaction, and validate the strong correlation between MUSE and human judgment. This work redefines evaluation standards, laying the foundation for next-generation agents capable of truly understanding user intent.</description>

      <title>Verifiable Provenance of Software Artifacts with Zero-Knowledge Compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verifying that a compiled binary originates from its claimed source code is a fundamental security requirement, called source code provenance. Achieving verifiable source code provenance in practice remains challenging. The most popular technique, called reproducible builds, requires difficult matching and reexecution of build toolchains and environments. We propose a novel approach to verifiable provenance based on compiling software with zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs). By executing a compiler within a zkVM, our system produces both the compiled output and a cryptographic proof attesting that the compilation was performed on the claimed source code with the claimed compiler. We implement a proof-of-concept implementation using the RISC Zero zkVM and the ChibiCC C compiler, and evaluate it on 200 synthetic programs as well as 31 OpenSSL and 21 libsodium source files. Our results show that zk-compilation is applicable to real-world software and provides strong security guarantees: all adversarial tests targeting compiler substitution, source tampering, output manipulation, and replay attacks are successfully blocked.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLMs to support co-evolution between definitions and instances of textual DSLs: A Systematic Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software languages evolve over time for reasons such as feature additions. When grammars evolve, textual instances that originally conformed to them may become outdated. While model-driven engineering provides many techniques for co-evolving models with metamodel changes, these approaches are not designed for textual DSLs and may lose human-relevant information such as layout and comments. This study systematically evaluates the potential of large language models (LLMs) for co-evolving grammars and instances of textual DSLs. Using Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5.2 across ten case languages with ten runs each, we assess both correctness and preservation of human-oriented information. Results show strong performance on small-scale cases ($\geq$94% precision and recall for instances requiring fewer than 20 modified lines), but performance degraded with scale: Claude maintains 85% recall at 40 lines, while GPT fails on the largest instances. Response time increases substantially with instance size, and grammar evolution complexity and deletion granularity affect performance more than change type. These findings clarify when LLM-based co-evolution is effective and where current limitations remain.</description>

      <title>Improving Code Generation via Small Language Model-as-a-judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in automated code generation. While effective for mainstream languages, they may underperform on less common or domain-specific languages, prompting companies to develop in-house code generators. While open-source models can be trained for this, only LLMs with tens of billions of parameters match the performance of commercial tools, demanding costly training and deployment. Recent work proposed supporting code generation with smaller models (SLMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and using another SLM to select the most likely correct one. The most recent work in this area is the one by Sun et al. [29] presenting RankEF, a T5 model trained to rank code solutions using both execution-based and non-execution-based information. However, Sun et al. do not assess the T5 ranker's classification accuracy, that is, how often it misjudges correct implementations as incorrect or vice versa, leaving open questions about the reliability of LMs as code correctness judges for other tasks (e.g., automated code review). Moreover, their experiments involve relatively old models, making it unclear the extent to which such a methodology would still help companies in cheaply training their own code generators with performance comparable to those of massive LLMs. We present a study addressing these limitations. We train several state-of-the-art SLMs as code correctness judges and assess their ability to discriminate between correct and wrong implementations. We show that modern SLMs outperform RankEF, even without exploiting execution-based information. When used as code rankers, they achieve higher performance gains than RankEF and perform competitively with LLMs 5-25x larger, at a fraction of the cost.</description>

      <title>Studying Quality Improvements Recommended via Manual and Automated Code Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several Deep Learning (DL)-based techniques have been proposed to automate code review. Still, it is unclear the extent to which these approaches can recommend quality improvements as a human reviewer. We study the similarities and differences between code reviews performed by humans and those automatically generated by DL models, using ChatGPT-4 as representative of the latter. In particular, we run a mining-based study in which we collect and manually inspect 739 comments posted by human reviewers to suggest code changes in 240 PRs. The manual inspection aims at classifying the type of quality improvement recommended by human reviewers (e.g., rename variable/constant). Then, we ask ChatGPT to perform a code review on the same PRs and we compare the quality improvements it recommends against those suggested by the human reviewers. We show that while, on average, ChatGPT tends to recommend a higher number of code changes as compared to human reviewers (~2.4x more), it can only spot 10% of the quality issues reported by humans. However, ~40% of the additional comments generated by the LLM point to meaningful quality issues. In short, our findings show the complementarity of manual and AI-based code review. This finding suggests that, in its current state, DL-based code review can be used as a further quality check on top of the one performed by humans, but should not be considered as a valid alternative to them nor as a mean to save code review time, since human reviewers would still need to perform their manual inspection while also validating the quality issues reported by the DL-based technique.</description>

      <title>Evaluating AGENTS.md: Are Repository-Level Context Files Helpful for Coding Agents?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A widespread practice in software development is to tailor coding agents to repositories using context files, such as AGENTS.md, by either manually or automatically generating them. Although this practice is strongly encouraged by agent developers, there is currently no rigorous investigation into whether such context files are actually effective for real-world tasks. In this work, we study this question and evaluate coding agents' task completion performance in two complementary settings: established SWE-bench tasks from popular repositories, with LLM-generated context files following agent-developer recommendations, and a novel collection of issues from repositories containing developer-committed context files.
  Across multiple coding agents and LLMs, we find that context files tend to reduce task success rates compared to providing no repository context, while also increasing inference cost by over 20%. Behaviorally, both LLM-generated and developer-provided context files encourage broader exploration (e.g., more thorough testing and file traversal), and coding agents tend to respect their instructions. Ultimately, we conclude that unnecessary requirements from context files make tasks harder, and human-written context files should describe only minimal requirements.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of the Imbalance Issue in Software Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vulnerability detection is crucial to protect software security. Nowadays, deep learning (DL) is the most promising technique to automate this detection task, leveraging its superior ability to extract patterns and representations within extensive code volumes. Despite its promise, DL-based vulnerability detection remains in its early stages, with model performance exhibiting variability across datasets. Drawing insights from other well-explored application areas like computer vision, we conjecture that the imbalance issue (the number of vulnerable code is extremely small) is at the core of the phenomenon. To validate this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study involving nine open-source datasets and two state-of-the-art DL models. The results confirm our conjecture. We also obtain insightful findings on how existing imbalance solutions perform in vulnerability detection. It turns out that these solutions perform differently as well across datasets and evaluation metrics. Specifically: 1) Focal loss is more suitable to improve the precision, 2) mean false error and class-balanced loss encourages the recall, and 3) random over-sampling facilitates the F1-measure. However, none of them excels across all metrics. To delve deeper, we explore external influences on these solutions and offer insights for developing new solutions.</description>

      <title>ModelWisdom: An Integrated Toolkit for TLA+ Model Visualization, Digest and Repair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model checking in TLA+ provides strong correctness guarantees, yet practitioners continue to face significant challenges in interpreting counterexamples, understanding large state-transition graphs, and repairing faulty models. These difficulties stem from the limited explainability of raw model-checker output and the substantial manual effort required to trace violations back to source specifications. Although the TLA+ Toolbox includes a state diagram viewer, it offers only a static, fully expanded graph without folding, color highlighting, or semantic explanations, which limits its scalability and interpretability. We present ModelWisdom, an interactive environment that uses visualization and large language models to make TLA+ model checking more interpretable and actionable. ModelWisdom offers: (i) Model Visualization, with colorized violation highlighting, click-through links from transitions to TLA+ code, and mapping between violating states and broken properties; (ii) Graph Optimization, including tree-based structuring and node/edge folding to manage large models; (iii) Model Digest, which summarizes and explains subgraphs via large language models (LLMs) and performs preprocessing and partial explanations; and (iv) Model Repair, which extracts error information and supports iterative debugging. Together, these capabilities turn raw model-checker output into an interactive, explainable workflow, improving understanding and reducing debugging effort for nontrivial TLA+ specifications. The website to ModelWisdom is available: https://model-wisdom.pages.dev. A demonstrative video can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plyZo30VShA.</description>

      <title>Performance Antipatterns: Angel or Devil for Power Consumption?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performance antipatterns are known to degrade the responsiveness of microservice-based systems, but their impact on energy consumption remains largely unexplored. This paper empirically investigates whether widely studied performance antipatterns defined by Smith and Williams also negatively influence power usage. We implement ten antipatterns as isolated microservices and evaluate them under controlled load conditions, collecting synchronized measurements of performance, CPU and DRAM power consumption, and resource utilization across 30 repeated runs per antipattern. The results show that while all antipatterns degrade performance as expected, only a subset exhibit a statistically significant relationship between response time and increased power consumption. Specifically, several antipatterns reach CPU saturation, capping power draw regardless of rising response time, whereas others (\eg Unnecessary Processing, The Ramp) demonstrate energy-performance coupling indicative of inefficiency. Our results show that, while all injected performance antipatterns increase response time as expected, only a subset also behaves as clear energy antipatterns, with several cases reaching a nearly constant CPU power level where additional slowdowns mainly translate into longer execution time rather than higher instantaneous power consumption. The study provides a systematic foundation for identifying performance antipatterns that also behave as energy antipatterns and offers actionable insights for designing more energy-efficient microservices architectures.</description>

Abstract: Modern container-based microservices evolve through rapid deployment cycles, but CI/CD pipelines still rarely measure energy consumption, even though prior work shows that design patterns, code smells and refactorings affect energy efficiency. We present PPTAM$\eta$, an automated pipeline that integrates power and energy measurement into GitLab CI for containerised API systems, coordinating load generation, container monitoring and hardware power probes to collect comparable metrics at each commit. The pipeline makes energy visible to developers, supports version comparison for test engineers and enables trend analysis for researchers. We evaluate PPTAM$\eta$ on a JWT-authenticated API across four commits, collecting performance and energy metrics and summarising the architecture, measurement methodology and validation.</description>

      <title>On the Adoption of AI Coding Agents in Open-source Android and iOS Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI coding agents are increasingly contributing to software development, yet their impact on mobile development has received little empirical attention. In this paper, we present the first category-level empirical study of agent-generated code in open-source mobile app projects. We analyzed PR acceptance behaviors across mobile platforms, agents, and task categories using 2,901 AI-authored pull requests (PRs) in 193 verified Android and iOS open-source GitHub repositories in the AIDev dataset. We find that Android projects have received 2x more AI-authored PRs and have achieved higher PR acceptance rate (71%) than iOS (63%), with significant agent-level variation on Android. Across task categories, PRs with routine tasks (feature, fix, and ui) achieve the highest acceptance, while structural changes like refactor and build achieve lower success and longer resolution times. Furthermore, our evolution analysis shows improvement in PR resolution time on Android through mid-2025 before it declined again. Our findings offer the first evidence-based characterization of AI agents effects on OSS mobile projects and establish empirical baselines for evaluating agent-generated contributions to design platform aware agentic systems.</description>

      <title>Automated Test Suite Enhancement Using Large Language Models with Few-shot Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unit testing is essential for verifying the functional correctness of code modules (e.g., classes, methods), but manually writing unit tests is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. Unit tests generated by tools that employ traditional approaches, such as search-based software testing (SBST), lack readability, naturalness, and practical usability. LLMs have recently provided promising results and become integral to developers' daily practices. Consequently, software repositories now include a mix of human-written tests, LLM-generated tests, and those from tools employing traditional approaches such as SBST. While LLMs' zero-shot capabilities have been widely studied, their few-shot learning potential for unit test generation remains underexplored. Few-shot prompting enables LLMs to learn from examples in the prompt, and automatically retrieving such examples could enhance test suites. This paper empirically investigates how few-shot prompting with different test artifact sources, comprising human, SBST, or LLM, affects the quality of LLM-generated unit tests as program comprehension artifacts and their contribution to improving existing test suites by evaluating not only correctness and coverage but also readability, cognitive complexity, and maintainability in hybrid human-AI codebases. We conducted experiments on HumanEval and ClassEval datasets using GPT-4o, which is integrated into GitHub Copilot and widely used among developers. We also assessed retrieval-based methods for selecting relevant examples. Our results show that LLMs can generate high-quality tests via few-shot prompting, with human-written examples producing the best coverage and correctness. Additionally, selecting examples based on the combined similarity of problem description and code consistently yields the most effective few-shot prompts.</description>

Abstract: In the late 1970s, C.A. Petri introduced partially ordered event occurrences (runs), then called \emph{processes}, as the appropriate model to describe the individual evolutions of distributed systems. Here, we present a unified framework for handling Petri nets and their runs, specifically to compose and decompose them. It is shown that, for nets $M$ and $N$, the set of runs of the composed net $M \bullet N$ equals the composition of the runs of $M$ and $N$.</description>

      <title>Transferable Backdoor Attacks for Code Models via Sharpness-Aware Adversarial Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code models are increasingly adopted in software development but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks via poisoned training data. Existing backdoor attacks on code models face a fundamental trade-off between transferability and stealthiness. Static trigger-based attacks insert fixed dead code patterns that transfer well across models and datasets but are easily detected by code-specific defenses. In contrast, dynamic trigger-based attacks adaptively generate context-aware triggers to evade detection but suffer from poor cross-dataset transferability. Moreover, they rely on unrealistic assumptions of identical data distributions between poisoned and victim training data, limiting their practicality. To overcome these limitations, we propose Sharpness-aware Transferable Adversarial Backdoor (STAB), a novel attack that achieves both transferability and stealthiness without requiring complete victim data. STAB is motivated by the observation that adversarial perturbations in flat regions of the loss landscape transfer more effectively across datasets than those in sharp minima. To this end, we train a surrogate model using Sharpness-Aware Minimization to guide model parameters toward flat loss regions, and employ Gumbel-Softmax optimization to enable differentiable search over discrete trigger tokens for generating context-aware adversarial triggers. Experiments across three datasets and two code models show that STAB outperforms prior attacks in terms of transferability and stealthiness. It achieves a 73.2% average attack success rate after defense, outperforming static trigger-based attacks that fail under defense. STAB also surpasses the best dynamic trigger-based attack by 12.4% in cross-dataset attack success rate and maintains performance on clean inputs.</description>

      <title>Yaksha-Prashna: Understanding eBPF Bytecode Network Function Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many cloud infrastructure organizations increasingly rely on third-party eBPF-based network functions for use cases like security, observability, and load balancing, so that not everyone requires a team of highly skilled eBPF experts. However, the network functions from third parties (e.g., F5, Palo Alto) are available in bytecode format to cloud operators, giving little or no understanding of their functional correctness and interaction with other network functions in a chain. Also, eBPF developers want to provide proof of functional correctness for their developed network functions without disclosing the source code to the operators. We design Yaksha-Prashna, a system that allows operators/developers to assert and query bytecode's conformance to its specification and dependencies on other bytecodes. Our work builds domain-specific models that enable us to employ scalable program analysis to extract and model eBPF programs. Using Yaksha-Prashna language, we express 24 properties on standard and non-standard eBPF-based network functions with 200-1000x speedup over the state-of-the-art work.</description>

      <title>Cross-Architecture Model Diffing with Crosscoders: Unsupervised Discovery of Differences Between LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model diffing, the process of comparing models' internal representations to identify their differences, is a promising approach for uncovering safety-critical behaviors in new models. However, its application has so far been primarily focused on comparing a base model with its finetune. Since new LLM releases are often novel architectures, cross-architecture methods are essential to make model diffing widely applicable. Crosscoders are one solution capable of cross-architecture model diffing but have only ever been applied to base vs finetune comparisons. We provide the first application of crosscoders to cross-architecture model diffing and introduce Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs), an architectural modification designed to better isolate features unique to one model. Using this technique, we find in an unsupervised fashion features including Chinese Communist Party alignment in Qwen3-8B and Deepseek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, American exceptionalism in Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, and a copyright refusal mechanism in GPT-OSS-20B. Together, our results work towards establishing cross-architecture crosscoder model diffing as an effective method for identifying meaningful behavioral differences between AI models.</description>

      <title>Designing Scalable Rate Limiting Systems: Algorithms, Architecture, and Distributed Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing a rate limiter that is simultaneously accurate, available, and scalable presents a fundamental challenge in distributed systems, primarily due to the trade-offs between algorithmic precision, availability, consistency, and partition tolerance. This article presents a concrete architecture for a distributed rate limiting system in a production-grade environment. Our design chooses the in-memory cache database, the Redis, along with its Sorted Set data structure, which provides $O(log (N))$ time complexity operation for the key-value pair dataset with efficiency and low latency, and maintains precision. The core contribution is quantifying the accuracy and memory cost trade-off of the chosen Rolling Window as the implemented rate limiting algorithm against the Token Bucket and Fixed Window algorithms. In addition, we explain how server-side Lua scripting is critical to bundling cleanup, counting, and insertion into a single atomic operation, thereby eliminating race conditions in concurrent environments. In the system architecture, we propose a three-layer architecture that manages the storage and updating of the limit rules. Through script load by hashing the rule parameters, rules can be changed without modifying the cached scripts. Furthermore, we analyze the deployment of this architecture on a Redis Cluster, which provides the availability and scalability by data sharding and replication. We explain the acceptance of AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance) from the CAP theorem as the pragmatic engineering trade-off for this use case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explanations are essential for helping users interpret and trust autonomous smart-home decisions, yet evaluating their quality and impact remains methodologically difficult in this domain. V-SHiNE addresses this gap: a browser-based smarthome simulation framework for scalable and realistic assessment of explanations. It allows researchers to configure environments, simulate behaviors, and plug in custom explanation engines, with flexible delivery modes and rich interaction logging. A study with 159 participants demonstrates its feasibility. V-SHiNE provides a lightweight, reproducible platform for advancing user-centered evaluation of explainable intelligent systems</description>

      <title>FlowMind: Execute-Summarize for Structured Workflow Generation from LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs can solve complex tasks through reasoning and tool use, but accurately translating these solutions into structured workflows remains challenging. We model workflows as sequences of tool use and reformulate the problem as designing a mechanism that can both solve tasks and reliably construct workflows. Prior approaches that build workflows during execution often suffer from inaccuracies due to interference between the two processes. We propose an Execute-Summarize(ES) framework that decouples task execution from workflow construction: the model first completes the task using available tools, then independently reconstructs a structured workflow from execution traces. This separation improves workflow accuracy and robustness. We introduce FlowBench and show through extensive experiments that our approach outperforms existing methods, providing a reliable paradigm for grounding free-form LLM reasoning into structured workflows.</description>

      <title>Unknown Attack Detection in IoT Networks using Large Language Models: A Robust, Data-efficient Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of cyberattacks continues to drive the emergence of unknown (zero-day) threats, posing significant challenges for network intrusion detection systems in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Existing machine learning and deep learning approaches typically rely on large labeled datasets, payload inspection, or closed-set classification, limiting their effectiveness under data scarcity, encrypted traffic, and distribution shifts. Consequently, detecting unknown attacks in realistic IoT deployments remains difficult. To address these limitations, we propose SiamXBERT, a robust and data-efficient Siamese meta-learning framework empowered by a transformer-based language model for unknown attack detection. The proposed approach constructs a dual-modality feature representation by integrating flow-level and packet-level information, enabling richer behavioral modeling while remaining compatible with encrypted traffic. Through meta-learning, the model rapidly adapts to new attack types using only a small number of labeled samples and generalizes to previously unseen behaviors. Extensive experiments on representative IoT intrusion datasets demonstrate that SiamXBERT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under both within-dataset and cross-dataset settings while requiring significantly less training data, achieving up to \num{78.8}\% improvement in unknown F1-score. These results highlight the practicality of SiamXBERT for robust unknown attack detection in real-world IoT environments.</description>

      <title>EvoGPT: Leveraging LLM-Driven Seed Diversity to Improve Search-Based Test Suite Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12424v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) is a well-established approach for automated unit test generation, yet it often suffers from premature convergence and limited diversity in the generated test suites. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as an alternative technique for unit test generation. We present EvoGPT, a hybrid test generation system that integrates LLM-based test generation with SBST-based test suite optimization. EvoGPT uses LLMs to generate an initial population of test suites, and uses an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to further optimize this test suite population. A distinguishing feature of EvoGPT is its explicit enforcement of diversity, achieved through the use of multiple temperatures and prompt instructions during test generation. In addition, each LLM-generated test is refined using a generation-repair loop and coverage-guided assertion generation. To address evolutionary plateaus, EvoGPT also detects stagnation during search and injects additional LLM-generated tests aimed at previously uncovered branches. Here too diversity is enforced using multiple temperatures and prompt instructions. We evaluate EvoGPT on Defects4J, a standard benchmark for test generation. The results show that EvoGPT achieves, on average, a 10% improvement in both code coverage and mutation score metrics compared to TestART, an LLM-only baseline; and EvoSuite, a standard SBST baseline. An ablation study indicates that explicitly enforcing diversity both at initialization and during the search is key to effectively leveraging LLMs for automated unit test generation.</description>

      <title>When Domains Collide: An Activity Theory Exploration of Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20063v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Software development teams are increasingly diverse, embedded, and cross-disciplinary. Domain experts (DEs) from different disciplines collaborate with professional software developers (SDEs), bringing complementary expertise in creating and maintaining complex production software. However, contested expectations, divergent problem-solving perspectives, and conflicting priorities lead to friction. Aims: This study aims to investigate the dynamics of emerging collaboration of cross-disciplinary software development (CDSD) by exploring the expectations held by DEs and SDEs and understanding how these frictions manifest in practice. Method: We utilize Activity Theory (AT), a well-established socio-technical framework, as an analytical lens in a grounded, empirical investigation, conducted through a mixed-method study involving 24 interviews (12 DEs and 12 SDEs) and a large-scale validation survey with 293 participants (161 DEs and 132 SDEs). Results: We conceptualize and empirically ground the CDSD dynamics. We identified eight expectations held by SDEs and six by DEs. By mapping these expectations to AT components, we revealed 21 frictions in CDSD and illustrated where and how they arise. Conclusions: This study offers a theoretical lens for understanding the dynamics and frictions in CDSD and provides actionable insights for future research, practitioners, and infrastructure design.</description>

      <title>Combining Example-Based and Rule-Based Program Transformations to Resolve Build Conflicts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Merge conflicts often arise when developers integrate changes from different software branches. The conflicts can result from overlapping edits in programs (i.e., textual conflicts) or cause build and test errors (i.e., build and test conflicts). They degrade software quality and hinder programmer productivity. While several tools detect build conflicts, few offer meaningful support for resolving them. To overcome limitations of existing tools, we introduce BuCoR (Build Conflict Resolver), a new conflict resolver. BuCoR first detects conflicts by comparing three versions related to a merging scenario: base b, left l, and right r. To resolve conflicts, it employs two complementary strategies: example-based transformation (BuCoR-E) and rule-based transformation (BuCoR-R). BuCoR-R applies predefined rules to resolve conflicts in frequently suggested or conventional ways. BuCoR-E mines branch versions (l and r) for exemplar edits applied to fix related build errors. From these examples, it infers and generalizes program transformation patterns to resolve conflicts in project-specific or unconventional ways.
  We evaluated BuCoR on 88 real-world build conflicts spanning 21 distinct conflict types. BuCoR generated at least one solution for 65 cases and correctly resolved 34 conflicts. We observed that this hybrid approach--combining context-aware, example-based learning with structured, rule-based resolution--can effectively help resolve conflicts. Our research sheds light on future directions for more intelligent and automated merge tools.</description>

      <title>VibeCodeHPC: An Agent-Based Iterative Prompting Auto-Tuner for HPC Code Generation Using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose VibeCodeHPC, a multi-agent system based on large language models (LLMs) for the automatic tuning of high-performance computing (HPC) programs on supercomputers. VibeCodeHPC adopts Claude Code as its backend and provides an integrated environment that facilitates program development in supercomputer settings. The system not only brings the Vibe Coding paradigm -- program development through natural language interaction with users -- to HPC programming, but also enables autonomous performance optimization with minimal user intervention through a sophisticated multi-agent design. To achieve these objectives, VibeCodeHPC implements three core functionalities: (1) configuration capabilities tailored to the unique development environments of supercomputers, (2) collaborative operation among multiple LLM agents with distinct roles -- Project Manager (PM), System Engineer (SE), Programmer (PG), and Continuous Deliverer (CD), and (3) long-term autonomous operation through agent activity monitoring and dynamic deployment mechanisms. This paper highlights one of the most powerful features of VibeCodeHPC: fully automated code optimization through autonomous operation without user intervention. Specifically, it demonstrates the performance optimization of CPU-based codes on GPU-equipped systems for matrix multiplication and a Poisson equation solver using Jacobi's iterative method. The results show that the multi-agent configuration employed in VibeCodeHPC enables faster and more reliable development of higher-performance code compared to a single-agent setup.</description>

      <title>Toward Linking Declined Proposals and Source Code: An Exploratory Study on the Go Repository</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traceability links are key information sources for software developers, connecting software artifacts (e.g., linking requirements to the corresponding source code). In open-source software (OSS) projects, such links play an important role, particularly between the contributions (e.g., GitHub issues) and the corresponding source code. Through these links, developers can trace the discussions in contributions and uncover design rationales, constraints, and security concerns. Previous studies have mainly examined accepted contributions, while those declined after discussion have been overlooked. The discussions behind declined contributions contain valuable design rationales and implicit knowledge about software decision-making, as the reasons behind the decline often reveal the criteria used to judge what should or should not be implemented. In this study, we present the first attempt to establish traceability links between declined contributions and related source code. We propose an initial linking approach and conduct an empirical analysis of the generated links to discuss factors affecting link generation. As our dataset, we use proposals from the official Go repository, which are GitHub issues used to propose new features or language changes. To link declined proposals to source code, we designed an LLM-driven pipeline. Our results showed that the pipeline selected the correct granularity for each declined proposal with an accuracy of 0.836, and generated correct links at that granularity with a mean precision of 0.643. To clarify the challenges of linking declined proposals, we performed a failure analysis. In the declined proposals where the pipeline failed to generate links, the discussions were often redundant and lacked concrete information (e.g., how the feature should be implemented).</description>

      <title>BYOS: Knowledge-driven Large Language Models Bring Your Own Operating System More Excellent</title>

Abstract: Operating system (OS) kernel tuning is a critical yet challenging problem for performance optimization, due to the large configuration space, complex interdependencies among configuration options, and the rapid evolution of kernel versions. Recent work has explored large language models (LLMs) for automated kernel tuning, but existing approaches often suffer from hallucinated configurations, limited interpretability, and poor robustness across workloads and kernel versions. We propose BYOS, a knowledge-driven framework that grounds LLM-based Linux kernel tuning in structured domain knowledge. BYOS incorporates three key components: (1) structured knowledge construction and mapping to bridge the semantic gap, (2) knowledge-driven configuration generation to refine the search space, and (3) continuous knowledge maintenance to adapt to kernel evolution. We evaluate BYOS on diverse workloads across multiple Linux distributions and kernel versions. Experimental results show that BYOS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuning baselines, achieving 7.1%-155.4% performance improvement while substantially reducing invalid configurations. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating structured knowledge with LLMs for robust and scalable system optimization. The code of BYOS is available at https://github.com/LHY-24/BYOS.</description>

      <title>TreeTensor: Boost AI System on Nested Data with Constrained Tree-Like Tensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor is the most basic and essential data structure of nowadays artificial intelligence (AI) system. The natural properties of Tensor, especially the memory-continuity and slice-independence, make it feasible for training system to leverage parallel computing unit like GPU to process data simultaneously in batch, spatial or temporal dimensions. However, if we look beyond perception tasks, the data in a complicated cognitive AI system usually has hierarchical structures (i.e. nested data) with various modalities. They are inconvenient and inefficient to program directly with conventional Tensor with fixed shape. To address this issue, we summarize two main computational patterns of nested data, and then propose a general nested data container: TreeTensor. Through various constraints and magic utilities of TreeTensor, one can apply arbitrary functions and operations to nested data with almost zero cost, including some famous machine learning libraries, such as Scikit-Learn, Numpy and PyTorch. Our approach utilizes a constrained tree-structure perspective to systematically model data relationships, and it can also easily be combined with other methods to extend more usages, such as asynchronous execution and variable-length data computation. Detailed examples and benchmarks show TreeTensor not only provides powerful usability in various problems, especially one of the most complicated AI systems at present: AlphaStar for StarCraftII, but also exhibits excellent runtime efficiency without any overhead. Our project is available at https://github.com/opendilab/DI-treetensor.</description>
