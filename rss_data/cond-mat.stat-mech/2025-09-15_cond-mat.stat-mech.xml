      <title>Bond percolation in distorted square and triangular lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a Monte Carlo study on bond percolation in distorted square and triangular lattices. The distorted lattices are generated by dislocating the sites from their regular positions. The amount and direction of the dislocations are random, but can be tuned by the distortion parameter $\alpha$. Once the sites are dislocated, the bond lengths $\delta$ between the nearest neighbors change. A bond can only be occupied if its bond length is less than a threshold value called the connection threshold $d$. It is observed that when the connection threshold is greater than the lattice constant (assumed to be $1$), the bond percolation threshold $p_\mathrm{b}$ always increases with distortion. For $d\le 1$, no spanning configuration is found for the square lattice when the lattice is distorted, even very slightly. On the other hand, the triangular lattice not only spans for $d\le 1$, it also shows a decreasing trend for $p_\mathrm{b}$ in the low-$\alpha$ range. These variation patterns have been linked with the average coordination numbers of the distorted lattices. A critical value $d_\mathrm{c}$ for the connection threshold has been defined as the value of $d$ below which no spanning configuration can be found even after occupying all the bonds satisfying the connection criterion $\delta\le d$. The behavior of $d_\mathrm{c}(\alpha)$ is markedly different for the two lattices.</description>

      <title>Universal Driven Critical Dynamics near the Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) describes the scaling of physical quantities when external parameters sweep through a critical point. Boundaries are ubiquitous in real systems, and critical behaviors near the boundary have attracted extensive research. Different boundary universality classes, including ordinary, special, extraordinary, and surface transitions, have been identified. However, the driven critical dynamics near boundaries remains unexplored. Here, we systematically investigate the driven critical dynamics in various boundary universality classes of the Ising model in both two and three dimensions, and discover a wealth of dynamic scaling behaviors. We find that for heating dynamics in all boundary universality classes, as well as for cooling dynamics in special, extraordinary, and surface transitions, the dynamic scaling behaviors of the order parameter can be described by a normal generalization of the KZM, called boundary finite-time scaling (BFTS). In contrast, for cooling dynamics in ordinary transition, we discover an abnormal logarithmic scaling on the driving rate. Moreover, for the special transition, in addition to temperature driving, we also consider the driven dynamics by driving the surface couplings. For increasing the surface coupling across the special transition point along the line of the ordinary transition, the prerequisite of the KZM, which requires that the correlation length/time in the initial state to be short-ranged, breaks down. We develop a generalized BFTS for a nonequilibrium initial state characterized by the waiting time, or the ``age'', of the boundary. Possible generalizations are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality reduction of optically generated vortex strings in a charge density wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In phase transitions, mesoscale structures such as topological defects, vortex strings, and domain walls control the path towards equilibrium, and thus the functional properties of many active devices. In photoinduced phase transitions driven by femtosecond laser excitation, the temporal (pulse duration) and spatial (penetration depth) structure of the optical excitation present opportunities for control and creating structures with unique topologies. By performing time-resolved optical pump, x-ray probe experiments on the CDW system Pd-intercalated ErTe$_{3}$, we gain access to the nanoscale dynamics of the mesoscale topological features (vortex strings) produced after a quench, which have a different apparent dimensionality than the topological defects predicted from the bulk system. We show that these vortex strings persist for much longer than the electronic recovery time. The critical exponent obtained from power-law scaling of the intensity as a function of wavevector shows a reduction in the effective dimensionality of the topological defects in the system, corroborated by time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations. Our results demonstrate a novel pathway to use light to control the dimensionality and orientation of topological defects in quantum materials, which could be used to stabilize competing quantum states.</description>

      <title>What do the fundamental constants of physics tell us about life?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the 1970s, the renowned physicist Victor Weisskopf famously developed a research program to qualitatively explain properties of matter in terms of the fundamental constants of physics. But there was one type of matter prominently missing from Weisskopf's analysis: life. Here, we develop Weisskopf-style arguments demonstrating how the fundamental constants of physics can be used to understand the properties of living systems. By combining biophysical arguments and dimensional analysis, we show that vital properties of chemical self-replicators, such as growth yield, minimum doubling time, and minimum power consumption in dormancy, can be quantitatively estimated using fundamental physical constants. The calculations highlight how the laws of physics constrain chemistry-based life on Earth, and if it exists, elsewhere in our universe.</description>

      <title>Turing patterns on adaptive networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are surrounded by spatio-temporal patterns resulting from the interaction of the numerous basic units constituting natural or human-made systems. In presence of diffusive-like coupling, Turing theory has been largely applied to explain the formation of such self-organized motifs both on continuous domains or networked systems, where reactions occur in the nodes and the available links are used for species to diffuse. In many relevant applications, those links are not static, as very often assumed, but evolve in time and more importantly they adapt their weights to the states of the nodes. In this work, we make one step forward and we provide a general theory to prove the validity of Turing idea in the case of adaptive symmetric networks with positive weights. The conditions for the emergence of Turing instability rely on the spectral property of the Laplace matrix and the model parameters, thus strengthening the interplay between dynamics and network topology. A rich variety of patterns are presented by using two prototype models of nonlinear dynamical systems, the Brusselator and the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Because many empirical networks adapt to changes in the system states, our results pave the way for a thorough understanding of self-organization in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions for Elephant Random Walks with Two memory Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elephant random walk, introduced to study the effect of memory on random walks, is a novel type of walk that incorporates the information of one randomly chosen past step to determine the future step. However, memory of a process can be multifaceted and can arise due to interactions of more than one underlying phenomena. To model this, random walks with multiple memory channels were introduced in the statistical physics literature by Saha (2022) - here the information on a bunch of independently chosen past steps is needed to decide the future step. With the help of variance heuristics, this work analyzed the two-channel case and predicted a double phase transition: from diffusive to superdiffusive and from superdiffusive to ballistic regimes. We prove these conjectures rigorously (with some corrections), discover a mildly superdiffusive regime at one of the conjectured transition boundaries, and observe a new second-order phase transition. We also carry out a detailed investigation of the asymptotic behavior of the walk at different regimes.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of percolation patterns in a kinetic replication model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The model of a one-dimensional kinetic contact process with parallel update is studied by the Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling. The goal was to reveal the structure of the hidden percolative patterns (order parameters) in the active phase and the nature of transitions those patterns emerge through. Our results corroborate the earlier conjecture that in general the active (percolating) phases possess the hierarchical structure (tower of percolation patterns), where more complicated patterns emerge on the top of coexistent patterns of lesser complexity. Plethora of different patterns emerge via cascades of continuous transitions. We detect five phases with distinct patterns of percolation within the active phase of the model. All transitions on the phase diagram belong to the directed percolation universality class, as confirmed by the scaling analysis. To accommodate the case of multiple percolating phases the extension of the Janssen-Grassberger conjecture is proposed.</description>

      <title>Non-Normal Phase Transitions: A New Universality in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a new universality class of phase transitions that emerges in non-normal systems, extending the classical framework beyond eigenvalue instabilities. Unlike traditional critical phenomena, where transitions occur when eigenvalues cross zero, we show that the geometry of eigenvectors alone can trigger qualitative changes in dynamics. Within a large-deviation framework, transient amplification intrinsic to non-normal operators renormalizes the effective noise amplitude, acting as an emergent temperature. Once the non-normality index $\kappa$ exceeds a critical threshold $\kappa_c$--the balance between restoring curvature and non-normal shear--stable equilibria lose practical relevance: fluctuations are amplified enough to induce escapes even though spectral stability is preserved. This mechanism defines a fundamentally new route to criticality (pseudo-criticality) that generalizes Kramers' escape beyond potential barriers and can dominate noise-driven transitions in natural and engineered systems. In biology, we demonstrate that DNA methylation, a cornerstone of epigenetic regulation, operates in this regime: by extending a bistable CpG dyad model to include non-normality, we reconcile long-term epigenetic memory with rapid stochastic switching observed on minute timescales. More broadly, the same mechanism underlies abrupt tipping in climate, ecological collapse, financial crises, and engineered network failures. By showing that phase transitions can arise from non-normal amplification rather than spectral instabilities, our work provides a predictive framework for sudden transitions across disciplines.</description>

      <title>Walks in Rotation Spaces Return Home When Doubled and Scaled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of numerous physical systems, such as spins and qubits, can be described as a series of rotation operations, i.e., walks in the manifold of the rotation group. A basic question with practical applications is how likely and under what conditions such walks return to the origin (the identity rotation), which means that the physical system returns to its initial state. In three dimensions, we show that almost every walk in SO(3) or SU(2), even a very complicated one, will preferentially return to the origin simply by traversing the walk twice in a row and uniformly scaling all rotation angles. We explain why traversing the walk only once almost never suffices to return, and comment on the problem in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Fractional Brownian motion with mean-density interaction: a myopic self-avoiding fractional stochastic process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional Brownian motion is a Gaussian stochastic process with long-range correlations in time; it has been shown to be a useful model of anomalous diffusion. Here, we investigate the effects of mutual interactions in an ensemble of particles undergoing fractional Brownian motion. Specifically, we introduce a mean-density interaction in which each particle in the ensemble is coupled to the gradient of the total, time-integrated density produced by the entire ensemble. We report the results of extensive computer simulations for the mean-squared displacements and the probability densities of particles undergoing one-dimensional fractional Brownian motion with such a mean-density interaction. We find two qualitatively different regimes, depending on the anomalous diffusion exponent $\alpha$ characterizing the fractional Gaussian noise. The motion is governed by the interactions for $\alpha &lt; 4/3$ whereas it is dominated by the fractional Gaussian noise for $\alpha &gt; 4/3$. We develop a scaling theory explaining our findings. We also discuss generalizations to higher space dimensions and nonlinear interactions, the relation of our process to the ``true'' or myopic self-avoiding walk, as well as applications to the growth of strongly stochastic axons (e.g., serotonergic fibers) in vertebrate brains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium steady state of a two dimensional Coulomb gas under the action of an anisotropic harmonic trapping potential along with a non-conservative rotational force. In the case without rotation, the equilibrium (zero temperature) steady state has a uniform density supported over a a static elliptical droplet. The addition of a rotational force drives the system into a nonequilibrium steady state where the density is still uniform inside an ellipse, but the ellipse gets tilted by a a fixed angle compared to the non-rotational case. In addition, a nonzero current is generated inside the droplet which run concentrically to the droplet boundary. For large rotational force, the droplet develops a purely circular form. Our results are predicted by a simple hydrodynamic calculation and are confirmed by numerical simulations and provide a full understanding of a novel driven non-equilibrium state in a strongly interacting system.</description>

Abstract: We find and analyse the exact solution of a model of three different
  polymers with asymmetric contact interactions in two dimensions, modelling a
  scenario where there are different types of polymers involved. In particular, we find
  the generating function of three directed osculating walks in star
  configurations on the square lattice with two interaction Boltzmann weights,
  so that there is one type of contact interaction between the top pair of walks and a
  different interaction between the bottom pair of walks. These osculating
  stars are found to be the most amenable to exact solution using functional
  equation techniques in comparison to the symmetric case where three friendly
  walks in watermelon configurations were successfully solved with the same
  techniques. We elucidate the phase diagram, which has four phases, and find
  the order of all the phase transitions between them. We also calculate the
  entropic exponents in each phase.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Compartment Model of Epidemic Spreading in Complex Networks with Mortality and Resetting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an epidemic compartment model, which includes mortality caused by the disease, but excludes demographic birth and death processes. Individuals are represented by random walkers, which are in one of the following states (compartments) S (susceptible to infection), E (exposed: infected but not infectious corresponding to the latency period), I (infected and infectious), R (recovered, immune), D (dead). The disease is transmitted with a certain probability at contacts of I to S walkers. The compartmental sojourn times are independent random variables drawn from specific (here Gamma-) distributions. We implement this model into random walk simulations. Each walker performs an independent simple Markovian random walk on a graph, where we consider a Watts-Strogatz (WS) network. Only I walkers may die. For zero mortality, we prove the existence of an endemic equilibrium for basic reproduction number ${\cal R}_0 &gt; 1$ and for which the disease free (globally healthy) state is unstable. We explore the effects of long-range-journeys (stochastic resetting) and mortality. Our model allows for various interpretations, such as certain chemical reactions, the propagation of wildfires, and in population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric tensor determines the i.i.d. conversion rate in the resource theory of asymmetry for any compact Lie group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04766v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying physical concepts in terms of the ultimate performance of a given task has been central to theoretical progress, as illustrated by thermodynamic entropy and entanglement entropy, which respectively quantify irreversibility and quantum correlations. Symmetry breaking is equally universal, yet lacks such an operational quantification. While an operational characterization of symmetry breaking through asymptotic state-conversion efficiency is a central goal of the resource theory of asymmetry (RTA), such a characterization has so far been completed only for the $U(1)$ group among continuous symmetries. Here, we identify the complete measure of symmetry breaking for a general continuous symmetry described by any compact Lie group. Specifically, we show that the asymptotic conversion rate between many copies of pure states in RTA is determined by the quantum geometric tensor, thereby establishing it as the complete measure of symmetry breaking. As an immediate consequence of our conversion rate formula, we also resolve the Marvian-Spekkens conjecture on conditions for reversible conversion in RTA, which has remained unproven for over a decade. By applying our analysis to a standard setup in quantum thermodynamics, we show that asymptotic state conversion under thermal operations generally requires macroscopic coherence in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical self-assembly for high-yield addressable complexity at fixed conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is evidence that the self-assembly of complex molecular systems often proceeds hierarchically, by first building subunits that later assemble in larger entities, in a process that can repeat multiple times. Yet, our understanding of this phenomenon and its performance is limited. Here we introduce a simple model for hierarchical addressable self-assembly, where interactions between particles can be optimised to maximise the fraction of a well-formed target structure, or yield. We find that a hierarchical strategy leads to an impressive yield up to at least five generations of the hierarchy, and does not require a cycle of temperatures as used in previous methods. High yield is obtained when the microscopic interaction decreases with the scale of units considered, such that the total interaction between intermediate structures remains identical at all scales. We provide thermodynamic and dynamical arguments constraining the interaction strengths where this strategy is effective. Overall, our work characterizes an alternative strategy for addressable self-assembly at a fixed temperature, and provides insight into the mechanisms sustaining hierarchical assembly in biology.</description>

      <title>Physics of droplet regulation in biological cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Droplet formation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatiotemporal organisation of biomolecules in cells. However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situations inside cells. This review discusses three general aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets posses complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monitoring a quantum system can profoundly alter its dynamical properties, leading to nontrivial emergent phenomena. In this work, we demonstrate that dynamical measurements strongly influence the evolution of symmetry in many-body quantum systems. Specifically, we demonstrate that monitored systems governed by non-Hermitian dynamics exhibit a quantum Mpemba effect, where systems with stronger initial asymmetry relax faster to a symmetric state. Crucially, this phenomenon is purely measurement-induced: in the absence of measurements, we find states where the corresponding unitary evolution does not display any Mpemba effect. Furthermore, we uncover a novel measurement-induced symmetry restoration mechanism: below a critical measurement rate, the symmetry remains broken, but beyond a threshold, it is fully restored in the thermodynamic limit--along with the emergence of the quantum Mpemba effect.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic quantum state preparation in integrable models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose applying the adiabatic algorithm to prepare high-energy eigenstates of integrable models on a quantum computer. We first review the standard adiabatic algorithm to prepare ground states in each magnetization sector of the prototypical XXZ Heisenberg chain. Based on the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, we show that the algorithm circuit depth is polynomial in the number of qubits $N$, outperforming previous methods explicitly relying on integrability. Next, we propose a protocol to prepare arbitrary eigenstates of integrable models that satisfy certain conditions. For a given target eigenstate, we construct a suitable parent Hamiltonian written in terms of a complete set of local conserved quantities. We propose using such Hamiltonian as an input for an adiabatic algorithm. After benchmarking this construction in the case of the non-interacting XY spin chain, where we can rigorously prove its efficiency, we apply it to prepare arbitrary eigenstates of the Richardson-Gaudin models. In this case, we provide numerical evidence that the circuit depth of our algorithm is polynomial in $N$ for all eigenstates, despite the models being interacting.</description>

      <title>High-performance local decoders for defect matching in 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local decoders, also known as cellular-automaton decoders, offer a promising path toward real-time quantum error correction by replacing centralized classical decoding, with inherent hardware constraints, by a natively parallel and streamlined architecture from a simple local transition rule. We propose two new types of local decoders for the quantum repetition code in one dimension. The signal-rule decoders interpret odd parities between neighboring qubits as defects, attracted to each other via the exchange of classical point-like excitations, represented by a few bits of local memory. We prove the existence of a threshold in the code-capacity model and present numerical evidence of exponential logical error suppression under a phenomenological noise model, with data and measurement errors at each error correction cycle. Compared to previously known local decoders that suffer from sub-optimal threshold and scaling, our construction significantly narrows the gap with global decoders for practical system sizes and error rates. Implementation requirements can be further reduced by eliminating the need for local classical memories, with a new rule defined on two rows of qubits. This shearing-rule works well at relevant system sizes making it an appealing short-term solution. When combined with biased-noise qubits, such as cat qubits, these decoders enable a fully local quantum memory in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Determining the chemical potential via universal density functional learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the machine learning of density functionals allows one to determine simultaneously the equilibrium chemical potential across simulation datasets of inhomogeneous classical fluids. Minimization of a loss function based on an Euler-Lagrange equation yields both the universal one-body direct correlation functional, which is represented locally by a neural network, as well as the system-specific unknown chemical potential values. The method can serve as an efficient alternative to conventional computational techniques of measuring the chemical potential. It also facilitates using canonical data from Brownian dynamics, molecular dynamics, or Monte Carlo simulations as a basis for constructing neural density functionals, which are fit for accurate multiscale prediction of soft matter systems in equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Spectral distribution of sparse Gaussian Ensembles of Real Asymmetric Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical analysis of biological and artificial neural networks e.g. modelling of synaptic or weight matrices necessitate consideration of the generic real-asymmetric matrix ensembles, those with varying order of matrix elements e.g. a sparse structure or a banded structure. We pursue the complexity parameter approach to analyze the spectral statistics of the multiparametric Gaussian ensembles of real asymmetric matrices and derive the ensemble averaged spectral densities for real as well as complex eigenvalues. Considerations of the matrix elements with arbitrary choice of mean and variances render us the freedom to model the desired sparsity in the ensemble. Our formulation provides a common mathematical formulation of the spectral statistics for a wide range of sparse real-asymmetric ensembles and also
  reveals, thereby, a deep rooted universality among them.</description>
