      <title>Dark Higgs in Hidden Sector as a Probe for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a sensitivity analysis of exotic Higgs boson decays at the electron--positron stage of the Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee), performed within the FCCAnalyses framework. The analysis investigates Higgs boson production in association with a Z boson in electron--positron collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 240~GeV. The Higgs boson is assumed to decay into a pair of long-lived scalar particles, while the Z boson decays leptonically. A hadronic final state is considered, in which the long-lived scalars subsequently decay into bottom--antibottom quark pairs.
  The simulation chain is implemented using the FCCAnalyses framework, with event generation performed using \textsc{MadGraph} and \textsc{Pythia}, and detector effects modeled with \textsc{Delphes}. Displaced vertices arising from the decays of long-lived particles are reconstructed using the FCCAnalyses implementation of the \textsc{LCFIPlus} secondary vertex finding algorithm, enhanced with extended features such as customized track selection.
  The final event selection requires the reconstruction of a Z boson together with at least two displaced vertices. This strategy efficiently suppresses Standard Model backgrounds while retaining at least three expected signal events, including statistical uncertainties, over most of the explored parameter space. The study considers scalar masses of 20~GeV and 60~GeV and mixing angles of $10^{-5}$, $10^{-6}$, and $10^{-7}$. The results demonstrate that FCC-ee will be sensitive to long-lived scalars with decay lengths ranging from approximately 1~mm to 10~m, with optimal sensitivity around a decay length of 0.3~m.</description>

      <title>Charm quark and QGP interactions through the spectra and anisotropic flow of D$^0$ over the widest p$_\text{T}$ interval using event-shape engineering at CMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charm quark is formed almost exclusively during the initial stages of the collision, and a significant fraction of the charm quarks fragment into the $\mathrm{D}^{0}$ meson, the lightest open-charm hadron. We can gain insights into the interactions between the charm quark and the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium by studying the production and the flow of the $\mathrm{D}^{0}$ meson in heavy-ion collisions. We study the effect of the initial shape of the collision system on the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of promptly produced $\mathrm{D}^{0}$ mesons in the $p_\mathrm{T}$ region $2-30$ GeV/c using event-shape engineering (ESE) in PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV at the CMS experiment. A correlation between the initial shape anisotropy and the $\mathrm{D}^{0}$ $v_{2}$ would suggest that the flow gets driven by the interactions between the charm quark and the QGP. Comparison with theoretical predictions allows us to unravel the mechanism behind the generation of $v_{2}$. We also study the anisotropic flow of nonprompt $\mathrm{D}^{0}$ produced due to the decay of the bottom quarks and the nuclear modification factor ($\mathrm{R_{AA}}$) for prompt and nonprompt $\mathrm{D}^{0}$. These studies provide further insights into the QGP interactions of heavy quarks like charm and bottom in heavy-ion collisions in different $p_\mathrm{T}$ regions ranging from $1-40$ GeV/c, the widest ever performed with ESE, and centralities between 0--50%.</description>

      <title>Deep-learning jet flavor tagging for precision hadronic Higgs measurements at future $e^+e^-$ Higgs factories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise measurements of Higgs decays into quarks and gluons are essential for probing the Yukawa couplings of the Higgs boson and testing the flavor structure of the Standard Model. We investigate the process $e^+e^- \to ZH$ at $\sqrt{s}=240~\mathrm{GeV}$ at a future $e^+e^-$ Higgs factory, taking the CEPC design as a benchmark. The analysis focuses on events with $Z\to\nu\bar\nu$ and hadronic Higgs decays $H\to b\bar b$, $c\bar c$, $s\bar s$ and $gg$. Jet flavor is identified using state-of-the-art particle-level deep neural network taggers (ParticleNet, Particle Transformer and More-Interaction Particle Transformer), whose per-jet outputs are combined with global event observables in a two-stage analysis employing XGBoost classifiers to separate the four Higgs decay modes from the dominant two- and four-fermion Standard Model backgrounds. Assuming an integrated luminosity of $20\,\mathrm{ab}^{-1}$, we obtain projected relative precision on $\sigma(ZH)\times\mathrm{Br}(H\to X)$ of 0.18% for $X=b\bar b$, 1.07% for $c\bar c$, 0.52% for $gg$ and 78% for $s\bar s$. Compared with the CEPC published results, the precisions for $H\to c\bar c$ and $H\to gg$ are improved by about $42%$ and $26%$, respectively. For $H\to s\bar s$ we present a quantitative sensitivity estimation corresponding to a statistical significance of about $1.3\sigma$. These results highlight the potential of deep-learning-based jet flavor tagging for precision studies of Higgs decays at future $e^+e^-$ Higgs factories.</description>

      <title>Determination of the HERA coherent diffractive $J/\psi$ production cross section via artificial neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exclusive coherent diffractive $J/\psi$ production dataset from HERA, covering a large kinematic range in the photon virtuality $Q^2$, the squared momentum transfer $t$, and the photon-proton center-of-mass energy $W$, has been analyzed using various theoretical models with different approaches. In common model analyses, the inherent assumptions and limited kinematic applicability somewhat restrict the predictive power of the models, resulting in model-dependent prediction results. In this paper, we present our model-independent approach for the same reaction process and dataset, utilizing an artificial neural network (ANN) technique. The prediction of the best ANN model for the HERA differential cross-section dataset over a range of $W$, $Q^2$, and $t$ is obtained. We then extend the ANN model by combining the HERA and LHC data at various values of $W$ to predict the total photoproduction cross-section and demonstrate how to extract the exponential slope $b$. We find that the exponential slope $b$ strongly depends on $Q^2$ and $W$.</description>

      <title>Investigating charm quark interactions and hadronization in PbPb collisions with $\mathrm{D}_{s}^{\pm}$ and $\mathrm{\Lambda}_{c}^{\pm}$ measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charm quarks serve as a sensitive probe of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), providing direct insights into its formation, evolution, and properties. In this proceeding, we present new high-precision measurements from the CMS experiment in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. The elliptic ($v_2$) and triangular ($v_3$) flow of prompt $\mathrm{D}_{s}^{\pm}$ mesons are measured with high precision, extending the kinematic coverage. A comparison of the $\mathrm{D}_{s}^{\pm}$ flow to that of $\mathrm{{D}^{0}}$ mesons is performed to investigate the impact of strange quark hadronization on charm quark collectivity. We further explore charm quark hadronization by measuring the $\mathrm{\Lambda}_{c}^{\pm}$ nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) as a function of transverse momentum for different collision centralities, and the $\mathrm{\Lambda}_{c}^{\pm}$/$\mathrm{{D}^{0}}$ yield ratio in pp, pPb, and Pb-Pb collisions. These results provide crucial constraints on charm quark energy loss and hadronization mechanisms, offering critical tests for theoretical models and advancing our understanding of heavy quark dynamics in the QGP.</description>

      <title>Mass Spectra of $\Lambda_Q\bar{\Sigma}_Q$ Bound States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the BESIII Collaboration indicate that no $\Lambda_c\bar{\Sigma}_c$ bound-state with a mass near threshold in the range $4715$--$4735~\mathrm{MeV}$ was observed. In order to determine the plausible mass region of the bound states in this structure, we calculate the mass spectrum of the $\Lambda_c\bar{\Sigma}_c$ molecular configuration with the method of QCD sum rules. Two linearly independent interpolating currents are constructed, and contributions from nonperturbative condensates up to dimension 12 are included in the numerical results. Consequently, we obtain the masses of the candidate bound states with quantum numbers $J^P = 0^-,\,0^+,\,1^-,\,1^+$. Our results show that the central values of the $\Lambda_c\bar{\Sigma}_c$ bound-state masses lie around the $5.8~\mathrm{GeV}$ region, consistent with the findings reported by the BESIII Collaboration. Furthermore, we compute the mass spectrum of the $\Lambda_b\bar{\Sigma}_b$ bound states with quantum numbers $J^P = 0^-,\,0^+,\,1^-,\,1^+$, which could be served as hidden-bottom candidates in the experimental detecting.</description>

      <title>Next-to-leading order QCD corrections to electromagnetic production and decay of fully charm tetraquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the electromagnetic properties of the fully charm tetraquark states, particularly incorporating contributions from internal gluon radiations. The paper first presents analytical expressions for the next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD corrections to the decay amplitudes of fully charm tetraquarks into two photons. It is found that the QCD corrections are significant for the $J^{PC}=0^{++}$ fully charm tetraquark decay process, whereas they are relatively small for the $J^{PC}=2^{++}$ fully charm tetraquark decay process. Subsequently, by considering photon-photon fusion in ultra-peripheral high-energy collisions of protons and nuclei and in electron-positron collision processes, we provide theoretical predictions for the production cross sections of fully-charm tetraquark states. The results presented in this work regarding the electromagnetic production and decay of fully charm tetraquarks shall be tested in current and future experiments.</description>

      <title>A Method for On-Orbit Calibration of the VLAST-P Electromagnetic Calorimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Very Large Area Gamma-ray Space Telescope Pathfinder (VLAST-P), as the technology validation satellite for the VLAST mission, is designed to observe high-energy solar bursts on orbit. The CsI electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is one of the key sub-detectors of VLAST-P. To investigate the on-orbit energy calibration method of the ECAL, a Geant4-based simulation of VLAST-P was carried out. The results show an energy resolution better than 10% in the 0.1 to 5 GeV range and a linearity deviation below 2%. A dedicated minimum-ionization-particle (MIP) calibration method was developed to ensure accurate energy reconstruction and to monitor detector stability throughout the in-orbit calibration period.</description>

      <title>Model-independent ZH production cross section at FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents prospects for a model-independent measurement of the $ZH$ production cross section at the FCC-ee using the recoil-mass technique at center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=240$ and $365$ GeV. The analysis considers the muon, electron, and hadronic decay modes of the associated $Z$ boson. Event selections rely primarily on the kinematic properties of the reconstructed $Z$ decay products, ensuring maximal independence from specific Higgs boson decay modes, while multivariate techniques are employed to further enhance sensitivity. Statistical interpretations of the individual final states yield relative precisions of $0.52\%$ for the combined leptonic channels and $0.38\%$ for the hadronic channel at $\sqrt{s}=240$ GeV with an integrated luminosity of $10.8$ ab$^{-1}$. Their full statistical combination leads to total uncertainties of $0.31\%$ at $\sqrt{s}=240$ GeV and $0.52\%$ at $\sqrt{s}=365$ GeV with $3.12$ ab$^{-1}$. Dedicated statistical tests demonstrate model independence at the level of the obtained precision. This study presents, for the first time, a consistent and combined analysis of the leptonic and hadronic final states, achieving the most precise projected determination of the $ZH$ production cross section at future lepton colliders, with model independence demonstrated within the statistical precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) constitutes a theoretically compelling and experimentally testable mechanism for explaining the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU). New results for the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron place significant constraints on the beyond Standard Model CP-violation needed for successful EWBG. Using a specific model illustration, we show how new developments in EWBG quantum transport theory that include CP-violating sources first order in gradients imply more relaxed EDM constraints -- and thereby greater EWBG viability -- than implied by previous approximation formulations. We also illustrate how these developments enable a more realistic treatment of CP-conserving interactions that can also have a decisive impact on the predicted BAU.</description>

      <title>Exclusive photon-fusion production of even-spin resonances and exotic QED atoms in high-energy hadron collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cross sections for the single exclusive production of (pseudo)scalar and (pseudo)tensor hadrons, as well as of even-spin QED bound states formed by pairs of opposite-charge leptons or hadrons, are estimated for photon-fusion processes in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus at the RHIC, LHC and FCC colliders, as well as in proton-air interactions at the highest energies reached by cosmic-rays impinging on Earth. The UPC cross sections are computed in the equivalent photon approximation with realistic photon fluxes from the charged form factors of proton, lead, gold, and nitrogen ions. The production of four types of even-spin systems are considered: quarkonium (spin-0,2,4 meson bound states, from the lightest $\pi^0$ meson up to toponium), exotic hadrons (including candidate multiquark states), leptonium (positronium, dimuonium, and ditauonium), as well as mesonium (pionium, kaonium, D-onium, and B-onium) and baryonium (notably, protonium) QED atoms. The expected yields at the different colliders are presented for about 50 such even-spin composite resonances, for which the ALICE and LHCb experiments have potential reconstruction capabilities at the LHC. The impact of the diphoton decays of such even-spin states is also discussed as resonant backgrounds in the measurement of light-by-light scattering ($\gamma\gamma\to\gamma\gamma$) over $m_{\gamma\gamma} = 0.1$--15 GeV in PbPb UPCs at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Precise measurements of the cosmic ray proton energy spectrum in the "knee'' region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the high-purity identification of cosmic-ray (CR) protons and a precise measurement of their energy spectrum from 0.15 to 12 PeV using the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Abundant event statistics, combined with the simultaneous detection of electrons/photons, muons, and Cherenkov light in air showers, enable spectroscopic measurements with statistical and systematic precision comparable to satellite data at lower energies. The proton spectrum shows significant hardening relative to low-energy extrapolations, culminating at 3 PeV, followed by sharp softening. This distinct spectral structure closely aligned with the knee in the all-particle spectrum points to the emergence of a new CR component at PeV energies that might be linked to the dozens of PeVatrons recently discovered by LHAASO, and offers crucial clues to the origin of Galactic cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>New Types of Hydrogenlike matter Composed of Electron(s) and Meson(s)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we predict the existence of new types of hydrogenlike matter, including hydrogenlike atoms ($\pi^+e^-$, $K^+e^-$, $D^+e^-$), hydrogenlike molecular ions ($\pi^+\pi^+e^-$, $K^+K^+e^-$, $D^+D^+e^-$) and hydrogenlike molecules ($\pi^+\pi^+e^-e^-$, $K^+K^+e^-e^-$, $D^+D^+e^-e^-$). By solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the binding energy of hydrogenlike atoms is obtained as $E_n=-\frac{1}{2n^2}$. For hydrogenlike molecular ions and molecules, the variational method is employed to calculate the binding energies, i.e., $E_+=-0.587$ and $E_0=-1.139$ for hydrogenlike molecular ions and molecules, respectively. And the bond lengths for hydrogenlike molecular ions and molecules are also calculated, whose values are $2.003$ and $1.414$, respectively. Here all the quantities are in atomic units for convenience. In addition, the strong interaction between the two constituent mesons is considered in our calculations, where we find that its influence on the hydrogenlike molecular ions and molecules can be neglected. Comparisons of hydrogenlike molecular ion and molecule with the systems governed by the strong interaction are made, which suggests the possible existence of doubly heavy triquark, hidden heavy-flavor tetraquarks and doubly heavy tetraquarks. Hopefully, these types of matter would be observed in the future with the improvement of accuracy in the high energy physical experiments.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Pion Electromagnetic Form Factor with Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order QCD Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: NNLO QCD corrections for the pion electromagnetic form factor at large momentum transfer have been recently performed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 201901 (2024); Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 221901 (2025)], revealing that the NLO and NNLO contributions are positive and sizeable. Unfortunately, these predictions have been obtained using the conventional scale-setting method and thus they are plagued by large renormalization scale ambiguities. In this paper, we analyze the pion electromagnetic form factor at NNLO by applying the Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC), which is introduced with the aim of resolving renormalization scheme and scale ambiguities. By applying the PMC, a more precise perturbative QCD (pQCD) prediction for the pion EMFF \(Q^2F_\pi(Q^2)\) without conventional renormalization scale ambiguity can be achieved. This improved pQCD prediction is highly beneficial for the precise determination of the pion light-cone distribution amplitude. We then conduct a comprehensive comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of the pion EMFF \(Q^2F_\pi(Q^2)\).</description>

      <title>Potential of di-Higgs observation via a calibratable jet-free $HH\to 4b$ framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a calibratable, jet-free framework that enhances the search significance of the flagship LHC channel $HH \to 4b$ by more than a factor of five compared to existing approaches. The method employs a mass-decorrelated discriminant to identify $h_1 h_2 \to 4b$ with variable $h_{1,2}$ masses and a simultaneous estimator of $(m_{h_1}, m_{h_2})$, both derived from multiclass classification on all-particle inputs. The $HH$ signal response can be calibrated using $ZZ \to 4b$. Using a highly realistic simulation framework validated through multiple tests, we demonstrate the method's robustness and identify two prerequisites essential for achieving this level of sensitivity. Results indicate that with LHC Run 2 and 3 data, observation-level sensitivity to $HH$ appears within reach, enabling constraints on $\kappa_\lambda$ comparable to HL-LHC projections and offering an accelerated path to precision measurements of the Higgs trilinear coupling.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar heavy-quarkonium hadroproduction from nonrelativistic fragmentation at NLL/NLO$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the inclusive hadroproduction of pseudoscalar heavy quarkonia, $\eta_c$ and $\eta_b$ mesons, in high-energy proton collisions. Our framework bases on the single-parton collinear fragmentation within a variable-flavor number scheme, tailored to describe the moderate to large transverse momentum regime. To this end, we construct a new set of collinear fragmentation functions, denoted as NRFF1.0, which evolve via standard DGLAP equations with a consistent treatment of flavor thresholds. Initial conditions for all parton-induced channels are computed using next-to-leading-order nonrelativistic QCD. We perform our analysis within the NLL/NLO$^+$ hybrid factorization framework, employing the JETHAD numerical interface together with the symJETHAD symbolic engine. These tools allow us to deliver predictions for high-energy observables sensitive to quarkonium final states at 13 TeV LHC. To the best of our knowledge, the NRFF1.0 sets represent the first-ever release of collinear fragmentation functions for heavy quarkonia that consistently includes all partonic channels within collinear factorization.</description>

      <title>Bound and Resonant States of Muonic Few-Body Coulomb Systems: Extended Stochastic Variational Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the bound and resonant states of hydrogen-like muonic ions ($\mu\mu p$, $\mu\mu d$, $\mu\mu t$) and three-body muonic molecular ions ($pp\mu$, $pd\mu$, $pt\mu$, $dd\mu$, $dt\mu$, $tt\mu$), and the four-body double-muonic hydrogen molecule ($\mu\mu pp$) using an extended stochastic variational method combined with complex scaling. The approach provides a unified treatment of bound and quasibound states and achieves an energy accuracy better than $0.1~\mathrm{eV}$ across all systems studied. Complete spectra below the corresponding $n=2$ atomic thresholds are obtained, including several previously unresolved shallow resonances in both three- and four-body sectors.</description>
