      <title>A multiscale radiation biophysical stochastic model describing the cell survival response at ultra-high dose rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high dose-rate (UHDR) radiotherapy, characterized by an extremely high radiation delivery rate, represents one of the most recent and promising frontier in radiotherapy. UHDR radiotherapy, addressed in the field as FLASH radiotherapy, is a disruptive treatment modality with several benefits, including significantly shorter treatment times, unchanged effectiveness in treating tumors, and clear reductions in side effects on normal tissues. While the benefits of UHDR irradiation have been well highlighted experimentally, the biological mechanism underlying the FLASH effect is still unclear and highly debated. Nonetheless, to effectively use UHDR radiotherapy in clinics, understanding the driving biological mechanism is paramount. Since the concurrent involvement of multiple scales of radiation damage has been suggested, we developed the MultiScale Generalized Stochastic Microdosimetric Model (MS-GSM2), a multi-stage extension of the GSM2, which is a probabilistic model describing the time evolution of the DNA damage in an irradiated cell nucleus. The MS-GSM2 can investigate several chemical species combined effects, DNA damage formation, and time evolution. We demonstrate that the MS-GSM2 can predict various in-vitro UHDR experimental results across various oxygenation levels, radiation types, and energies. The MS-GSM2 can accurately describe the empirical trend of dose and dose rate-dependent cell sensitivity over a wide range, consistently describing multiple aspects of the FLASH effect and reproducing the main evidence from the in-vitro experimental data. Our model also proposes a consistent explanation for the differential outcomes observed in normal tissues and tumors, in-vivo and in-vitro.</description>

      <title>From modelling to understanding: the signals in nerves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper attempts to review our studies on the propagation of signals in nerves over the past decade. The need for interdisciplinary studies is stressed that helps to understand the physical mechanisms of coupling the electrical, mechanical, and thermal effects in nerves. Based on the analysis of structural properties of axons and possible mechanisms of interaction between different physical phenomena, a set of assumptions and hypotheses is formulated. As a proof of concept, a rather general mathematical model is presented for describing a wave ensemble in unmyelinated axons. This model is composed of several governing equations ("building blocks") which are coupled by forces describing the interaction between the effects. The numerical simulation using the dimensionless variables demonstrated a rather good qualitative match with experiments. The further generalisation of this model in physical units for the processes in myelinated axons permits a closer match to measurements. Based on modelling and in silico experiments, the guidelines for modelling such a complex electrophysiological process are formulated. These guidelines reflect the importance of following the physical principles in modelling together with interdisciplinary knowledge from continuum mechanics and mathematics.</description>

      <title>Active matter as the underpinning agency for extraordinary sensitivity of biological membranes to electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interaction of electric fields with biological cells is indispensable for many physiological processes. Thermal electrical noise in the cellular environment has long been considered as the minimum threshold for detection of electrical signals by cells. However, there is compelling experimental evidence that the minimum electric field sensed by certain cells, and organisms, is many orders of magnitude weaker than the thermal electrical noise limit estimated purely under equilibrium considerations. We resolve this discrepancy by proposing a non-equilibrium statistical mechanics model for active electromechanical membranes and hypothesize the role of activity in modulating the minimum electrical field that can be detected by a biological membrane. Active membranes contain proteins that use external energy sources to carry out specific functions and drive the membrane away from equilibrium. The central idea behind our model is that active mechanisms, attributed to different sources, endow the membrane with the ability to sense and respond to electric fields that are deemed undetectable based on equilibrium statistical mechanics. Our model for active membranes is capable of reproducing different experimental data available in the literature by varying the activity. Elucidating how active matter can modulate the sensitivity of cells to electric signals can open avenues for a deeper understanding of physiological and pathological processes.</description>

      <title>Nutrient Transport in Concentration Gradients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sessile ciliates attach to substrates and generate feeding currents to capture passing particulates and dissolved nutrients. Optimal ciliary activity that maximizes nutrient flux at the cell surface while minimizing the rate of hydrodynamic energy dissipation is well characterized in uniform nutrient fields. However, it is unclear how ciliary motion should change when nutrients are non-uniform or patchy. To address this question, we modeled the sessile ciliate and feeding currents using the spherical envelope model, and used an unsteady advection-diffusion equation to describe the nutrient scalar field. In the absence of flows, we calculated the diffusive nutrient uptake analytically in linear nutrient gradients and found no advantage over uptake in uniform fields. With ciliary activity driving feeding currents, we used a spectral method to solve for the unsteady nutrient concentration. We found that, when the axis of symmetry of the ciliary motion is aligned with the nutrient gradient, nutrient uptake at the cell surface increases steadily over time, with highest uptake achieved by the treadmill ciliary motion which is optimal in uniform fields as well. The associated nutrient uptake in concentration gradients scales with the square root of the product of time and P\'eclet number. In patchy environments, optimal ciliary activity depends on the nature of the patchiness. Our findings highlight strategies that enable sessile ciliates to thrive in environments with fluctuating nutrient availability.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired super-resolution of fluorescent point-like sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the experimental super-resolution of pairs of simultaneously emitting point-like fluorescent sources using a modified image inversion interferometer microscope. The technique is inspired by recent developments in the application of quantum parameter estimation theory to semiclassical imaging problems. We find that the image inversion technique requires special polarization filtering to account for the dipolar nature of the emission. Using an azimuthal polarizer, we obtain improvements in the Fisher information of point-source separation by over an order of magnitude relative to direct imaging. Unlike established super-resolution fluorescence techniques, the method does not require sequential photoswitching/blinking of the fluorophores, and thus could facilitate significant speed-ups for certain biological imaging/tracking tasks.</description>

      <title>Optimal signal transmission and timescale diversity in a model of human brain operating near criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cortical neurons exhibit a hierarchy of timescales across brain regions in response to input stimuli, which is thought to be crucial for information processing of different temporal scales. Modeling studies suggest that both intra-regional circuit dynamics as well as cross-regional connectome may contribute to this timescale diversity. Equally important to diverse timescales is the ability to transmit sensory signals reliably across the whole brain. Therefore, the brain must be able to generate diverse timescales while simultaneously minimizing signal attenuation. To understand the dynamical mechanism behind these phenomena, we develop a second-order mean field model of the human brain by applying moment closure and coarse-graining to a digital twin brain model endowed with whole brain structural connectome. Cross-regional coupling strength is found to induced a phase transition from asynchronous activity to synchronous oscillation. By analyzing the input-response properties of the model, we reveal criticality as a unifying mechanism for enabling simultaneously optimal signal transmission and timescales diversity. We show how structural connectome and criticality jointly shape intrinsic timescale hierarchy across the brain.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Cardiovascular Simulations for In-Vivo Prediction of Cardiac Biomarkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whole-body hemodynamics simulators, which model blood flow and pressure waveforms as functions of physiological parameters, are now essential tools for studying cardiovascular systems. However, solving the corresponding inverse problem of mapping observations (e.g., arterial pressure waveforms at specific locations in the arterial network) back to plausible physiological parameters remains challenging. Leveraging recent advances in simulation-based inference, we cast this problem as statistical inference by training an amortized neural posterior estimator on a newly built large dataset of cardiac simulations that we publicly release. To better align simulated data with real-world measurements, we incorporate stochastic elements modeling exogenous effects. The proposed framework can further integrate in-vivo data sources to refine its predictive capabilities on real-world data. In silico, we demonstrate that the proposed framework enables finely quantifying uncertainty associated with individual measurements, allowing trustworthy prediction of four biomarkers of clinical interest--namely Heart Rate, Cardiac Output, Systemic Vascular Resistance, and Left Ventricular Ejection Time--from arterial pressure waveforms and photoplethysmograms. Furthermore, we validate the framework in vivo, where our method accurately captures temporal trends in CO and SVR monitoring on the VitalDB dataset. Finally, the predictive error made by the model monotonically increases with the predicted uncertainty, thereby directly supporting the automatic rejection of unusable measurements.</description>

      <title>Scaling Description of the Relaxation Dynamics and Dynamical Heterogeneity of an Active Glass-forming Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active glasses refer to a class of driven non-equilibrium systems that share remarkably similar dynamical behavior as conventional glass-formers in equilibrium. Glass-like dynamical characteristics have been observed in various biological systems from micro to macro length scales. As activity induces additional fluctuations in the system, studying how they couple with density fluctuations is an interesting question to address. Via extensive molecular dynamics simulations, We show that activity enhances density fluctuations more strongly than its passive counterpart. Increasing activity beyond a limit results in the sub-Arrhenieus-type relaxation behavior in active glasses. We also propose a unified scaling theory that can rationalize the relaxation spectrum over a broad parameter range using the concept of an effective temperature. In particular, we show that our scaling theory can capture the dynamical crossover from super to sub-Arrhenius relaxation behavior by changing activity from small to large values. Furthermore, We present non-trivial system size dependencies of the relaxation time at large activity limits that have not been found in any passive systems or even in active systems at small activities.</description>

      <title>On the Optimization of Singular Spectrum Analyses: A Pragmatic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) occupies a prominent place in the real signal analysis toolkit alongside Fourier and Wavelet analysis. In addition to the two aforementioned analyses, SSA allows the separation of patterns directly from the data space into the data space, with data that need not be strictly stationary, continuous, or even normally sampled. In most cases, SSA relies on a combination of Hankel or Toeplitz matrices and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Like Fourier and Wavelet analysis, SSA has its limitations. The main bottleneck of the method can be summarized in three points. The first is the diagonalization of the Hankel/Toeplitz matrix, which can become a major problem from a memory and/or computational point of view if the time series to be analyzed is very long or heavily sampled. The second point concerns the size of the analysis window, typically denoted as 'L', which will affect the detection of patterns in the time series as well as the dimensions of the Hankel/Toeplitz matrix. Finally, the third point concerns pattern reconstruction: how to easily identify in the eigenvector/eigenvalue space which patterns should be grouped. We propose to address each of these issues by describing a hopefully effective approach that we have been developing for over 10 years and that has yielded good results in our research work.</description>

Abstract: Epigenetic inheritance during cell division is essential for preserving cell identity by stabilizing the overall chromatin organisation. Heterochromatin,the condensed and transcriptionally silent fraction of chromatin,is marked by specific epigenetic modifications that are diluted during each cell division. Here we build a physical model,based on the formation of a biomolecular condensate,a liquid 'droplet',that promotes the restoration of epigenetic marks. Heterochromatin facilitates the droplet formation via polymer-assisted condensation(PAC). The resulting condensate serves as a reaction chamber to reconstruct the lost epigenetic marks. We incorporate the enzymatic reactions into a particle-based simulation and monitor the progress of the epigenetic markers through an in silico analogue of the cell cycle. We demonstrate that the proposed mechanism is robust and stabilizes the heterochromatin domains over many cell generations. This mechanism and variations thereof might be at work for other epigenetic marks as well.</description>

      <title>On the effects of membrane viscosity on transient red blood cell dynamics</title>

Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is currently used to design and improve the hydraulic properties of biomedical devices, wherein the large scale blood circulation needs to be simulated by accounting for the mechanical response of red blood cells (RBCs) at mesoscales. In many practical instances, biomedical devices work on time-scales comparable to the intrinsic relaxation time of RBCs: thus, a systematic understanding of the time-dependent response of erythrocyte membranes is crucial for the effective design of such devices. So far, this information has been deduced from experimental data, which do not necessarily adapt to the the broad variety of the fluid dynamic conditions that can be encountered in practice. This work explores the novel possibility of studying the time-dependent response of an erythrocyte membrane to external mechanical loads via ab-initio, mesoscale numerical simulations, with a primary focus on the detailed characterisation of the RBC relaxation time $t_c$ following the arrest of the external mechanical load. The adopted mesoscale model exploits a hybrid Immersed Boundary-Lattice Boltzmann Method (IB-LBM), coupled with the Standard Linear Solid model (SLS) to account for the RBC membrane viscosity. We underscore the key importance of the 2D membrane viscosity $\mu_{m}$ to correctly reproduce the relaxation time of the RBC membrane. A detailed assessment of the dependencies on the typology and strength of the applied mechanical loads is also provided. Overall, our findings open interesting future perspectives for the study of the non-linear response of RBCs immersed in time-dependent strain fields.</description>

      <title>Elastic interactions compete with persistent cell motility to drive durotaxis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The directed migration of cells toward stiffer substrate regions or durotaxis is relevant to tissue development and tumor progression. Here, we introduce a phenomenological model for single cell durotaxis that incorporates both elastic deformation-mediated cell-substrate interactions and the stochasticity of cell migration. Our model is motivated by a key observation in an early demonstration of durotaxis: a single, contractile cell at a sharp interface between a softer and a stiffer region of an elastic substrate reorients and migrates towards the stiffer region. We model migrating cells as self-propelling, persistently motile agents that exert contractile traction forces on their elastic substrate. The resulting substrate deformations induce elastic interactions with mechanical boundaries, captured by an elastic potential. Cell dynamics are governed by two critical parameters: the strength of the traction-induced boundary interaction (A) and the persistence of cell motility (Pe). The resulting elastic forces and torques align cells perpendicular (parallel) to the boundary and accumulate (deplete) them at clamped (free) boundaries. A clamped boundary induces an attractive potential, promoting durotaxis, while a free boundary generates a repulsive potential, preventing anti-durotaxis. By analyzing steady-state position and orientation probabilities, we show how accumulation and depletion depend on elastic potential strength and motility. We compare our findings with biological microswimmers and other active particles that accumulate at confining boundaries. The model defines metrics for boundary accumulation and durotaxis, presenting a phase diagram with three regimes: durotaxis, adurotaxis, and motility-induced accumulation. Our model predicts how durotaxis depends on cell contractility and motility, offering insights and testable predictions for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Energy-ordered resource stratification as an agnostic signature of life</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for extraterrestrial life hinges on identifying biosignatures, often focusing on gaseous metabolic byproducts as indicators. However, most such biosignatures require assuming specific metabolic processes. It is widely recognized that life on other planets may not resemble that of Earth, but identifying biosignatures ``agnostic'' to such assumptions has remained a challenge. Here, we propose a novel approach by considering the generic outcome of life: the formation of competing ecosystems. We use a minimal model to argue that the presence of ecosystem-level dynamics, characterized by ecological interactions and resource competition, may yield biosignatures independent of specific metabolic activities. Specifically, we propose the emergent stratification of chemical resources in order of decreasing energy content as a candidate new biosignature. While likely inaccessible to remote sensing, this signature could be relevant for sample return missions, or for detection of ancient signatures of life on Earth itself.</description>

Abstract: Spiral waves are a well-known phenomenon in excitable media, playing critical roles in biological systems such as cardiac tissues, where they are involved in arrhythmias, and in slime molds, where they guide collective cell migration. However, their presence in the cytoplasm of cells has not been reported to date. In this study, we present the observation of spiral waves in a Xenopus laevis frog egg extract reconstituting periodic cell cycle transitions. We find that the emergence of these spiral waves accelerates the cell division cycle nearly twofold. Using two distinct computational models, we demonstrate that this behavior arises from generic principles and is driven primarily by time-scale separation in the cell cycle oscillator. Additionally, we investigate the interplay between these spiral waves and the more commonly observed target pattern waves in the frog cytoplasm, providing new insights into their dynamic interactions.</description>
