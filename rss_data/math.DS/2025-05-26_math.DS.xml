      <title>Rigorously Characterizing Dynamics with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of dynamics from time series data is a problem of general interest. It is well established that dynamics on the level of invariant sets, the primary objects of interest in the classical theory of dynamical systems, is not computable. We recall a coarser characterization of dynamics based on order theory and algebraic topology and prove that this characterization can be identified using approximations that can be realized by feedforward neural networks.</description>

      <title>Normal Singular Geodesics of a Conformally Generic Sub-Riemannian Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a Ma\~n\'e generic real-analytic $D$-Hamiltonian H, subjected to a totally non-holonomic real-analytic distribution $D$, has no non-trivial normal $D$-singular orbits of minimal rank. If $D$ has co-rank 1, this implies that $H + u$, where $u$ is a generic real-analytic potential, does not admit non-trivial normal $D$-singular orbits.</description>

      <title>Linear response for systems with a cusp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we consider a tent-like family with a cusp at the singular point and show that the linear response holds for certain perturbations of this family. This contrasts the tent-like maps with finite derivatives at the singularity. Our results extend the results of Bahsoun and Galatolo to the larger class of singularities and we obtain the linear response formula in $L^p$ for $p&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Critical Exponent Rigidity for $\Theta-$positive Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove for a $\Theta-$positive representation from a discrete subgroup $\Gamma\subset \mathsf{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$, the critical exponent for any $\alpha\in \Theta$ is not greater than one. When $\Gamma$ is geometrically finite, the equality holds if and only if $\Gamma$ is a lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define sets of coulourings of the infinite discrete plane using monadic second order (MSO) formulas. We determine the complexity of deciding whether such a formula defines a subshift, parametrized on the quantifier alternation complexity of the formula. We also study the complexities of languages of MSO-definable sets, giving either an exact classification or upper and lower bounds for each quantifier alternation class.</description>

      <title>Educational programs and crime: a compartmental model approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a mathematical model to describe the temporal evolution of delinquent behavior, treating it as a socially transmitted phenomenon influenced by peer interactions, thus similar to an epidemic. We consider a compartmental framework involving three ordinary differential equations to describe the dynamics among the three population groups: individuals not incarcerated (susceptible), incarcerated offenders, and incarcerated offenders participating in an educational program. Transitions between the groups are governed by interaction-based mechanisms that capture the influence of peer effects in the spread of criminal behavior. The model revealed three equilibrium states: a delinquence free equilibrium, an equilibrium where no criminals attend an educational program, and a coexistence equilibrium. The basic reproduction number, $R_0$, was derived, and a sensitivity analysis revealed the key parameters that influence the system's stability. The model thus provides a quantitative basis for evaluating the effectiveness of rehabilitation strategies in correctional settings. Numerical simulations and an empirical application illustrate the qualitative properties of the model and show how parameter variations influence system behavior.</description>

      <title>$L^p$ measure equivalence of nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify compactly generated locally compact groups of polynomial growth up to $L^p$ measure equivalence (ME) for all $p\leq 1$.
  To achieve this, we combine rigidity results (previously proved for discrete groups by Bowen and Austin) with new constructions of explicit orbit equivalences between simply connected nilpotent Lie groups. In particular, we prove that for every pair of simply connected nilpotent Lie groups there is an $L^p$ orbit equivalence for some $p&gt;0$, where we can choose $p&gt;1$ if and only if the groups have isomorphic asymptotic cones. We also prove analogous results for lattices in simply connected nilpotent Lie groups. This yields a strong converse of Austin's Theorem that two nilpotent groups which are $L^1$ ME have isomorphic Carnot graded groups.
  We also address the much harder problem of extending this classification to $L^p$ ME for $p&gt;1$: we obtain the first rigidity results, providing examples of nilpotent groups with isomorphic Carnot graded groups (hence $L^1$ OE) which are not $L^p$ ME for some finite (explicit) $p$. For this we introduce a new technique, which consists of combining induction of cohomology and scaling limits via the use of a theorem of Cantrell.
  Finally, in the appendix, we extend theorems of Bowen, Austin and Cantrell on $L^1$ ME to locally compact groups.</description>

      <title>Flowing Through Layers: A Continuous Dynamical Systems Perspective on Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the standard discrete update rule of transformer layers can be naturally interpreted as a forward Euler discretization of a continuous dynamical system. Our Transformer Flow Approximation Theorem demonstrates that, under standard Lipschitz continuity assumptions, token representations converge uniformly to the unique solution of an ODE as the number of layers grows. Moreover, if the underlying mapping satisfies a one-sided Lipschitz condition with a negative constant, the resulting dynamics are contractive, causing perturbations to decay exponentially across layers. Beyond clarifying the empirical stability and expressivity of transformer models, these insights link transformer updates to a broader iterative reasoning framework, suggesting new avenues for accelerated convergence and architectural innovations inspired by dynamical systems theory.</description>

      <title>Variational principles for Hausdorff and packing dimensions of fractal percolation on self-affine sponges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish variational principles for the Hausdorff and packing dimensions of a class of statistically self-affine sponges, including in particular fractal percolation sets obtained from Bara\'nski and Gatzouras-Lalley carpets and sponges. Our first step is to compute the Hausdorff and packing dimensions of non-degenerate inhomogeneous Mandelbrot measures supported on the associated random limit sets. This is not a straightforward combination of the existing approaches for the deterministic inhomogeneous Bernoulli measures and the Mandelbrot measures on random Sierpi\'nski sponges; it reveals new structural features. The variational principles rely on a specific subclass of inhomogeneous Mandelbrot measures, which are connected to localized digit frequencies in the underlying coding space. This connection makes it possible to construct effective coverings of the random limit set, leading to sharp upper bounds for its Hausdorff and packing dimensions.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness for the Rosenzweig-MacArthur Model with Internal Stochasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a stochastic version of the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model solely driven by internal demographic noise, extending classical Lotka-Volterra-type systems focused on external noise. We give a criterion for the existence and uniqueness of autonomous stochastic differential equations (SDEs) on an open submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and the framework allows for a wider choice of Lyapunov functions. In the meantime, the invariance of open submanifolds, which is a biologically feasible result and has been implicitly incorporated into many biological and ecological models, facilitates the application of analytic tools typically suited to $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and indicates the persistence of predator and prey populations, thus providing a criterion for determining whether a population will become extinct. We apply the well-posedness criterion to our stochastic Rosenzweig-MacArthur model and show the existence and uniqueness of solutions. Furthermore, the asymptotic estimates of solutions are obtained, indicating the at most exponential growth of the population with internal stochasticity. Some numerical experiments are performed, which illustrate the discrepancy between the deterministic and stochastic models. Overall, this work demonstrates the broad applicability of our results to ecological models with constrained dynamics, offering a foundation for analyzing extinction, persistence, and well-posedness in systems where internal randomness dominates. This paper not only promotes the development of stochastic modeling and stochastic differential equations in theoretical ecology but also proposes a rigorous mathematical methodology for studying the predator-prey system with internal stochasticity.</description>
