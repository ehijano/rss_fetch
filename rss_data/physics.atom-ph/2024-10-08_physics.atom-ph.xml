      <title>Role of intermediate resonances in attosecond photoelectron interferometry in neon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond photoelectron interferometry based on the combination of an attosecond pulse train and a synchronized infrared field is a fundamental technique for the temporal characterization of attosecond waveforms and for the investigation of electron dynamics in the photoionization process. In this approach, the comb of extreme ultraviolet harmonics typically lies above the ionization threshold of the target under investigation, thus releasing a photoelectron by single-photon absorption. The interaction of the outgoing photoelectron with the infrared pulse results in the absorption or emission of infrared photons, thereby creating additional peaks in the photoelectron spectrum, referred to as sidebands. While, in the absence of resonances in the first ionization step, the phases imparted on the photoionization process evolve smoothly with the photon energy, the presence of intermediate resonances imprints a large additional phase on the outgoing photoelectron wave packet. In this work, using a comb of harmonics below and above the ionization threshold of neon, we investigate the effect of intermediate bound excited states on attosecond photoelectron interferometry. We show that the phase of the oscillations of the sidebands and their angular distributions are strongly affected by such resonances. By slightly tuning the photon energies of the extreme ultraviolet harmonics, we show how the contributions of selected resonances can be enhanced or suppressed.</description>

      <title>Matrix isolated barium monofluoride: Assembling a sample of BaF molecules for a measurement of the electron electric dipole moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cryogenic neon solid doped with barium monofluoride (BaF) is created on a cryogenic substrate using a stream of Ne gas and a high-intensity beam of BaF molecules produced in a cryogenic helium-buffer-gas laser-ablation source. The apparatus is designed for eventual use in a measurement of the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM). Laser-induced fluorescence is observed from transitions up to the $B\,^2\Sigma_{1/2}$ state. The number of BaF molecules found to be present in the solid and addressable with this laser transition is approximately 10$^{10}$ per mm$^3$, which is of the same order as the total number of BaF molecules that impact the substrate during the hour of growth time for the solid. As a result, an eventual eEDM measurement could have continual access to an accumulation of an hour's worth of molecules (all of which are contained within a 1-mm$^3$ volume and are thermalized into the ground state), compared to beam experiments which study the molecules from a single ablation during the millisecond-timescale of their passage through a much larger-scale measurement apparatus. The number of BaF molecules observed in the doped solid matches the target value for our planned eEDM measurement.</description>

      <title>Specular reflection of polar molecules from a simple multi-cylinder electrostatic mirror: a method for separating BaF molecules produced in a buffer-gas-cooled laser-ablation source from other ablation products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for specular reflection of polar molecules is proposed. Electrostatatic potentials and forces are calculated for a low-field-seeking molecule near a series of long cylindrical electrodes of radius $r$ with dc potentials of $+V$ and $-V$ applied to alternate electrodes. A center-to-center separation of $2.9\,r$ leads to remarkably flat equipotential surfaces and thus to a nearly planar mirror for specular reflection of the polar molecules, with the angle of reflection equalling the angle of incidence to an accuracy approaching a microradian. This mirror can be used to redirect cryogenic molecular beams. Separating barium monofluoride (BaF) molecules created in a helium-buffer-gas laser-ablation source from other ablation products is a necessary step to producing a pure sample of matrix-isolated BaF, as is required by the EDM$^3$ collaboration for implementing a precise measurement of the electron electric dipole moment. The design and modelling for the BaF deflector based on this electrode geometry is presented.</description>

      <title>Optical pumping of matrix-isolated barium monofluoride: dependence on the orientation of the BaF molecular axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical pumping of barium monofluoride (BaF) within a cryogenic neon matrix is demonstrated. Interestingly, with an applied magnetic field of 2~G, optical pumping is found to be considerably more efficient for a laser beam with right-circular polarization compared to left-circular polarization. Calculations show that the higher efficiency is due to a constructive versus destructive interference and is dependent on the orientation of the BaF molecule relative to the magnetic field direction. The effect leads to orientation-dependent optical pumping within the matrix. As optical pumping is the first step used in our planned electron electric-dipole moment (eEDM) measurement, we intend to exploit this property to obtain the selection of molecular orientations that is required for an eEDM measurement.</description>

      <title>Two-electron atomic systems. A simple method for calculating the ground state near the nucleus. Some applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple method of variational calculations of the electronic structure of a two-electron atom/ion, primarily near the nucleus, is proposed. The method as a whole consists of a standard solution of a generalized matrix eigenvalue equation, all matrix elements of which are reduced to a numerical calculation of one-dimensional integrals. Distinctive features of the method are: The use of the hyperspherical coordinate system. The inclusion of logarithms of the hyperspherical radius $R$ in the basis functions, similar to the Fock expansion. Using a special basis function including the leading angular Fock coefficients to provide the correct behavior of the wave function near the nucleus. The main numerical parameters characterizing the properties of the helium atom and a number of helium-like ions near the nucleus are calculated and presented in tables. Among others, the specific coefficients $a_{21}$ of the Fock expansion, which can only be calculated using a wave function with the correct behavior near the nucleus, are presented in table and graphs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing sensitivity of atomic microwave receiver combining laser arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg atom,which exhibits a strong response to weak electric(E) fields,is regarded as a promising atomic receiver to surpass sensitivity of conventional receivers. However, its sensitivity is strongly limited by the noise coming from both classical and quantum levels and how to enhance it significantly remains challenging. Here we experimentally prove that the sensitivity of Rydberg atomic receiver can be increased to 23 nV/cm/Hz1/2 by combining laser arrays. Theoretically, we demonstrate that multiple beams illuminating on a PD perform better than multiple PDs for laser arrays.In our experiment,10 dB SNR enhancement is achieved by utilizing 2 * 2 probe beam arrays, compared to the performance of a laser beam,and it can be enhanced further just by adding a resonator. The results could offer an avenue for the design and optimization of ultrahigh-sensitivity Rydberg atomic receivers and promote applications in cosmology, meteorology, communication, and microwave quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm in systems with large condition numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm offers an exponential speedup in system size for treating linear equations of the form $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ on quantum computers when compared to their traditional counterparts, it faces a challenge related to the condition number ($\mathcal{\kappa}$) scaling of the $A$ matrix. In this work, we address the issue by introducing the post-selection-improved HHL (Psi-HHL) approach that involves a simple yet effective modification of the HHL algorithm to extract a feature of $|x\rangle$, and which leads to achieving optimal behaviour in $\mathcal{\kappa}$ (linear scaling) for large condition number situations. This has the important practical implication of having to use substantially fewer shots relative to the traditional HHL algorithm. We carry out two sets of simulations, where we go up to 26-qubit calculations, to demonstrate the ability of Psi-HHL to handle situations involving large $\mathcal{\kappa}$ matrices via: (a) a set of toy matrices, for which we go up to size $64 \times 64$ and $\mathcal{\kappa}$ values of up to $\approx$ 1 million, and (b) a deep-dive into quantum chemistry, where we consider matrices up to size $256 \times 256$ that reach $\mathcal{\kappa}$ of about 466. The molecular systems that we consider are Li$_{\mathrm{2}}$, RbH, and CsH. Although the feature of $|x\rangle$ considered in our examples is an overlap between the input and output states of the HHL algorithm, our approach is general and can be applied in principle to any transition matrix element involving $|x\rangle$.</description>

      <title>Emergent Topological Hall Effect in Fe-doped Monolayer WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11222v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topological Hall effect (THE) has attracted great attention since it provides an important probe of the interaction between electron and topological spin textures. THE has been considered an experimental signature of the topological spin texture of skyrmions. While THE has been widely reported in chiral magnets, oxide heterostructures, and hybrid systems such as ferromagnet/heavy metal and ferromagnet/topological insulators, the study of monolayer structures is lacking, hindering the understanding of noncollinear spin textures at the atomically thin scale. Here, we show a discernible THE via proximity coupling of Fe-doped monolayer WSe2 (Fe:WSe2) synthesized using chemical vapor deposition on a Pt Hall bar. Multiple characterization methods were employed to demonstrate that Fe atoms substitutionally replace W atoms, making a two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) dilute magnetic semiconductor (DMS) at room temperature. Distinct from the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, we found the transverse Hall resistivity of Fe:WSe2 displaying two additional dip/peak features in the temperature-dependent measurements, consistent with the contribution of THE. The topological Hall effect is attributed to the magnetic skyrmions that emerge from the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions at the Fe:WSe2 and Pt interface. Our work shows that a DMS synthesized from 2D vdW transition metal dichalcogenides is promising for realizing magnetic skyrmions and spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Minimising Interference in Low-Pressure Supersonic Beam Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free-jet atomic, cluster &amp; molecular sources are used to produce beams of low-energy, neutral particles and find application in a wide array of technologies, from neutral atom microscopes to instruments for surface processing. However, understanding and maximising the intensity derived from such sources has proven challenging, partly because of the interference of gas in the vacuum chamber with the beam. Here, we describe a semi-analytic method to estimate the resulting attenuation in low-pressure free-jet sources. We explicitly calculate the two contributions to the interference, which arise from the interaction of the beam with (i) background gas and (ii) atoms backscattered from the 'skimmer', a conical aperture designed to extract the centre of the expansion. We demonstrate that at high stagnation temperatures the former dominates, suggesting that the design of the skimmer has an insignificant impact at around room temperature. We also determine a number of scaling relationships and analytic formulae to make it easier to include 'skimmer interference' in future calculations of the centre-line intensity. We present experimental evidence to support our approach. Finally, we apply the theory to develop a number of design recommendations for the skimmer and vacuum chamber to enhance desirable beam properties for spectroscopy and microscopy when using cryogenic-temperature atom or molecular beams.</description>

Abstract: Catalysts open up new reaction pathways that can speed up chemical reactions while not consuming the catalyst. A similar phenomenon has been discovered in quantum information science, where physical transformations become possible by utilizing a quantum degree of freedom that returns to its initial state at the end of the process. In this review, a comprehensive overview of the concept of catalysis in quantum information science is presented and its applications in various physical contexts are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a single neutral 87Rb atom held in an optical trap, and "quantum jump" detection of single-photon-initiated state changes, we demonstrate a single-photon quantum jump photodetector (QJPD) with intrinsically narrow bandwidth and strong rejection of out-of-band photons, of interest for detecting weak optical signals in the presence of a strong broadband background. By analyzing fluorescence photon count distributions for the bright and dark states with and without excitation, we measure quantum efficiency of 2.9(2)$\times 10^{-3}$, a record for single-pass quantum jump production, and signal-photon-unprovoked "dark jump" rate - analogous to the dark count rate of other detectors - 3(10)$\times 10^{-3}$ jumps per second during passive accumulation plus 4.0(4)$\times 10^{-3}$ jumps per readout, orders of magnitude below those of traditional single-photon detectors. Available methods can substantially improve QJPD quantum efficiency, dark jump rate, bandwidth and tunability.</description>

      <title>Effective light-induced Hamiltonian for atoms with large nuclear spin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-cold fermionic atoms, having two valence electrons, exhibit a distinctive internal state structure, wherein the nuclear spin becomes decoupled from the electronic degrees of freedom in the ground electronic state. Consequently, the nuclear spin states are well isolated from the environment, rendering these atomic systems an opportune platform for quantum computation and quantum simulations. Coupling with off-resonance light is an essential tool to selectively and coherently manipulate the nuclear spin states. In this paper, we present a systematic derivation of the effective Hamiltonian for the nuclear spin states of ultra-cold fermionic atoms due to such an off-resonance light. We obtain compact expressions for the scalar, vector and tensor light shifts taking into account both linear and quadratic contributions to the hyperfine splitting. The analysis has been carried out using the Green operator approach and solving the corresponding Dyson equation. Finally, we analyze different scenarios of light configurations which lead to the vector- and tensor-light shifts, as well as the pure spin-orbit coupling for the nuclear spin.</description>

Abstract: The multifractal critical phase (MCP) fundamentally differs from extended and localized phases, exhibiting delocalized distributions in both position and momentum spaces. The investigation on the MCP has largely focused on one-dimensional quasiperiodic systems. Here, we introduce a two-dimensional (2D) quasiperiodic model with a MCP. We present its phase diagram and investigate the characteristics of the 2D system's MCP in terms of wave packet diffusion and transport based on this model. We further investigate the movement of the phase boundary induced by the introduction of next-nearest-neighbor hopping by calculating the fidelity susceptibility. Finally, we consider how to realize our studied model in superconducting circuits. Our work opens the door to exploring MCP in 2D systems.</description>
