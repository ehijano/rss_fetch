      <title>A projection method for particle resampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle discretizations of partial differential equations are advantageous for high-dimensional kinetic models in phase space due to their better scalability than continuum approaches with respect to dimension. Complex processes collectively referred to as \textit{particle noise} hamper long-time simulations with particle methods. One approach to address this problem is particle mesh adaptivity or remapping, known as \textit{particle resampling}. This paper introduces a resampling method that projects particles to and from a (finite element) function space. The method is simple; using standard sparse linear algebra and finite element techniques, it can adapt to almost any set of new particle locations and preserves all moments up to the order of polynomial represented exactly by the continuum function space.
  This work is motivated by the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau model of magnetized plasmas with up to six dimensions, $3X$ in physical space and $3V$ in velocity space, and is developed in the context of a $1X$ + $1V$ Vlasov-Poisson model of Landau damping with logically regular particle and continuum phase space grids. The evaluation codes are publicly available, along with the data and reproducibility artifacts, and developed in the PETSc numerical library.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and collisionality in firehose-susceptible high-$\beta$ plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of collisionless plasmas that, due to their macroscopic evolution, are susceptible to the firehose instability, using both analytic theory and hybrid-kinetic particle-in-cell simulations. We establish that, depending on the relative magnitude of the plasma $\beta$, the characteristic timescale of macroscopic evolution, and the ion-Larmor frequency, the saturation of the firehose instability in high-$\beta$ plasmas can result in three qualitatively distinct thermodynamic (and electromagnetic) states. By contrast with the previously identified `ultra-high-beta' and `Alfv\'en-inhibiting' states, the newly identified `Alfv\'en-enabling' state, which is realised when the macroscopic evolution time $\tau$ exceeds the ion-Larmor frequency by a $\beta$-dependent parameter, can support linear Alfv\'en waves and Alfv\'enic turbulence because the magnetic tension associated with the plasma's macroscopic magnetic field is never completely negated by anisotropic pressure forces. We characterise these states in detail, including their saturated magnetic-energy spectra. The effective collision operator associated with the firehose fluctuations is also described; we find it to be well approximated in the Alfv\'en-enabling state by a simple quasilinear pitch-angle scattering operator. The box-averaged collision frequency is $\nu_{\rm eff} \sim \beta/\tau$, in agreement with previous results, but certain sub-populations of particles scatter at a much larger (or smaller) rate depending on their velocity in the direction parallel to the magnetic field. Our findings are essential for understanding low-collisionality astrophysical plasmas including the solar wind, the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters and black-hole accretion flows. We show that all three of these plasmas are in the Alfv\'en-enabling regime of firehose saturation and discuss the implications of this result.</description>

      <title>Influence of inertial confinement on laser-induced bubble generation and shock wave emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-induced breakdown with ultrashort laser pulses is isochoric and inertially confined. It is characterized by a sequence of nonlinear energy deposition and hydrodynamics events such as shock wave emission and cavitation bubble formation. With nanosecond pulses, inertial confinement is lost especially during micro- and nanobubble generation and energy deposition and hydrodynamic events occur concurrently. The onset of bubble expansion during the laser pulse reduces peak pressure, bubble wall velocity, conversion into mechanical energy, and prevents shock wave formation. Here we present an extension of the Gilmore model of bubble dynamics in a compressible liquid that enables to describe the interplay between particle velocity during acoustic transient emission and bubble wall acceleration in the inertial fluid at any degree of confinement. Energy deposition during a finite laser pulse duration is encoded in the time evolution of the bubble's equilibrium radius such that no explicit description of phase transitions is required. The model is used to simulate bubble generation, acoustic transient emission and energy partitioning as a function of laser pulse duration and bubble size at fixed plasma energy density and ambient pressure. It turns out that bubble formation with femtosecond laser pulses is more disruptive than with nanosecond pulses. This applies mainly for micro- and nano-cavitation but to a lesser degree also for millimeter-sized bubbles. We discuss implications for process control in microsurgery and microfluidic manipulation with free-focused laser pulses and via nanoparticle-mediated energy deposition.</description>

      <title>Theory of the kinetic helicity effect on turbulent diffusion of magnetic and scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic helicity is a fundamental characteristics of astrophysical turbulent flows. It is not only responsible for the generation of large-scale magnetic fields in the Sun, stars, and spiral galaxies, but it also affects turbulent diffusion resulting in the dissipation of large-scale magnetic fields. Using the path integral approach for random helical velocity fields with a finite correlation time and large Reynolds numbers, we show that turbulent magnetic diffusion is reduced by the kinetic helicity, while the turbulent diffusivity of a passive scalar is enhanced by the helicity. The latter can explain the results of recent numerical simulations for forced helical turbulence. One of the crucial reasons for the difference between the kinetic helicity effect on magnetic and scalar fields is related to the helicity dependence of the correlation time of a turbulent velocity field.</description>

      <title>External charge perturbation in a flowing plasma and electrostatic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, an 1D electrostatic hybrid-Particle-in-Cell-Monte-Carlo-Collisionh-PIC-MCC) code is used to study the response of a plasma to a moving, external, charged perturbation (debris). We show that the so-called pinned solitons can form only under certain specific conditions through a turbulent regime of the ion-ion counter-streaming electrostatic instability (IICSI). In fact, the pinned solitons are manifestation of the ion phase-space vortices formed around the debris. The simulation shows that the pinned solitons can form only when the debris charge density exceeds a certain value causing the counter-streaming ion velocity to exceed a critical velocity, pushing the instability to a turbulent regime. The effect of debris velocity is also essential for the appearance of pinned soliton as when the debris velocity increases, it causes the widening of the phase space vortices causing well-separated pinned solitons, which merge to form one single soliton when debris velocity reduces to zero. In the opposite extreme, when debris velocity becomes highly supersonic, the vortices are widened up to a limit causing the pinned solitons to disappear altogether. We further show the existence of a Kolmogorov-type energy cascade scaling for this electrostatic turbulence.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Gyrokinetic Study of Eigenstate Transitions in Fast Ion-Driven Electrostatic Drift Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study comprehensively investigates fast ion-driven drift instability, extending the theory in [B. J. Kang and T. S. Hahm, Phys. Plasmas 26, 042501 (2019)]. The eigenmode equation, including the resonant contribution of passing fast ions, is derived and solved using the shooting method. Passing fast ions significantly affect the instability in weak negative shear or moderate positive shear plasmas. Eigenstate transitions to non-ground states occur more readily in weak magnetic shear, high safety factor, and long wavelength perturbations. Linear gyrokinetic simulations using the GKV code verify the theory, showing good agreement with shooting method results. The estimated quasilinear transport indicates that the net energy flux can be inward, without contradicting the second law of thermodynamics. These findings have important implications for heating efficiency and plasma confinement in the heating process, such as Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ICRH) in future fusion devices.</description>

      <title>Computing MHD equilibria of stellarators with a flexible coordinate frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the representation of axi-symmetric plasma configurations, it is natural to use cyl. coordinates (R,Z,$\phi$), where $\phi$ is an independent coordinate. The same cyl. coordinates have also been widely used for representing 3D MHD equilibria of non-axisymmetric configurations (stellarators), with cross-sections, defined in RZ-planes, that vary over $\phi$. Stellarator equilibria have been found, however, for which cyl. coordinates are not at all a natural choice, for instance certain stellarators obtained using the near-axis expansion (NAE), defined by a magn. axis curve and its Frenet frame.
  In this contribution, we propose an alternative approach for representing the boundary in a fixed-boundary 3D MHD equil. solver, moving away from cyl. coordinates. Instead, we use planar cross-sections whose orientation is determined by a general coordinate frame (G-Frame). This frame is similar to the conventional Frenet frame, but more flexible. As an additional part of the boundary representation, it becomes an input to the equil. solve, along with the geometry of the cross-sections. We see two advantages: 1) the capability to easily represent configurations where the magn. axis is highly non-planar or even knotted 2) a reduction in the degrees of freedom needed for the boundary surface, and thus the equil. solver, enabling progress in optimization of these configurations.
  We discuss the properties of the G-Frame, starting from the conventional Frenet frame. Then we show two exemplary ways of constructing it, first from a NAE solution and also from a given boundary surface. We present the details of the implementation of the new frame in the 3D MHD equil. solver GVEC. Furthermore, we demonstrate for a highly shaped QI-optimized stellarator that far fewer degrees of freedom are necessary to find a high quality equil. solution, compared to the solution computed in cyl. coordinates.</description>
