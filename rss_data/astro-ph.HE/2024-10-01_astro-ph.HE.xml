      <title>The Radio Counterpart to the Fast X-ray Transient EP240414a</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite being operational for only a short time, the Einstein Probe mission has already significantly advanced the study of rapid variability in the soft X-ray sky. We report the discovery of luminous and variable radio emission from the Einstein Probe fast X-ray transient EP240414a, the second such source with a radio counterpart. The radio emission at $3\,\rm{GHz}$ peaks at $\sim30$ days post explosion and with a spectral luminosity $\sim2\times10^{30}\,\rm{erg}\,\rm{s}^{-1}\,\rm{Hz}^{-1}$, similar to what is seen from long gamma-ray bursts, and distinct from other extra-galactic transients including supernovae and tidal disruption events, although we cannot completely rule out emission from engine driven stellar explosions e.g. the fast blue optical transients. An equipartition analysis of our radio data reveals that an outflow with at least a moderate bulk Lorentz factor ($\Gamma\gtrsim1.6$) with a minimum energy of $\sim10^{48}\,\rm{erg}$ is required to explain our observations. The apparent lack of reported gamma-ray counterpart to EP240414a could suggest that an off-axis or choked jet could be responsible for the radio emission, although a low luminosity gamma-ray burst may have gone undetected. Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that a significant fraction of extragalactic fast X-ray transients are associated with the deaths of massive stars.</description>

      <title>The Einstein Probe transient EP240414a: Linking Fast X-ray Transients, Gamma-ray Bursts and Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detections of fast X-ray transients (FXTs) have been accrued over the last few decades. However, their origin has remained mysterious. There is now rapid progress thanks to timely discoveries and localisations with the Einstein Probe mission. Early results indicate that FXTs may frequently, but not always, be associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Here, we report on the multi-wavelength counterpart of FXT EP240414a, which has no reported gamma-ray counterpart. The transient is located 25.7~kpc in projection from a massive galaxy at $z=0.40$. We perform comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up. The optical light curve shows at least three distinct emission episodes with timescales of $\sim 1, 4$ and 15 days and peak absolute magnitudes of $M_R \sim -20$, $-21$, and $-19.5$, respectively. The optical spectrum at early times is extremely blue, inconsistent with afterglow emission. It may arise from the interaction of both jet and supernova shock waves with the stellar envelope and a dense circumstellar medium, as has been suggested for some Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs). At late times, the spectrum evolves to a broad-lined~Type~Ic supernova, similar to those seen in collapsar long-GRBs. This implies that the progenitor of EP240414a is a massive star creating a jet-forming supernova inside a dense envelope, resulting in an X-ray outburst with a luminosity of $\sim 10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and the complex observed optical/IR light curves. If correct, this argues for a causal link between the progenitors of long-GRBs, FXTs and LFBOTs.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the optical counterpart of the fast X-ray transient EP240414a</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast X-ray transients (FXTs) are extragalactic bursts of X-rays first identified in archival X-ray data, and now routinely discovered by the Einstein Probe in real time, which is continuously surveying the night sky in the soft ($0.5 - 4$ keV) X-ray regime. In this Letter, we report the discovery of the second optical counterpart (AT2024gsa) to an FXT (EP240414a). EP240414a is located at a projected radial separation of 27 kpc from its likely host galaxy at $z = 0.4018 \pm 0.0010$. The optical light curve of AT2024gsa displays three distinct components. The initial decay from our first observation is followed by a re-brightening episode, displaying a rapid rise in luminosity to an absolute magnitude of $M_r \sim -21$ after two rest-frame days. While the early optical luminosity and decline rate is similar to luminous fast blue optical transients, the colour temperature of AT2024gsa is distinctly red and we show that the peak flux is inconsistent with a thermal origin. The third component peaks at $M_i \sim -19$ at $\gtrsim 16$ rest-frame days post-FXT, and is compatible with an emerging supernova. We fit the $riz$-band data with a series of power laws and find that the decaying components are in agreement with gamma-ray burst afterglow models, and that the re-brightening may originate from refreshed shocks. By considering EP240414a in context with all previously reported known-redshift FXT events, we propose that Einstein Probe FXT discoveries may all result from high-redshift gamma-ray bursts, and thus are distinct from the previously discovered lower redshift, lower luminosity population of FXTs.</description>

      <title>A simulation study on the sub-threshold joint gravitational wave-electromagnetic wave observation on binary neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coalescence of binary neutron stars (BNS) is a prolific source of gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic (EM) radiation, offering a dual observational window into the Universe. Lowering the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) threshold is a simple and cost-effective way to enhance the detection probability of GWs from BNS mergers. In this study, we introduce a metric of the purity of joint GW and EM detections $P_{\rm joint}$, which is in analogue to $P_{\rm astro}$ in GW only observations. By simulating BNS merger GWs jointly detected by the HLV network and EM counterparts (kilonovae and short Gamma-ray bursts, sGRBs) with an assumed merger rate density of BNS, we generate catalogs of GW events and EM counterparts. Through this simulation, we analyze joint detection pairs, both correct and misidentified. We find the following: 1. For kilonovae, requiring $P_{\rm joint}&gt;$ 95\% instead of $P_{\rm astro}&gt;95\%$ reduces the S/N from 9.2 to 8.5-8.8, allowing 5-13 additional joint detections per year and increasing the GW detection volume by 9-17\%; 2. For sGRBs, requiring $P_{\rm joint}&gt;$ 95\% instead of $P_{\rm astro}$ reduces the S/N from 9.2 to 8.1-8.5; 3. Increasing kilonova or sGRB detection capability does not improve $P_{\rm joint}$ due to a higher rate of misidentifications. We also show that sub-threshold GW and kilonova detections can reduce the uncertainty in measuring the Hubble constant to 89-92\% of its original value, and sub-threshold GW and sGRB observations can enhance the precision of constraining the speed of GWs to 88\% of previously established values.</description>

      <title>Constraining the low-energy cosmic ray flux in the center molecular zone from MeV nuclear deexcitation line observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-energy cosmic rays (LECRs) dominate the ionization in dense regions of molecular clouds in which other ionizers such as UV or X-ray photons are effectively shielded. Thus it was argued that the high ionization rate at the central molecular zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy is mainly caused by LECRs. However, the required LECR flux is orders of magnitude higher than the extrapolation of GeV cosmic ray (CR) flux derived from GeV gamma-ray observations. In this paper, we considered two types of additional LECR components and found that only very soft anomalous CR components can explain such a high ionization rate. This LECR component will inevitably produce MeV nuclear deexcitation lines due to their inelastic scattering with the ambient gas. We calculated the MeV line emission and discussed the detectability of next-generation MeV instruments. We found that future MeV observations can be used to pin down the origin of the high ionization rate in the CMZ.</description>

      <title>The anti-glitching gamma-ray pulsar PSR J1522-5735</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. A small number of pulsar glitches have been identified as anti-glitches or spin-down glitches, where the overall contribution to the pulsar's rotation frequency is negative. A notable example of a spin-down glitch was observed in PSR 1522-5735, a radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar discovered by blind searches in the 3-year data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Aims. This work aims to search for PSR 1522-5735's glitches using Fermi-LAT data from over 15 years of observations. Methods. The weighted H-test statistic was applied to identify glitches and evaluate the related changes in pulsar's spin parameters. The timing solution based on these results was further refined by maximization of the unbinned likelihood. The Bayesian information criterion was used to set an appropriate number of parameters in the timing solution to avoid overfitting. Results. The analysis revealed eight glitch events: regular spin-up glitch, spin-up glitch over-recovered to a spin-down and six anti-glitches. These events were radiatively quiet, exhibiting no significant variations in the shape of the pulse profile or energy flux. Conclusions. The results may suggest that an internal mechanism is responsible for spin-down glitch phenomena.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of dense matter equation of state of neutron star with antikaon condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the Density Dependent Relativistic Hadron (DDRH) field theoretical Model in a Bayesian analysis to investigate the equation of state (EOS) of dense matter featuring antikaon condensation for $K^-$ and $\bar{K}^0$ inside neutron stars. The vector coupling parameters within the kaonic sector are determined through the iso-spin counting rule and quark model. Our study integrates various constraints, including $\chi$EFT calculations, nuclear saturation properties, and astrophysical observations from pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+66 and from the GW170817 event. We present posterior distributions of model parameters derived from these constraints, enabling us to explore the distributions of nuclear matter properties and neutron star (NS) characteristics such as radii, tidal deformabilities, central energy densities, and speed of sound. The antikaon potential at the 68(90)\% confidence intervals is determined to be $-129.36^{+12.53(+32.617)}_{-3.837(-5.696)}$ MeV. This aligns with several studies providing estimates within the range of $-120$ to $-150$ MeV. We find that the maximum neutron star mass is constrained to around 2M$_\odot$ due to the significant softening of the EOS caused by antikaon condensation. This softening results in a considerable decrease in the speed of sound. Although antikaon condensation for $K^-$ is not feasible inside the canonical neutron stars, it becomes feasible for higher NS masses. The condensation of both $K^-$ and $\bar{K}^0$ is probably present in the interior of neutron star with mass greater than 2M$_\odot$. We also discuss the interconnections among input variables, isoscalar and isovector aspects of the EOS, and specific NS properties in the context of antikaon condensation.</description>

      <title>estimating the spin of MAXI J1348--630 from intermediate and soft states using \textit{Insight}-HXMT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a broadband spectral analysis of the soft-intermediate and soft states using \textit{Insight}-HXMT observations of the black hole binary MAXI J1348--630 during its outburst in 2019. We employ a combination of reflection and continuum fitting methods to measure the spin of the black hole and determine a spin of $a=0.79\pm0.13$, which is consistent with most of the previous results. Additionally, we investigate some sources of systematic uncertainty that could bias the measurement. The valid spectral hardening factor can partially account for the spin evolution observed during the outburst. Other potential factors, such as assumptions about the corona's structure and their interaction with reflected photons, can also affect the accuracy of spin measurements. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that MAXI J1348--630 exhibits a significantly high disc density ($\sim10^{22}\,\rm{cm}^{-3}$), with a moderate iron abundance of approximately 2.5 times solar.</description>

      <title>X-ray observations of the very-faint X-ray transient XMMSL1 J171900.4--353217: A new candidate neutron star low-mass X-ray binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: XMMSL1 J171900.4-353217 is a very-faint X-ray transient that was discovered in 2010 March when it exhibited an outburst. We report on 7 observations, obtained with the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) aboard the Neil Gehrels {\it{Swift}} Observatory between 2010 May to October. By fitting a single absorbed power-law model to the XRT spectra, we infer power-law indices of $\Gamma = 1.8-2.7$ and an absorption column density of $\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{H}}=(4.6-7.9)\times 10^{22}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. The inferred $0.5-10$~keV luminosity fluctuated irregularly and peaked at $\mathrm{L}_\mathrm{X}\simeq 10^{35}-10^{36} ~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$ for a distance of $4-12$~kpc. Based on the evolution of the power-law index with varying luminosity, we propose that the source most likely is a transient neutron star low-mass X-ray binary located at several kpc. If true, it would be a good candidate to search for coherent millisecond pulsations when it enters a new accretion outburst.</description>

      <title>Viscous Transonic Accretion Flows in Kerr Black Hole Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study viscous transonic accretion flows in vertical equilibrium in Kerr geometry. We employ the pseudo-Kerr formalism which accurately describes transonic flows around Kerr black holes and is applicable for modelling observational data. We study the effects of viscosity on the nature of sonic points and the parameter space that allows an accretion flow to possess multiple sonic points. We concentrate on the accretion solutions that can have centrifugal pressure supported shock waves and find that the shocks are weaker and are located farther from the black hole as the viscosity is enhanced. Moreover, if the viscosity is greater than a critical value, shocks do not form and the accretion flow can pass only through the inner sonic point close to the black hole and remains subsonic and Keplerian throughout the accretion disk. Since the resonance oscillation frequencies of the shock waves provide a measure of the observed Quasi Periodic Oscillation (QPO) frequencies, and since the location of shock waves depend on the spin of a black hole, it is clear that the QPO frequencies must depend on the spin of black hole as well. Our pseudo-Kerr approach makes it easier to compute spectra from an accretion flow with viscous dissipation and radiative cooling around a spinning black hole.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the progenitors of a population of likely peculiar GRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are classified as long and short GRBs, with $T_{90} = 2$ s being the threshold duration. Generally, long-duration GRBs (LGRBs, $T_{90}&gt;2$ s) are associated with the collapse of massive stars, and short-duration (SGRBs, $T_{90}&lt;2$ s) are associated with the compact binary mergers involving at least one neutron star. However, the existence of a population of so-called ``peculiar GRBs", i.e., LGRBs originating from mergers, or long Type I GRBs, and SGRBs originating from collapsars, or short Type II GRBs, have challenged the traditional paradigm of GRB classification. Finding more peculiar GRBs may help to give us more insight into this issue. In this work, we analyze the properties of machine learning identified long Type I GRBs and short Type II GRBs candidates, long GRBs-I and short GRBs-II (the so-called ``peculiar GRBs"). We find that long GRBs-I almost always exhibit properties similar to Type I, which suggests that the merger may indeed produce GRBs with $T_{90}&gt;2$ s. Furthermore, according to the probability given by the redshift distribution, short GRBs-II almost exhibit properties similar to Type II. This suggests that the populations of short Type II GRBs are not scarce and that they are hidden in a large number of samples without redshifts, which is unfavorable to the interpretation that the jet progression leads to a missed main emission.</description>

      <title>Analytical and Numerical Methods for Circumbinary Disk Dynamics -- II: Inclined Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) To gain insight into the dynamical influence of a supermassive black hole binary on a circumbinary accretion disk, we investigate the binary and viscous torque densities throughout such a disk, with emphasis on the final density distribution, particularly the size and stability of the central gap between the binary and the inner edge of the disk. We limit ourselves to the simplified case of a massless viscous thin accretion disk under the influence of the gravitational potential from a binary system whose orbital plane is inclined relative to the disk. The orbital plane could be inclined if it is not coeval with the disk, or the black holes have spin angular momentum misaligned with respect to the disk's orbital angular momentum, so that the binary can precess to an inclined orientation. We employ 2D Newtonian hydrodynamics simulations to examine the influence of two model parameters: the mass ratio of the binary and the inclination angle between the binary and the disk. We investigate their impact on the density and torque distribution. In our analytical approach, we consider the stability of epicycles induced by the perturbative effect of the asymmetric inclined binary gravitational potential on Keplerian circular orbits. Through our simulations, we observe that certain configurations never attain a quasi-steady state, where the density profile averaged over many orbits stabilizes. This instability occurs when the inclination is close to 45 degrees. Furthermore, we identify configurations where there is never a persistent balance between the dynamical and viscous torque densities, as well as cases where the location of this balance oscillates or exhibits other time-dependent behavior over viscous timescales. These findings have implications for understanding both the expected gravitational-wave signal and electromagnetic counterparts from supermassive black hole binaries.</description>

      <title>A search for the ultra high energy neutrinos with the low threshold phased array trigger system of the Askaryan Radio Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) is an in-ice ultra high energy (UHE, $&gt;10$ PeV) neutrino experiment at the South Pole that aims to detect UHE neutrino-induced radio emission in ice. ARA consists of five independent stations each consisting of a cubical lattice of in-ice antenna clusters with a side length of $\sim$10 m buried at $\sim$200 m below the ice surface. The fifth station of ARA (A5) is special as this station has an additional central string, the phased array (PA), which provides an interferometric trigger that enables ARA to trigger on weak signals that are otherwise buried in noise. Leveraging the low threshold phased array trigger, ARA was the first radio neutrino experiment to demonstrate significant improvement in sensitivity to weak signals. In this contribution, we present initial results from a neutrino search combining information from both the traditional station antennas and the phased array antennas of the A5 station. We show the improved vertex reconstruction achieved with this approach, and leveraging this improvement, we expect to enhance the analysis efficiency beyond what has been achieved previously by ARA. This analysis is the paradigmatic representation of future neutrino searches with the next generation of in-ice neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>Instant ZeV-ion-acceleration in Upset Magnetar Origin Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the energetics of bursting activity in a magnetar under the `Dzhanibekov effect,' described by the classical mechanics of rigid bodies. The magnetar's rotation axis suddenly flips due to this effect, resulting in a sudden rise of the Euler force. The outer layer of magnetar, called the crust, can plastically flow and eventually break due to the Euler force. Then, the degenerate electrons burst open from the braking region like a balloon burst. We find that the pair plasma formation can be ignited inside the crust, and its radiation can be similar to the observed bursts from soft gamma-ray repeaters. At the beginning of this bursting phenomenon, the self-discharge effect of the electron streaming may induce a strong resistive electric field, accelerating the ions. We also find that the maximum energy of the accelerated ions possibly reaches $\sim$ZeV within a timescale of $\sim1$~ps. If $\gtrsim2$~\% of magnetars in nearby galaxies are undergoing this scenario, the observed cosmic-ray flux at $&gt;100$~EeV can be explained.</description>

      <title>The properties of the Galactic Hard X-Ray and soft gamma-ray Background based on 20 years of INTEGRAL/IBIS observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present results of a study of the Galactic hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray background emission performed with the IBIS telescope aboard INTEGRAL observatory using data obtained over more than 20 years of operations. The study of Galactic background at energies between 10 keV and a few MeV is problematic due to the contribution of point sources, high instrumental background and large-scale extent of the emission, which leads to the need of utilizing complex model-dependent methods. Using the unique properties of the IBIS coded-mask telescope, we developed model-independent approach to study diffuse continuum emission within the Galactic plane in 25-60, 60-80, and 80-200 keV bands. The comparison of 25-60 keV longitude profile with near infrared intensity shows excellent agreement, confirming stellar origin of Galactic Ridge X-ray Emission (GRXE). The Galactic X-ray background is significantly detected in the Galactic bulge region up to 200 keV. We build broad-band spectra of the Galactic background in three broad regions, the Galactic bulge and two spiral arms at l= +/-20 deg. The spectral analysis reveals two distinct components with a minimum at about 80 keV. The low-energy component E&lt;60 keV, coming from GRXE, is consistent with a one-dimensional accretion flow model of intermediate polars with an average white dwarf mass of about 0.7 Msun. The high-energy part of the spectrum, attributed to gamma-ray background at E&gt;80 keV is consistent with a power-law model with photon index Gamma=1.55. The total 30-80 keV flux budget of 1.5E-9 erg/s/cm^2 observed within effective IBIS FOV (~286 deg^2) in the region of Galactic bulge, consists of 2/3 of GRXE and 1/3 of gamma-ray background. Finally, we provide the Python code of the IBIS/ISGRI background model, which can be used to measure the X-ray intensity of the Galactic background in different parts of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Investigation of individual pulse emission behaviours from pulsar J1741$-$0840</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have carried out a detailed study of individual pulse emission from the pulsar J1741$-$0840 (B1738$-$08), observed using the Parkes and Effelsberg radio telescopes at the $L$ band. The pulsar exhibits four emission components which are not well resolved by employing multi-component Gaussian fitting. The radio emission originates at a height of approximately 1000 km, with the viewing geometry characterized by inclination and impact angles roughly estimated at 81$^\circ$ and 3$^\circ$, respectively. Fluctuation spectral analysis of single pulse behaviour reveals two prominent periodicities, around 32 and 5 rotation periods. The longer periodic modulation feature is linked to nulling behaviour across the entire emission window, with an updated nulling fraction of 23$\pm$2\% is derived from pulse energy distribution via Gaussian mixture modeling. In addition to quasiperiodic nulling, the pulsar also exhibits the presence of subpulse drifting in the trailing component, with the shorter periodic feature in the fluctuation spectra related to the phenomenon of subpulse drifting, and the longitudinal separation estimated to be about 5 degrees. Both periodic modulations show significant temporal evolution with time-dependent fluctuation power. The ramifications for understanding the radio emission mechanisms are discussed.</description>

      <title>Wideband Monitoring of FRB 180916.J0158+6 Across a Half-Decade Bandwidth Using the Upgraded GMRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the uGMRT having unprecedented sensitivity and unique capability of providing instantaneous frequency coverage of 250$-$1460 MHz, we studied ${\rm FRB}\,180916.J0158+65$ over four months sampling during its active phase. We report the detection of $74$ bursts at Band-3 (i.e. 250$-$500 MHz) and $4$ bursts at Band-4 (i.e. 550$-$750 MHz) of uGMRT providing a burst rate of $\sim 4$ bursts/hour above a fluence of 0.05 Jy ms. We find that the source emits maximum energy and luminosity up to a fractional bandwidth of 70 MHz near the middle of its activity window consistent with earlier studies. We see a strong correlation between the excess dispersion measure and excess scattering width where both of them attains their maximum value near the middle of the activity window. We find that the normalized cumulative distribution of the waiting time can be well-fitted by an exponential function, indicating a stochastic emission process. We also notice that the cumulative burst rate changes rapidly with the intrinsic energy of the bursts near the middle of the activity window considering the full observed window of 0.4-0.6 of this FRB, where this change is much steeper for the high-energy bursts and shallower for the low-energy bursts.</description>

      <title>NuSTAR view of the accreting X-ray pulsars IGR J17480-2446 and IGR J17511-3057</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the NuSTAR observations of the accreting pulsars IGR~J17480-2446 and IGR~J17511-3057 performed on March 4, 2023, and April 8, 2015, respectively. We describe the continuum emission of IGR~J17480-2446 with a combination of two soft thermal components and an additional hard X-ray emission described by a power-law. We suggest that the spectral properties of IGR~J17480-2446 are consistent with a soft state, different from many other accreting X-ray millisecond pulsars usually found in the hard spectral state. The source IGR~J17511-3057 exhibits a hard spectrum characterized by a Comptonized emission from the corona. The X-ray spectrum of both sources shows evidence of disc reflection. For the first time, we employ the self-consistent reflection models ({\tt relxill} and {\tt relxillNS}) to fit the reflection features in the NuSTAR spectrum. From the best-fit spectral model, we find an inner disc radius is precisely constrained to $(1.99-2.68)\:R_{ISCO}$ and inclination to $30\pm 1$ degree for IGR~J17480-2446. We determine an inner disc radius of $\lesssim 1.3\;R_{ISCO}$ and inclination of $44\pm 3$ degree for IGR~J17511-3057. A low inclination angle of the system is required for both sources. We further place an upper limit on the magnetic field strength of the sources, considering the disc is truncated at the magnetospheric radius.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Galactic Center gamma-ray observations explained by a unified cosmic-ray dynamics model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy (HE) and very high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray observations from the Galactic center (GC) detected extended emission correlated with the morphology of the central molecular zone (CMZ). Emission in both bands is expected to be produced by hadronic interaction between cosmic rays (CRs) and ambient gas. We examine if our three previously proposed scenarios for the CR sources and dynamics, which are consistent with the VHE gamma-ray data (1-100 TeV), also match the HE gamma-ray observations (10-300 GeV). Additionally, we analyze the effect of the isotropic Galactic CR "sea" inside the CMZ. We generated synthetic gamma-ray maps considering a simplified isotropic diffusion, but more realistic dynamics with two diffusion zones (in and out of the CMZ) and polar advection, for mono-energetic particles of 3 TeV. Additionally, we considered two gas distributions for the CMZ (with and without an inner cavity), and CR populations injected from the clusters of young massive stars (the Arches Cluster, the Quintuplet Cluster, and the nuclear star cluster), plus the supernova Sgr A East. Only the combination of more realistic CR dynamics, the CMZ with an inner cavity, CR injection from all proposed sources, and a CR sea similar to that observed in the Solar System reproduced the current HE and VHE gamma-ray detection from the CMZ and was consistent with the observed gamma-rays from Sagittarius A*. The HE and VHE gamma-rays observations of the GC can be reproduced by a unified model for the CRs.}</description>

      <title>A Unified Multi-Wavelength Data Analysis Workflow with gammapy. Constraining the Broadband Emission of FSRQ OP 313</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar OP~313 entered an enhanced activity phase in November 2023 and has undergone multiple flares since then which have motivated the organisation of several large multi-wavelength campaigns, including two deep observations from the hard X-ray telescope NuSTAR. The broadband emission from OP~313 during these two observations is investigated under a new unified analysis framework, with data spanning from optical to gamma rays. Traditional methods for analyzing blazar emissions often rely on proprietary software tailored to specific instruments, making it challenging to integrate and interpret data from multi-wavelength campaigns comprehensively. This study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing gammapy, an open-source Python package, and common data formats originally developed for gamma-ray instrumentation, to perform a consistent multi-instrument analysis. This enables a forward folding approach that fully incorporates source observations, detector responses, and various instrumental and astrophysical backgrounds. The methodology is applied as an example to recent data collected from the distant quasar OP~313. We present a comprehensive data reconstruction and analysis for instruments including the Liverpool Telescope's IO:O detector, Swift-UVOT, Swift-XRT, NuSTAR, and Fermi-LAT. The resulting spectral analysis is validated against the native tools for each instrument. Additionally, a multi-wavelength phenomenological model of the source emission, encompassing optical to gamma-ray bands, is developed, incorporating absorption components across different energy regimes. We introduce and validate a new unified framework for multi-wavelength forward folding data analysis based on gammapy and open data formats, demonstrating its application to spectral data from the quasar OP~313.</description>

      <title>Predicting the rate of fast radio bursts in globular clusters from binary black hole observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source in an old globular cluster (GC) in M81 proves that FRBs, which are typically associated with young magnetars, can also occur in old stellar populations. A potential explanation is super-Chandrasekhar binary white dwarf (BWD) coalescences, which may produce FRB-emitting neutron stars. GCs can also give rise to binary black hole (BBH) mergers detectable with gravitational waves, and the BWD coalescence rate from GCs is correlated with their BBH merger rate. For the first time, we combine independent observations of gravitational waves and FRBs to infer the origins of FRB sources. We use GC formation histories inferred from BBH observations to predict the rate of super-Chandrasekhar BWD coalescences originating from GCs as a function of redshift. We explore mass-loss and mass-conserved scenarios for BWD coalescences and find that the coalescence rates evolve differently across redshift in these two cases. In the mass-loss scenario, the BWD coalescence rates decrease with increasing redshift, similar to some recent measurements of the FRB rate as a function of redshift. We show that GCs could contribute $\lesssim 1\%$ to the total FRB source formation rates in the local Universe. Our multi-messenger approach also offers a novel method to better constrain the GC population using both FRB and gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>MAGICS III. Seeds sink swiftly: nuclear star clusters dramatically accelerate seed black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Merger rate predictions of Massive Black Hole (MBH) seeds from large-scale cosmological simulations differ widely, with recent studies highlighting the challenge of low-mass MBH seeds failing to reach the galactic center, a phenomenon known as the seed sinking problem. In this work, we tackle this issue by integrating cosmological simulations and galaxy merger simulations from the MAGICS-I and MAGICS-II resimulation suites with high-resolution $N$-body simulations. Building on the findings of MAGICS-II, which showed that only MBH seeds embedded in stellar systems are able to sink to the center, we extend the investigation by incorporating nuclear star clusters (NSCs) into our models. Utilizing $N$-body resimulations with up to $10^7$ particles, we demonstrate that interactions between NSCs and their surrounding galactic environment, particularly tidal forces triggered by cluster interactions, significantly accelerate the sinking of MBHs to the galactic center. This process leads to the formation of a hard binary in $\lesssim 500$ Myr after the onset of a galaxy merger. Our results show that in 8 out of 12 models, the high stellar density of the surrounding NSCs enhances MBH hardening, facilitating gravitational wave (GW) mergers by redshift $z = 4$. We conclude that at $z &gt; 4$, dense NSCs serve as the dominant channel for MBH seed mergers, producing a merger rate of $0.3$--$0.6\, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at $z = 4$, which is approximately 300--600 times higher than in non-NSC environments. In contrast, in environments without NSCs, surrounding dark matter plays a more significant role in loss-cone scattering.</description>

      <title>Incorporating model accuracy into gravitational-wave Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inferring the properties of colliding black holes from gravitational-wave observations is subject to systematic errors arising from modelling uncertainties. Although the accuracy of each model can be calculated through comparison to theoretical expectations from general relativity, Bayesian analyses are yet to incorporate this information. As such, a mixture model is typically used where results obtained with different gravitational-wave models are combined with either equal weight, or based on their relative Bayesian evidence. In this work we present a novel method to incorporate the accuracy of multiple models in gravitational-wave Bayesian analyses. By analysing simulated gravitational-wave signals in zero-noise, we show that our technique uses $30\%$ less computational resources, and more faithfully recovers the true parameters than existing techniques. We envisage that this method will become an essential tool within ground-based gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev Based Spectral Representations of Neutron-Star Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal parametric representations of neutron-star equations of state are constructed here using Chebyshev polynomial based spectral expansions. The accuracies of these representations are evaluated for a collection of model equations of state from a variety of nuclear-theory models and also a collection of equations of state with first- or second-order phase transitions of various sizes. These tests show that the Chebyshev based representations are convergent (even for equations of state with phase transitions) as the number of spectral basis functions is increased. This study finds that the Chebyshev based representations are generally more accurate than a previously studied power-law based spectral representation, and that pressure-based representations are generally more accurate than those based on enthalpy.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Astrophysics with TianQin: A brief progress review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a space-borne gravitational wave observatory, TianQin can observe a large variety of gravitational wave sources. The rich signals can be composed by different types of astronomical systems, like Galactic compact binaries, inspiral of stellar mass black holes, merger of massive black holes, and extreme mass ratio inspirals. The incoherent summation of these signals can also form a stochastic gravitational wave background. Using the future TianQin observation, it is possible to put stringent constraints on fundamental science, like the expansion history of our universe. In this work, we provide a brief review of these topics that contributes to the 7th International Workshop on the TianQin Science Mission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The opening of the gravitational wave window has significantly enhanced our capacity to explore the universe's most extreme and dynamic sector. In the mHz frequency range, a diverse range of compact objects, from the most massive black holes at the farthest reaches of the Universe to the lightest white dwarfs in our cosmic backyard, generate a complex and dynamic symphony of gravitational wave signals. Once recorded by gravitational wave detectors, these unique fingerprints have the potential to decipher the birth and growth of cosmic structures over a wide range of scales, from stellar binaries and stellar clusters to galaxies and large-scale structures. The TianQin space-borne gravitational wave mission is scheduled for launch in the 2030s, with an operational lifespan of five years. It will facilitate pivotal insights into the history of our universe. This document presents a concise overview of the detectable sources of TianQin, outlining their characteristics, the challenges they present, and the expected impact of the TianQin observatory on our understanding of them.</description>

      <title>Neutron star g-modes in the relativistic Cowling approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mature neutron stars are expected to exhibit gravity g-modes due to stratification caused by a varying matter composition in the high-density core. By employing the BSk equation of state family, and working within the relativistic Cowling approximation, we examine how subtle differences in the nuclear matter assumptions impact on the g-mode spectrum. We investigate the possibility of detecting individual g-mode resonances during a binary inspiral with current and next-generation ground-based detectors, like Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. Our results suggest that these resonances may be within the reach of future detectors, especially for low mass stars with $M\lesssim1.4M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Horizon replicas in black hole shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, new exploratory channels have opened up for the physics of highly compact objects, such as gravitational waves and black hole shadows. Moreover, more precise analysis and observations are now possible in the physics of accretion around compact objects. These advancements provide in particular an unprecedented insight into the physics near the horizons of a black hole. In this work we focus on the shadow boundary of a Kerr black hole, introducing observables related to special null orbits, called horizons replicas, solutions of the shadow edge equations which are related to particular photon orbits, defined by constraints on their impact parameter, carrying information about the angular momentum of the central spinning object. These orbits are related to particular regions on the shadow boundary and might be used to determine the spin of the black hole. The results provide the conditions by which horizon replicas are imprinted in the black hole shadow profile, in dependence on the black hole dimensionless spin and observational angle, providing eventually new templates for the future observations.</description>

      <title>Common origin for black holes in both high mass X-ray binaries and gravitational-wave sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.09401v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black-hole (BH) high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) systems are likely to be the progenitors of BH-BH mergers detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK). Yet merging BHs reach higher masses ($\sim 100M_{\odot}$) than BHs in HMXBs ($\sim 20 M_{\odot}$) and exhibit lower spins ($a_{\rm BH}\lesssim 0.25$ with a larger values tail) than what is often claimed for BHs in HMXBs ($a_{\rm BH}\gtrsim 0.9$). This could suggest that these two classes of systems belong to different populations, but here we show that this may not necessarily be the case. The difference in masses is easily explained as the known HMXB-BHs are in galaxies with relatively high metallicity, so their progenitor stars are subject to strong mass loss from winds, leading to relatively low-mass BH at core collapse. Conversely, LVK is also able to detect BHs from low-metallicity galaxies that produce more massive stellar-origin BHs. The difference in spin is more difficult to explain. Models with efficient angular momentum transport in stellar interiors produce slowly spinning progenitors for both LVK and HMXB BHs. Known HMXBs have orbital periods that are too long for tidal spin-up and are unlikely to have undergone significant accretion spin-up. Instead, we show that the derived value of the BH spin depends strongly on how the HMXB accretion disc emission is modelled. We argue that since Cyg X-1 is never observed in a soft state, the appropriate spectral models must take into account the Comptonisation of the disc photosphere. We show that such models are consistent with low spin values, namely: $a_{\rm BH}\sim 0.1$. This was confirmed by other teams for both Cyg X-1 and LMC X-1 and we show this is also the case for M33 X-7. We conclude that all HMXB BHs can exhibit low spins, in accordance with stellar evolution models. Hence, the observations are consistent with the LVK BHs and HMXB BHs belonging to the same population.</description>

      <title>Correlated spectro-polarimetric study along the Z track in XTE J1701-462 puts constraints on its coronal geometry</title>

Abstract: Context. In September 2022, the transient neutron star low-mass X-ray binary XTE J1701-462 went into a new outburst. Aims. The objective of this work is to examine the evolution of the accretion geometry of XTE J1701-462 by studying the spectro-polarimetric properties along the Z track of this source. The simultaneous observations archived by the Insight-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT) and the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) give us the opportunity. Methods. We present a comprehensive X-ray spectro-polarimetric analysis of XTE J1701-462, using simultaneous observations from IXPE, Insight-HXMT and NuSTAR. For IXPE observations, two methods are employed to measure the polarization: a model-independent measurement with PCUBE and a model-dependent polarization-spectral analysis with XSPEC. The corresponding spectra from Insight-HXMT and NuSTAR are studied with two configurations that correspond to a slab-like corona and a spherical shell-like corona, respectively. Results. Significant polarization characteristics are detected in XTE J1701-462. The polarization degree shows a decreasing trend along the Z track, reducing from (4.84 $\pm$ 0.37)% to (3.76 $\pm$ 0.43)% on the horizontal branch and jumping to less than 1% on the normal branch. The simultaneous spectral analysis from Insight-HXMT and NuSTAR suggests that the evolution of the PD is closely linked to changes in the flux of the Comptonized component and its covering factor along the Z track, supporting a shrinking corona.</description>

      <title>Accretion tori around rotating neutron stars I: Structure, shape and size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a full general relativistic analytic solution for a radiation-pressure supported equilibrium fluid torus orbiting a rotating neutron star (NS). Previously developed analytical methods are thoroughly applied in the Hartle-Thorne geometry, including the effects of both the NS's angular momentum and quadrupole moment. The structure, size and shape of the torus are explored, focusing especially on the critically thick solution - the cusp tori. For the astrophysically relevant range of NS parameters, we examine how our findings differ from those obtained for the Schwarzschild spacetime. The solutions for rotating stars display signatures of the interplay between relativistic and Newtonian effects where the impact of NS angular momentum and quadrupole moment are almost counterbalanced at the given radius. Nevertheless, the spacetime parameters still strongly influence the size of tori, which can be shown in a coordinate-independent way. Finally, we discuss the importance of the size of the central NS, determining whether or not the surrounding torus may exist. We provide a set of tools in a Wolfram Mathematica code, which poses a basis allowing for a further investigation of the impact of the NSs' superdense matter equation of state on the spectral and temporal behaviour of accretion tori.</description>

      <title>Magnetized Accretion onto and Feedback from Supermassive Black Holes in Elliptical Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the fueling of supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies from a turbulent cooling medium on galactic scales, taking M87* as a typical case. We find that the mass accretion rate is increased by a factor of $\sim 10$ compared with analogous hydrodynamic simulations. The scaling of $\dot{M} \sim r^{1/2}$ roughly holds from $\sim 10\,\mathrm{pc}$ to $\sim 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{pc}$ ($\sim 10\, r_\mathrm{g}$) with the accretion rate through the event horizon being $\sim 10^{-2}\, M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$. The accretion flow on scales $\sim 0.03-3\,\mathrm{kpc}$ takes the form of magnetized filaments. Within $\sim 30\,\mathrm{pc}$, the cold gas circularizes, forming a highly magnetized ($\beta\sim 10^{-3}$) thick disk supported by a primarily toroidal magnetic field. The cold disk is truncated and transitions to a turbulent hot accretion flow at $\sim0.3\,\mathrm{pc}$ ($10^3\,r_\mathrm{g}$). There are strong outflows towards the poles driven by the magnetic field. The outflow energy flux increases with smaller accretor size, reaching $\sim 3\times10^{43}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ for $r_\mathrm{in}=8\,r_\mathrm{g}$; this corresponds to a nearly constant energy feedback efficiency of $\eta\sim0.05-0.1$ independent of accretor size. The feedback energy is enough to balance the total cooling of the M87/Virgo hot halo out to $\sim 50$ kpc. The accreted magnetic flux at small radii is similar to that in magnetically arrested disk models, consistent with the formation of a powerful jet on horizon scales in M87. Our results motivate a subgrid model for accretion in lower-resolution simulations in which the hot gas accretion rate is suppressed relative to the Bondi rate by $\sim (10r_\mathrm{g}/r_\mathrm{B})^{1/2}$.</description>

      <title>Constraining the dense matter equation of state with new NICER mass-radius measurements and new chiral effective field theory inputs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulse profile modeling of X-ray data from NICER is now enabling precision inference of neutron star mass and radius. Combined with nuclear physics constraints from chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT), and masses and tidal deformabilities inferred from gravitational wave detections of binary neutron star mergers, this has lead to a steady improvement in our understanding of the dense matter equation of state (EOS). Here we consider the impact of several new results: the radius measurement for the 1.42$\,M_\odot$ pulsar PSR J0437$-$4715 presented by Choudhury et al. (2024), updates to the masses and radii of PSR J0740$+$6620 and PSR J0030$+$0451, and new $\chi$EFT results for neutron star matter up to 1.5 times nuclear saturation density. Using two different high-density EOS extensions -- a piecewise-polytropic (PP) model and a model based on the speed of sound in a neutron star (CS) -- we find the radius of a 1.4$\,M_\odot$ (2.0$\,M_\odot$) neutron star to be constrained to the 95% credible ranges $12.28^{+0.50}_{-0.76}\,$km ($12.33^{+0.70}_{-1.34}\,$km) for the PP model and $12.01^{+0.56}_{-0.75}\,$km ($11.55^{+0.94}_{-1.09}\,$km) for the CS model. The maximum neutron star mass is predicted to be $2.15^{+0.14}_{-0.16}\,$$M_\odot$ and $2.08^{+0.28}_{-0.16}\,$$M_\odot$ for the PP and CS model, respectively. We explore the sensitivity of our results to different orders and different densities up to which $\chi$EFT is used, and show how the astrophysical observations provide constraints for the pressure at intermediate densities. Moreover, we investigate the difference $R_{2.0} - R_{1.4}$ of the radius of 2$\,M_\odot$ and 1.4$\,M_\odot$ neutron stars within our EOS inference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron stars have solid crusts threaded by strong magnetic fields. Perturbations in the crust can excite non-radial oscillations, which can in turn launch Alfven waves into the magnetosphere. In the case of a compact binary close to merger involving at least one neutron star, this can happen through tidal interactions causing resonant excitations that shatter the neutron star crust. We present the first numerical study that elucidates the dynamics of Alfven waves launched in a compact binary magnetosphere. We seed a magnetic field perturbation on the neutron star crust, which we then evolve in fully general-relativistic force-free electrodynamics using a GPU-based implementation. We show that Alfven waves steepen nonlinearly before reaching the orbital light cylinder, form flares, and dissipate energy in a transient current sheet. Our results predict radio and X-ray precursor emission from this process.</description>

      <title>Late Jets, Early Sparks: Illuminating the Premaximum Bumps in Superluminous Supernovae</title>

Abstract: Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) radiate $\gtrsim 10-100$ times more energy than ordinary stellar explosions, implicating a novel power source behind these enigmatic events. One frequently discussed source, particularly for hydrogen-poor (Type I) SLSNe, is a central engine such as a millisecond magnetar or accreting black hole. Both black hole and magnetar engines are expected to channel a fraction of their luminosity into a collimated relativistic jet. Using 3D relativistic hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the interaction of a relativistic jet, endowed with a luminosity $L_{\rm j}\approx10^{45.5}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$ and duration $t_{\rm eng} \approx 10\,{\rm days}$ compatible with those needed to power SLSNe, launched into the envelope of the exploding star. The jet successfully breaks through the expanding ejecta, and its shocked cocoon powers ultraviolet/optical emission lasting several days after the explosion and reaching a peak luminosity $\gtrsim 10^{44}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}} $, corresponding to a sizable fraction of $L_{\rm j}$. This high radiative efficiency is the result of the modest adiabatic losses the cocoon experiences owing to the low optical depths of the enlarged ejecta at these late times, e.g., compared to the more compact stars in gamma-ray bursts. The luminosity and temperature of the cocoon emission match those of the ``bumps'' in SLSN light curves observed weeks prior to the optical maximum in many SLSNe. Confirmation of jet breakout signatures by future observations (e.g., days-long to weeks-long internal X-ray emission from the jet for on-axis observers, spectroscopy confirming large photosphere velocities $v/c \gtrsim 0.1$, or detection of a radio afterglow) would offer strong evidence for central engines powering SLSNe.</description>

      <title>Orbital motion of NGC 6166 (3C 338) and its impact on the jet morphology at kiloparsec scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the central region of the galaxy cluster Abell 2199 (A2199) resides the cD galaxy NGC 6166, which spatially coincides with the 3C 338 radio source. Lobes, jets, and a more detached southern structure (similar to a jet labelled as ridge) are seen at kiloparsec-scale images of 3C 338. This unusual radio morphology has led to the proposition of different hypotheses about its physical origin in the literature. In this work, we study the feasibility of a dynamical scenario where NGC 6166 moves around the X-ray inferred centre of A2199 from the point of view of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. The physical characteristics of the intra-cluster medium in which the jet propagates are constrained to those derived from X-ray observations in the vicinity of NGC 6166. Possible orbits for the jet inlet region are derived from the estimated radial velocity of NGC 6166, while the jet parameters are constrained by parsec-scale interferometric radio observations and the estimated jet power of 3C 338 obtained from radio and X-ray data. Our results show that the hypothesis of NGC 6166 has been moving around the centre of A2199 during the last tens of million of years is compatible with the general radio morphology of 3C 338. Furthermore, the proposed dynamic scenario for the motion of NGC 6166 may be linked to gravitational perturbations induced by the passage of a sub-cluster of galaxies hundreds of millions of years ago.</description>

      <title>Neutrino flux sensitivity to the next galactic core-collapse supernova in COSINUS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While neutrinos are often treated as a background for many dark matter experiments, these particles offer a new avenue for physics: the detection of core-collapse supernovae. Supernovae are extremely energetic, violent and complex events that mark the death of massive stars. During their collapse stars emit a large number of neutrinos in a short burst. These neutrinos carry 99\% of the emitted energy which makes their detection fundamental in understanding supernovae. This paper illustrates how COSINUS (Cryogenic Observatory for SIgnatures seen in Next-generation Underground Searches), a sodium iodide (NaI) based dark matter search, will be sensitive to the next galactic core-collapse supernova. The experiment is composed of two separate detectors which will be sensitive to far and nearby supernovae. The inner core of the experiment will consist of NaI crystals operating as scintillating calorimeters, mainly sensitive to the Coherent Elastic Scattering of Neutrinos (CE$\nu$NS) against the Na and I nuclei. The low mass of the cryogenic detectors gives the experiment a sensitivity to close supernovae below 1kpc without pileup. They will see up to hundreds of CE$\nu$NS events from a supernova happening at 200pc. The crystals reside at the center of a cylindrical 230T water tank, instrumented with 30 photomultipliers. This tank acts as a passive and active shield able to detect the Cherenkov radiation induced by impinging charged particles from ambient and cosmogenic radioactivity. A supernova near the Milky Way Center (10kpc) will be easily detected inducing $\sim$60 measurable events, and the water tank will have a 3$\sigma$ sensitivity to supernovae up to 22kpc, seeing $\sim$10 events. This paper shows how, even without dedicated optimization, modern dark matter experiments will also play their part in the multi-messenger effort to detect the next galactic core-collapse supernova.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of common envelope stage in close binary systems: comparison between Newtonian and modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the important stage in evolution of close binary system namely common envelope phase in framework of various models of modified gravity. The comparison of results between calculations in Newtonian gravity and modified gravity allows to estimate possible observational imprints of modified gravity. Although declination from Newtonian gravity should be negligible we can propose that due to the long times some new effects can appear. We use the moving-mesh code AREPO for numerical simulation of binary system consisting of $\sim M_{\odot}$ white dwarf and a red giant with mass $\sim 2 M_{\odot}$. For implementing modified gravity into AREPO code we apply the method of (pseudo)potential, assuming that modified gravity can be described by small corrections to usual Newtonian gravitational potential. As in Newtonian case initial orbit has to shrink due to the energy transfer to the envelope of a giant. We investigated evolution of common envelope in a case of simple model of modified gravity with various values of parameters and compared results with simulation in frames of Newtonian gravity.</description>

      <title>Estimate for the bulk viscosity of strongly coupled quark matter using perturbative QCD and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern hydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star mergers require knowledge not only of the equilibrium properties of strongly interacting matter, but also of the system's response to perturbations, encoded in various transport coefficients. Using perturbative and holographic tools, we derive here an improved weak-coupling and a new strong-coupling result for the most important transport coefficient of unpaired quark matter, its bulk viscosity. These results are combined in a simple analytic pocket formula for the quantity that is rooted in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics at high densities but takes into account nonperturbative holographic input at neutron-star densities, where the system is strongly coupled. This expression can be used in the modeling of unpaired quark matter at astrophysically relevant temperatures and densities.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally produced Dark Matter and primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine how the existence of a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) influences cosmological gravitational particle production (CGPP) for spin-0 and spin-1 particles. In addition to the known effects of particle production and entropy dilution resulting from PBH evaporation, we find that the generation of dark matter (DM) through CGPP is profoundly influenced by a possible era of PBH matter domination. This early matter dominated era results in an enhancement of the particle spectrum from CGPP. Specifically, it amplifies the peak comoving momentum $k_\star$ for spin-1 DM, while enhancing the plateau of the spectrum for minimally coupled spin-0 particles for low comoving momenta. At the same time, the large entropy dilution may partially or completely compensate for the increase of the spectrum and strongly mitigates the DM abundance produced by CGPP. Our results show that, in the computation of the final abundance, CGPP and PBH evaporation cannot be disentangled, but the parameters of both sectors must be considered together to obtain the final result. Furthermore, we explore the potential formation of PBHs from density fluctuations arising from CGPP and the associated challenges in such a scenario.</description>

      <title>Theory of neutrino fast flavor evolution. Part I. Linear response theory and stability conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06708v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino-neutrino refraction leads to collective flavor evolution that can include fast flavor conversion, an ingredient still missing in numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae. We provide a theoretical framework for the linear regime of this phenomenon using the language of response theory. In analogy to electromagnetic waves, we introduce a flavor susceptibility as the linear response to an external flavor field. By requiring self-consistency, this approach leads to the usual dispersion relation for growing modes, but differs from the traditional treatment in that it predicts Landau damping of subluminal collective modes. The new dispersion relation has definite analyticity properties and can be expanded for small growth rates. This approach simplifies and intuitively explains Morinaga's proof of sufficiency for the occurrence of growing modes. We show that weakly growing modes arise as soon as an angular crossing is formed, due to their resonant interaction with individual neutrino modes. For longitudinal plasma waves, a similar resonance causes Landau damping or conversely, the two-stream instability.</description>

      <title>Searching for cosmological stochastic backgrounds by notching out resolvable compact binary foregrounds with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds can be of either cosmological or astrophysical origin. The detection of an astrophysical stochastic gravitational-wave background with ground-based interferometers is expected in the near future. Perhaps even more excitingly, the detection of stochastic backgrounds of cosmological origin by future ground-based interferometers could reveal invaluable information about the early Universe. From this perspective, the astrophysical background is a {\it foreground} that can prevent the extraction of this information from the data. In this paper, we revisit a time-frequency domain notching procedure previously proposed to remove the astrophysical foreground in the context of next-generation ground-based detectors, but we consider the more realistic scenario where we remove individually detectable signals by taking into account the uncertainty in the estimation of their parameters. We find that time-frequency domain masks can still efficiently remove the astrophysical foreground and suppress it to about $5\%$ of its original level. Further removal of the foreground formed by unresolvable events (in particular, unresolvable binary neutron stars), which is about $10$ times larger than the residual foreground from realistic notching, would require detector sensitivity improvements. Therefore, the main limitation in the search for a cosmological background is the unresolvable foreground itself, and not the residual of the notching procedure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixing between ultralight bosons and the Standard Model photon may allow access to the hitherto invisible Universe. In the presence of plasma, photons are dressed with an effective mass which will influence the conversion between the two. We study this phenomenon, known as in-medium suppression, in the context of black hole physics. We consider both axion-photon mixing around charged black holes and dark photon-photon mixing around neutral black holes. We find that the presence of plasma indeed influences the conversion rate, possibly quenching it altogether for large plasma densities, and discuss implications for superradiance and observational signatures.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Jona-Lasinio description of hadronic matter from a Bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A microscopic nuclear matter formalism with explicit chiral symmetry based on the Nambu Jona-Lasinio model is considered to describe nuclear matter. To reproduce nuclear matter properties adequately at the saturation density, four-point and eight-point interactions are introduced. Within a Bayesian inference approach, the parameters of the model are determined by imposing nuclear matter, both experimental and from {\it ab-initio} calculations, and neutron star observational constraints. Nuclear matter properties are well reproduced with an effective mass of 0.75 to 0.8 nucleon mass at the saturation density. At 90% confidence level, the radius of a $1.4 ~\rm M_\odot$ star varies between 11.48 km and 13.20 km, masses as large as $\sim 2.2 ~\rm M_\odot$ are predicted and the radius of a 2 M$_\odot$ star is above 10.5 km. High-density perturbative QCD (pQCD) results exclude equations of state that predict larger maximum masses and radii. The speed of sound increases monotonically with density and reaches values as large as $\sqrt{0.7}c$-$\sqrt{0.8}c$ in the center of massive stars. Several properties such as the polytropic index or the renormalized trace anomaly, that have been proposed to identify the deconfined phase transition, are analyzed. Interestingly, the radius of the obtained posterior that also meets pQCD constraints aligns closely with the mass-radius measurement of the recent PSR J0437-4715, which contrasts with other relativistic mean field model results.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the $10^7$ K hot emitting gas in the Circumgalactic medium of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of the $\approx 10^6$ K gas in the circumgalactic medium of the Milky Way has been well established. However, the location and the origin of the newly discovered hot gas at `super-virial' temperatures of $\approx 10^7$ K have been puzzling. This hot gas has been detected in both absorption and emission; here we focus on the emitting gas only. We show that both the `virial' and the `super-virial' temperature gas as observed in \emph{emission} occupy disk-like extraplanar regions, in addition to the diffuse virial temperature gas filling the halo of the Milky Way. We perform idealized hydrodynamical simulations to show that the $\approx 10^7$ K emitting gas is likely to be produced by stellar feedback in and around the Galactic disk. We further show that the emitting gas at both super-virial and virial temperatures in the extraplanar regions is metal enriched and is not in hydrostatic equilibrium with the halo but is continuously evolving.</description>

      <title>Can supernova from runaway stars mimic the signs of absorbing `super-virial' gas?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of large column density absorption lines from highly ionized gas in a few directions through the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way (MW) has been puzzling. The inferred temperature from these absorption lines far exceeds the virial temperature of the MW, and the column densities are also too large to be easily explained. In this paper, we propose a novel idea to explain these observations and claim that they may not have originated from the CGM, but from a totally different type of source, namely, stellar ejecta from supernovae (SNe) above the Galactic disk that happen to lie in the line of sight to the background quasars. About $\sim 20\%$ of massive OB stars (progenitors of core-collapse supernovae) are known to be runaway stars that have high ejection velocities near the Galactic plane and can end up exploding as SNe above the Galactic disk. We show that the associated reverse shock in the supernova remnant in the early non-radiative phase can heat the ejecta to temperatures of $\gtrsim 10^7\,{\rm K}$ and can naturally explain the observed high column density of ions in the observed `super-virial' phase along with $\alpha$-enriched super-solar abundance that is typical of core-collapse supernovae. However, SNe from runaway stars has a covering fraction of $\lesssim 0.7 \%$ and thus can only explain the observations along limited sightlines.</description>

      <title>Theory of neutrino fast flavor conversions. Part II. Solutions at the edge of instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In dense neutrino environments, such as provided by core-collapse supernovae or neutron-star mergers, neutrino angular distributions may be unstable to collective flavor conversions, whose outcome remains to be fully understood. These conversions are much faster than hydrodynamical scales, suggesting that self-consistent configurations may never be strongly unstable. With this motivation in mind, we study weakly unstable modes, i.e., those with small growth rates. We show that our newly developed dispersion relation (Paper~I of this series) allows for an expansion in powers of the small growth rate. For weakly unstable distributions, we show that the unstable modes must either move with subluminal phase velocity, or very close to the speed of light. The instability is fed from neutrinos moving resonantly with the waves, allowing us to derive explicit expressions for the growth rate. For axisymmetric distributions, often assumed in the literature, numerical examples show the accuracy of these expressions. We also note that for the often-studied one-dimensional systems one should not forget the axial-symmetry-breaking modes, and we provide explicit expressions for the range of wavenumbers that exhibit instabilities.</description>
