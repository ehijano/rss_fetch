      <title>Qubit stabilisation via learning capable materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I describe the engineered decoherence of a qubit state by means of an environment formed out of a neurally architected material. Such a material is a material that can adjust its inner properties in the same way a neural network is adjusting its weights, subject to a built-in cost function. Such a material is naturally found in biological structures (like a brain) but can in principle be engineered at a microscopic level. If such a material is used as an environment for a Nakajima-Zwanzig equation describing the controlled decoherence of a quantum state, we obtain a modified decoherence that allows for correlated states to exist longer or even to become robust. Such a neural material can also be architected to implement certain quantum gate operations on the encapsulated qubit.</description>

      <title>The binding of cosmological structures by massless topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming spherical symmetry and weak field, it is shown that if one solves the Poisson equation or the Einstein field equations sourced by a topological defect, \ie~a singularity of a very specific form, the result is a localised gravitational field capable of driving flat rotation (\ie~Keplerian circular orbits at a constant speed for all radii) of test masses on a thin spherical shell without any underlying mass. Moreover, a large-scale structure which exploits this solution by assembling concentrically a number of such topological defects can establish a flat stellar or galactic rotation curve, and can also deflect light in the same manner as an equipotential (isothermal) sphere. Thus the need for dark matter or modified gravity theory is mitigated, at least in part.</description>

      <title>Light-Light scattering in Very Special Relativity Quantum Electrodynamics and Cosmic Anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider scattering of light by light in Very Special Relativity (VSR) Quantum Electrodynamics(QED) with a non-zero photon mass. In order to preserve gauge invariance and Sim(2) symmetry we made use of a recently introduced infrared regularization of VSR theories. Additionally we show that all one loop diagrams with any number of photon external legs and zero fermion legs reduce to the standard QED result with the effective electron mass, as required by unitarity. It follows that the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian is the same as in QED. The total cross section of scattering of light by light exhibits tiny anisotropies that could be detected at cosmological scales. In particular they should be looked at the Cosmic Microwave Background(CMB) Radiation for low photon frequencies.</description>

      <title>Does there exist the applicability limit of PDE to describe physical phenomena? -- A personal survey of Quantization, QED, Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What does it mean to study PDE(=Partial Differential Equation)? How and what to do "to claim proudly that I'm studying a certain PDE"? Newton mechanic uses mainly ODE(=Ordinary Differential Equation) and describes nicely movements of Sun, Moon and Earth etc. Now, so-called quantum phenomenum is described by, say Schr\"odinger equation, PDE which explains both wave and particle characters after quantization of ODE. The coupled Maxwell-Dirac equation is also "quantized" and QED(=Quantum Electro-Dynamics) theory is invented by physicists. Though it is said this QED gives very good coincidence between theoretical and experimental observed quantities, but what is the equation corresponding to QED? Or, is it possible to describe QED by "equation" in naive sense?</description>
