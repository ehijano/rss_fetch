      <title>Close-enough general routing problem for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles in monitoring missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a close-enough multi-UAV general routing problem (CEMUAVGRP) where a fleet of homogeneous UAVs conduct monitoring tasks containing nodes, each of which has its disk neighborhood, and edges, aiming to minimize the total distance. A two-phase iterative method is proposed, partitioning the CEMUAVGRP into a general routing phase where a satisfactory route including required nodes and edges for each UAV is obtained without considering the disk neighborhoods of required nodes, and a close-enough routing phase where representative points are optimized for each required node in the determined route. To be specific, a variable neighborhood descent (VND) heuristic is proposed for the general routing phase, while a second-order cone programming (SOCP) procedure is applied in the close-enough routing phase. These two phases are performed in an iterative fashion under the framework of an adaptive iterated local search (AILS) algorithm until the predefined termination criteria are satisfied. Extensive experiments and comparative studies are conducted, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed AILS-VND-SOCP algorithm and the superiority of disk neighborhoods.</description>

      <title>Stability and convergence of multi-converter systems using projection-free power-limiting droop control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a projection-free power-limiting droop control for grid-connected power electronics and an associated constrained flow problem. In contrast to projection-based power-limiting droop control, the novel projection-free power-limiting droop control results in networked dynamics that are semi-globally exponentially stable with respect to the set of optimizers of the constrained flow problem. Under a change to edge coordinates, the overall networked dynamics arising from projection-free power-limiting droop control coincide with the projection-free primal-dual dynamics associated with an augmented Lagrangian of the constrained flow problem. Leveraging this result, we (i) provide a bound on the convergence rate of the projection-free networked dynamics, (ii) propose a tuning method for controller parameters to improve the bound on the convergence rate, and (iii) analyze the relationship of the bound on the convergence rate and connectivity of the network. Finally, the analytical results are illustrated using an Electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Implicit Cooperation: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach Towards Decentralized Local Energy Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes implicit cooperation, a framework enabling decentralized agents to approximate optimal coordination in local energy markets without explicit peer-to-peer communication. We formulate the problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision problem that is solved through a multi-agent reinforcement learning task in which agents use stigmergic signals (key performance indicators at the system level) to infer and react to global states. Through a 3x3 factorial design on an IEEE 34-node topology, we evaluated three training paradigms (CTCE, CTDE, DTDE) and three algorithms (PPO, APPO, SAC). Results identify APPO-DTDE as the optimal configuration, achieving a coordination score of 91.7% relative to the theoretical centralized benchmark (CTCE). However, a critical trade-off emerges between efficiency and stability: while the centralized benchmark maximizes allocative efficiency with a peer-to-peer trade ratio of 0.6, the fully decentralized approach (DTDE) demonstrates superior physical stability. Specifically, DTDE reduces the variance of grid balance by 31% compared to hybrid architectures, establishing a highly predictable, import-biased load profile that simplifies grid regulation. Furthermore, topological analysis reveals emergent spatial clustering, where decentralized agents self-organize into stable trading communities to minimize congestion penalties. While SAC excelled in hybrid settings, it failed in decentralized environments due to entropy-driven instability. This research proves that stigmergic signaling provides sufficient context for complex grid coordination, offering a robust, privacy-preserving alternative to expensive centralized communication infrastructure.</description>

      <title>MARLEM: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Simulation Framework for Implicit Cooperation in Decentralized Local Energy Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, open-source MARL simulation framework for studying implicit cooperation in LEMs, modeled as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and implemented as a Gymnasium environment for MARL. Our framework features a modular market platform with plug-and-play clearing mechanisms, physically constrained agent models (including battery storage), a realistic grid network, and a comprehensive analytics suite to evaluate emergent coordination. The main contribution is a novel method to foster implicit cooperation, where agents' observations and rewards are enhanced with system-level key performance indicators to enable them to independently learn strategies that benefit the entire system and aim for collectively beneficial outcomes without explicit communication. Through representative case studies (available in a dedicated GitHub repository in https://github.com/salazarna/marlem, we show the framework's ability to analyze how different market configurations (such as varying storage deployment) impact system performance. This illustrates its potential to facilitate emergent coordination, improve market efficiency, and strengthen grid stability. The proposed simulation framework is a flexible, extensible, and reproducible tool for researchers and practitioners to design, test, and validate strategies for future intelligent, decentralized energy systems.</description>

      <title>Tunable Ferroelectric Acoustic Resonators in Monolithic Thin-Film Barium Titanate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing development of wireless communication bands has motivated the development of compact, low-loss, and frequency adjustable RF filtering technologies. Acoustic resonators are the ideal solution to these requirements, and tunable implementations offer a path toward reconfigurable front ends. In this work, we investigate epitaxial barium titanate (BTO) grown on silicon as a platform for tunable acoustic resonators operating in the sub-GHz regime. We demonstrate lateral excitation of symmetric lamb (S0) modes in X-cut BTO membranes, in contrast to prior thickness-defined ferroelectric resonators. Devices are designed using finite-element simulations and fabricated with laterally patterned electrodes that enable overtone coupling to multiple resonant modes. Under applied DC bias, ferroelectric domains align, allowing electrical excitation, frequency tuning, and quality-factor enhancement of acoustic modes. Resonances near 300 MHz and 700 MHz exhibit electromechanical coupling up to 8% and bias-dependent frequency tuning, with a distinct transition in behavior near 20 V. These results highlight monolithic BTO on silicon as a promising material system for laterally excited, tunable acoustic resonators for reconfigurable RF applications.</description>

      <title>Discovering Unknown Inverter Governing Equations via Physics-Informed Sparse Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering the unknown governing equations of grid-connected inverters from external measurements holds significant attraction for analyzing modern inverter-intensive power systems. However, existing methods struggle to balance the identification of unmodeled nonlinearities with the preservation of physical consistency. To address this, this paper proposes a Physics-Informed Sparse Machine Learning (PISML) framework. The architecture integrates a sparse symbolic backbone to capture dominant model skeletons with a neural residual branch that compensates for complex nonlinear control logic. Meanwhile, a Jacobian-regularized physics-informed training mechanism is introduced to enforce multi-scale consistency including large/small-scale behaviors. Furthermore, by performing symbolic regression on the neural residual branch, PISML achieves a tractable mapping from black-box data to explicit control equations. Experimental results on a high-fidelity Hardware-in-the-Loop platform demonstrate the framework's superior performance. It not only achieves high-resolution identification by reducing error by over 340 times compared to baselines but also realizes the compression of heavy neural networks into compact explicit forms. This restores analytical tractability for rigorous stability analysis and reduces computational complexity by orders of magnitude. It also provides a unified pathway to convert structurally inaccessible devices into explicit mathematical models, enabling stability analysis of power systems with unknown inverter governing equations.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Safe Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile networks require safe optimization to adapt to changing conditions in traffic demand and signal transmission quality, in addition to improving service performance metrics. With the increasing complexity of emerging mobile networks, traditional parameter tuning methods become too conservative or complex to evaluate. For the first time, we apply safe Bayesian optimization to mobile networks. Moreover, we develop a new safe collaborative optimization algorithm called CoSBO, leveraging information from multiple optimization tasks in the network and considering multiple safety constraints. The resulting algorithm is capable of safely tuning the network parameter online with very few iterations. We demonstrate that the proposed method improves sample efficiency in the early stages of the optimization process by comparing it against the SafeOpt-MC algorithm in a mobile network scenario.</description>

      <title>Autonomous and non-autonomous fixed-time leader-follower consensus for second-order multi-agent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of consensus tracking with fixed-time convergence, for leader-follower multi-agent systems with double-integrator dynamics, where only a subset of followers has access to the state of the leader. The control scheme is divided into two steps. The first one is dedicated to the estimation of the leader state by each follower in a distributed way and in a fixed-time. Then, based on the estimate of the leader state, each follower computes its control law to track the leader in a fixed-time. In this paper, two control strategies are investigated and compared to solve the two mentioned steps. The first one is an autonomous protocol which ensures a fixed-time convergence for the observer and for the controller parts where the Upper Bound of the Settling-Time (UBST) is set a priory by the user. Then, the previous strategy is redesigned using time-varying gains to obtain a non-autonomous protocol. This enables to obtain less conservative estimates of the UBST while guaranteeing that the time-varying gains remain bounded. Some numerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed consensus protocols.</description>

      <title>Certifying Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Learned via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework to \emph{certify} Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) reachability learned by reinforcement learning (RL). Building on a discounted initial time \emph{travel-cost} formulation that makes small-step RL value iteration provably equivalent to a forward Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) equation with damping, we convert certified learning errors into calibrated inner/outer enclosures of strict backward reachable tube. The core device is an additive-offset identity: if $W_\lambda$ solves the discounted travel-cost Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation, then $W_\varepsilon:=W_\lambda + \varepsilon$ solves the same PDE with a constant offset $\lambda\varepsilon$. This means that a uniform value error is \emph{exactly} equal to a constant HJB offset. We establish this uniform value error via two routes: (A) a Bellman operator-residual bound, and (B) a HJB PDE-slack bound. Our framework preserves HJ-level safety semantics and is compatible with deep RL. We demonstrate the approach on a double-integrator system by formally certifying, via satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), a value function learned through reinforcement learning to induce provably correct inner and outer backward-reachable set enclosures over a compact region of interest.</description>

      <title>Optimal Placement and Sizing of PV-Based DG Units in a Distribution Network Considering Loading Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research paper proposes an efficient methodology for the allocation of multiple photovoltaic (PV)-based distributed generation (DG) units in the radial distribution network (RDN), while considering the loading capacity of the network. The proposed method is structured using a two-stage approach. In the first stage, the additional active power loading capacity of the network and each individual bus is determined using an iterative approach. This analysis quantifies the network's additional active loadability limits and identifies buses with high active power loading capacity, which are considered candidate nodes for the placement of DG units. Subsequently, in the second stage, the optimal locations and sizes of DG units are determined using the Monte Carlo method, with the objectives of minimizing voltage deviation and reducing active power losses in the network. The methodology is validated on the standard IEEE 33-bus RDN to determine the optimal locations and sizes of DG units. The results demonstrate that the optimal allocation of one, two, and three DG units, achieved from proposed method, reduces network active power losses by 50.37%, 58.62%, and 65.16%, respectively, and also significantly enhances the voltage profile across all buses. When the obtained results are compared with the results of several existing studies, it is found that the proposed method allows for larger DG capacities and maintains better voltage profiles throughout the RDN.</description>

      <title>A Koopman-Bayesian Framework for High-Fidelity, Perceptually Optimized Haptic Surgical Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified framework that combines nonlinear dynamics, perceptual psychophysics and high frequency haptic rendering to enhance realism in surgical simulation. The interaction of the surgical device with soft tissue is elevated to an augmented state space with a Koopman operator formulation, allowing linear prediction and control of the dynamics that are nonlinear by nature. To make the rendered forces consistent with human perceptual limits, we put forward a Bayesian calibration module based on WeberFechner and Stevens scaling laws, which progressively shape force signals relative to each individual's discrimination thresholds. For various simulated surgical tasks such as palpation, incision, and bone milling, the proposed system attains an average rendering latency of 4.3 ms, a force error of less than 2.8% and a 20% improvement in perceptual discrimination. Multivariate statistical analyses (MANOVA and regression) reveal that the system's performance is significantly better than that of conventional spring-damper and energy, based rendering methods. We end by discussing the potential impact on surgical training and VR, based medical education, as well as sketching future work toward closed, loop neural feedback in haptic interfaces.</description>

      <title>ScenicRules: An Autonomous Driving Benchmark with Multi-Objective Specifications and Abstract Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing autonomous driving systems for complex traffic environments requires balancing multiple objectives, such as avoiding collisions, obeying traffic rules, and making efficient progress. In many situations, these objectives cannot be satisfied simultaneously, and explicit priority relations naturally arise. Also, driving rules require context, so it is important to formally model the environment scenarios within which such rules apply. Existing benchmarks for evaluating autonomous vehicles lack such combinations of multi-objective prioritized rules and formal environment models. In this work, we introduce ScenicRules, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous driving systems in stochastic environments under prioritized multi-objective specifications. We first formalize a diverse set of objectives to serve as quantitative evaluation metrics. Next, we design a Hierarchical Rulebook framework that encodes multiple objectives and their priority relations in an interpretable and adaptable manner. We then construct a compact yet representative collection of scenarios spanning diverse driving contexts and near-accident situations, formally modeled in the Scenic language. Experimental results show that our formalized objectives and Hierarchical Rulebooks align well with human driving judgments and that our benchmark effectively exposes agent failures with respect to the prioritized objectives. Our benchmark can be accessed at https://github.com/BerkeleyLearnVerify/ScenicRules/.</description>

      <title>Reactive Slip Control in Multifingered Grasping: Hybrid Tactile Sensing and Internal-Force Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a hybrid learning and model-based approach that adapts internal grasp forces to halt in-hand slip on a multifingered robotic gripper. A multimodal tactile stack combines piezoelectric (PzE) sensing for fast slip cues with piezoresistive (PzR) arrays for contact localization, enabling online construction of the grasp matrix. Upon slip, we update internal forces computed in the null space of the grasp via a quadratic program that preserves the object wrench while enforcing actuation limits. The pipeline yields a theoretical sensing-to-command latency of 35-40 ms, with 5 ms for PzR-based contact and geometry updates and about 4 ms for the quadratic program solve. In controlled trials, slip onset is detected at 20ms. We demonstrate closed-loop stabilization on multifingered grasps under external perturbations. Augmenting efficient analytic force control with learned tactile cues yields both robustness and rapid reactions, as confirmed in our end-to-end evaluation. Measured delays are dominated by the experimental data path rather than actual computation. The analysis outlines a clear route to sub-50 ms closed-loop stabilization.</description>

Abstract: Robots executing iterative tasks in complex, uncertain environments require control strategies that balance robustness, safety, and high performance. This paper introduces a safe information-theoretic learning model predictive control (SIT-LMPC) algorithm for iterative tasks. Specifically, we design an iterative control framework based on an information-theoretic model predictive control algorithm to address a constrained infinite-horizon optimal control problem for discrete-time nonlinear stochastic systems. An adaptive penalty method is developed to ensure safety while balancing optimality. Trajectories from previous iterations are utilized to learn a value function using normalizing flows, which enables richer uncertainty modeling compared to Gaussian priors. SIT-LMPC is designed for highly parallel execution on graphics processing units, allowing efficient real-time optimization. Benchmark simulations and hardware experiments demonstrate that SIT-LMPC iteratively improves system performance while robustly satisfying system constraints.</description>

      <title>Nonplanar Model Predictive Control for Autonomous Vehicles with Recursive Sparse Gaussian Process Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a nonplanar model predictive control (MPC) framework for autonomous vehicles operating on nonplanar terrain. To approximate complex vehicle dynamics in such environments, we develop a geometry-aware modeling approach that learns a residual Gaussian Process (GP). By utilizing a recursive sparse GP, the framework enables real-time adaptation to varying terrain geometry. The effectiveness of the learned model is demonstrated in a reference-tracking task using a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller. Validation within a custom Isaac Sim environment confirms the framework's capability to maintain high tracking accuracy on challenging 3D surfaces.</description>

      <title>How Reliable is Your Service at the Extreme Edge? Analytical Modeling of Computational Reliability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme Edge Computing (XEC) distributes streaming workloads across consumer-owned devices, exploiting their proximity to users and ubiquitous availability. Many such workloads are AI-driven, requiring continuous neural network inference for tasks like object detection and video analytics. Distributed Inference (DI), which partitions model execution across multiple edge devices, enables these streaming services to meet strict throughput and latency requirements. Yet consumer devices exhibit volatile computational availability due to competing applications and unpredictable usage patterns. This volatility poses a fundamental challenge: how can we quantify the probability that a device, or ensemble of devices, will maintain the processing rate required by a streaming service? This paper presents an analytical framework for computational reliability in XEC, defined as the probability that instantaneous capacity meets demand at a specified Quality of Service (QoS) threshold. We derive closed-form reliability expressions under two information regimes: Minimal Information (MI), requiring only declared operational bounds, and historical data, which refines estimates via Maximum Likelihood Estimation from past observations. The framework extends to multi-device deployments, providing reliability expressions for series, parallel, and partitioned workload configurations. We derive optimal workload allocation rules and analytical bounds for device selection, equipping orchestrators with tractable tools to evaluate deployment feasibility and configure distributed streaming systems. We validate the framework using real-time object detection with YOLO11m model as a representative DI streaming workload; experiments on emulated XED environments demonstrate close agreement between analytical predictions, Monte Carlo sampling, and empirical measurements across diverse capacity and demand configurations.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Kernel Regression for Coordinated Energy Storage Peak Shaving with Stacked Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing effective control strategies for behind-the-meter energy storage to coordinate peak shaving and stacked services is essential for reducing electricity costs and extending battery lifetime in commercial buildings. This work proposes an end-to-end, two-stage framework for coordinating peak shaving and energy arbitrage with a theoretical decomposition guarantee. In the first stage, a non-parametric kernel regression model constructs state-of-charge trajectory bounds from historical data that satisfy peak-shaving requirements. The second stage utilizes the remaining capacity for energy arbitrage via a transfer learning method. Case studies using New York City commercial building demand data show that our method achieves a 1.3 times improvement in performance over the state-of-the-art forecast-based method, achieving cost savings and effective peak management without relying on predictions.</description>

      <title>Consensus Based Task Allocation for Angles-Only Local Catalog Maintenance of Satellite Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order for close proximity satellites to safely perform their missions, the relative states of all satellites and pieces of debris must be well understood. This presents a problem for ground based tracking and orbit determination since it may not be practical to achieve the required accuracy. Using space-based sensors allows for more accurate relative state estimates, especially if multiple satellites are allowed to communicate. Of interest to this work is the case where several communicating satellites each need to maintain a local catalog of communicating and non-communicating objects using angles-only limited field of view (FOV) measurements. However, this introduces the problem of efficiently scheduling and coordinating observations among the agents. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation algorithm to address this problem and quantifies its performance in terms of fuel usage and overall catalog uncertainty via numerical simulation. It was found that the new method significantly outperforms the uncertainty-fuel Pareto frontier formed by current approaches.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Flexibility Aggregation of DERs for Ancillary Services Provision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a grid-aware probabilistic approach to compute the aggregated flexibility at the grid connection point (GCP) of active distribution networks (ADNs) to allow the participation of DERs in ancillary services (AS) markets. Specifically an optimal power flow (OPF) method using a linear network model is used to compute the aggregated capability for the provision of multiple AS. We start from the method proposed in [1] and extend it to allow for optimizing the provision of multiple services simultaneously, ensure cost-effectiveness of the used DERs and handle uncertainties in a probabilistic way. The allocation of individual DERs power flexibilities accounts for the operational costs associated to the provision of different services and ensures cost-effectiveness while maximizing the value of the advertised aggregated flexibility, assuming known service prices. Empirical uncertainty sets are obtained to achieve a predefined coverage of the probability distribution in line with recent developments in the Nordic AS markets. Finally, a feeder-decomposition approach is proposed to ensure the methods applicability to realistic distribution networks with a large number of buses. Different case studies show the effectiveness of the method, highlight the importance of accounting for network constraints and illustrate its applicability to realistic distribution systems.</description>

      <title>Spiking control systems for soft robotics: a rhythmic case study in a soft robotic crawler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by spiking neural feedback, we propose a spiking controller for efficient locomotion in a soft robotic crawler. Its bistability, akin to neural fast positive feedback, combined with a sensorimotor slow negative feedback loop, generates rhythmic spiking. The closed-loop system is robust through the quantized actuation, and negative feedback ensures efficient locomotion with minimal external tuning. Using bifurcation analysis, we characterize how the sensorimotor gain-coupling body and controller dynamics-governs the emergence of qualitatively distinct dynamical regimes, including resting and crawling behaviors associated with peristaltic waves. Dimensional analysis formalizes a separation of mechanical and electrical timescales, and Geometric Singular Perturbation theory explains the geometry of the relaxation oscillations leading to endogenous crawling. Within this singularly perturbed framework, we further formulate and analytically solve an optimization problem, proving that locomotion speed is maximized when mechanical resonance is achieved via a matching of neuromechanical scales. Given the importance and ubiquity of rhythms and waves in soft-bodied locomotion, we envision that spiking control systems could be utilized in a variety of soft-robotic morphologies and modular distributed architectures, yielding significant robustness, adaptability, and energetic gains across scales.</description>

      <title>Extended Version: Characterizing Distributed Photovoltaic Panel Investment Equilibria</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates long-term investment decisions in distributed photovoltaic panels by individual investors. We consider a setting where investment decisions are driven by expected revenue from participating in short-term electricity markets over the panel lifespan. These revenues depend on short-term market equilibria, i.e., prices and allocations, which are influenced by aggregate invested panel capacity participating in the markets. We model the interactions among investors by a non-atomic game and develop a framework that links short-term market equilibria to the resulting long-term investment equilibrium. Then, within this framework, we analyze three market mechanisms: (a) a single-product real-time energy market, (b) a product-differentiated real-time energy market that treats solar energy and grid energy as different products, and (c) a contract-based panel market that trades claims/rights to the production of certain panel capacity ex-ante, rather than the realized solar production ex-post. For each, we derive expressions for short-term equilibria and the associated expected revenues, and analytically characterize the corresponding long-term Nash equilibrium aggregate capacity. We compare the solutions of these characterizing equations under different conditions and theoretically establish that the product-differentiated market always supports socially optimal investment, while the single-product market consistently results in under-investment. We also establish that the contract-based market leads to over-investment when the extra valuations of users for solar energy are small. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Strategic Data Center Load Shifting: Implications for Market Efficiency and Transmission Value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data center electricity use may reach 12% of U.S. demand by 2030, alongside growing ability to shift workloads geographically in response to prices or carbon signals. We examine the system-level implications of such strategic flexibility using a bilevel two-zone model that couples economic dispatch with consumer cost minimization. Two market failures emerge. First, discontinuous price changes at generator capacity limits can induce flexible consumers to shift load in socially inefficient directions; for example, toward a higher-cost region to trigger a price drop elsewhere. Second, by positioning near capacity boundaries, consumers can counteract the marginal benefit of transmission expansion: although shadow prices suggest additional capacity is valuable, strategic consumers reoptimize to offset resulting flow changes, leaving dispatch and costs unchanged. We derive conditions under which these effects arise and show that conventional price signals can misrepresent system value in the presence of large spatially flexible loads.</description>

      <title>Reliability entails input-selective contraction and regulation in excitable networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The animal nervous system offers a model of computation combining digital reliability and analog efficiency. Understanding how this sweet spot can be realized is a core question of neuromorphic engineering. To this aim, this paper explores the connection between reliability, contraction, and regulation in excitable systems. Using the FitzHugh-Nagumo model of excitable behavior as a proof-of-concept, it is shown that neuronal reliability can be formalized as an average trajectory contraction property induced by the input. In excitable networks, reliability is shown to enable regulation of the network to a robustly stable steady state. It is thus posited that regulation provides a notion of dynamical analog computation, and that stability makes such a computation model robust.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized air traffic management requires coordination among self-interested stakeholders operating under shared safety and capacity constraints, where conventional centralized or implicitly cooperative models do not adequately capture this setting. We develop a unified perspective on noncooperative coordination, in which system-level outcomes emerge by designing incentives and assigning signals that reshape individual optimality rather than imposing cooperation or enforcement. We advance this framework along three directions: scalable equilibrium engineering via reduced-rank and uncertainty-aware correlated equilibria, decentralized mechanism design for equilibrium selection without enforcement, and structured noncooperative dynamics with convergence guarantees. Beyond these technical contributions, we discuss core design principles that govern incentive-compatible coordination in decentralized systems. Together, these results establish a foundation for scalable, robust coordination in safety-critical air traffic systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control and Neural Porkchop Analysis for Low-Thrust Asteroid Rendezvous Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of the applicability and accuracy of optimal control methods and neural network-based estimators in the context of porkchop plots for preliminary asteroid rendezvous mission design. The scenario considered involves a deep-space CubeSat equipped with a low-thrust engine, departing from Earth and rendezvousing with a near-Earth asteroid within a three-year launch window. A low-thrust trajectory optimization model is formulated, incorporating variable specific impulse, maximum thrust, and path constraints. The optimal control problem is efficiently solved using Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) combined with a solution continuation strategy. The neural network framework consists of two models: one predicts the minimum fuel consumption ($\Delta v$), while the other estimates the minimum flight time ($\Delta t$) which is used to assess transfer feasibility. Case results demonstrate that, in simplified scenarios without path constraints, the neural network approach achieves low relative errors across most of the design space and successfully captures the main structural features of the porkchop plots. In cases where the SCP-based continuation method fails due to the presence of multiple local optima, the neural network still provides smooth and globally consistent predictions, significantly improving the efficiency of early-stage asteroid candidate screening. However, the deformation of the feasible region caused by path constraints leads to noticeable discrepancies in certain boundary regions, thereby limiting the applicability of the network in detailed mission design phases. Overall, the integration of neural networks with porkchop plot analysis offers an effective decision-making tool for mission designers and planetary scientists, with significant potential for engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach to QoSAware Load Balancing in 5G Cellular Networks under User Mobility and Observation Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient mobility management and load balancing are critical to sustaining Quality of Service (QoS) in dense, highly dynamic 5G radio access networks. We present a deep reinforcement learning framework based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for autonomous, QoS-aware load balancing implemented end-to-end in a lightweight, pure-Python simulation environment. The control problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process in which the agent periodically adjusts Cell Individual Offset (CIO) values to steer user-cell associations. A multi-objective reward captures key performance indicators (aggregate throughput, latency, jitter, packet loss rate, Jain's fairness index, and handover count), so the learned policy explicitly balances efficiency and stability under user mobility and noisy observations. The PPO agent uses an actor-critic neural network trained from trajectories generated by the Python simulator with configurable mobility (e.g., Gauss-Markov) and stochastic measurement noise. Across 500+ training episodes and stress tests with increasing user density, the PPO policy consistently improves KPI trends (higher throughput and fairness, lower delay, jitter, packet loss, and handovers) and exhibits rapid, stable convergence. Comparative evaluations show that PPO outperforms rule-based ReBuHa and A3 as well as the learning-based CDQL baseline across all KPIs while maintaining smoother learning dynamics and stronger generalization as load increases. These results indicate that PPO's clipped policy updates and advantage-based training yield robust, deployable control for next-generation RAN load balancing using an entirely Python-based toolchain.</description>

      <title>KANEL\'E: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Efficient LUT-based Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-latency, resource-efficient neural network inference on FPGAs is essential for applications demanding real-time capability and low power. Lookup table (LUT)-based neural networks are a common solution, combining strong representational power with efficient FPGA implementation. In this work, we introduce KANEL\'E, a framework that exploits the unique properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for FPGA deployment. Unlike traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), KANs employ learnable one-dimensional splines with fixed domains as edge activations, a structure naturally suited to discretization and efficient LUT mapping. We present the first systematic design flow for implementing KANs on FPGAs, co-optimizing training with quantization and pruning to enable compact, high-throughput, and low-latency KAN architectures. Our results demonstrate up to a 2700x speedup and orders of magnitude resource savings compared to prior KAN-on-FPGA approaches. Moreover, KANEL\'E matches or surpasses other LUT-based architectures on widely used benchmarks, particularly for tasks involving symbolic or physical formulas, while balancing resource usage across FPGA hardware. Finally, we showcase the versatility of the framework by extending it to real-time, power-efficient control systems.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Functions can Exactly Quantify Rate Performance of Nonlinear Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pointwise-in-time stability notions for Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) provide quantitative metrics for system performance by establishing bounds on the rate of decay of the system state in terms of initial condition -- allowing stability to be quantified by e.g. the maximum provable decay rate. Such bounds may be obtained by finding suitable Lyapunov functions using, e.g. Sum-of-Squares (SOS) optimization. While Lyapunov tests have been proposed for numerous pointwise-in-time stability notions, including exponential, rational, and finite-time stability, it is unclear whether these characterizations are able to provide accurate bounds on system performance.
  In this paper, we start by proposing a generalized notion of rate performance -- with exponential, rational, and finite-time decay rates being special cases. Then, for any such notion and rate, we associate a Lyapunov condition which is shown to be necessary and sufficient for a system to achieve that rate. Finally, we show how the proposed conditions can be enforced using SOS programming in the case of exponential, rational, and finite-time stability. Numerical examples in each case demonstrate that the corresponding SOS test can achieve tight bounds on the rate performance with accurate inner bounds on the associated regions of performance.</description>

Abstract: The long-standing vision of general-purpose robots hinges on their ability to understand and act upon natural language instructions. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the "intention-action gap." We first characterize the test-time scaling laws for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce CoVer-VLA, a hierarchical test-time verification pipeline using the trained verifier. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses the verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On the PolaRiS benchmark, CoVer-VLA achieves 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate.</description>
