      <title>Testing the heavy decaying sterile neutrino hypothesis at the DUNE near detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most convincing explanations of the LSND and MiniBooNE anomalies relies on a heavy, mostly sterile neutrino with a small muon neutrino component, which decays to an electron neutrino and an invisible light scalar field. We investigate the possibility to test this hypothesis at the near detector complex of the upcoming DUNE experiment. We find that the DUNE liquid argon near detector (ND-LAr) can probe a larger region of the parameter space than the Fermilab SBN program, and may help to confirm or reject a possible hint of $\nu_e$ appearance in future MicroBooNE, SBND or ICARUS data. We also argue that it may be possible to distinguish between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos if this scenario is realized in Nature.</description>

      <title>Constraining light dark matter in vector-scalar portals with COSI and AMEGO-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting gamma-ray signals that could be due to dark matter (DM) particles would give us invaluable information about the nature of DM. In particular, gamma-ray lines could provide a way to measure the DM mass. The excellent energy resolution of the upcoming Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) will allow us to probe underexplored regions of the DM parameter space while being sensitive to distinctive spectral features of potential DM signals. In this work, we consider a fermionic sub-GeV DM charged under a new U(1) gauge symmetry. Both the DM and the new gauge boson $Z'$ acquire mass from a new singlet scalar. The masses of the new particles in this class of vector-scalar portal models are naturally at the MeV scale, enabling detectable gamma-ray lines in the bandpasses of COSI and proposed missions such as the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory eXplorer (AMEGO-X). We estimate the sensitivity of COSI and AMEGO-X to sub-GeV DM in this context, considering a B-L and a purely axial $Z'$ as benchmark examples. We find regions of the parameter space where COSI will provide leading constraints, beyond the strong CMB limits. On the other hand, AMEGO-X would probe most of the viable parameter space leading to continuum gamma rays.</description>

      <title>Probing $0\nu\beta\beta$ and $\mu\to e\gamma$ via Fully Determined Dirac Mass Terms in LRSM with Double Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) and charged lepton flavor violation (cLFV) experiments provide promising avenues to probe new physics contributions from extended neutrino sectors in beyond Standard Model (BSM) scenarios. We consider a Left--Right Symmetric Model (LRSM) extended with three generations of sterile neutrinos to realize a double type-I seesaw mechanism for light neutrino mass generation. The double seesaw induces maximal lepton number violation in the right-handed sector and facilitates enhanced Majorana masses for right-handed neutrinos, thereby leading to their dominant contributions in both cLFV and $0\nu\beta\beta$ processes. We perform a comprehensive exploration of the parameter space for new-physics contributions to the cLFV decay $\mu \to e \gamma$ and to $0\nu\beta\beta$, considering two different textures for the Dirac mass matrices: one proportional to the identity matrix and another fully determined by the model framework. A detailed analysis of the common parameter regions accessible to current experiments like KamLAND-Zen and LEGEND-200, and upcoming experiments, such as MEG-II and LEGEND-1000, is presented, underscoring the phenomenological relevance of this framework. Our results aim to provide optimistic benchmarks for future searches targeting right-handed current-mediated neutrino interactions.</description>

      <title>Electroweak symmetry non-restoration and suppressed dark radiation in Supersymmetric Twin Higgs model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a possibility of electroweak symmetry non-restoration (SNR) below the Twin electroweak scale ($\sim$TeV) within the Twin Higgs model. We focus on supersymmetric extensions with light sfermions where SNR is driven by mirror symmetry breaking in the Yukawa couplings. The inclusion of light scalars not only stabilizes the electroweak scale, but also extends SNR into new regions of the parameter space and enables a first-order phase transition. When this model is augmented with right-handed neutrinos with unbroken $B'-L'$ in the twin sector, the number of dark relativistic degrees of freedom can be reduced to the level consistent with the constraints from CMB data. The SNR in the supersymmetric Twin Higgs framework can naturally be integrated with minimal axiogenesis, offering a simultaneous explanation for the origin of baryon asymmetry and dark matter and the resolution of the strong CP problem that is consistent with astrophysical constraints.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves and Cosmological Observables from First-Order Phase Transitions: Thermal Corrections at Low Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the impact on cosmological first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) of low-temperature thermal corrections to the effective potential. These are corrections from degrees of freedom whose field-dependent masses are much smaller than the nucleation temperature in the true vacuum, though they may be much larger than the nucleation temperature in the false vacuum. Although the general form of these corrections to the thermal effective potential can be quite complicated, we argue that the net effect of all such corrections can be well-modeled with a single new parameter. We determine the shift in the parameters of the FOPT in terms of this new parameter, and the impact on gravitational wave signals and cosmological observables.</description>

      <title>Angular phase-space integrals with four denominators through Mellin--Barnes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute four-denominator angular phase-space integrals using the Mellin--Barnes (MB) technique in dimensional regularisation. Independent of the scattering process, an angular integral can be categorised based on the nature of the momenta appearing in the denominators. We address all scenarios involving fully massless and massive momenta. We present a partial fraction decomposition that relates angular integrals with multiple massive momenta to those with a single massive momentum. By solving six- and seven-fold MB integrals, we express the final results up to the finite order in the dimensional regulator in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms.</description>

      <title>Transport Properties of QGP within a Bayesian Holographic QCD Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a holographic QCD model augmented by Bayesian inference, we calculate key transport coefficients of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP)$\text{-}$including the drag force, jet quenching parameter, heavy quark diffusion coefficient, and shear and bulk viscosities$\text{-}$at finite temperature and chemical potential. Posterior parameter distributions at the 68\% and 95\% confidence levels (CL), as well as the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates, are employed to quantify uncertainties. Our findings indicate that the diffusion coefficient within the Bayesian credible regions aligns with lattice QCD results for $T \sim 1.2T_c$ to $2T_c$, and is consistent with ALICE experimental measurements near $T_c$. The jet quenching parameter obtained from the Bayesian analysis agrees with RHIC and LHC data, while viscosity coefficients show compatibility with existing literature. These results demonstrate the efficacy of a Bayesian holographic approach in elucidating the nonperturbative transport properties of QCD matter.</description>

      <title>A natural realization of inverse seesaw model in a non-invertible selection rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose natural hierarchies among neutral fermions in a framework of inverse seesaw, imposing a $Z_3$ Tambara-Yamagami fusion rule which is applied to our phenomenology. Under the symmetry, the Majorana mass terms for $N_R$ and $N_L$ are forbidden at tree level. However they are generated at one-loop level where the symmetry is dynamically broken. In order to realize such loop corrections, we introduce neutral boson and fermion either of which can be an appropriate dark matter candidate. Finally, we show the best fit value of the neutrino sector for normal and inverted hierarchies referring recent experimental results.</description>

      <title>Topological Stabilization via Higgs and $Z$-Boson Repulsions in Electroweak Monopole-Antimonopole Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate dual repulsive mechanisms stabilizing Cho-Maison monopole-antimonopole pairs (MAPs) through stress-energy tensor analysis. Higgs-mediated repulsion exhibits non-monotonic dependence on topological charge and Higgs self-coupling, confirming its topological origin while revealing a mass-controlled range transition beyond Yukawa suppression. Simultaneously, $Z$-boson field generates localized repulsive cores of radius $R_c\approx 0.8$ $m_W^{-1}$, which aligns with weak interaction scales. Neutral charge distribution confirms $Z$-boson exchange as the physical mechanism. These competing effects -- operating at topological and electroweak scales -- establish a stabilization mechanism for Cho-Maison MAPs that extends to other topological solitons in the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Analysis of $B\to KM_X$ and $B\to K^* M_X$ decays in scalar- and vector-mediator dark-matter scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surprising excess of missing-energy events far beyond all standard-model expectations in the weak decays of the charged ground-state $B^+$ meson into some charged strange meson, rather recently observed by the Belle-II experiment, may (easily) be explained by the decay of the $B$ meson into the strange meson and a pair of dark-matter fermion and antifermion, mediated by an (intermediate) scalar or vector boson. Thorough inspections of both the total and the differential widths of these decays provide, among others, a simple means for the (straightforward) discrimination of such mediator boson's scalar or vector nature.</description>

      <title>Renormalization Group Running of the Minimal Leptophilic Dark Matter Model toward UV Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study renormalization group running of the coupling constants in a minimal leptophilic dark matter model in which a Standard Model singlet fermion, acting as the DM candidate, couples exclusively to right-handed charged leptons via a new charged scalar mediator. Reproduction of the observed thermal relic abundance of the DM candidate requires sizable Yukawa couplings, and such sizable Yukawa couplings can significantly affect the renormalization group evolution of the model parameters. We examine the conditions that the model remains perturbative and the vacuum stability is maintained up to high energy scales. We find that the parameter space is severely constrained to ensure the perturbativity and the vacuum stability up to the Planck scale. In particular, the masses of the dark matter and the charged scalar mediator should be smaller than about 350 GeV and can be tested by future collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Dynamics in D-meson Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical predictions for the $D^0\overline{D^0}$ mixing parameters fall significantly short of experimental measurements, with discrepancies spanning several orders of magnitude. This gap is mainly due to the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism, which suppresses leading-order contributions by high powers of $m_s/m_c$. However, higher-order corrections and nonperturbative effects could reduce this suppression, especially through flavor $SU(3)_F$ symmetry breaking. In this work, we investigate the long-distance contributions from QCD condensates, including, for the first time, the effects of mixed quark-gluon and four-quark condensates. Our results show an increase in the predicted values of $D^0\overline{D^0}$ mixing parameters by two orders of magnitude compared to perturbative NLO result, providing valuable insights into nonperturbative QCD dynamics. Although the theoretical estimates still fall below experimental values, this study represents an important step toward narrowing the gap between theory and observation, highlighting the significance of higher-order $1/m_c$ QCD effects in understanding $D^0\overline{D^0}$ mixing.</description>

      <title>Probing the Scotogenic Dirac Model with FIMP Dark Matter and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a feebly interacting massive particle realization of the Scotogenic Dirac Model in which the lightest neutral fermion $N_1$ serves as a dark matter candidate, produced via the freeze-in or super-WIMP mechanism. The model generates Dirac neutrino masses at one loop, resulting in a rank-2 mass matrix that predicts one nearly massless neutrino. We analyze the DM relic density for various next-to-lightest odd particles (NLOPs), finding that coannihilation effects and enhanced annihilation channels are crucial for achieving the correct thermal freeze-out abundance of the NLOP. We provide a detailed analysis of the model's implications for the effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{\mathrm{eff}}$, which receives contributions from both a thermal bath of right-handed neutrinos and non-thermal energy injection due to late NLOP decays. Through an extensive parameter scan, we identify viable parameter space for all NLOP candidates that satisfies constraints from DM relic density, lepton flavor violation, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, Cosmic Microwave Background, and $\Delta N_{\mathrm{eff}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on available experimental results on $\chi _{cJ}(J=0,1,2)$ decays, we investigate the $\chi_{cJ}\to PP$, $VV$, $PV$, and $PT$ decays by using SU(3) flavor symmetry/breaking approach, where $P$, $V$, and $T$ denote light pseudoscalar, vector, and tensor mesons, respectively. With the decay amplitude relations determined by SU(3) flavor symmetry/breaking, we present the branching ratios for all $\chi_{cJ}\to PP$ and $\chi_{cJ}\to VV$ modes, including ones without experimental data. While theoretical considerations strongly suppress or even forbid most $\chi_{cJ}\to PV$ and $PT$ decays, we also provide quantitative predictions constrained by existing experimental data. Our results are expected to be accessible in future experiments at BESIII and the planned Super Tau-Charm Facility.</description>

      <title>Probing scalar non-standard interaction of supernova neutrinos in next-generation neutrino experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new neutrino-matter interaction can potentially affect neutrino propagation through matter. In this work, we explore the impact of a flavor-conserving scalar-mediated non-standard neutrino interaction in the supernova neutrino flux. We observe that the presence of scalar interaction involving muon and tau neutrinos (parameterized as $\eta_{\mu\mu}$ and $\eta_{\tau\tau}$, respectively) can invert the neutrino mass eigenstate in which three neutrino flavor states are produced inside the Supernova core, resulting in a significant modification of the electron neutrino flux from supernova reaching the Earth. In the context of the DUNE experiment, we estimate the number of supernova neutrino events in the presence of scalar non-standard neutrino interaction $\eta_{\mu\mu}$ or $\eta_{\tau\tau}$ and contrast with the case without scalar-mediated non-standard interactions. Our results indicate that such scalar interactions introduce a new degeneracy in the measurement of neutrino mass ordering from supernova neutrinos. We show how the $\bar{\nu}_e$ event distribution in Hyper-Kamiokande experiment can help resolve the degeneracy between a model with new scalar interactions for normal ordered neutrino masses and the standard model with inverted mass ordering.</description>

      <title>Scalar non-standard neutrino interactions in Galactic supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the prospects for studying scalar non-standard interactions (SNSI) using the neutrino burst from a Galactic supernova. SNSI modify the resonant flavor conversion and, correspondingly, the neutronization burst signal, and may be identifiable in future multi-tonne-scale experiments such as DUNE. We show that, in the presence of SNSI, neutrinos propagating out of the dense supernova environment acquire a density-squared-dependent contribution to their mass-squared differences, which in turn modifies the energy levels of the neutrino mass eigenstates. This phenomenon is not present in less dense environments like the Earth or the Sun. For a given mass ordering, supernova neutrinos can improve the sensitivity to SNSI parameters by up to four orders of magnitude compared to that achievable with solar or terrestrial neutrino sources.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein Condensates in Astrophysics and Cosmology: From Quantum Statistics to Cosmic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and their manifestations in astrophysical and cosmological contexts. Building upon the foundations of quantum statistics in curved spacetime, we derive the conditions for BEC formation under extreme gravitational fields and explore their implications for compact objects and early universe physics. Through rigorous mathematical treatment incorporating general relativistic corrections to the Bose-Einstein distribution, we demonstrate that BEC phenomena may play crucial roles in neutron star interiors, primordial black hole formation, and dark matter halos. Our analysis reveals that the critical temperature for condensation exhibits non-trivial dependence on spacetime curvature, with corrections of order O(GM/rc2) becoming significant near compact objects. We further show that axion dark matter, if it exists, naturally forms a cosmic BEC with coherence length {\lambda}dB ~ 10^-3 pc for ma ~ 10^-22 eV, potentially explaining the observed core-cusp problem in galactic dark matter profiles. These findings suggest that quantum coherence effects at macroscopic scales may be more prevalent in the universe than previously recognized, with profound implications for our understanding of cosmic structure formation and the behaviour of matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Inference for Direction Reconstruction of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays with Radio Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray (UHECR) observatories require unbiased direction reconstruction to enable multi-messenger astronomy with sparse, nanosecond-scale radio pulses. Explicit likelihood methods often rely on simplified models, which may bias results and understate uncertainties. We introduce a simulation-based inference pipeline that couples a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) to a normalizing-flow posterior within the \textit{Learning the Universe Implicit Likelihood Inference} framework. Each event is seeded by an analytic plane-wavefront fit; the GNN refines this estimate by learning spatiotemporal correlations among antenna signals, and its frozen embedding conditions an eight-block autoregressive flow that returns the full Bayesian posterior. Trained on about $8,000$ realistic UHECR air-shower simulations generated with the ZHAireS code, the posteriors are temperature-calibrated to meet empirical coverage targets. We demonstrate a sub-degree median angular resolution on test UHECR events, and find that the nominal 68\% highest-posterior-density contours capture $71\% \pm 2\%$ of true arrival directions, indicating a mildly conservative uncertainty calibration. This approach provides physically interpretable reconstructions, well-calibrated uncertainties, and rapid inference, making it ideally suited for upcoming experiments targeting highly inclined events, such as GRAND, AugerPrime Radio, IceCube-Gen2, RNO-G, and BEACON.</description>

      <title>Causality and Stability in Relativistic Hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The causality and stability of a relativistic hydrodynamic theory is shown to require a consensus between, either (i) newer degrees of freedom apart from the fundamental fluid fields, or (ii) a general hydrodynamic frame other than the Landau or Eckart compromising the field's first principle definition, unless the non-equilibrium derivative correction goes to infinity. Any finitely truncated derivative correction (no matter how high it is) is shown to lead to an acausal theory, unless the corrections are infinitely summed up to include all orders. From an underlying microscopic theory, an exact form of relativistic hydrodynamics has been derived which establishes that the resummation of all order temporal derivatives is essential for causality, which finally 'integrated in' as newer degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Transport coefficients of hot and dense matter in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transport coefficients are known as the measure of system interactions, as well as the dynamical input of the hydrodynamic evolution equations of an expanding system created in the relativistic heavy ion collisions. In the current analysis, they have been evaluated for strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma system as well as hot hadronic media. The medium effects for an interacting QCD system have been introduced through a quasiparticle model. The same for a hadronic system has been captured via the in-medium self-energy correction using thermal field theory. The resulting behavior of the transport coefficients shows significant modification with respect to the estimations made in vacuum or using ideal equation of state.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints on Neutrino Masses in a Second-Order CPL Dark Energy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent DESI results indicate a strong preference for dynamical dark energy (DE) when baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements are combined with supernovae (SNe) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data using the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization. We analyze the exponential (EXP) parameterization, which introduces a second-order correction to CPL. We determine and compare the 95% upper bounds on the sum of neutrino masses for three dark energy (DE) models -- $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and EXP -- across four neutrino mass hierarchies (1 massive/2 massless, degenerate, normal, inverted) and multiple dataset combinations (CMB$+$BAO, CMB$+$BAO$+$PantheonPlus, CMB$+$BAO$+$DESY5), employing both Bayesian and frequentist frameworks with physical lower limits from oscillation experiments (0.059 eV and 0.11 eV). Our results show that CPL yields tighter ($\lesssim10$%) bounds compared to EXP. We further confirm earlier findings that neutrino mass constraints are only mildly sensitive to the assumed hierarchy and that the frequentist bounds are tighter than Bayesian ones. Furthermore, the imposed oscillation lower limits, the datasets used and the cosmological model play a crucial role in the inferred cosmological neutrino mass bounds. For the datasets, hierarchies, and DE parameterizations considered, we find no statistically significant evidence for nonzero neutrino mass consistent with oscillation lower limits.</description>

Abstract: The interplay of relativistic fluid dynamics and spacetime geometry is discussed in the regime of small wave numbers and frequencies. A combination of gravitational Ward identities and fluid dynamic equations of motion in the Mueller-Israel-Stewart formulation is used to explicitly determine the retarded linear response of the energy-momentum tensor to metric perturbations. We also discuss applications to gravitational wave production and the damping of gravitational waves in a relativistic fluid.</description>

Abstract: We present a formulation of lepton family numbers, based on quantum field theory, for neutrino oscillation phenomenology that can be applied to nonrelativistic and relativistic energies for neutrinos. It is formulated for both types of neutrinos, Dirac and Majorana. The formulation is constructed as the time evolution of a lepton family number density operator. Then, the time evolution of the lepton family number density operator becomes dependent on the mass and new features appear. The expectation value of the density operator is evaluated for the initial state with a Gaussian distribution for the momentum amplitude. This enables us to study wave packet-like decoherence effects. We show in the nonrelativistic regime, the type of neutrino mass are distinguishable even under the presence of wave packet-like decoherence effects.</description>

      <title>Searching for hadronic scale baryonic and dark forces at $(g-2)_\mu$'s lattice-vs-dispersion front</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ($\,a_{\mu}\,$) provides a stringent test of the quantum nature of the Standard Model (SM) and its extensions. To probe beyond the SM physics, one needs to be able to subtract the SM contributions, which consists of a non-perturbative part, namely, the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) of the photon. The state of the art is to predominantly use two different methods to extract this HVP: lattice computation, and dispersion relation-based, data-driven method. Thus one can construct different forms of the ``$a_{\mu}$ test" which compares the precise measurement of $a_{\mu}$ to its theory prediction. Additionally, this opens the possibility for another subtle test, where these two ``theory" predictions themselves are compared against each other, which is denoted as the ``HVP-test". This test is particularly sensitive to hadronic scale new physics. Therefore, in this work, we consider a SM extension consisting of a generic, light $\sim(100~{\rm MeV}-1~{\rm GeV})$ vector boson and study its impact on both tests. We develop a comprehensive formalism for this purpose. We find that in the case of data-driven HVP being used in the $a_{\mu}$ test, the new physics contributions effectively cancels for a flavor-universal vector boson. As an illustration of these general results, we consider two benchmark models: i)~the dark photon ($\,A'\,$) and ii)~a gauge boson coupled to baryon-number ($\,B\,$). Using a combination of these tests, we are able to constrain the parameter space of $B$ and $A'$, complementarily to the existing limits. As a spin-off, our preliminary analysis of the spectrum of invariant mass of $3\pi$ in events with ISR at the $B-$ factories (BaBar, Belle) manifests the value of such a study in searching for $B\to 3\pi$ decay, thus motivating a dedicated search by experimental collaborations.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal short-distance constraints on hadronic light-by-light scattering and tensor meson contributions to the muon $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19293v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short-distance constraints from the operator product expansion in QCD play an important role in the evaluation of the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. While conventional hadronic models involving a finite number of resonances fail to reproduce the correct power laws implied by them, holographic QCD has been shown to naturally incorporate the Melnikov-Vainshtein constraint on the longitudinal amplitude following from the triangle anomaly in the asymmetric limit, where one photon virtuality remains small compared to the others. This is saturated by an infinite tower of axial vector mesons, and their numerical contribution to the muon $g-2$ in AdS/QCD models agrees rather well with a recent dispersive analysis and alternative approaches. However, the longitudinal short-distance constraint where all virtualities are large turns out to be matched only at the level of 81\%. In this Letter we show that tensor mesons, whose contribution to the muon $g-2$ has recently been found to be underestimated, can fill this gap, because in holographic QCD their infinite tower of excited mesons only contributes to the symmetric longitudinal short-distance constraint. Numerically, they give rise to a sizeable positive contribution from the low-energy region below 1.5 GeV, a small one from the mixed region, and a negligible one from the high-energy region, which could explain the remaining gap between the most recent dispersive and lattice results for the complete hadronic light-by-light contribution.</description>

      <title>A model-independent parameterization of $B\rightarrow\pi\pi\ell\nu$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel parameterization of $B\rightarrow\pi\pi\ell\nu$ form factors relying on partial-wave decompositions and series expansions in suitable variables. We bound the expansion coefficients through unitarity and include left-hand cut contributions using established dispersive methods. The two-hadron lineshapes are treated in a model-independent manner using Omn\`es functions, thus allowing for a data-driven determination of the expansion parameters. We study the underlying composition of the di-pion system in $B\rightarrow\pi\pi\ell\nu$ decays through fits to differential spectra of $B^{+} \rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-} \ell^+ \nu$ measured by the Belle experiment. In contrast to previous works, we are able to study the full phase-space and are not limited to certain kinematic regions. As a consequence, we extract branching fractions for the different partial waves of the di-pion system. We find: \begin{align*}
  \mathcal{B}(B^+\rightarrow (\pi^+ \pi^-)_S \ell^+ \nu) &amp;= 2.2^{+1.4}_{-1.0}\times 10^{-5}\,,\\
  \mathcal{B}(B^+\rightarrow (\pi^+ \pi^-)_P \ell^+\nu) &amp;= 19.6^{+2.8}_{-2.7}\times 10^{-5}\,,\\
  \mathcal{B}(B^+\rightarrow (\pi^+ \pi^-)_D \ell^+ \nu) &amp;= 3.5^{+1.3}_{-1.1}\times 10^{-5}\,.\\ \end{align*} In addition, we derive predictions for the thus far unobserved $B^+\rightarrow \pi^0\pi^0\ell^+\nu$ decay and obtain a sizeable branching fraction of $\mathcal{B}(B^+\rightarrow \pi^0\pi^0\ell^+\nu) = 2.9^{+0.9}_{-0.7}\times 10^{-5}$.</description>

Our analysis revealed that this {resonance} can be assigned as the fourth radial excitation within the $0^{+}$ light strange meson family. Furthermore, we predicted additional radial excitations in this meson family and systematically discussed their spectra, decay behaviors, and branching ratios. These results provide critical guidance for future to identify their signatures in experiments.</description>

      <title>Chiral Anomaly Cancellation and Neutral Triple Gauge Boson Vertices in the SM EFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the cancellation of chiral anomalies in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SM EFT), achieved through by a consistent choice of loop momentum routing in triangle diagrams with dimension-6 operator insertions. By enforcing gauge invariance and Bose symmetry, we show that Goldstone boson contributions cancel anomalies arising from massive gauge boson vertices, preserving the consistency of the SM EFT. We compute neutral triple gauge boson vertices at one loop, revealing dominant contributions from dimension-6 operators at all energies below the EFT cutoff. A UV-complete anomaly-free model with a heavy vector-like electron validates our approach, illustrating how heavy fermion decoupling generates SM EFT operators while maintaining anomaly cancellation. Our results highlight the phenomenological relevance of these vertices for probing new physics at colliders, particularly through dimension-6 effects that scale as the inverse of the centre of mass energy squared, 1/s, offering a viable pathway for experimental detection.</description>

Abstract: Transverse single-spin asymmetries in the semi-inclusive deep-inelastic production of isolated photons ($\gamma$SIDIS), $A_{UT}^{\gamma {\rm SIDIS}}$, provide an unprecedented opportunity to extract the quark-gluon-quark correlators $F_{FT}(x,x')$ and $G_{FT}(x,x')$ point-by-point in their full support $x,x'$. We utilize realistic models for these functions, based on input from the Sivers transverse momentum dependent parton distribution function and imposing constraints from the $d_2$ matrix element calculated in lattice QCD, in order to provide numerical estimates for $A_{UT}^{\gamma {\rm SIDIS}}$ at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). We thoroughly explore the EIC phase space in order to isolate in which regions the asymmetry can be sizable, finding it can be as much as $10\%$ or larger for certain kinematics. Given that $F_{FT}(x,x')$ and $G_{FT}(x,x')$ are basically unknown, $A_{UT}^{\gamma {\rm SIDIS}}$ will be an important future measurement to learn about multi-parton correlations in the nucleon.</description>

      <title>Examining dark neutron decay using f-mode gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, the impact of neutron decay into dark matter and various dark matter self-interaction strengths on neutron star properties is explored. Using the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model for nucleon-only equations of state (EoSs), the effects of different matter compositions are compared, including strange matter and self-interacting dark matter. The results demonstrate that increasing dark matter self-repulsion stiffens the EoS, influencing the mass-radius relationship and stability of neutron stars. Furthermore, fundamental mode (f-mode) oscillations are analyzed as diagnostic tools for probing neutron star interiors. The f-mode frequencies follow universal relations, reinforcing their applicability for constraining dense matter properties. It is shown that neutron stars composed of nucleons-only and self-interacting dark matter exhibit universal behavior in damping time and angular frequency, whereas strange matter and non-self-interacting dark matter deviate from this trend. These findings highlight the significance of gravitational wave detections in investigating neutron star structure, particularly with next-generation observatories such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. The f-mode frequencies generated by such stars fall within the detection range of modern telescopes, making it possible to observe these signals directly. This opens a promising pathway for probing dark matter indirectly using neutron stars as natural laboratories for fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Decays into Light New Particles in Neutrino Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proton and neutron decays into light new particles $X$ can drastically change the experimental signatures and benefit from the complementarity of large water-Cherenkov neutrino detectors such as Super/Hyper-Kamiokande and tracking detectors such as JUNO and DUNE. The proton decays $p\to \ell^+ X$ and $p\to \pi^+ X$ with $m_X$ near phase-space closure lead to charged particles below Cherenkov threshold, rendering them practically invisible in Super- and Hyper-Kamiokande but not in JUNO and DUNE, which are therefore uniquely positioned for these baryon-number-violating signatures despite their smaller size. As an additional signature, such nucleon decays in Earth can produce a sizable flux of $X$ particles in underground detectors. We present a simple model in which nucleons decay into sub-GeV sterile neutrinos that subsequently decay through active-sterile neutrino mixing, with a promisingly large number of events in Super-Kamiokande even in the seesaw-motivated parameter space.</description>

      <title>Double-strangeness hidden-charm pentaquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the possible existence of double-strangeness hidden-charm pentaquark states, denoted as $P_{c\bar{c}ss}$, within an off-shell coupled-channel formalism. Eleven meson-baryon channels with total strangeness $S = -2$ are constructed by combining charmed mesons and singly charmed baryons. The two-body scattering amplitudes are derived from an effective Lagrangian that respects heavy-quark spin symmetry, hidden local symmetry, and flavor SU(3) symmetry. The Bethe-Salpeter equation is solved using the Blankenbecler-Sugar reduction scheme, and resonances are identified as poles in the scattering amplitudes on the complex energy plane. We find five negative-parity $P_{c\bar{c}ss}$ states with spins $J = 1/2$, $3/2$, and $5/2$, all located below their relevant thresholds. Three positive-parity states are also found: two with $J = 1/2$ and one with $J = 3/2$, lying above the thresholds with substantial widths. The coupling strengths of each resonance to relevant meson-baryon channels are extracted. The sensitivity of the results to the cutoff parameter $\Lambda_0 = \Lambda - m$ is examined. These results provide theoretical predictions that may assist future experimental searches for $P_{c\bar{c}ss}$ states in the $J/\psi\,\Xi$ channel.</description>

Abstract: In response to recent experimental findings from the BES III and LHCb collaborations concerning the decay of open charm mesons into three pseudoscalars, we present evidence suggesting that the lightest scalar mesons can be characterized as diquark-antidiquark states mixed with the next-to-light, q\bar q, scalar mesons through six-fermion, instanton-induced interactions.</description>

      <title>The recoil corrections, correlation functions and possible double-strange hadronic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a systematic investigation of ${K}^{(*)}{K}^{(*)}$ interactions within a one-boson-exchange model.The framework incorporates both $S-D$ wave mixing and coupled-channel effects, with effective potentials retained up to order $\mathcal{O}(1/M^2)$. By solving the coupled channel Schr\"{o}dinger equations, we can predict two double-strange molecular candidates: a $KK^*$ molecule with $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$ and a $K^*K^*$ molecule with $0(1^+)$. Our results also show that the recoil corrections play a crucial role in the formation of these two molecular candidates. Furthermore, the $S-D$ wave mixing effects contribute positively to the formation process. As a byproduct of this analysis, we extend our study to $K^{(*)}\bar{K}^{(*)}$ interactions with the same model. Our findings suggest that the $K\bar{K}^{*}$ states with $0(1^{+-}, 1^{++})$ and $K^{*}\bar{K}^{*}$ states with $0(0^{++}, 1^{+-}, 2^{++})$ can be promising molecular candidates. Additionally, we analyze the correlations between the constituent mesons, the resulting correlation functions provide additional support for our predictions of both double-strange and strangonium-like molecular states.</description>

      <title>Dilatons Improve (Non)-Goldstones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shift symmetry forbids conformal coupling of Goldstone bosons from internal symmetries, but not for spontaneously broken conformal symmetry. Its Goldstone boson, the dilaton $D$, admits and indeed requires, an improvement term $ {\cal L}_R \propto R e^{-2D/F_D}$ as it realises the Goldstone matrix element in the effective theory. The improvement, combined with Weyl-gauging, enables conformal coupling to Goldstone bosons and other particles of arbitrary Weyl-weight. While improvement does not affect scattering amplitudes in flat space, it impacts gravitational form factors decisively, giving rise to the dilaton pole in the spin-zero channel. We compute leading-order scalar, fermion, pion, and dilaton form factors, confirming low-energy constraints. The dilaton decoupling limit further implies that the operator driving spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking has scaling dimension $\Delta= d-2$.</description>

      <title>Block Lanczos algorithm for lattice QCD spectroscopy and matrix elements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work introduced a new framework for analyzing correlation functions with improved convergence and signal-to-noise properties, as well as rigorous quantification of excited-state effects, based on the Lanczos algorithm and spurious eigenvalue filtering with the Cullum-Willoughby test. Here, we extend this framework to the analysis of correlation-function matrices built from multiple interpolating operators in lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) by constructing an oblique generalization of the block Lanczos algorithm, as well as a new physically motivated reformulation of the Cullum-Willoughby test that generalizes to block Lanczos straightforwardly. The resulting block Lanczos method directly extends generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) methods, which can be viewed as applying a single iteration of block Lanczos. Block Lanczos provides qualitative and quantitative advantages over GEVP methods analogous to the benefits of Lanczos over the standard effective mass, including faster convergence to ground- and excited-state energies, explicitly computable two-sided error bounds, straightforward extraction of matrix elements of external currents, and asymptotically constant signal-to-noise. No fits or statistical inference are required. Proof-of-principle calculations are performed for noiseless mock-data examples as well as two-by-two proton correlation-function matrices in lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love Numbers of Neutron Stars in Horndeski Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision measurements of the gravitational wave signal from compact binary inspirals allow us to constrain the internal structure of those objects via physical parameters such as the tidal Love numbers. In scalar-tensor theories, one typically finds new types of Love numbers that are usually not considered or simply absent in General Relativity, which further allows us to constrain deviations from General Relativity. Building upon previous results, we present the linear perturbation equations necessary to calculate static and even-parity tidal Love numbers in Horndeski theories, the most general scalar-tensor theories with second-order field equations of motion. We further focus on the quadrupolar Love numbers and demonstrate how these can be extracted from the asymptotic expansion of the perturbation fields. We find that there is a potential ambiguity in extracting the Love numbers in this way, which we resolve by performing supplementary calculations in the effective field theory framework. We show that, in the case of scalar-tensor theories, the tidal Love numbers are not directly given by the $1/r^3$ term in the asymptotic expansion of the perturbation fields, as there is an additional contribution to this term independent of the Love numbers. We calculate such a contribution for a minimally coupled scalar field and also for the Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese model. For the latter, we find that the Love numbers can differ by $\mathcal{O}(1 \sim 10)\,\%$, if this additional contribution is not taken into account.</description>

      <title>Investigating effects of the electrical conductivity of QCD matter on charge-dependent directed flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge dependent directed flow is an important observable of electromagnetic fields in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We demonstrate how the difference in charge dependent directed flows between protons and antiprotons is sensitive to the resistivity, inverse of quark-gluon plasma's electric conductivity, over different collision centralities. Our model numerically solves the 3+1D relativistic resistive magneto-hydrodynamic (RRMHD) equations, assuming the electric conductivity to be a scalar. For this work, we focus on symmetric Au + Au collisions at the top RHIC energy of $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV. We illustrate the time evolution of the electromagnetic fields in our model and connect that to the charge dependent directed flow results. Our results highlight the importance of modeling quark-gluon plasma's electric conductivity for charge dependent observables in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Configuration Requirements for 21-cm Forest Background Quasar Searches with the Moon-based Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 21-cm forest offers a powerful cosmological probe of the thermal history and small-scale structure of the intergalactic medium during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Its success, however, critically depends on the availability of high-redshift radio-loud quasars (HzRLQs) as background sources. In this work, we investigate the configuration requirements for a Moon-based low-frequency radio interferometer aimed at maximizing the detection of HzRLQs for future 21-cm forest studies. Building upon a previously developed quasar luminosity function (QLF), we forecast HzRLQ abundances under various array configurations. Assuming a total survey area of $10^4\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ and 1 year of observation, we compare continuum surveys with 10 MHz bandwidth and 21-cm forest surveys with 5 kHz resolution. Our results show that a minimum collecting area of $\sim$6 500 m$^2$ enables detection at $z \sim 6$, while SKA-like arrays ($N_{\mathrm{st}} = 512$) extend the detection limit to $z \sim 10$ for 21-cm forest survey and $z \sim 16$ for continuum survey. Larger arrays with $N_{\mathrm{st}} = 2048$ can reach $z \sim 11$ in 21-cm forest mode. We also explore configurations that maintain fixed collecting areas while increasing the number to enhance survey efficiency. This boosts source detection but significantly increases the data volume and computational demands. These results underscore the importance of optimizing array design for different survey goals and balancing sensitivity, spectral resolution, and data management. A well-designed Moon-based array could open a new observational window on reionization and early cosmic structure formation.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Axions Revealed via Amplified Modulation of Ellipticity of Laser (CARAMEL)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new axion dark matter detection strategy that employs optical readout of laser beam ellipticity modulations caused by axion-induced electric fields in a microwave cavity, using electro-optic (EO) crystals, enhanced by externally injected radio-frequency (RF) power. Building upon the variance-based probing method, PRD 107, 103005, (2023), we extend this concept to the optical domain: a weak probe laser interacts with an EO crystal placed inside a resonant microwave cavity at cryogenic temperatures, and the axion-induced electric field is revealed through induced ellipticity. The injected RF signal coherently interferes with that of the axion field, amplifying the optical response and significantly improving sensitivity. While our EO-based method employs a Fabry-Perot resonator, we do not require Michelson interferometers. Our method hence enables compact, high-frequency axion searches, across the 0.5-50 GHz range. Operating at cryogenic temperatures not only suppresses thermal backgrounds but, critically, allows the probing method to mitigate the laser quantum noise. This approach offers a scalable path forward for axion detection over the $\sim (\text{few}-200$)~$\mu$eV mass range -- covering the preferred parameter space for the post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn axion dark matter -- using compact, tunable systems.</description>

      <title>Early time hydrodynamic attractor in a nearly-unitary Fermi gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic attractors paradigm aims to explain the applicability of hydrodynamics after a very short timescale in ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC in terms of the emergence of universal behavior across different initial states. The attractors observed in theoretical models are first driven by a rapid expansion of matter, which later gives way to the decay of exponentially damped transient excitations into the viscous fluid regime. Recently, a theoretical proposal was made how to realize hydrodynamic attractors in cold atomic gases focusing on the decay of transients and opening prospects for a future experimental realization in table top experiments. Motivated by this, in the present paper we show how the far-from-equilibrium, expansion-driven part of the hydrodynamic attractor emerges in a model of a nearly-unitary Fermi gas.</description>

      <title>From Hyperons to Hypernuclei: A New Route to Unravel Proton Spin Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12193v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions create the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) known as the hottest, least viscous, and most vortical fluid ever produced in terrestrial laboratories. Its vortical structure has been uncovered through the spin polarization of Lambda ($\Lambda$) hyperons, attributed to the spin-orbit coupling that transfers the system's orbital angular momentum to the quark spin, which is then inherited by hadrons via quark recombination or coalescence. However, $\Lambda$ polarization reflects primarily the strange-quark component, leaving the spin dynamics of the up and down quarks largely unexplored. Although the proton is an ideal probe, its stability makes direct measurements experimentally challenging. Here, we propose to unravel proton spin polarization via hypertriton ($^3_\Lambda \text{H}$) measurements, exploiting the fact that spin information is preserved when polarized nucleons and $\Lambda$ coalesce to form hypertriton. We show that, over a broad range of collision energies, the polarizations of proton, $\Lambda$, and hypertriton are related by a simple linear scaling law. Since both $\Lambda$ and hypertriton polarizations can be measured via their self-analyzing weak decays, this linear relation provides a practical experimental avenue for accessing spin polarizations of protons and neutrons-the dominant baryonic degrees of freedom in nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Origins of the NANOGrav Signal: Early Universe Models and $\Delta N_{eff}$ Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether an Early-Universe stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) can account for the common spectrum process reported by NANOGrav, while also being consistent with current and projected CMB measurements of extra radiation. We compute the contribution of effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{eff}$, for a number of Early-Universe models proposed to explain the pulsar timing array (PTA) spectrum. We demonstrate that models predicting $\Delta N_{eff}$ above the CMB limit would be firmly excluded, implying that the NANOGrav signal in tension with these bounds must instead arise from astrophysical sources. We find that current NANOGrav 15-year dataset, sensitive up to 60 nHz, gives a negligible contribution to $\Delta N_{eff}$ and remains well below the present and future CMB detection threshold. However, when we project future PTA capabilities reaching upto 1 $\mu$Hz, even with our conservative estimate we find that Inflation, Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGW), and metastable cosmic strings can induce a $\Delta N_{eff}$ large enough for $&gt;3.5\sigma$ detection by the Simons Observatory.</description>
