      <title>The Economic Dividends of Peace: Evidence from Arab-Israeli Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides the first causal evidence on the long-run economic dividends of Arab-Israeli peace treaties. Using synthetic control and difference-in-synthetic control estimators, we analyze 1978 Camp David Accords and 1994 peace treaty between Jordan and Israel. Both cases reveal large and lasting gains. By 2011, real GDP of Egypt exceeded its synthetic counterfactual by 64 percent, and per capita income by 82 percent. Jordanian trajectory shows similarly permanent improvements, with real GDP higher by 75 percent and per capita income by more than 20 percent. The mechanisms differ: in Egypt, gains stem from a sharp fiscal reallocation together with higher foreign direct investment and improved institutional credibility, while Jordan benefited primarily through enhanced trade and financial inflows. Robustness and placebo tests confirm the uniqueness of these effects. The results demonstrate that peace agreements yield large, durable, and heterogeneous growth dividends.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Medicaid Coverage on Mental Health, Why Insurance Makes People Happier in OHIE: by Spending Less or by Spending More?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment (OHIE) offers a unique opportunity to examine the causal relationship between Medicaid coverage and happiness among low-income adults, using an experimental design. This study leverages data from comprehensive surveys conducted at 0 and 12 months post-treatment. Previous studies based on OHIE have shown that individuals receiving Medicaid exhibited a significant improvement in mental health compared to those who did not receive coverage. The primary objective is to explore how Medicaid coverage impacts happiness, specifically analyzing in which direction variations in healthcare spending significantly improve mental health: higher spending or lower spending after Medicaid. Utilizing instrumental variable (IV) regression, I conducted six separate regressions across subgroups categorized by expenditure levels and happiness ratings, and the results reveal distinct patterns. Enrolling in OHP has significantly decreased the probability of experiencing unhappiness, regardless of whether individuals had high or low medical spending. Additionally, it decreased the probability of being pretty happy and having high medical expenses, while increasing the probability among those with lower expenses. Concerning the probability of being very happy, the OHP only had a positive effect on being very happy and spending less, and its effect on those with high expenses was insignificant. These findings align with the benefit of Medicaid: alleviating financial burden, contributing to the well-being of distinct subgroups.</description>

      <title>Culture, Gender, and Labor Force Participation: Evidence from Colombia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of integrating gender equality into the Colombian constitution of 1991 on attitudes towards gender equality, experiences of gender-based discrimination, and labor market participation. Using a difference-in-discontinuities framework, we compare individuals exposed to mandatory high school courses on the Constitution with those who were not exposed. Our findings show a significant increase in labor market participation, primarily driven by women. Exposure to these courses also shapes attitudes towards gender equality, with men demonstrating greater support. Women report experiencing less gender-based discrimination. Importantly, our results suggest that women's increased labor market participation is unlikely due to reduced barriers from male partners. A disparity in opinions regarding traditional gender norms concerning household domains is observed between men and women, highlighting an ongoing power struggle within the home. However, the presence of a younger woman in the household appears to influence men's more positive view of gender equality, potentially indicating a desire to empower younger women in their future lives. These findings highlight the crucial role of cultural shocks and the constitutional inclusion of women's rights in shaping labor market dynamics.</description>

      <title>Floods do not sink prices, historical memory does: How flood risk impacts the Italian housing market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Do home prices incorporate flood risk in the immediate aftermath of specific flood events, or is it the repeated exposure over the years that plays a more significant role? We address this question through the first systematic study of the Italian housing market, which is an ideal case study because it is highly exposed to floods, though unevenly distributed across the national territory. Using a novel dataset containing about 550,000 mortgage-financed transactions between 2016 and 2024, as well as hedonic regressions and a difference-in-difference design, we find that: (i) specific floods do not decrease home prices in areas at risk; (ii) the repeated exposure to floods in flood-prone areas leads to a price decline, up to 4\% in the most frequently flooded regions; (iii) responses are heterogeneous by buyers' income and age. Young buyers (with limited exposure to prior floods) do not obtain any price reduction for settling in risky areas, while experienced buyers do. At the same time, buyers who settle in risky areas have lower incomes than buyers in safe areas in the most affected regions. Our results emphasize the importance of cultural and institutional factors in understanding how flood risk affects the housing market and socioeconomic outcomes.</description>

      <title>Signature Decomposition Method Applying to Pair Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-frequency quantitative trading strategies have long been of significant interest in futures market. While advanced statistical arbitrage and deep learning enhance high-frequency data processing, they diminish opportunities for traditional methods and yield less interpretable, unstable strategies. Consequently, developing stable, interpretable quantitative strategies remains a priority in futures markets. In this study, we propose a novel pair trading strategy by leveraging the mathematical concept of path signature which serves as a feature representation of time series. Specifically, the path signature is decomposed into two new indicators: the path interactivity indicator segmented signature and the directional indicator covariation of increments, which serve as double filters in strategy design. Empirical experiments using minute-level futures data show our strategy significantly outperforms traditional pair trading, delivering higher returns, lower maximum drawdown, and higher Sharpe ratio. The proposed method enhances interpretability and robustness while maintaining strong returns, demonstrating the potential of path signatures in financial trading.</description>

      <title>Seeing Through Green: Text-Based Classification and the Firm's Returns from Green Patents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Natural Language Processing for identifying ``true'' green patents from official supporting documents. We start our training on about 12.4 million patents that had been classified as green from previous literature. Thus, we train a simple neural network to enlarge a baseline dictionary through vector representations of expressions related to environmental technologies. After testing, we find that ``true'' green patents represent about 20\% of the total of patents classified as green from previous literature. We show heterogeneity by technological classes, and then check that `true' green patents are about 1\% less cited by following inventions. In the second part of the paper, we test the relationship between patenting and a dashboard of firm-level financial accounts in the European Union. After controlling for reverse causality, we show that holding at least one ``true'' green patent raises sales, market shares, and productivity. If we restrict the analysis to high-novelty ``true'' green patents, we find that they also yield higher profits. Our findings underscore the importance of using text analyses to gauge finer-grained patent classifications that are useful for policymaking in different domains.</description>
