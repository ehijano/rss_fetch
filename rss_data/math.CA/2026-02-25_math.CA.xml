      <title>A coherent theory of tent spaces and homogeneous Triebel-Lizorkin spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and systematically investigate a scale of tent spaces that characterizes homogeneous Triebel-Lizorkin spaces $\mathrm{\dot F}^{\beta}_{p,q}$. These spaces generalize the classical spaces of Coifman, Meyer, and Stein, and are shown to be equivalent to the weighted tent spaces with Whitney averages developed by Huang. We show that these tent spaces follow a functional analytic theory that mirrors that of Triebel-Lizorkin spaces, including duality, embeddings, discrete characterizations, John-Nirenberg-type properties, as well as real and complex interpolation. Furthermore, we provide a novel characterization of the endpoint spaces $\mathrm{\dot F}^\beta_{\infty,q}$, completing earlier work by Auscher, Bechtel, and the author.</description>

      <title>On the P\'olya Frequency Order of the de Bruijn Newman Kernel. Certified Failure at Order Five and the Toeplitz Threshold Phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the classical de Bruijn--Newman kernel $K(u) = \Phi(|u|)$, arising in the study of the Riemann zeta function via the de Bruijn--Newman constant, is not a P\'olya frequency function of order $5$ (PF$_5$). The proof is computational: we exhibit an explicit $5 \times 5$ Toeplitz minor with rigorously certified negative determinant, established through interval arithmetic at 80-digit precision with formally bounded truncation and rounding errors. At the same Toeplitz configuration we certify positivity of all minors of orders $2$, $3$, and $4$; this shows that the \emph{Toeplitz PF threshold} within the two-parameter family $D_r(u_0,h)$ (Definition 2.1) lies exactly at order $5$ for this configuration, while the global question $K \in \mathrm{PF}_4$ remains an open problem (Section 8).
  We develop a systematic Toeplitz reduction that collapses the $2r$-dimensional configuration space of the PF$_r$ condition to a two-parameter family $D_r(u_0,h)$ of Toeplitz determinants. An asymptotic analysis in the grid spacing $h \to 0$ reveals leading coefficients $C_r(u_0)$ whose signs govern the PFthreshold.  We prove the algebraic decomposition \[ C_r(u_0) \;=\; \sum_{\substack{k_0,\ldots,k_{r-1}\ge 0 \\ k_0+\cdots+k_{r-1}=r(r-1)}} \!\!\Bigl(\prod_{i=0}^{r-1} a_{k_i}(u_0)\Bigr)\, \det\bigl[(i-j)^{k_m}\bigr]_{i,m=0}^{r-1}, \] where $a_k(u_0) = K^{(k)}(u_0)/k!$, and verify that $C_r(u_0) &gt; 0$ for $r \le 4$ at all tested points while $C_5(u_0) &lt; 0$ for $u_0 \in (0, u_0^*)$ with a critical threshold $u_0^* = 0.031139\ldots$ (computed by bisection to 15 digits; see Section 5).  This sign pattern, together with the positivity of $C_6$ and $C_7$, reveals a localized failure mechanism specific to order $5$.
  As a further probe of this phenomenon, we study the Gaussian deformation $K_t(u) = e^{tu^2}\Phi(|u|)$ and compute, for each counterexample configuration $(u_0,h)$, the minimal $t$ at which the PF$_5$ violation is healed. This \emph{Toeplitz PF$_5$ Gaussian threshold} $\lambda_5^*(u_0,h)$ is configuration-dependent and should not be confused with the de Bruijn--Newman constant $\Lambda$, which concerns the reality of zeros of $H_t$ rather than total positivity of $K_t$.</description>

      <title>Sharp isoperimetric inequalities on the Hamming cube II: The critical exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sharp isoperimetric inequality for the Hamming cube is proved at the critical exponent $\beta=\frac12$. This follows up on previous work, where such bounds were established for $\beta$ near $\frac12$. As a consequence, this result settles a conjecture of Kahn and Park on cube partitions and yields a sharp $L^1$ Poincar\'e inequality for Boolean-valued functions. It also confirms a low-noise limit for balanced functions predicted by the Hellinger conjecture on noisy Boolean channels in information theory.</description>

      <title>Wendroff's theorem beyond consecutive degrees and related inverse spectral problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical theorem of Wendroff shows that one may reconstructs a sequence of orthogonal polynomials on the real line from two non-constant polynomials of consecutive degrees whose zeros strictly interlace on the real line. In this note we extend this result to arbitrary non-constant polynomials. The reconstruction may be formulated via a Vandermonde-type linear system and recast as an underdetermined inverse spectral problem, in which the spectra of a finite Jacobi matrix and of one of its leading principal submatrices are prescribed. In addition, the analogous result on the unit circle is established by reconstructing a sequence of paraorthogonal polynomials from two arbitrary non-constant polynomials whose zeros strictly interlace on the unit circle. In this setting, the Jacobi matrix is replaced by a finite unitary pentadiagonal matrix, and the spectral data consist of the spectrum of the full matrix together with that of a rank-one perturbation of a leading principal submatrix. Strict interlacing of zeros is shown to be a necessary and sufficient condition for solvability, and explicit constructions of the associated polynomial families and matrices are provided. Finally, an algorithm and several illustrative examples are presented.</description>

      <title>Oppenheim--Schur inequalities for causal products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a class of Oppenheim--Schur-type inequalities for the convolutional Jury product of positive semidefinite matrices. These results extend to a causal convolutional setting the classical Schur and Oppenheim inequalities associated with the Hadamard product. Our approach highlights structural parallels between entrywise and convolution-based matrix operations, revealing how positivity constraints interact with causality. Building on this perspective, we introduce a broader family of causal matrix products and prove unified inequalities that simultaneously recover the classical Schur and Oppenheim bounds as well as their convolutional Jury counterparts. These results provide a common framework for understanding positivity-preserving matrix products and suggest further connections between classical matrix analysis and causal operator structures.</description>

      <title>Lebesgue bounds for multilinear spherical and lacunary maximal averages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish $L^{p_1}(\mathbb R^d) \times \cdots \times L^{p_n}(\mathbb R^d) \rightarrow L^r(\mathbb R^d)$ bounds for spherical averaging operators $\mathcal A^n$ in dimensions $d \geq 2$ for indices $1\le p_1,\dots , p_n\le \infty$ and $\frac{1}{p_1}+\cdots +\frac{1}{p_n}=\frac{1}{r}$. We obtain this result by first showing that $\mathcal A^n$ maps $L^1 \times \cdots \times L^1 \rightarrow L^1$. We also obtain similar estimates for lacunary maximal spherical averages in the largest possible open region of indices.</description>

      <title>Approximating the operator norm of local Hamiltonians via few quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a Hermitian operator $A$ acting on a complex Hilbert space of dimension $2^n$. We show that when $A$ has small degree in the Pauli expansion, or in other words, $A$ is a local $n$-qubit Hamiltonian, its operator norm can be approximated independently of $n$ by maximizing $|\braket{\psi|A|\psi}|$ over a small collection $\mathbf{X}_n$ of product states $\ket{\psi}\in (\mathbf{C}^{2})^{\otimes n}$. More precisely, we show that whenever $A$ is $d$-local, \textit{i.e.,} $\deg(A)\le d$, we have the following discretization-type inequality:
  \[ \|A\|\le C(d)\max_{\psi\in \mathbf{X}_n}|\braket{\psi|A|\psi}|.
  \] The constant $C(d)$ depends only on $d$. This collection $\mathbf{X}_n$ of $\psi$'s, termed a \emph{quantum norm design}, is independent of $A$, and consists of product states, and can have
  cardinality as small as $(1+\eps)^n$, which is essentially tight. Previously, norm designs were known only for homogeneous $d$-localHamiltonians $A$ \cite{L,BGKT,ACKK}, and for non-homogeneous $2$-local traceless $A$ \cite{BGKT}.
  Several other results, such as boundedness of Rademacher projections for all levels and estimates of operator norms of random Hamiltonians, are also given.</description>
