      <title>Perturbing finite temperature multicomponent DFT 1D Kohn-Sham systems: Peierls Gap &amp; Kohn Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the greatest challenges when designing new technologies that make use of non-trivial quantum materials is the difficulty associated with predicting material-specific properties, such as critical temperature, gap parameter, etc. There is naturally a great amount of interest in these types of condensed matter systems because of their application to quantum sensing, quantum electronics, and quantum computation; however, they are exceedingly difficult to address from first principles because of the famous many-body problem. For this reason, a full electron-nuclear quantum calculation will likely remain completely out of reach for the foreseeable future. A practical alternative is provided by finite temperature, multi component density functional theory (MCDFT), which is a formally exact method of computing the equilibrium state energy of a many-body quantum system. In this work, we use this construction alongside a perturbative scheme to demonstrate that the phenomena Peierls effect and Kohn Anomaly are both natural features of the KS equations without additional structure needed. We find the temperature dependent ionic density for a simple 1D lattice which is then used to derive the ionic densities temperature dependent affect on the electronic band structure. This is accomplished by Fourier transforming the ionic density term found within this KS electronic equation. Using the Peierls effect phonon distortion gap openings in relation to the Fermi level, we then perturb the KS ionic equation with a conduction electron density, deriving the Kohn Anomaly. This provides a workable predictive strategy for interesting electro-phonon related material properties which could be extended to 2D and 3D real materials while retaining the otherwise complicated temperature dependence.</description>

      <title>Current-induced Zero Resistance in Trigonal Fulde-Ferrell Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current-induced zero resistance (CIZR) in twisted trilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ has posed a theoretical challenge, as it goes beyond understanding of the existing theories of critical current and superconducting diode effect. In this Letter, we demonstrate that CIZR can be understood based on three-fold (near-)degenerate Fulde-Ferrell states, by studying a minimal tight-binding model on a triangular lattice with valley polarization and trigonal warping. We ellucidate that Fulde-Ferrell states are stabilized due to broken two-fold rotational symmetry, making an exception to the common belief that Larkin-Ovchinnikov states are stable in most cases. After establishing the thermodynamic phase diagram in electric current, we propose a scenario that predicts nonreciprocal and reciprocal CIZR in the presence of domains of different Fulde-Ferrell states. The triangular finite-momentum state is also predicted, unraveling another fascinating aspect of valley-polarized superconductors.</description>

      <title>Electronic structures and multi-orbital models of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity with $T_c$ exceeding 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and (La,Pr)$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure marks a significant breakthrough in nickelate superconductors. Using density functional theory (DFT), we propose the double-stacked two-orbital effective models for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, based on the Ni$-e_g$ orbitals. Our analysis reveals the presence of three electron pockets $\alpha,\alpha^{\prime},\beta$ and two hole pockets $\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}$ on the Fermi surface, where the additional pockets $\alpha^{\prime}$ and $\gamma^{\prime}$ emerge due to inter-stack interactions. Furthermore, we construct higher-energy models incorporating O-$p$ orbitals to facilitate further investigations. The spin susceptibility, calculated within the random phase approximation (RPA), indicates enhanced magnetic correlations primarily driven by nesting effects of the $\gamma$ pocket, which is predominantly contributed by the Ni$-d_{z^2}$ orbital. These models provide fundamental framework for further theoretical and experimental studies, offering critical insights into the superconducting mechanism of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films.</description>

      <title>Superconducting non-volatile memory based on charge trapping and gate-controlled superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting electronics represents a promising technology, offering not only efficient integration with quantum computing systems, but also the potential for significant power reduction in high-performance computing. Nonetheless, the lack of superconducting memories better than conventional metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) memories represent a major obstacle towards the development of computing systems entirely based on superconducting electronics. In this work, we combine the emerging concept of gate-controlled supercurrent (GCS) with the well-established mechanism of charge-trapping memory to demonstrate a novel, highly scalable, voltage-controlled and non-volatile superconducting memory. GCS denotes the observation that the supercurrent in a superconducting constriction can be suppressed by applying a certain gate voltage (VG) to it. Our findings show that charge trapping within the gate dielectric, here sapphire, influences the voltage threshold needed to suppress the supercurrent. We demonstrate reliable reading and reversible writing of two distinct charge-trapping memory states, associated with different supercurrent values. Based on our memory device demonstrator, we discuss its integration into a NOT AND (NAND) gate layout, outlining the significant improvements offered by this novel memory concept over other existing NAND memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Superconducting properties of commercially available solders for low-field applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solders with superconducting properties around $4\,{\rm K}$ are useful in low magnetic field environments for AC current leads or in electrical and mechanical bonds. Accurate knowledge of these properties are needed in high precision experiments. We have measured the electrical resistance of five commercially-available solders: 50\%Sn-50\%Pb, 60\%Sn-40\%Pb, 60\%Sn-40\%Pb-0.3\%Sb, 52\%In-48\%Sn, and 96.5\%Sn-3.5\%Ag, down to $2.3\,{\rm K}$ and in applied magnetic fields from 0 to 0.1$\,{\rm T}$. Their critical temperatures $T_c$ and critical fields $B_c$ were extracted in our analysis, taking into account the observed 90\%-to-10\% transition widths. Our best candidate for low-loss AC current leads in low fields is 50\%Sn-50\%Pb, which had zero-field $T_{c,0} = (7.1 \pm 0.3)\,{\rm K}$, and remained high to $T_c(B=0.1\,{\rm T}) = (6.9 \pm 0.3) \,{\rm K}$. We report $T_c$ and $B_c$ of 60\%Sn-40\%Pb-0.3\%Sb and $B_{c,0}$ of 96.5\%Sn-3.5\%Ag for the first time. Our $T_{c,0}= (3.31 \pm 0.04)\,{\rm K}$ for 96.5\%Sn-3.5\%Ag disagrees with a widely adopted value.</description>

      <title>Tight-Binding Energy-Phase Calculation for Topological Josephson Junction Nanowire Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current state of Quantum computing (QC) is extremely optimistic, and we are at a point where researchers have produced highly sophisticated quantum algorithms to address far reaching problems. However, it is equally apparent that the noisy quantum environment is a larger threat than many may realize. The noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era can be viewed as an inflection point for the enterprise of QC where decoherence could stagnate progress if left unaddressed. One tactic for handling decoherence is to address the problem from a hardware level by implementing topological materials into the design. In this work, we model several Josephson junctions that are modified by the presence of topological superconducting nanowires in between the host superconductors. Our primary result is a numerical calculation of the energy-phase relationship for topological nanowire junctions which are a key parameter of interest for the dynamics of qubit circuits. In addition to this, we report on the qualitative physical behavior of the bound states as a function of superconducting phase. These results can be used to further develop and inform the construction of more complicated systems, and it is hopeful that these types of designs could manifest as a fault tolerant qubit.</description>

      <title>Development of High-Quality $\alpha$-Ta Film at Room Temperature via Seed Layer Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth of high-quality superconducting thin film on silicon substrates is essential for quantum computing, and low signal interconnects with industrial compatibility. Recently, the growth of $\alpha$-Ta (alpha-phase tantalum) thin films has gained attention over conventional superconductors like Nb and Al due to their high-density native oxide ($Ta_2O_5$), which offers excellent chemical resistance, superior dielectric properties, and mechanical robustness. The growth of $\alpha$-Ta thin films can be achieved through high-temperature/cryogenic growth, ultra-thin seed layers, or thick films (&gt;300 nm). While high-temperature deposition produces high-quality films, it can cause thermal stress, silicide formation at the interface, and defects due to substrate-film mismatch. Room-temperature deposition minimizes these issues, benefiting heat-sensitive substrates and device fabrication. Low-temperature growth using amorphous (defective) seed layers such as TaN and TiN has shown promise for phase stabilization. However, nitrogen gas, used as a source of metallic nitride, can introduce defects and lead to the formation of amorphous seed layers. This study explores using crystalline seed layers to optimize $\alpha$-Ta thin films, demonstrating improved film quality, including reduced surface roughness, enhanced phase orientation, and higher transition temperatures compared to amorphous seed layers like metal nitrides. These advancements could interest the superconducting materials community for fabricating high-quality quantum devices.</description>

      <title>High-performance Andreev interferometer-based electronic coolers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an electronic refrigerator based on a ballistic Andreev interferometer that allows to reach a maximum cooling power per channel up to five orders of magnitude larger than that of the conventional normal metal-insulator-superconductor cooler. This effect is achieved by exploiting the destructive interference that occurs when the superconducting phase difference equals $\pi$. This results in a strongly suppressed charge current below the superconducting gap, while still allowing the extraction of excitations above the gap, leading to a cooler with enhanced performance. Interestingly, we find that such a large cooling power per channel enables the achievement of an electronic temperature close to the theoretical lower bound. Additionally, we derive an approximate expression for this bound in the regime of low bath temperatures. Finally, we propose potential implementations of the ballistic Andreev interferometer cooler using semiconductors, graphene, and topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Gate and Carriers tunable Valley Imbalance in Topological Proximitized Rhombohedral Trilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the electronic structure, Fermi surface topology and the emergence of valley imbalance in rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG) induced by the topological proximity and the electric fields. We show that, a strong proximity strength isolates the unperturbed low energy bands at the charge neutrality and the isolated topological bands show metallic nature under the influence of applied electric fields. Our calculations indicate that valley-resolved metallic states with a finite Chern number $|C| =$3 can appear near charge neutrality for appropriate electric fields and second-nearest-neighbor strengths. The Fermi surface topology of these metallic bands greatly influenced by the applied electric fields and carrier doping. The valley imbalance lead to the dominant carriers of either $e^-$ or $h^+$ Fermi surface pockets and the choice of carriers is subjected to the direction of electric fields. The gate-tunable and carrier-induced valley imbalance in topologically proximated rhombohedral trilayer graphene may have potential applications toward the realization of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Multi-orbital effects on superconductivity in kagome metals: Parquet renormalization group analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Van Hove singularities (VHSs), where the electronic density of states diverges due to saddle points in the band structure, play a crucial role in enhancing electronic correlations and driving various instabilities. In particular, VHS-induced superconductivity has earned significant attention due to its potential to achieve high transition temperatures and its tendency to favor exotic pairing states beyond conventional electron-phonon mechanisms. Despite extensive research on VHS-driven superconductivity, the multi-orbital effect on such systems remains less explored. Motivated by recent experiments on several kagome metals under doping and pressure [Z.Zhang {\it et al.}, Phys.Rev.B {\bf 103}, 224513 (2021), Y.Sur {\it et al.}, Nat.Commun. {\bf 14}, 3899 (2023)], we explore the effects of multi-orbital physics and strong correlations induced by VHS in the kagome lattice, focusing on their impact on superconductivity. Using parquet renormalization group analysis, we uncover eight distinct superconducting instabilities, characterized by order parameters with mixed orbital degrees of freedom. Among these, we identify a parameter regime where $d$-wave-like orbital-singlet spin-triplet order parameters dominate as the leading instability. The degenerate spin-triplet states in this regime are capable of breaking time-reversal symmetry, which is a multi-orbital analogue of chiral spin-triplet superconductivity. These findings highlight the interplay between multi-orbital effects on superconductivity and can apply to the kagome metal systems such as $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs) family.</description>

      <title>High-throughput study of kagome compounds in the AV3Sb5 family</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kagome lattice has emerged as a fertile ground for exotic quantum phenomena, including superconductivity, charge density waves, and topologically nontrivial states. While AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) compounds have been extensively studied in this context, the broader AB3C5 family remains largely unexplored. In this work, we employ machine-learning-accelerated, high-throughput density functional theory calculations to systematically investigate the stability and electronic properties of kagome materials derived from atomic substitutions in the AV3Sb5 structure. We identify 36 promising candidates that are thermodynamically stable, with many more close to the convex hull. Stable compounds are not only found with a pnictogen (Sb or Bi) as the C atom but also with Au, Hg, Tl, and Ce. This diverse chemistry opens the way to tune the electronic properties of the compounds. In fact, many of these compounds exhibit Dirac points, Van Hove singularities, or flat bands close to the Fermi level. Our findings provide an array of compounds for experimental synthesis and further theoretical exploration of kagome superconductors beyond the already known systems.</description>

      <title>Jitter in photon-number-resolved detection by superconducting nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By analyzing the physics of multi-photon absorption in superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs), we identify physical components of jitter. From this, we formulate a quantitative physical model of the multi-photon detector response which combines local detection mechanism and local fluctuations (hotspot formation and intrinsic jitter) with thermoelectric dynamics of resistive domains. Our model provides an excellent description of the arrival-time histogram of a commercial SNSPD across several orders of magnitude, both in arrival-time probability and across mean photon number. This is achieved with just three fitting parameters: the scaling of the mean arrival time of voltage response pulses, as well as the Gaussian and exponential jitter components. Our findings have important implications for photon-number-resolving detector design, as well as applications requiring low jitter such as light detection and ranging (LIDAR).</description>

      <title>Intertwined charge and spin instability of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15649v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research on nickel-based superconductors has progressed from infinite-layer LaNiO$_2$ to finite-layer La$_{6}$Ni$_{5}$O$_{12}$, and most recently to the Ruddlesden-Popper phase La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, which was found to exhibits onset of superconductivity at $\sim$80\,K under a pressure of $\sim$16\,GPa. Unlike the superconductivity mainly driven by the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital in infinite-layer nickelates, the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ and O-2$p$ orbitals contribute significantly to the low energy states and potentially to the superconducting electron pairing mechanism of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Employing density functional calculations and multi-orbital multi-atom cluster exact diagonalization including local exchange and Coulomb interactions, here we analyze the pressure dependent low-energy electronic states of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster, relevant for the bilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The various possible spin states and the exchange and superexchange mechanisms of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster are quantified via the involvement of the Ni-$3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals and the atomic Hund's rule exchange, the apical bridging O-$2p_z$ orbitals, and the orbitals involved in the formation of local Zhang-Rice singlet like states. We find that the leading configurations contributiong to the cluster ground-states both for nominal valence and also with local charge fluctuations, do not involve occupation of the apical oxygen, instead they favor formation of in-plane Zhang-Rice singlet like states between an O ligand hole and the Ni $3d_{z^2-y^2}$ orbital. We also highlight two possible charge and spin ordered states suggested by our cluster results, that are nearly degenerate at all relevant pressures within our modelling.</description>

Abstract: The anomalous proximity effect of a spin-triplet $p$-wave superconductor has been known as a part of the Majorana physics and is explained by the penetration of zero-energy states from a surface of a superconductor to a dirty normal metal. We demonstrate that a spin-singlet $d$-wave superconductor without any surface zero-energy states exhibits the anomalous proximity effect in the presence of a specific spin-orbit interaction. The results show the quantization of the zero-bias conductance in a dirty normal-metal/superconductor junction. We also discuss a relation between our findings and results in an experiment on a CoSi$_2$/TiSi$_2$ junction.</description>

      <title>Digital-analog quantum computing of fermion-boson models in superconducting circuits</title>

Abstract: High-fidelity quantum simulations demand hardware-software co-design architectures, which are crucial for adapting to complex problems such as strongly correlated dynamics in condensed matter. By leveraging co-design strategies, we can enhance the performance of state-of-the-art quantum devices in the noisy intermediate quantum (NISQ) and early error-correction regimes. In this direction, we propose a digital-analog quantum algorithm for simulating the Hubbard-Holstein model, describing strongly-correlated fermion-boson interactions, in a suitable architecture with superconducting circuits. It comprises a linear chain of qubits connected by resonators, emulating electron-electron (e-e) and electron-phonon (e-p) interactions, as well as fermion tunneling. Our approach is adequate for digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) of fermion-boson models, including those described by the Hubbard-Holstein model. We show the reduction in the circuit depth of the DAQC algorithm, a sequence of digital steps and analog blocks, outperforming the purely digital approach. We exemplify the quantum simulation of a half-filled two-site Hubbard-Holstein model. In this example, we obtain time-dependent state fidelities larger than 0.98, showing that our proposal is suitable for studying the dynamical behavior of solid-state systems. Our proposal opens the door to computing complex systems for chemistry, materials, and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Trapped Magnetic Vortex Losses in Niobium Resonators at mK Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trapped magnetic vortices in niobium can introduce microwave losses in superconducting devices, affecting both niobium-based qubits and resonators. While our group has extensively studied this problem at temperatures above 1~K, in this study we quantify for the first time the losses driven by magnetic vortices for niobium-based quantum devices operating down to millikelvin temperature, and in the low photon counts regime. By cooling a single interface system a 3-D niobium superconducting cavity in a dilution refrigerator through the superconducting transition temperature in controlled levels of magnetic fields, we isolate the flux-induced losses and quantify the added surface resistance per unit of trapped magnetic flux. Our findings indicate that magnetic flux introduces approximately 2~n$\Omega /$mG at 10 mK and at 6 GHz in high RRR niobium. We find that the decay rate of a 6 GHz niobium cavity at 10 mK which contains a native niobium pentoxide will be dominated by the TLS oxide losses until vortices begin to impact $T_1$ for trapped magnetic field ($B_{\text{trap}}$) levels of $&gt;$100 mG. In the absence of the niobium pentoxide, $B_{\text{trap}}=$ 10 mG limits $Q_0\sim$ 10$^{10}$, or $T_1\sim$ 350 ms, highlighting the importance of magnetic shielding and magnetic hygiene in enabling $T_1&gt;$ 1 s. We observe that the flux-induced resistance decreases with temperature-yet remains largely field-independent, qualitatively explained by thermal activation of vortices in the flux-flow regime. We present a phenomenological model which captures the salient experimental observations. Our results suggest that niobium-based transmon qubits could be robust against vortex dissipation up to several hundreds mG. We are directly addressing vortex losses in transmon qubits made with low RRR Nb films in a separate experimental study.</description>
