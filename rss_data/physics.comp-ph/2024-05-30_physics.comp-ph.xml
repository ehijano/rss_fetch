      <title>Thermodynamically Informed Multimodal Learning of High-Dimensional Free Energy Models in Molecular Coarse Graining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a differentiable formalism for learning free energies that is capable of capturing arbitrarily complex model dependencies on coarse-grained coordinates and finite-temperature response to variation of general system parameters. This is done by endowing models with explicit dependence on temperature and parameters and by exploiting exact differential thermodynamic relationships between the free energy, ensemble averages, and response properties. Formally, we derive an approach for learning high-dimensional cumulant generating functions using statistical estimates of their derivatives, which are observable cumulants of the underlying random variable. The proposed formalism opens ways to resolve several outstanding challenges in bottom-up molecular coarse graining dealing with multiple minima and state dependence. This is realized by using additional differential relationships in the loss function to significantly improve the learning of free energies, while exactly preserving the Boltzmann distribution governing the corresponding fine-grain all-atom system. As an example, we go beyond the standard force-matching procedure to demonstrate how leveraging the thermodynamic relationship between free energy and values of ensemble averaged all-atom potential energy improves the learning efficiency and accuracy of the free energy model. The result is significantly better sampling statistics of structural distribution functions. The theoretical framework presented here is demonstrated via implementations in both kernel-based and neural network machine learning regression methods and opens new ways to train accurate machine learning models for studying thermodynamic and response properties of complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Ground state phases of the two-dimension electron gas with a unified variational approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) is a fundamental model, which is drawing increasing interest because of recent advances in experimental and theoretical studies of 2D materials. Current understanding of the ground state of the 2DEG relies on quantum Monte Carlo calculations, based on variational comparisons of different ansatze for different phases. We use a single variational ansatz, a general backflow-type wave function using a message-passing neural quantum state architecture, for a unified description across the entire density range. The variational optimization consistently leads to lower ground-state energies than previous best results. Transition into a Wigner crystal (WC) phase occurs automatically at rs = 37 +/- 1, a density lower than currently believed. Between the liquid and WC phases, the same ansatz and variational search strongly suggest the existence of intermediate states in a broad range of densities, with enhanced short-range nematic spin correlations.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Quantum Monte Carlo Algorithm for Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy in Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum magic, or nonstabilizerness, provides a crucial characterization of quantum systems, regarding the classical simulability with stabilizer states. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient algorithm for computing stabilizer R\'enyi entropy, one of the measures for quantum magic, in spin systems with sign-problem free Hamiltonians. This algorithm is based on the quantum Monte Carlo simulation of the path integral of the work between two partition function ensembles and it applies to all spatial dimensions and temperatures. We demonstrate this algorithm on the one and two dimensional transverse field Ising model at both finite and zero temperatures and show the quantitative agreements with tensor-network based algorithms. Furthermore, we analyze the computational cost and provide both analytical and numerical evidences for it to be polynomial in system size.</description>

      <title>Chaotic advection in a steady three-dimensional MHD flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a real 3D stationary flow characterized by chaotic advection generated by a magnetic field created by permanent magnets acting on a weakly conductive fluid subjected to a weak constant current. The model under consideration involves the Stokes equations for viscous incompressible fluid at low Reynolds number in which the density forces correspond to the Lorentz force generated by the magnetic field of the magnets and the electric current through the fluid. An innovative numerical approach based on a mixed finite element method has been developed and implemented for computing the flow velocity fields with the electromagnetic force. This ensures highly accurate numerical results, allowing a detailed analysis of the chaotic behavior of fluid trajectories through the computations of associated Poincar\'e sections and Lyapunov exponents. Subsequently, an examination of mixing efficiency is conducted, employing computations of contamination and homogeneity rates, as well as mixing time. The obtained results underscore the relevance of the modeling and computational tools employed, as well as the design of the magnetohydrodynamic device used.</description>

      <title>Flowy: High performance probabilistic lava emplacement prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lava emplacement is a complex physical phenomenon, affected by several factors. These include, but are not limited to features of the terrain, the lava settling process, the effusion rate or total erupted volume, and the probability of effusion from different locations. One method, which has been successfully employed to predict lava flow emplacement and forecast the inundated area and final lava thickness, is the MrLavaLoba method from Vitturi et al. The MrLavaLoba method is implemented in their code of the same name. Here, we introduce Flowy, a new computational tool that implements the MrLavaLoba method of Vitturi et al. in a more efficient manner. New fast algorithms have been incorporated for all performance critical code paths, resulting in a complete overhaul of the implementation. When compared to the MrLavaLoba code, Flowy exhibits a significant reduction in runtime - between 100 to 400 times faster - depending on the specific input parameters. The accuracy and the probabilistic convergence of the model outputs are not compromised, maintaining high fidelity in generating possible lava flow paths and deposition characteristics. We have validated Flowy's performance and reliability through comprehensive unit-testing and a real-world eruption scenario. The source code is freely available on GitHub, facilitating transparency, reproducibility and collaboration within the geoscientific community.</description>

      <title>A relativistic statistical field theory on a discretized Minkowski lattice with quantum-like observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A relativistic statistical field theory is constructed for a fluctuating complex-valued scalar field on a discretized Minkowski lattice. A Hilbert space of observables is then constructed from functionals of the fluctuating complex-valued scalar field with an inner product defined in terms of expectation values of the functionals. A bosonic Fock space is then constructed from the Hilbert space and creation and annihilation operators that act on the Fock space are defined. The creation and annihilation operators are used to define field operators. These field operators have some interesting quantum-like properties. For example, the field operators do not commute in general and, in the particular case of the free field theory, can be shown to satisfy the microcausality condition.</description>

      <title>Bridging electronic and classical density-functional theory using universal machine-learned functional approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of density-functional theory (DFT) is determined by the quality of the approximate functionals, such as exchange-correlation in electronic DFT and the excess functional in the classical DFT formalism of fluids. The exact functional is highly nonlocal for both electrons and fluids, yet most approximate functionals are semi-local or nonlocal in a limited weighted-density form. Machine-learned (ML) nonlocal density-functional approximations are promising in both electronic and classical DFT, but have so far employed disparate approaches with limited generality. Here, we formulate a universal approximation framework and training protocol for nonlocal ML functionals, combining features of equivariant convolutional neural networks and the weighted-density approximation. We prototype this approach for several 1D and quasi-1D problems and demonstrate that a functional with exactly the same hyperparameters achieves excellent accuracy for the hard-rod fluid, the inhomogeneous Ising model, the exact exchange functional for electrons, the electron kinetic energy functional for orbital-free DFT, as well as for liquid water with 1D inhomogeneities. These results lay the foundation for a universal ML approach to exact 3D functionals spanning electronic and classical DFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SpiDy.jl solves the non-Markovian stochastic dynamics of interacting classical spin vectors and harmonic oscillator networks in contact with a dissipative environment. The methods implemented allow the user to include arbitrary memory effects and colored quantum noise spectra. In this way, SpiDy.jl provides key tools for the simulation of classical and quantum open systems including non-Markovian effects and arbitrarily strong coupling to the environment. Among the wide range of applications, some examples range from atomistic spin dynamics to ultrafast magnetism and the study of anisotropic materials. We provide the user with Julia notebooks to guide them through the various mathematical methods and help them quickly set up complex simulations.</description>

      <title>Performance Assessment of Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials: Challenges and Directions for Materials' Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are one of the main techniques in the materials science toolbox, able to bridge ab initio accuracy with the computational efficiency of classical force fields. This allows simulations ranging from atoms, molecules, and biosystems, to solid and bulk materials, surfaces, nanomaterials, and their interfaces and complex interactions. A recent class of advanced MLIPs, which use equivariant representations and deep graph neural networks, is known as universal models. These models are proposed as foundational models suitable for any system, covering most elements from the periodic table. Current universal MLIPs (UIPs) have been trained with the largest consistent dataset available nowadays. However, these are composed mostly of bulk materials' DFT calculations. In this article, we assess the universality of all openly available UIPs, namely MACE, CHGNet, and M3GNet, in a representative task of generalization: calculation of surface energies. We find that the out-of-the-box foundational models have significant shortcomings in this task, with errors correlated to the total energy of surface simulations, having an out-of-domain distance from the training dataset. Our results show that while UIPs are an efficient starting point for fine-tuning specialized models, we envision the potential of increasing the coverage of the materials space towards universal training datasets for MLIPs.</description>

      <title>Non-unique Hamiltonians for Discrete Symplectic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An outstanding property of any Hamiltonian system is the symplecticity of its flow, namely, the continuous trajectory preserves volume in phase space. Given a symplectic but discrete trajectory generated by a transition matrix applied at a fixed time-increment ($\tau &gt; 0$), it was generally believed that there exists a unique Hamiltonian producing a continuous trajectory that coincides at all discrete times ($t = n\tau$ with $n$ integers) as long as $\tau$ is small enough. However, it is now exactly demonstrated that, for any given discrete symplectic dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, there exists an infinite number of real-valued Hamiltonians for any small value of $\tau$ and an infinite number of complex-valued Hamiltonians for any large value of $\tau$. In addition, when the transition matrix is similar to a Jordan normal form with the supradiagonal element of $1$ and the two identical diagonal elements of either $1$ or $-1$, only one solution to the Hamiltonian is found for the case with the diagonal elements of $1$, but no solution can be found for the other case.</description>

      <title>Magnetized compressible turbulence with a fluctuation dynamo and Reynolds numbers over a million</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supersonic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is a ubiquitous state for many astrophysical plasmas. However, even the basic statistics for this type of turbulence remains uncertain. We present results from supersonic MHD turbulence simulations at unparalleled resolutions, with plasma Reynolds numbers of over a million. In the kinetic energy spectrum we find a break between the scales that are dominated by kinetic energy, with spectral index $-2$, and those that become strongly magnetized, with spectral index $-3/2$. By analyzing the Helmholtz decomposed kinetic energy spectrum, we find that the compressible modes are not passively mixed through the cascade of the incompressible modes. At high magnetic Reynolds number, above $10^5$, we find a power law in the magnetic energy spectrum with spectral index $-9/5$. On the strongly magnetized, subsonic scales the plasma tends to self-organize into locally relaxed regions, where there is strong alignment between the current density, magnetic field, velocity field and vorticity field, depleting both the nonlinearities and magnetic terms in the MHD equations, which we attribute to plasma relaxation on scales where the magnetic fluctuations evolve on shorter timescales than the velocity fluctuations. This process constrains the cascade to inhomogenous, volume-poor, fractal surfaces between relaxed regions, which has significant repercussions for understanding the nature of magnetized turbulence in astrophysical plasmas and the saturation of the fluctuation dynamo.</description>

      <title>A note on the error analysis of data-driven closure models for large eddy simulations of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a mathematical formulation for error propagation in flow trajectory prediction using data-driven turbulence closure modeling. Under the assumption that the predicted state of a large eddy simulation prediction must be close to that of a subsampled direct numerical simulation, we retrieve an upper bound for the prediction error when utilizing a data-driven closure model. We also demonstrate that this error is significantly affected by the time step size and the Jacobian which play a role in amplifying the initial one-step error made by using the closure. Our analysis also shows that the error propagates exponentially with rollout time and the upper bound of the system Jacobian which is itself influenced by the Jacobian of the closure formulation. These findings could enable the development of new regularization techniques for ML models based on the identified error-bound terms, improving their robustness and reducing error propagation.</description>

      <title>Ion Correlation-Driven Hysteretic Adhesion and Repulsion between Opposing Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polyelectrolyte (PE) brushes are widely used in biomaterials and nanotechnology to regulate surface properties and interactions. Here, we apply the electrostatic correlation augmented self-consistent field theory to investigate the interactions between opposing PE brushes in a mixture of 1:1 and 3:1 salt solutions. Our theory predicts hysteretic feature of the normal stress induced by strong ion correlations. In the presence of trivalent ions, the force profile is discontinuous: repulsive in the compression branch and adhesive in the separation branch. The molecular origin of the hysteretic force is the coexistence of two collapsed modes: two separated condensed layer on each surface in the compression and a single bundled condensed layer in the separation. With the systematic inclusion of ion correlations, our theory fully captures the hysteretic force, adhesive separation, ``jump-in'' and ``jump-out'' features, and the ``specific ion effect'', all in good agreement with the reported experimental results.</description>
