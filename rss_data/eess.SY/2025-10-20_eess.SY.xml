      <title>Q-EnergyDEX: A Zero-Trust Distributed Energy Trading Framework Driven by Quantum Key Distribution and Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid decentralization and digitalization of local electricity markets have introduced new cyber-physical vulnerabilities, including key leakage, data tampering, and identity spoofing. Existing blockchain-based solutions provide transparency and traceability but still depend on classical cryptographic primitives that are vulnerable to quantum attacks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Q-EnergyDEX, a zero-trust distributed energy trading framework driven by quantum key distribution and blockchain. The framework integrates physical-layer quantum randomness with market-level operations, providing an end-to-end quantum-secured infrastructure. A cloud-based Quantum Key Management Service continuously generates verifiable entropy and regulates key generation through a rate-adaptive algorithm to sustain high-quality randomness. A symmetric authentication protocol (Q-SAH) establishes secure and low-latency sessions, while the quantum-aided consensus mechanism (PoR-Lite) achieves probabilistic ledger finality within a few seconds. Furthermore, a Stackelberg-constrained bilateral auction couples market clearing with entropy availability, ensuring both economic efficiency and cryptographic security. Simulation results show that Q-EnergyDEX maintains robust key stability and near-optimal social welfare, demonstrating its feasibility for large-scale decentralized energy markets.</description>

      <title>Exploring a New Design Paradigm for Omnidirectional MAVs for Minimal Actuation and Internal Force Elimination: Theoretical Framework and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel concept for achieving omnidirectionality in a multirotor aerial vehicle (MAV) that uses only 6 inputs and ensures no internal forces at the equilibria. The concept integrates a single actively-tilting propeller along with 3 pendulum-like links, each carrying a propeller, connected by passive universal joints to the main body. We show that this design ensures omnidirectionality while minimizing the internal forces and without resorting to overactuation (i.e., more than 6 inputs). A detailed dynamic model of the multi-link MAV is first developed. Afterwards, the analysis identifies the equilibrium configurations and illustrates that a forced equilibrium exists for every pose of the MAV's main platform. In order to render this equilibrium asymptotically stable for the closed-loop system, a geometric nonlinear controller is constructed using dynamic feedback linearization and backstepping techniques with the main platform configuration error being the left-trivialized error on SE(3). The stability of the closed-loop system is then investigated by employing standard Lyapunov arguments on the zero dynamics. We conclude by providing numerical simulations validating the proposed approach. They demonstrate the MAV capability to perform decoupled attitude and translational motions under non-zero initial conditions, parametric uncertainty, and actuators noise.</description>

      <title>Sparsity-exploiting Gaussian Process for Robust Transient Learning of Power System Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in leveraging Gaussian processes (GP) have enabled learning and inferring dynamic grid behavior from scarce PMU measurements. However, real measurements can be corrupted by various random and targeted threats, leading to inaccurate and meaningless results. This paper develops robust transient learning to overcome this challenge by exploiting the sparse corruption patterns in the data flow. Specifically, we integrate sparse optimization with method of moments (MoM) to make learning robust to a sparse distribution of data corruptions; then, we optimize sparse weights to identify corrupted meter locations. To improve inference speed on large-scale systems, we further adopt K-medoid clustering of locations to develop dimension reduction (DR) and aggregate representation (AR) heuristics. Experimental results demonstrate robustness against random large errors, targeted false data injections, and local PMU clock drifts. On a 1354-bus system, inference turns out to be 18x faster using DR and 400x faster when further combined with AR heuristics.</description>

      <title>Tail-Optimized Caching for LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt caching is critical for reducing latency and cost in LLM inference: OpenAI and Anthropic report up to 50-90% cost savings through prompt reuse. Despite its widespread success, little is known about what constitutes an optimal prompt caching policy, particularly when optimizing tail latency, a metric of central importance to practitioners. The widely used Least Recently Used (LRU) policy can perform arbitrarily poor on this metric, as it is oblivious to the heterogeneity of conversation lengths. To address this gap, we propose Tail-Optimized LRU, a simple two-line modification that reallocates KV cache capacity to prioritize high-latency conversations by evicting cache entries that are unlikely to affect future turns. Though the implementation is simple, we prove its optimality under a natural stochastic model of conversation dynamics, providing the first theoretical justification for LRU in this setting, a result that may be of independent interest to the caching community. Experimentally, on real conversation data WildChat, Tail-Optimized LRU achieves up to 27.5% reduction in P90 tail Time to First Token latency and 23.9% in P95 tail latency compared to LRU, along with up to 38.9% decrease in SLO violations of 200ms. We believe this provides a practical and theoretically grounded option for practitioners seeking to optimize tail latency in real-world LLM deployments.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Oscillatory Perturbations in Car-Following Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As connected and autonomous vehicles become more widespread, platooning has emerged as a key strategy to improve road capacity, reduce fuel consumption, and enhance traffic flow. However, the benefits of platoons strongly depend on their ability to maintain stability. Instability can lead to unsafe spacing and increased energy usage. In this work, we study platoon instability and analyze the root cause of its occurrence, as well as its impacts on the following vehicle. To achieve this, we propose a comparative study between different car-following models such as the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), the Optimal Velocity Model (OVM), the General Motors Model (GMM), and the Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC). In our approach, we introduce a disruption in the model by varying the velocity of the leading vehicle to visualize the behavior of the following vehicles. To evaluate the dynamic response of each model, we introduce controlled perturbations in the velocity of the leading vehicle, specifically, sinusoidal oscillations and discrete velocity changes. The resulting vehicle trajectories and variations in inter-vehicle spacing are analyzed to assess the robustness of each model to disturbance propagation. The findings offer insight into model sensitivity, stability characteristics, and implications for designing resilient platooning control strategies.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Key-Distribution Authenticated Aggregation and Settlement for Virtual Power Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs) and demand-side flexibility has made virtual power plants (VPPs) central to modern grid operation. Yet their end-to-end business pipeline, covering bidding, dispatch, metering, settlement, and archival, forms a tightly coupled cyber-physical-economic system where secure and timely communication is critical. Under the combined stress of sophisticated cyberattacks and extreme weather shocks, conventional cryptography offers limited long-term protection. Quantum key distribution (QKD), with information-theoretic guarantees, is viewed as a gold standard for securing critical infrastructures. However, limited key generation rates, routing capacity, and system overhead render key allocation a pressing challenge: scarce quantum keys must be scheduled across heterogeneous processes to minimize residual risk while maintaining latency guarantees. This paper introduces a quantum-authenticated aggregation and settlement framework for VPPs. We first develop a system-threat model that connects QKD key generation and routing with business-layer security strategies, authentication strength, refresh frequency, and delay constraints. Building on this, we formulate a key-budgeted risk minimization problem that jointly accounts for economic risk, service-level violations, and key-budget feasibility, and reveal a threshold property linking marginal security value to shadow prices. Case studies on a representative VPP system demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces residual risk and SLA violations, enhances key efficiency and robustness, and aligns observed dynamics with the theoretical shadow price mechanism.</description>

      <title>Techno-Economic Feasibility Analysis of Quantum Key Distribution for Power-System Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accelerating digitalization and decentralization of modern power systems expose critical communication infrastructures to escalating cyber risks, particularly under emerging quantum computing threats. This paper presents an integrated techno-economic framework to evaluate the feasibility of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for secure power-system communications. A stochastic system model is developed to jointly capture time-varying key demand, QKD supply under optical-loss constraints, station-side buffering, and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) fallback mechanisms. Analytical conditions are derived for service-level assurance, including buffer stability, outage probability, and availability bounds. Building on this, two quantitative metrics, including the Levelized Cost of Security (LCoSec) and Cost of Incremental Security (CIS), are formulated to unify capital, operational, and risk-related expenditures within a discounted net-present-value framework. Using IEEE 118-bus, 123-node, and 39-bus test systems, we conduct discrete-event simulations comparing PQC-only, QKD-only, and Hybrid architectures across multiple topologies and service profiles. Results show that Hybrid architectures dominated by QKD significantly reduce key-outage probability and SLA shortfalls, achieving near-unit availability for real-time and confidentiality-critical services. Economic analyses reveal clear breakeven zones where QKD-enhanced deployments become cost-effective, primarily in metropolitan and distribution-level networks under moderate optical loss and buffer sizing. The proposed framework provides a reproducible, risk-aware decision tool for guiding large-scale, economically justified QKD adoption in future resilient power-system infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Dynamic Modeling and Constraint-Aware Air Supply Control for Localized Water Management in Automotive Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a predictive constraint-aware control scheme is formulated within the Command Governor (CG) framework for localized hydration management of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell system. First, a comprehensive nonlinear dynamic model of the fuel cell system is presented which includes a pseudo 2-dimensional (P2D) model of the stack, reactant supply and cooling subsystems. The model captures the couplings among the various subsystems and serves as the basis for designing output feedback controllers to track the optimal set-points of the air supply and cooling systems for power optimization. The closed-loop nonlinear model is then used to analyze the dynamic behavior of membrane hydration near the anode inlet, the driest region of the membrane in a counter-flow configuration, under various operating conditions. A reduced-order linearized model is then derived to approximate hydration behavior with sufficient fidelity for constraint enforcement. This model is used within the CG framework to adjust the air supply set-points when necessary to prevent membrane dry-out. The effectiveness of the proposed approach in maintaining local membrane hydration while closely tracking the requested net power is demonstrated through realistic drive-cycle simulations.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Dynamic Simulation of a Hybrid Wind-Wave System on a Hexagonal Semi-Submersible Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offshore renewable energy systems offer promising solutions for sustainable power generation, yet most existing platforms harvest either wind or wave energy in isolation. This study presents a hybrid floating offshore platform that integrates a wind turbine with three oscillating surge wave energy converters (WECs) into a hexagonal semi-submersible structure. In this configuration, the flaps are integrated with the platform geometry to provide both energy extraction and hydrodynamic stability. A modeling and simulation framework was developed using WEC-Sim and benchmarked against the NREL 5 MW semisubmersible reference. Metacentric height analysis confirmed hydrostatic stability across a range of prescribed flap angles. Sensitivity analysis of twelve geometric variables identified flap dimensions and tower length as dominant drivers of stability, energy capture, and tower stress. Time-domain simulations revealed dependence on wave incidence angle, with variations in flap power sharing, capture width ratio (CWR), and platform response. The feasibility of using flap sweeps to modulate pitch motion was also demonstrated. Annual energy production (AEP) estimates based on site-specific data indicate 16.86 GWh from wind and 3.65 GWh from wave energy, with WECs contributing about 18% of the total. These results highlight the potential of integrated wind-wave platforms and point toward future studies on structural modeling and advanced control.</description>

      <title>TranSimHub:A Unified Air-Ground Simulation Platform for Multi-Modal Perception and Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air-ground collaborative intelligence is becoming a key approach for next-generation urban intelligent transportation management, where aerial and ground systems work together on perception, communication, and decision-making. However, the lack of a unified multi-modal simulation environment has limited progress in studying cross-domain perception, coordination under communication constraints, and joint decision optimization. To address this gap, we present TranSimHub, a unified simulation platform for air-ground collaborative intelligence. TranSimHub offers synchronized multi-view rendering across RGB, depth, and semantic segmentation modalities, ensuring consistent perception between aerial and ground viewpoints. It also supports information exchange between the two domains and includes a causal scene editor that enables controllable scenario creation and counterfactual analysis under diverse conditions such as different weather, emergency events, and dynamic obstacles. We release TranSimHub as an open-source platform that supports end-to-end research on perception, fusion, and control across realistic air and ground traffic scenes. Our code is available at https://github.com/Traffic-Alpha/TranSimHub.</description>

      <title>A Tsetlin Machine Image Classification Accelerator on a Flexible Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the first implementation of digital Tsetlin Machines (TMs) on flexible integrated circuit (FlexIC) using Pragmatic's 600nm IGZO-based FlexIC technology. TMs, known for their energy efficiency, interpretability, and suitability for edge computing, have previously been limited by the rigidity of conventional silicon-based chips. We develop two TM inference models as FlexICs: one achieving 98.5% accuracy using 6800 NAND2 equivalent logic gates with an area of 8X8 mm2, and a second more compact version achieving slightly lower prediction accuracy of 93% but using only 1420 NAND2 equivalent gates with an area of 4X4 mm2, both of which are custom-designed for an 8X8-pixel handwritten digit recognition dataset. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of deploying flexible TM inference engines into wearable healthcare and edge computing applications.</description>

      <title>Hypergame-based Cognition Modeling and Intention Interpretation for Human-Driven Vehicles in Connected Mixed Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the practical implementation of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), the traffic system is expected to remain a mix of CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) for the foreseeable future. To enhance safety and traffic efficiency, the trajectory planning strategies of CAVs must account for the influence of HVs, necessitating accurate HV trajectory prediction. Current research often assumes that human drivers have perfect knowledge of all vehicles' objectives, an unrealistic premise. This paper bridges the gap by leveraging hypergame theory to account for cognitive and perception limitations in HVs. We model human bounded rationality without assuming them to be merely passive followers and propose a hierarchical cognition modeling framework that captures cognitive relationships among vehicles. We further analyze the cognitive stability of the system, proving that the strategy profile where all vehicles adopt cognitively equilibrium strategies constitutes a hyper Nash equilibrium when CAVs accurately learn HV parameters. To achieve this, we develop an inverse learning algorithm for distributed intention interpretation via vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, which extends the framework to both offline and online scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a distributed trajectory prediction and planning approach for CAVs, leveraging the learned parameters in real time. Simulations in highway lane-changing scenarios demonstrate the proposed method's accuracy in parameter learning, robustness to noisy trajectory observations, and safety in HV trajectory prediction. The results validate the effectiveness of our method in both offline and online implementations.</description>

      <title>Observer Design over Hypercomplex Quaternions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop observer design over hypercomplex quaternions in a characteristic-polynomial-free framework. Using the standard right-module convention, we derive a right observable companion form and its companion polynomial that encodes error dynamics via right-eigenvalue similarity classes. The design mirrors the real/complex case - coefficient updates in companion coordinates, followed by a similarity back - yet avoids determinants, characteristic/minimal polynomials, and Cayley-Hamilton identities that do not transfer to quaternions. We also give an Ackermann-type construction for the important case of closed-loop companion polynomials with real coefficients, ensuring similarity-equivariant evaluation. The results yield simple recipes for full-order observers directly over quaternions, clarify the role of right spectra and their similarity classes, and pinpoint when classical one-shot formulas remain valid. Numerical examples illustrate the method and advantages over vectorized or complex-adjoint surrogates.</description>

      <title>A Predictive Flexibility Aggregation Method for Low Voltage Distribution System Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a predictive control strategy to manage low-voltage distribution systems. The proposed approach relies on an aggregate of the flexibility at the residential unit level into a three-dimensional chart that represents the injected active and reactive power, and the flexibility cost. First, this method solves a multiparametric optimization problem offline at the residential unit level to aggregate the flexibility of the assets. Then, a semi-explicit model predictive control problem is solved to account for forecasts. By combining the results of these problems with measurements, the method generates the desired flexibility chart. The proposed approach is compatible with realtime control requirements, as heavy computations are performed offline locally, making it naturally parallelizable. By linking realtime flexibility assessment with energy scheduling, our approach enables efficient, low-cost, and privacy-preserving management of low-voltage distribution systems. We validate this method on a low-voltage network of 5 buses by comparing it with an ideal technique.</description>

      <title>Cross-border offshore hydrogen trade and carbon mitigation for Europe's net zero transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: European countries are ambitious in both the net-zero transition and offshore energy resource development. The Irish and UK governments announced their commitments to offshore wind capacities - 37 and 125 GW, respectively, in 2050, more than two times higher than their projected power demands. While other continental countries, such as Germany, are calling for cleaner fuel resources. Exporting surplus offshore green hydrogen and bridging supply and demand could be pivotal in carbon emission mitigation for Europe. Yet, the potentials of these Island countries, are usually underestimated. This paper developed a bottom-up method to investigate the role of offshore hydrogen from Ireland and the UK in the decarbonisation of the entire Europe. We evaluate the future hydrogen/ammonia trading and the contributions of each country in carbon emission mitigation, considering their relative cost-competitiveness in offshore hydrogen production, domestic hourly power and gas system operation, and international shipping costs. Results indicate that the offshore green hydrogen could reduce 175.16 Mt/year of carbon dioxide emissions in Europe. The UK will be the largest hydrogen supplier from 2030 to 2040, while surpassed by Ireland in 2050, with 161 TWh of hydrogen exports to France and Spain. The offshore green hydrogen can contribute to 175.16 Mt of annual carbon dioxide emission reductions in total. This general flow of hydrogen from the West to the East not only facilitates Europe's net-zero progress, but also reshapes the energy supply structure and helps to ensure energy security across the European continent.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Underwater Noise from Offshore Wind Turbines via Individual Pitch Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a pitch control strategy to mitigate the underwater acoustic footprint of offshore wind turbines, a measure that will soon become necessary to minimize impacts on marine life, which rely on sound for communication, navigation, and survival. First, we quantify the underwater acoustic signature of blade-generated aerodynamic noise from three reference turbines, the NREL 5 MW, DTU 10 MW, and IEA 22 MW, using coupling blade element momentum and coupled air-water acoustic propagation modeling. Second, we propose and implement an open-loop individual pitch control (IPC) strategy that modulates the pitch of the blade at the blade passing frequency to attenuate the overall sound pressure level (OSPL) and the amplitude modulation (AM) of the transmitted noise. Third, we benchmark IPC performance against conventional pitch schemes. The results indicate that up to 5 dB reductions in OSPL and a decrease in AM depth 20% can be achieved with a pitch variation of $\Delta\theta\approx 5^\circ$, with small losses (5-10%) in energy capture. These findings highlight a previously underappreciated noise pathway and demonstrate that targeted blade-pitch modulation can mitigate its impact.</description>

      <title>Sugar Shack 4.0: Practical Demonstration of an IIoT-Based Event-Driven Automation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a practical alternative to programmable-logic-controller-centric automation by implementing an event-driven architecture built with industrial Internet of Things tools. A layered design on a local edge server (i) abstracts actuators, (ii) enforces mutual exclusion of shared physical resources through an interlock with priority queueing, (iii) composes deterministic singular operations, and (iv) orchestrates complete workflows as state machines in Node-RED, with communication over MQTT. The device layer uses low-cost ESP32-based gateways to interface sensors and actuators, while all automation logic is offloaded to the server side. As part of a larger project involving the first scientifically-documented integration of Industry 4.0 technologies in a maple syrup boiling center, this work demonstrates the deployment of the proposed system as a case-study. Evaluation over an entire production season shows median message time of flight around one tenth of a second, command issuance-to-motion latencies of about two to three seconds, and command completion near six seconds dominated by actuator mechanics; operation runtimes span tens of seconds to minutes. These results indicate that network and orchestration overheads are negligible relative to process dynamics, enabling modular, distributed control without compromising determinism or fault isolation. The approach reduces material and integration effort, supports portable containerized deployment, and naturally enables an edge/cloud split in which persistence and analytics are offloaded while automation remains at the edge.</description>

      <title>Integrating Conductor Health into Dynamic Line Rating and Unit Commitment under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic line rating (DLR) enables greater utilization of existing transmission lines by leveraging real-time weather data. However, the elevated temperature operation (ETO) of conductors under DLR is often overlooked, despite its long-term impact on conductor health. This paper addresses this issue by 1) quantifying depreciation costs associated with ETO and 2) proposing a Conductor Health-Aware Unit Commitment (CHA-UC) that internalizes these costs in operational decisions. The CHA-UC incorporates a robust linear approximation of conductor temperature and integration of expected depreciation costs due to hourly ETO into the objective function. Case studies on the Texas 123-bus backbone test system using NOAA weather data demonstrate that the proposed CHA-UC model reduces the total cost by 0.8% and renewable curtailment by 84%compared to static line rating (SLR), while conventional DLR operation without risk consideration resulted in higher costs due to excessive ETO. Further analysis of the commitment decisions and the line temperature statistics confirms that the CHA-UC achieves safer line flows by shifting generator commitments. Finally, we examine the emergent correlation between wind generation and DLR forecast errors, and show that CHA-UC adaptively manages this effect by relaxing flows for risk-hedging conditions while tightening flows for risk-amplifying ones.</description>

      <title>Braking within Barriers: Constructive Safety-Critical Control for Input-Constrained Vehicles via the Backup Set Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a safety-critical control framework to maintain bounded lateral motions for vehicles braking on asymmetric surfaces. We synthesize a brake controller that assists drivers and guarantees safety against excessive lateral motions (i.e., prevents the vehicle from spinning out) while minimizing the stopping distance. We address this safety-critical control problem in the presence of input constraints, since braking forces are limited by the available friction on the road. We use backup control barrier functions for safe control design. As this approach requires the construction of a backup set and a backup controller, we propose a novel, systematic method to creating valid backup set-backup controller pairs based on feedback linearization and continuous-time Lyapunov equations. We use simple examples to demonstrate our proposed safety-critical control method. Finally, we implement our approach on a four-wheel vehicle model for braking on asymmetric surfaces and present simulation results.</description>

      <title>Bio-inspired Microgrid Management based on Brain's Sensorimotor Gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microgrids are emerging as key enablers of resilient, sustainable, and intelligent power systems, but they continue to face challenges in dynamic disturbance handling, protection coordination, and uncertainty. Recent efforts have explored Brain Emotional Learning (BEL) controllers as bio-inspired solutions for microgrid control. Building on this growing trajectory, this article introduces a new paradigm for Neuro-Microgrids, inspired by the brain's sensorimotor gating mechanisms, specifically the Prepulse Inhibition (PPI) and Prepulse Facilitation (PPF). Sensorimotor gating offers a biological model for selectively suppressing or amplifying responses depending on contextual relevance. By mapping these principles onto the hierarchical control architecture of microgrids, we propose a Sensorimotor Gating-Inspired Neuro-Microgrid (SG-NMG) framework. In this architecture, PPI-like control decisions correspond to protective damping in primary and secondary management of microgrids, whereas PPF-like decisions correspond to adaptive amplification of corrective control actions. The framework is presented through analytical workflow design, neuro-circuitry analogies, and integration with machine learning methods. Finally, open challenges and research directions are outlined, including the mathematical modeling of gating, digital twin validation, and cross-disciplinary collaboration between neuroscience and industrial power systems. The resulting paradigm highlights sensorimotor gating as a promising framework for designing self-protective, adaptive, and resilient microgrids.</description>

      <title>Extending Load Forecasting from Zonal Aggregates to Individual Nodes for Transmission System Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reliability of local power grid infrastructure is challenged by sustainable energy developments increasing electric load uncertainty. Transmission System Operators (TSOs) need load forecasts of higher spatial resolution, extending current forecasting operations from zonal aggregates to individual nodes. However, nodal loads are less accurate to forecast and require a large number of individual forecasts, which are hard to manage for the human experts assessing risks in the control room's daily operations (operator). In collaboration with a TSO, we design a multi-level system that meets the needs of operators for hourly day-ahead load forecasting. Utilizing a uniquely extensive dataset of zonal and nodal net loads, we experimentally evaluate our system components. First, we develop an interpretable and scalable forecasting model that allows for TSOs to gradually extend zonal operations to include nodal forecasts. Second, we evaluate solutions to address the heterogeneity and volatility of nodal load, subject to a trade-off. Third, our system is manageable with a fully parallelized single-model forecasting workflow. Our results show accuracy and interpretability improvements for zonal forecasts, and substantial improvements for nodal forecasts. In practice, our multi-level forecasting system allows operators to adjust forecasts with unprecedented confidence and accuracy, and to diagnose otherwise opaque errors precisely.</description>

      <title>Two Roads to Koopman Operator Theory for Control: Infinite Input Sequences and Operator Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator, originally defined for dynamical systems without input, has inspired many applications in control. Yet, the theoretical foundations underpinning this progress in control remain underdeveloped. This paper investigates the theoretical structure and connections between two extensions of Koopman theory to control: (i) Koopman operator via infinite input sequences and (ii) the Koopman control family. Although these frameworks encode system information in fundamentally different ways, we show that under certain conditions on the function spaces they operate on, they are equivalent. The equivalence is both in terms of the actions of the Koopman-based formulations in each framework as well as the function values on the system trajectories. Our analysis provides constructive tools to translate between the frameworks, offering a unified perspective for Koopman methods in control.</description>

      <title>An Iterative Problem-Driven Scenario Reduction Framework for Stochastic Optimization with Conditional Value-at-Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scenario reduction (SR) alleviates the computational complexity of scenario-based stochastic optimization with conditional value-at-risk (SBSO-CVaR) by identifying representative scenarios to depict the underlying uncertainty and tail risks. Existing distribution-driven SR methods emphasize statistical similarity but often exclude extreme scenarios, leading to weak tail-risk awareness and insufficient problem-specific representativeness. Instead, this paper proposes an iterative problem-driven scenario reduction framework. Specifically, we integrate the SBSO-CVaR problem structure into SR process and project the original scenario set from the distribution space onto the problem space. Subsequently, to minimize the SR optimality gap with acceptable computation complexity, we propose a tractable iterative problem-driven scenario reduction (IPDSR) method that selects representative scenarios that best approximate the optimality distribution of the original scenario set while preserving tail risks. Furthermore, the iteration process is rendered as a mixed-integer program to enable scenario partitioning and representative scenarios selection. And ex-post problem-driven evaluation indices are proposed to evaluate the SR performance. Numerical experiments show IPDSR significantly outperforms existing SR methods by achieving an optimality gap of less than 1% within an acceptable computation time.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Cost-Map-based Path Planning in Partially Unknown Environments with Movable Obstacles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable navigation in disaster-response and other unstructured indoor settings requires robots not only to avoid obstacles but also to recognise when those obstacles can be pushed aside. We present an adaptive, LiDAR and odometry-based path-planning framework that embeds this capability into the ROS2 Nav2 stack. A new Movable Obstacles Layer labels all LiDAR returns missing from a prior static map as tentatively movable and assigns a reduced traversal cost. A companion Slow-Pose Progress Checker monitors the ratio of commanded to actual velocity; when the robot slows appreciably, the local cost is raised from light to heavy, and on a stall to lethal, prompting the global planner to back out and re-route. Gazebo evaluations on a Scout Mini, spanning isolated objects and cluttered corridors, show higher goal-reach rates and fewer deadlocks than a no-layer baseline, with traversal times broadly comparable. Because the method relies only on planar scans and CPU-level computation, it suits resource-constrained search and rescue robots and integrates into heterogeneous platforms with minimal engineering. Overall, the results indicate that interaction-aware cost maps are a lightweight, ROS2-native extension for navigating among potentially movable obstacles in unstructured settings. The full implementation will be released as open source athttps://costmap-namo.github.io.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State preparation is a cornerstone of quantum technologies, underpinning applications in computation, communication, and sensing. Its importance becomes even more pronounced in non-Markovian open quantum systems, where environmental memory and model uncertainties pose significant challenges to achieving high-fidelity control. Invariant-based inverse engineering provides a principled framework for synthesizing analytic control fields, yet existing parameterizations often lead to experimentally infeasible, singular pulses and are limited to simplified noise models such as those of Lindblad form. Here, we introduce a generalized invariant-based protocol for single-qubit state preparation under arbitrary noise conditions. The control proceeds in two-stages: first, we construct a family of bounded pulses that achieve perfect state preparation in a closed system; second, we identify the optimal member of this family that minimizes the effect of noise. The framework accommodates both (i) characterized noise, enabling noise-aware control synthesis, and (ii) uncharacterized noise, where a noise-agnostic variant preserves robustness without requiring a master-equation description. Numerical simulations demonstrate high-fidelity state preparation across diverse targets while producing smooth, hardware-feasible control fields. This singularity-free framework extends invariant-based control to realistic open-system regimes, providing a versatile route toward robust quantum state engineering on NISQ hardware and other platforms exhibiting non-Markovian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Recursive Inference for Heterogeneous Multi-Output GP State-Space Models with Arbitrary Moment Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate learning of system dynamics is becoming increasingly crucial for advanced control and decision-making in engineering. However, real-world systems often exhibit multiple channels and highly nonlinear transition dynamics, challenging traditional modeling methods. To enable online learning for these systems, this paper formulates the system as Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) and develops a recursive learning method. The main contributions are threefold. First, a heterogeneous multi-output kernel is designed, allowing each output dimension to adopt distinct kernel types, hyperparameters, and input variables, improving expressiveness in multi-dimensional dynamics learning. Second, an inducing-point management algorithm enhances computational efficiency through independent selection and pruning for each output dimension. Third, a unified recursive inference framework for GPSSMs is derived, supporting general moment matching approaches, including the extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and assumed density filtering (ADF), enabling accurate learning under strong nonlinearity and significant noise. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed method matches the accuracy of SOTA offline GPSSMs with only 1/100 of the runtime, and surpasses SOTA online GPSSMs by around 70% in accuracy under heavy noise while using only 1/20 of the runtime.</description>

      <title>Balancing Fairness and Performance in Multi-User Spark Workloads with Dynamic Scheduling (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Apache Spark is a widely adopted framework for large-scale data processing. However, in industrial analytics environments, Spark's built-in schedulers, such as FIFO and fair scheduling, struggle to maintain both user-level fairness and low mean response time, particularly in long-running shared applications. Existing solutions typically focus on job-level fairness which unintentionally favors users who submit more jobs. Although Spark offers a built-in fair scheduler, it lacks adaptability to dynamic user workloads and may degrade overall job performance. We present the User Weighted Fair Queuing (UWFQ) scheduler, designed to minimize job response times while ensuring equitable resource distribution across users and their respective jobs. UWFQ simulates a virtual fair queuing system and schedules jobs based on their estimated finish times under a bounded fairness model. To further address task skew and reduce priority inversions, which are common in Spark workloads, we introduce runtime partitioning, a method that dynamically refines task granularity based on expected runtime. We implement UWFQ within the Spark framework and evaluate its performance using multi-user synthetic workloads and Google cluster traces. We show that UWFQ reduces the average response time of small jobs by up to 74% compared to existing built-in Spark schedulers and to state-of-the-art fair scheduling algorithms.</description>

After the successful achievement of its first MA-class plasma, the installation of several additional sub-systems, including a set of non-axisymmetric Error Field Correction Coils (EFCC), is ongoing. Optimization of future JT-60SA plasma scenarios will critically depend on the correct use of EFCC, including careful fulfillment of system specifications. In addition to that, preparation and risk mitigation of early ITER operations will greatly benefit from the experience gained by early EFCC application to JT-60SA experiments, in particular to optimize error field detection and control strategies. In this work, EFCC application in JT-60SA Initial Research Phase I perspective scenarios is modeled including plasma response. Impact of (Resonant) Magnetic Perturbations on the different plasma scenarios is assessed for both core and pedestal regions by the linear resistive MHD code MARS-F. The dominant core response to EFs is discussed case by case and compared to mode locking thresholds from literature. Typical current/voltage amplitudes and wave-forms are then compared to EFCC specifications in order to assess a safe operational space.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Contrastive Sensor Fusion for Multimodal Fault Diagnosis in Induction Motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable induction motor (IM) fault diagnosis is vital for industrial safety and operational continuity, mitigating costly unplanned downtime. Conventional approaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships, are constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance degradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified framework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is the first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology specifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint modelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation beyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis of bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for consolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world benchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain generalisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for real-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each component. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset longevity in industrial environments.</description>

      <title>Active Inverse Methods in Stackelberg Games with Bounded Rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse game theory is utilized to infer the cost functions of all players based on game outcomes. However, existing inverse game theory methods do not consider the learner as an active participant in the game, which could significantly enhance the learning process. In this paper, we extend inverse game theory to active inverse methods. For Stackelberg games with bounded rationality, the leader, acting as a learner, actively chooses actions to better understand the follower's cost functions. First, we develop a method of active learning by leveraging Fisher information to maximize information gain about the unknown parameters and prove the consistency and asymptotic normality. Additionally, when leaders consider its cost, we develop a method of active inverse game to balance exploration and exploitation, and prove the consistency and asymptotic Stackelberg equilibrium with quadratic cost functions. Finally, we verify the properties of these methods through simulations in the quadratic case and demonstrate that the active inverse game method can achieve Stackelberg equilibrium more quickly through active exploration.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Legged Locomotion via Online Learning for Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an algorithm for adaptive legged locomotion via online learning and model predictive control. The algorithm is composed of two interacting modules: model predictive control (MPC) and online learning of residual dynamics. The residual dynamics can represent modeling errors and external disturbances. We are motivated by the future of autonomy where quadrupeds will autonomously perform complex tasks despite real-world unknown uncertainty, such as unknown payload and uneven terrains. The algorithm uses random Fourier features to approximate the residual dynamics in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Then, it employs MPC based on the current learned model of the residual dynamics. The model is updated online in a self-supervised manner using least squares based on the data collected while controlling the quadruped. The algorithm enjoys sublinear \textit{dynamic regret}, defined as the suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the residual dynamics. We validate our algorithm in Gazebo and MuJoCo simulations, where the quadruped aims to track reference trajectories. The Gazebo simulations include constant unknown external forces up to $12\boldsymbol{g}$, where $\boldsymbol{g}$ is the gravity vector, in flat terrain, slope terrain with $20\degree$ inclination, and rough terrain with $0.25m$ height variation. The MuJoCo simulations include time-varying unknown disturbances with payload up to $8~kg$ and time-varying ground friction coefficients in flat terrain.</description>

      <title>Freehand 3D Ultrasound Imaging: Sim-in-the-Loop Probe Pose Optimization via Visual Servoing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Freehand 3D ultrasound (US) imaging using conventional 2D probes offers flexibility and accessibility for diverse clinical applications but faces challenges in accurate probe pose estimation. Traditional methods depend on costly tracking systems, while neural network-based methods struggle with image noise and error accumulation, compromising reconstruction precision. We propose a cost-effective and versatile solution that leverages lightweight cameras and visual servoing in simulated environments for precise 3D US imaging. These cameras capture visual feedback from a textured planar workspace. To counter occlusions and lighting issues, we introduce an image restoration method that reconstructs occluded regions by matching surrounding texture patterns. For pose estimation, we develop a simulation-in-the-loop approach, which replicates the system setup in simulation and iteratively minimizes pose errors between simulated and real-world observations. A visual servoing controller refines the alignment of camera views, improving translational estimation by optimizing image alignment. Validations on a soft vascular phantom, a 3D-printed conical model, and a human arm demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our approach, with Hausdorff distances to the reference reconstructions of 0.359 mm, 1.171 mm, and 0.858 mm, respectively. These results confirm the method's potential for reliable freehand 3D US reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Grid-Aware Real-Time Dispatch of Microgrid with Generalized Energy Storage: A Prediction-Free Online Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel prediction-free two-stage coordinated dispatch framework for the real-time dispatch of grid-connected microgrid with generalized energy storages (GES). The proposed framework explicitly addresses grid awareness, non-anticipativity constraints, and the time-coupling characteristics of GES, providing microgrid operators with a near-optimal, reliable, and adaptable dispatch tool. In the offline stage, we generate the hindsight state-of-charge (SoC) trajectories of GES by solving the multi-period economic dispatch with historical scenarios. Subsequently, leveraging this historical information (SoC trajectories, net loads, and electricity prices), we synthesize and dynamically update online references for both SoC and opportunity cost through kernel regression. We propose an adaptive Lagrange multiplier-based online convex optimization algorithm, which innovatively incorporates reference tracking for global vision and expert-tracking for step-size updates. We provide theoretical proof to show that the proposed OCO algorithm achieves a sublinear bound of both dynamic regret and time-varying hard constraint violation. Numerical studies using ground-truth data from the Australian Energy Market Operator demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing operational costs by 5.0-6.2% and voltage violations by 0.8-9.1%. These improvements mainly result from mitigating myopia by reference tracking and the adaptive capability provided by dynamically updated references and adaptive Lagrange multipliers. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates the robustness, computational efficiency, and scalability of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Linear MPC for Quadrotors on SE(3): An Analytical Koopman-based Realization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter presents an analytical linear parameter-varying (LPV) representation of quadrotor dynamics utilizing Koopman theory, facilitating computationally efficient linear model predictive control (LMPC) for real-time trajectory tracking. By leveraging carefully designed Koopman observables, the proposed approach enables a compact lifted-space evolution that mitigates the curse of dimensionality while preserving the nonlinear characteristics of the system. Although model predictive control (MPC) is a powerful strategy for quadrotor control, it faces a trade-off between the high computational cost of nonlinear MPC (NMPC) and the reduced accuracy of LMPC. To address this gap, we introduce KQ-LMPC (Koopman Quasilinear LPV MPC), which leverages the Koopman-lifted LPV formulation to enforce constraints, ensure lower computational burden and real-time feasibility, and deliver tracking performance comparable to NMPC. Experimental validation confirms the effectiveness of the framework in reasonably agile flight. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimentally validated LMPC for quadrotors that employs analytically derived Koopman observables without requiring training data.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Learning Framework for Solving Non-Markovian Optimal Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04649v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integer-order calculus often falls short in capturing the long-range dependencies and memory effects found in many real-world processes. Fractional calculus addresses these gaps via fractional-order integrals and derivatives, but fractional-order dynamical systems pose substantial challenges in system identification and optimal control due to the lack of standard control methodologies. In this paper, we theoretically derive the optimal control via linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for fractional-order linear time-invariant (FOLTI) systems and develop an end-to-end deep learning framework based on this theoretical foundation. Our approach establishes a rigorous mathematical model, derives analytical solutions, and incorporates deep learning to achieve data-driven optimal control of FOLTI systems. Our key contributions include: (i) proposing an innovative system identification method control strategy for FOLTI systems, (ii) developing the first end-to-end data-driven learning framework, Fractional-Order Learning for Optimal Control (FOLOC), that learns control policies from observed trajectories, and (iii) deriving a theoretical analysis of sample complexity to quantify the number of samples required for accurate optimal control in complex real-world problems. Experimental results indicate that our method accurately approximates fractional-order system behaviors without relying on Gaussian noise assumptions, pointing to promising avenues for advanced optimal control.</description>

Abstract: We propose a stochastic Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that ensures closed-loop chance constraint satisfaction for linear systems with general sub-Gaussian process and measurement noise. By considering sub-Gaussian noise, we can provide guarantees for a large class of distributions, including time-varying distributions. Specifically, we first provide a new characterization of sub-Gaussian random vectors using matrix variance proxy, which can more accurately represent the predicted state distribution. We then derive tail bounds under linear propagation for the new characterization, enabling tractable computation of probabilistic reachable sets of linear systems. Lastly, we utilize these probabilistic reachable sets to formulate a stochastic MPC scheme that provides closed-loop guarantees for general sub-Gaussian noise. We further demonstrate our approach in simulations, including a challenging task of surgical planning from image observations.</description>

      <title>Multi-stage model predictive control for slug flow crystallizers using uncertainty-aware surrogate models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel dynamic model for slug flow crystallizers that addresses the challenges of spatial distribution without backmixing or diffusion, potentially enabling advanced model-based control. The developed model can accurately describe the main characteristics of slug flow crystallizers, including slug-to-slug variability but leads to a high computational complexity due to the consideration of partial differential equations and population balance equations. For that reason, the model cannot be directly used for process optimization and control. To solve this challenge, we propose two different approaches, conformalized quantile regression and Bayesian last layer neural networks, to develop surrogate models with uncertainty quantification capabilities. These surrogates output a prediction of the system states together with an uncertainty of these predictions to account for process variability and model uncertainty. We use the uncertainty of the predictions to formulate a robust model predictive control approach, enabling robust real-time advanced control of a slug flow crystallizer.</description>

      <title>A Set-Theoretic Robust Control Approach for Linear Quadratic Games with Unknown Counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring robust decision-making in multi-agent systems is challenging when agents have distinct, possibly conflicting objectives and lack full knowledge of each other's strategies. This is apparent in safety-critical applications such as human-robot interaction and assisted driving, where uncertainty arises not only from unknown adversary strategies but also from external disturbances. To address this, the paper proposes a robust adaptive control approach based on linear quadratic differential games. Our method allows a controlled agent to iteratively refine its belief about the adversary strategy and disturbances using a set-membership approach, while simultaneously adapting its policy to guarantee robustness against the uncertain adversary policy and improve performance over time. We formally derive theoretical guarantees on the robustness of the proposed control scheme and its convergence to $\epsilon$-Nash strategies. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in a numerical simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traffic signal control (TSC) is a core challenge in urban mobility, where real-time decisions must balance efficiency and safety. Existing methods - ranging from rule-based heuristics to reinforcement learning (RL) - often struggle to generalize to complex, dynamic, and safety-critical scenarios. We introduce VLMLight, a novel TSC framework that integrates vision-language meta-control with dual-branch reasoning. At the core of VLMLight is the first image-based traffic simulator that enables multi-view visual perception at intersections, allowing policies to reason over rich cues such as vehicle type, motion, and spatial density. A large language model (LLM) serves as a safety-prioritized meta-controller, selecting between a fast RL policy for routine traffic and a structured reasoning branch for critical cases. In the latter, multiple LLM agents collaborate to assess traffic phases, prioritize emergency vehicles, and verify rule compliance. Experiments show that VLMLight reduces waiting times for emergency vehicles by up to 65% over RL-only systems, while preserving real-time performance in standard conditions with less than 1% degradation. VLMLight offers a scalable, interpretable, and safety-aware solution for next-generation traffic signal control.</description>

Abstract: Wearable exoskeletons hold transformative promise for restoring mobility across diverse users with muscular weakness or other impairments. However, their translation beyond laboratory environments remains limited by sensing systems that capture movement but not underlying physiology. Here, we present a soft, lightweight smart leg sleeve that achieves anatomically aligned, layered multimodal sensing by integrating textile-based surface electromyography (sEMG) electrodes, ultrasensitive textile strain sensors, and inertial measurement units (IMUs). Each sensing modality targets a distinct physiological layer: IMUs track joint kinematics at the skeletal level, sEMG monitors muscle activation at the muscular level, and strain sensors detect skin deformation at the cutaneous level. Together, these sensors provide real-time perception to support three core objectives: controlling personalized assistance, optimizing user effort, and safeguarding against injury risks. The system is skin-conformal, mechanically compliant, and seamlessly integrated with a custom exoskeleton ($&lt;20$~g total sensor and electronics weight). We demonstrate: (1) accurate ankle joint moment estimation (RMSE = 0.13~Nm/kg), (2) real-time classification of metabolic trends (accuracy = 97.1\%), and (3) injury risk detection within 100~ms (recall = 0.96), all validated on unseen users using a leave-one-subject-out protocol. This work establishes a physiology-aligned sensing architecture that reframes exoskeleton perception from motion tracking to real-time physiological decoding, offering a pathway towards intelligent, adaptive, and personalized wearable robotics.</description>

The key contribution is a structured methodology that extends kernel-based techniques to seamlessly embed partially known physics-based models, improving parameter estimation and overall model accuracy. The proposed method enhances traditional modeling approaches by embedding a parametric model, which provides physical interpretability, with a kernel-based function, which accounts for unmodeled dynamics. The two models' components are identified from the data simultaneously, thereby minimizing a suitable cost that balances the relative importance of the physical and the black-box parts of the model. Additionally, nonlinear state smoothing is employed to address scenarios involving state-space models with not fully measurable states. Numerical simulations on an experimental benchmark system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving up to 51% reduction in simulation root mean square error compared to physics-only models and 31% performance improvement over state-of-the-art identification techniques.</description>

      <title>Through-the-Earth Magnetic Induction Communication and Networking: A Comprehensive Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic induction (MI) communication (MIC) has emerged as a promising candidate for underground communication networks due to its excellent penetration capabilities. Integration with Space-Air-Ground-Underground (SAGUI) networks in next-generation mobile communication systems requires a well-defined network architecture. A recent discovery in MIC research, MI fast fading, remains in its early stages and presents unique challenges. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on through-the-earth (TTE) MIC, covering MI applications, channel modeling, point-to-point MIC design, relay techniques, network frameworks, and emerging technologies. We compare various MIC applications to highlight TTE-specific challenges and review the principles of channel modeling, addressing both MI slow fading and MI fast fading, along with its potential impact on existing MIC theories. We conduct a fine-grained decomposition of MI channel power gain into four distinct physical parameters, and propose a novel geometric model to analyze MI fast fading. We also summarize MI relay techniques, examine crosstalk effects in relay and high-density networks, and explore key research tasks within the OSI framework for a holistic MI network protocol in SAGUI. To bridge the gaps identified, we propose a MIC framework that supports TCP/IP and Linux, enabling full implementation of existing and emerging MIC solutions. This framework empowers researchers to leverage Linux resources and deep learning platforms for accelerated development of MIC in SAGUI networks. Remaining research challenges, open issues, and promising novel techniques are further identified to advance MIC research.</description>

      <title>Decentralized non-convex optimization via bi-level SQP and ADMM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08786v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized non-convex optimization is important in many problems of practical relevance. Existing decentralized methods, however, typically either lack convergence guarantees for general non-convex problems, or they suffer from a high subproblem complexity. We present a novel bi-level SQP method, where the inner quadratic problems are solved via ADMM. A decentralized stopping criterion from inexact Newton methods allows the early termination of ADMM as an inner algorithm to improve computational efficiency. The method has local convergence guarantees for non-convex problems. Moreover, it only solves sequences of Quadratic Programs, whereas many existing algorithms solve sequences of Nonlinear Programs. The method shows competitive numerical performance for an optimal power flow problem.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Real-Time Iterations for Distributed NMPC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a Real-Time Iteration (RTI) scheme for distributed Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). The scheme transfers the well-known RTI approach, a key enabler for many industrial real-time NMPC implementations, to the setting of cooperative distributed control. At each sampling instant, one outer iteration of a bi-level decentralized Sequential Quadratic Programming (dSQP) method is applied to a centralized optimal control problem. This ensures that real-time requirements are met and it facilitates cooperation between subsystems. Combining novel dSQP convergence results with RTI stability guarantees, we prove local exponential stability under standard assumptions on the MPC design with and without terminal constraints. The proposed scheme only requires neighbor-to-neighbor communication and avoids a central coordinator. A numerical example with coupled inverted pendulums demonstrates the efficacy of the approach.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Kinematic Trajectory Control and Planning of Tracked Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tracked vehicles distribute their weight continuously over a large surface area (the tracks). This distinctive feature makes them the preferred choice for vehicles required to traverse soft and uneven terrain. From a robotics perspective, however, this flexibility comes at a cost: the complexity of modelling the system and the resulting difficulty in designing theoretically sound navigation solutions. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by proposing a framework for the navigation of tracked vehicles, built upon three key pillars. The first pillar comprises two models: a simulation model and a control-oriented model. The simulation model captures the intricate terramechanics dynamics arising from soil-track interaction and is employed to develop faithful digital twins of the system across a wide range of operating conditions. The control-oriented model is pseudo-kinematic and mathematically tractable, enabling the design of efficient and theoretically robust control schemes. The second pillar is a Lyapunov-based feedback trajectory controller that provides certifiable tracking guarantees. The third pillar is a portfolio of motion planning solutions, each offering different complexity-accuracy trade-offs. The various components of the proposed approach are validated through an extensive set of simulation and experimental data.</description>

      <title>Recursive Gaussian Process State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14679v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning dynamical models from data is not only fundamental but also holds great promise for advancing principle discovery, time-series prediction, and controller design. Among various approaches, Gaussian Process State-Space Models (GPSSMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their combination of flexibility and interpretability. However, for online learning, the field lacks an efficient method suitable for scenarios where prior information regarding data distribution and model function is limited. To address this issue, this paper proposes a recursive GPSSM method with adaptive capabilities for both operating domains and Gaussian process (GP) hyperparameters. Specifically, we first utilize first-order linearization to derive a Bayesian update equation for the joint distribution between the system state and the GP model, enabling closed-form and domain-independent learning. Second, an online selection algorithm for inducing points is developed based on informative criteria to achieve lightweight learning. Third, to support online hyperparameter optimization, we recover historical measurement information from the current filtering distribution. Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability of our method compared to state-of-the-art online GPSSM techniques.</description>

      <title>Kernel-based Koopman approximants for control: Flexible sampling, error analysis, and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven techniques for analysis, modeling, and control of complex dynamical systems are on the uptake. Koopman theory provides the theoretical foundation for the popular kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition (kEDMD). In this work, we propose a novel kEDMD scheme to approximate nonlinear control systems accompanied by an in-depth error analysis. Key features are regularization-based robustness and an adroit decomposition into micro and macro grids enabling flexible sampling. But foremost, we prove proportionality, i.e., explicit dependence on the distance to the (controlled) equilibrium, of the derived bound on the full approximation error. Leveraging this key property, we rigorously show that asymptotic stability of the data-driven surrogate (control) system implies asymptotic stability of the original (control) system and vice versa.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Lightweight Approach to Fault Diagnosis of Induction Motors in High-Dimensional Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An accurate AI-based diagnostic system for induction motors (IMs) holds the potential to enhance proactive maintenance, mitigating unplanned downtime and curbing overall maintenance costs within an industrial environment. Notably, among the prevalent faults in IMs, a Broken Rotor Bar (BRB) fault is frequently encountered. Researchers have proposed various fault diagnosis approaches using signal processing (SP), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and hybrid architectures for BRB faults. One limitation in the existing literature is the training of these architectures on relatively small datasets, risking overfitting when implementing such systems in industrial environments. This paper addresses this limitation by implementing large-scale data of BRB faults by using a transfer-learning-based lightweight DL model named ShuffleNetV2 for diagnosing one, two, three, and four BRB faults using current and vibration signal data. Spectral images for training and testing are generated using a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). The dataset comprises 57,500 images, with 47,500 used for training and 10,000 for testing. Remarkably, the ShuffleNetV2 model exhibited superior performance, in less computational cost as well as accurately classifying 98.856% of spectral images. To further enhance the visualization of harmonic sidebands resulting from broken bars, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied to current and vibration data. The paper also provides insights into the training and testing times for each model, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the proposed fault diagnosis methodology. The findings of our research provide valuable insights into the performance and efficiency of different ML and DL models, offering a foundation for the development of robust fault diagnosis systems for induction motors in industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Feedback Stackelberg-Nash equilibria in difference games with quasi-hierarchical interactions and inequality constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15019v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of two-player deterministic finite-horizon difference games with coupled inequality constraints, where each player has two types of decision variables: one involving sequential interactions and the other simultaneous interactions. We refer to this class of games as quasi-hierarchical dynamic games and define a solution concept called the feedback Stackelberg-Nash (FSN) equilibrium. Under separability assumption on cost functions, we provide a recursive formulation of the FSN solution using dynamic programming. We show that the FSN solution can be derived from the parametric feedback Stackelberg solution of an associated unconstrained game involving only sequential interactions, with a specific choice of the parameters that satisfy certain implicit complementarity conditions. For the linear-quadratic case, we show that an FSN solution is obtained by reformulating these complementarity conditions as a single large-scale linear complementarity problem. Finally, we illustrate our results using a dynamic duopoly game with production constraints.</description>

      <title>RadioDiff-$k^2$: Helmholtz Equation Informed Generative Diffusion Model for Multi-Path Aware Radio Map Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel physics-informed generative learning approach, named RadioDiff-$k^2$, for accurate and efficient multipath-aware radio map (RM) construction. As future wireless communication evolves towards environment-aware paradigms, the accurate construction of RMs becomes crucial yet highly challenging. Conventional electromagnetic (EM)-based methods, such as full-wave solvers and ray-tracing approaches, exhibit substantial computational overhead and limited adaptability to dynamic scenarios. Although existing neural network (NN) approaches have efficient inferencing speed, they lack sufficient consideration of the underlying physics of EM wave propagation, limiting their effectiveness in accurately modeling critical EM singularities induced by complex multipath environments. To address these fundamental limitations, we propose a novel physics-inspired RM construction method guided explicitly by the Helmholtz equation, which inherently governs EM wave propagation. Specifically, based on the analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs), we theoretically establish a direct correspondence between EM singularities, which correspond to the critical spatial features influencing wireless propagation, and regions defined by negative wave numbers in the Helmholtz equation. We then design an innovative dual diffusion model (DM)-based large artificial intelligence framework comprising one DM dedicated to accurately inferring EM singularities and another DM responsible for reconstructing the complete RM using these singularities along with environmental contextual information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RadioDiff-$k^2$ framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both image-level RM construction and localization tasks, while maintaining inference latency within a few hundred milliseconds.</description>

      <title>Contact-Aware Safety in Soft Robots Using High-Order Control Barrier and Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03841v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robots operating alongside people, particularly in sensitive scenarios such as aiding the elderly with daily tasks or collaborating with workers in manufacturing, must guarantee safety and cultivate user trust. Continuum soft manipulators promise safety through material compliance, but as designs evolve for greater precision, payload capacity, and speed, and increasingly incorporate rigid elements, their injury risk resurfaces. In this letter, we introduce a comprehensive High-Order Control Barrier Function (HOCBF) + High-Order Control Lyapunov Function (HOCLF) framework that enforces strict contact force limits across the entire soft-robot body during environmental interactions. Our approach combines a differentiable Piecewise Cosserat-Segment (PCS) dynamics model with a convex-polygon distance approximation metric, named Differentiable Conservative Separating Axis Theorem (DCSAT), based on the soft robot geometry to enable real-time, whole-body collision detection, resolution, and enforcement of the safety constraints. By embedding HOCBFs into our optimization routine, we guarantee safety, allowing, for instance, safe navigation in operational space under HOCLF-driven motion objectives. Extensive planar simulations demonstrate that our method maintains safety-bounded contacts while achieving precise shape and task-space regulation. This work thus lays a foundation for the deployment of soft robots in human-centric environments with provable safety and performance.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Cyber Resilience via a Co-Evolutionary Arms Race within a Fortified Digital Twin Sandbox</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The convergence of Information Technology and Operational Technology has exposed Industrial Control Systems to adaptive, intelligent adversaries that render static defenses obsolete. This paper introduces the Adversarial Resilience Co-evolution (ARC) framework, addressing the "Trinity of Trust" comprising model fidelity, data integrity, and analytical resilience. ARC establishes a co-evolutionary arms race within a Fortified Secure Digital Twin (F-SCDT), where a Deep Reinforcement Learning "Red Agent" autonomously discovers attack paths while an ensemble-based "Blue Agent" is continuously hardened against these threats. Experimental validation on the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) and Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) testbeds demonstrates superior performance in detecting novel attacks, with F1-scores improving from 0.65 to 0.89 and detection latency reduced from over 1200 seconds to 210 seconds. A comprehensive ablation study reveals that the co-evolutionary process itself contributes a 27% performance improvement. By integrating Explainable AI and proposing a Federated ARC architecture, this work presents a necessary paradigm shift toward dynamic, self-improving security for critical infrastructure.</description>

      <title>PowerChain: A Verifiable Agentic AI System for Automating Distribution Grid Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid electrification and decarbonization are increasing the complexity of distribution grid (DG) operation and planning, necessitating advanced computational analyses to ensure reliability and resilience. These analyses depend on disparate workflows comprising complex models, function calls, and data pipelines that require substantial expert knowledge and remain difficult to automate. Workforce and budget constraints further limit utilities' ability to apply such analyses at scale. To address this gap, we build an agentic system PowerChain, which is capable of autonomously performing complex grid analyses. Existing agentic AI systems are typically developed in a bottom-up manner with customized context for predefined analysis tasks; therefore, they do not generalize to tasks that the agent has never seen. In comparison, to generalize to unseen DG analysis tasks, PowerChain dynamically generates structured context by leveraging supervisory signals from self-contained power systems tools (e.g., GridLAB-D) and an optimized set of expert-annotated and verified reasoning trajectories. For complex DG tasks defined in natural language, empirical results on real utility data demonstrate that PowerChain achieves up to a 144/% improvement in performance over baselines.</description>

      <title>Wearable and Ultra-Low-Power Fusion of EMG and A-Mode US for Hand-Wrist Kinematic Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hand gesture recognition based on biosignals has shown strong potential for developing intuitive human-machine interaction strategies that closely mimic natural human behavior. In particular, sensor fusion approaches have gained attention for combining complementary information and overcoming the limitations of individual sensing modalities, thereby enabling more robust and reliable systems. Among them, the fusion of surface electromyography (EMG) and A-mode ultrasound (US) is very promising. However, prior solutions rely on power-hungry platforms unsuitable for multi-day use and are limited to discrete gesture classification. In this work, we present an ultra-low-power (sub-50 mW) system for concurrent acquisition of 8-channel EMG and 4-channel A-mode US signals, integrating two state-of-the-art platforms into fully wearable, dry-contact armbands. We propose a framework for continuous tracking of 23 degrees of freedom (DoFs), 20 for the hand and 3 for the wrist, using a kinematic glove for ground-truth labeling. Our method employs lightweight encoder-decoder architectures with multi-task learning to simultaneously estimate hand and wrist joint angles. Experimental results under realistic sensor repositioning conditions demonstrate that EMG-US fusion achieves a root mean squared error of $10.6^\circ\pm2.0^\circ$, compared to $12.0^\circ\pm1^\circ$ for EMG and $13.1^\circ\pm2.6^\circ$ for US, and a R$^2$ score of $0.61\pm0.1$, with $0.54\pm0.03$ for EMG and $0.38\pm0.20$ for US.</description>

Abstract: Rock capturing with standard excavator buckets is a challenging task typically requiring the expertise of skilled operators. Unlike soil digging, it involves manipulating large, irregular rocks in unstructured environments where complex contact interactions with granular material make model-based control impractical. Existing autonomous excavation methods focus mainly on continuous media or rely on specialized grippers, limiting their applicability to real-world construction sites. This paper introduces a fully data-driven control framework for rock capturing that eliminates the need for explicit modeling of rock or soil properties. A model-free reinforcement learning agent is trained in the AGX Dynamics simulator using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm and a guiding reward formulation. The learned policy outputs joint velocity commands directly to the boom, arm, and bucket of a CAT365 excavator model. Robustness is enhanced through extensive domain randomization of rock geometry, density, and mass, as well as the initial configurations of the bucket, rock, and goal position. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to develop and evaluate an RL-based controller for the rock capturing task. Experimental results show that the policy generalizes well to unseen rocks and varying soil conditions, achieving high success rates comparable to those of human participants while maintaining machine stability. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of learning-based excavation strategies for discrete object manipulation without requiring specialized hardware or detailed material models.</description>
