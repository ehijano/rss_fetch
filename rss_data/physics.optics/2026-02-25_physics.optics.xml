      <title>Graded anisotropic metamaterials for elastic wave mode conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient transmission of elastic waves across interfaces is central to several applications, including medical imaging, seismic isolation, and transducer design. Interfaces with abrupt changes in the material properties significantly impede wave transmission, leading to reflections. This limitation, known as impedance mismatch, becomes even more prominent for mode conversion between different wave types due to polarization mismatch. In this study, we investigate a mechanism employing two-dimensional functionally graded anisotropic metamaterials to facilitate longitudinal--shear mode conversion as waves propagate from a stiff to a compliant medium. By embedding density and anisotropic shape gradients within the functionally graded metamaterial, polarization-induced impedance mismatch is mitigated and efficient mode conversion is enabled. We use unit cell dispersion analysis to tailor the frequency range for mode conversion through gradation in the dispersion behavior and coupling between modes. Using frequency-domain finite element analysis, we demonstrate broadband mode conversion across interfaces with large stiffness contrast operating in the 1--10 kHz range. We then experimentally validate and quantify mode conversion through full-field velocity measurements on an additively manufactured specimen. We further apply the methodology to design a device capable of converting radial--tangential wave modes.</description>

      <title>DC-to-GHz Modulation In Microring Modulators Using Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystal-on-Silicon in a Foundry Photonic Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon-organic hybrid (SOH) platforms exhibit exceptional electro-optic (EO) properties, including high-speed operation, low energy consumption, and compact footprints. However, the absence of a scalable poling method for EO polymers, combined with the slow switching speeds characteristic of liquid crystals, has impeded the integration and compatibility of these materials with commercial silicon photonic foundries. On the other hand, the realization of very-large-scale photonic integrated circuits (PICs) in the native silicon photonics platform itself is impeded by the complexities associated with the wavelength and thermal stabilization for microring modulators (MRMs). This study establishes the foundation for a poling-free, CMOS-compatible SOH MRM platform by exploiting simultaneous AC phase shifts in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (FN-LCs). We present the first demonstration of an MRM coated with FN-LC, with both the RF signal and the DC bias applied to the same electrodes, taking advantage of the dual phase shift uniquely available in FN-LC. An EO bandwidth of f$_{-6dB}\approx$ 7.8 GHz is achieved \textendash~ the highest reported value for an SOH MRM to date. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate an approximately linear resonance shift across the full width at half maximum ($\approx$ 150 pm/V), with a static power efficiency of $\approx$ 4.5 nW/$\pi$ for an MRM occupying a total footprint of $\approx$ 0.084 mm$^2$ and exhibiting an on-chip optical insertion loss of $\approx$ 0.78 dB. Successful infiltration of FN-LC, selectively patterned on top of phase shifters, along with optical input/output channels established using free-form photonic wire bonds, is demonstrated in the proposed PIC.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Lattice Disorder and Collective Dipole Coupling Give Rise to Dicke Physics in Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide perovskite quantum dots exhibit cooperative optical phenomena that are absent in conventional semiconductor nanocrystals, including exciton superradiance, superabsorption, and biexciton superradiance within individual dots. Here we develop a microscopic theory that identifies the physical origin of these Dicke effects and establishes how they can be controlled by materials parameters. The central result is that cooperative emission emerges from a competition between collective coupling of optical transition dipoles and lattice-induced disorder, with the balance governed by the Raman-derived phonon spectral density and the excitonic oscillator strength. At elevated temperature, strong Fr\"ohlich coupling and glassy lattice dynamics produce dynamic disorder that suppresses dipole synchronization and yields incoherent emission. Upon cooling, lattice fluctuations freeze and cooperative coherence emerges when the collective coupling exceeds residual static disorder, defining size- and composition-dependent crossover temperatures that we map as phase diagrams. Extending the framework to biexcitons, we show that a confined biexciton constitutes a single correlated charge distribution dressed by a shared lattice configuration, enabling pathway-indistinguishable decay and cooperative radiative enhancement. The theory quantitatively accounts for observed size, composition, and temperature trends in radiative-rate constant ratios and biexciton binding energies, while explaining why full Dicke saturation is not universal. More broadly, the results establish Raman spectral weight and oscillator strength as design parameters for engineering cooperative quantum-optical behavior in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Enhancing FRET through DNA-controlled Emitters and ENZ Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to significantly enhance energy transfer processes at the nanoscale requires the simultaneous optimization of molecular scale orientation and macroscopic photonic enhancement between multiple quantum emitters. However, achieving this dual control has remained a significant experimental challenge, often limited by the stochastic arrangement of emitter assemblies and spatially non-uniform electromagnetic fields in conventional photonic platforms. In this work, we demonstrate a unified architecture that achieves this synergy by combining the structural precision of DNA nanotechnology with the unique field environment generated by epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials. Using DNA molecular beacons as programmable emitter scaffolds, we establish fixed donor-acceptor separations and emitter orientations (Atto425/Cy3.5) in two well-defined conformational states: closed hairpin (emitter separation 2 nm), and open extended (7.2 nm) configurations. These structures are then embedded in the near-field of a multilayer ENZ metamaterial substrate, which facilitates spatially uniform, enhanced electromagnetic field coupling. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements demonstrate a significant increase in FRET efficiency for DNA-programmed emitter pairs in the ENZ environment, compared to those on a glass substrate, corresponding to increased donor quenching and shortened donor lifetime. These results establish a scalable experimental pathway for engineering light-matter interactions at molecular scales, enabled by the structural precision of DNA paired with ENZ mediated redistribution of the local density of optical states (LDOS) to amplify near-filed coupling between quantum emitters, with applications in next-generation bio-sensing and quantum photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>An Optomechanical Coin Flip: Wavelength-Modulated, Erbium-Powered Rotations in a Levitated System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical levitation of nano-scale systems offers a pathway to highly sensitive rotation measurements, which are critical for advancing gyroscopic technologies. While prior studies have primarily focused on controlling rotational degrees of freedom of optically levitated particles via modulation of optical power, polarization, and ambient pressure, here we demonstrate wavelength-controlled rotation of the "coin-flip" mode in optically levitated NaYF hexagonal prisms doped with erbium by modulating the wavelength of a secondary pump beam. By switching the pump light wavelength, we precisely modulate the particle's rotation rate in a binary fashion, encoding the ASCII message "hello" in its rotational frequency. Finally, we observe long-term bimodal periodic dynamics in the rotational motion of a levitated prism that are suggestive of a Dzhanibekov (or tennis-racket)-like effect.</description>

      <title>Range Emulator: A Compact Paraxial Optical System to Emulate Long-Distance Monochromatic Laser Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emulating long-distance light propagation on a laboratory scale is essential for the ground-based testing of intersatellite optical systems. To address this challenge, we propose and analyze a novel optical system called the Range Emulator (RE) to reproduce the spatial propagation effects of a long-distance beam within a compact apparatus. Our analysis identifies that three lenses are required as the minimum number of lenses to implement the RE. Through a numerical exploration, we quantify the fundamental trade-off between system compactness and manufacturing precision. This work provides a practical framework for designing compact optical testbeds for future multi-satellite laser link technologies.</description>

      <title>Real-time Calibration-free Imaging Through Dynamic and Distinct Multimode Fibers via Spatial Harmonic Invariant Nonlinear Encoding (SHINE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimode fibers (MMFs) provide a compact, high-throughput platform for minimally invasive imaging and information transmission. However, their utility is fundamentally constrained by mode mixing, which renders image transmission spatially disrupted and sensitive to external perturbations. Current imaging methods typically rely on transmission matrix measurement or deep learning models that are fragile to fiber movement, necessitating frequent, time-consuming calibrations and re-calibrations that are easily disrupted and fail to generalize across different fiber configurations, let alone across entirely distinct fibers. Here, we propose a calibration and feedback-free MMF coherent imaging paradigm, that we termed Spatial Harmonic Invariant Nonlinear Encoding (SHINE). By leveraging the angle-dependent phase-matching conditions of second-harmonic generation, we encode spatial features into broadband spectral signatures that possess intrinsic insensitivity not only to modal scrambling but also to fiber bending, movement, as well as structural variations. This spectral representation enables a deep learning model to robustly reconstruct images in real time despite dynamic perturbations and even generalizes well to distinct MMFs without recalibration or feedback. We achieve experimentally an average Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.82 for image reconstruction tasks on Fashion-MNIST and a classification accuracy of 92.3% on HERLEV biomedical dataset. Uniquely, our method exhibits remarkable cross-fiber generalization: a model trained on a single MMF successfully reconstructs images transmitted through entirely distinct, previously unseen MMFs with a PCC of 0.74. These results establish a robust, calibration-free framework for imaging through MMFs in real time, paving the way for practical, resilient optical diagnostics that operate without distal-end feedback.</description>

      <title>Photonic timing-engineered solitons for dual-microcomb metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative microcavity solitons offer a route to integrate comb-based metrology systems on photonic chips. However, integrated solitons generally lack agile control of comb parameters, particularly pulse timing control, hindering their application in quantum-limited metrology. Here we introduce dynamical soliton trapping to enable optically timing-engineered microcombs (OTEM). By injecting an auxiliary laser to anchor one of the microcomb lines, we create a potential well to trap and steer the soliton. Thus, soliton timing can be engineered by phase modulating the injected laser. Theory and measurement reveal the fast response bandwidth of the OTEM, which enabled a soliton slew rate of 31.3 ps/$\mu$s, surpassing existing time-programmable fiber laser combs by more than two orders of magnitude. Leveraging the timing scan, we used a single OTEM for single-pixel and parallel ranging by retrieving the phase of the multi-heterodyne beat spectrum. Picometer-scale ranging precision was achieved, establishing new record for optical absolute ranging. Our work can transform timing-engineering of microcavity solitons and endow integrated dual-microcomb metrology systems with enhanced precision.</description>

      <title>True Bound States in the Continuum in Compact All-Dielectric Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs), known for their theoretically infinite quality (Q) factors and strong field localization, hold great promise for high-performance photonic devices. However, conventional true BICs typically rely on infinitely periodic structures, and their realization in finite-sized compact structures faces fundamental challenges, which severely limits device miniaturization and integration. In this work, a compact BIC design method based on optical conformal mapping is proposed, where a conventionally infinite periodic structure extended along one direction is mapped into a finite-sized annular structure. This symmetry transition, i.e., from translational to rotational, enables structural miniaturization while fully preserving the eigenvalues and BIC type of the original system. These transformations require only the adjustment of background permittivity and source distribution, without introducing extreme material parameters. As a concrete example, we show through theoretical and numerical analysis that a transformed compact all-dielectric structure, consisting of a double annular dielectric grating embedded in a gradient-index dielectric background, can support true BICs in a finite region. This work provides a simple and general strategy for achieving true BICs in compact all-dielectric structures, paving the way toward miniaturized high-Q photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Robust quantized transport from topological quasienergy winding in long-range-coupling synthetic quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantized transport is a prominent feature in topological physics, with canonical examples being the quantum Hall effect and adiabatic Thouless pump, which are based on the Chern number, a topological invariant of 2D systems. Going beyond the Chern-number-based paradigms, quantized transports can also arise from k-direction quasienergy winding unique to periodically driven (Floquet) systems, which are free of dimensionality and adiabaticity limitations. However, lattices displaying winding of their quasienergy bands require asymmetric long-range couplings that are difficult to achieve in lattices of real-space coupled sites. Here, by leveraging photonic synthetic dimensions we construct asymmetric long-range-couplings in a one-dimensional temporal quantum walk based on three coupled fiber loops. We demonstrate quantized transport arising from the winding of quasienergy bands in k direction. We show that the average group velocity of an initial wave packet is proportional to the winding number, which leads to a quantized transport displacement. To better visualize this quantized displacement, we cascade two regions with flipped nearest/long-range couplings and observe a focusing effect with a quantized spatial shift in the focusing point. We also probe the robust properties of quantized transport against obstacles and disorders. The study initiates quasienergy-winding-based topological transports, which can feature applications in precise and robust imaging and information processing.</description>

      <title>Native QR Factorization on Programmable Photonic Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a photonic native procedure for computing the QR factorization of a matrix using a programmable unitary interferometer mesh. The method configures the mesh through a sequence of local power routing steps within tunable two mode interferometric elements, while reading out the resulting upper triangular factor directly from the optical outputs. The number of physical operations grows quadratically ($O(N^2)$) with matrix size, matching the information content of a dense input and reducing runtime relative to standard digital QR routines, which scale cubically ($O(N^3)$). Beyond single factorizations, the same architecture supports iterative spectral computations by reusing the configured interferometer in a mirrored arrangement that implements the core update step of the QR eigenvalue algorithm. We also describe related optical procedures for Hessenberg reduction and Bidiagonalization, serving as compatible preprocessors for QR and SVD workflows. Finally, we analyze the impact of finite control resolution on the computed factors.</description>

      <title>Closed-loop control of a monolithically 3D nano-printed electromagnetic lens scanner with an integrated Hall sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D nano-printing through two-photon polymerization enables monolithic manufacturing of mechanical and freeform micro-optical elements with high inherent alignment accuracy. However, viscoelasticity and temperature-dependent stiffness of the photopolymer lead to hysteresis and drift, which significantly degrade open-loop position accuracy and long-term stability in quasi-static operation. Therefore, closed-loop control with integrated displacement sensing is essential for 3D nano-printed optical microsystems in practical precision positioning applications. Here, we present a closed-loop control system for a such a lens actuator that uses a commercial 3-axis Hall sensor for position tracking. A NdFeB micromagnet encircling the integrated microlens provides both the actuation force and a position-dependent sensing signal. The Hall sensor, located between an anti-Helmholtz-like coil pair that drives the scanner bidirectionally, measures the combined field due to the micro-magnet and the coil pair. Calibration-based subtraction separates the coil field and sensor offset contributions to recover the magnet field and thus the axial magnet displacement. Closed-loop operation yields a mean absolute accuracy of 0.86 um and a precision of 0.49 um over a displacement range of 150 um while eliminating viscoelastic creep, suppressing hysteresis, and minimizing temperature-induced displacement drift under coil self-heating. This sensing approach requires no additional microfabrication steps and provides a practical path toward stable and repeatable positioning for monolithically 3D nano-printed optical microsystems.</description>

      <title>Refractive Index Tuning of Terahertz Photonic Materials Based on a Stretchable Silicon Effective Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamically tunable terahertz (THz) photonics requires low-loss dielectric platforms with practical, continuous control of refractive index. Here we present a mechanically reconfigurable THz photonic material platform: a monolithic, all-silicon (Si) stretchable effective medium whose refractive index is tuned by deformation. A 200 micrometer-thick high-resistivity single-crystal Si slab was patterned into a subwavelength spiral-spring through-hole lattice, rendering bulk Si mechanically compliant while preserving its low-loss dielectric response. THz time-domain spectroscopy demonstrates high transmission below 0.6 THz and reveals a monotonic decrease in the effective refractive index under uniaxial stretching. At 12.6% elongation, the effective index decreases by 6% and 8% for polarizations perpendicular and parallel to the stretch direction, respectively, thereby demonstrating deformation-induced, controllable anisotropy without a detectable increase in extinction. This structurally engineered bulk-Si approach offers a process-compatible route to mechanically tunable, low-loss THz components for adaptive wavefront and polarization control.</description>

      <title>Novel High-Scalability Architecture for Photonic Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic computing promises ultrafast and energy-efficient artificial intelligence. However, existing photonic neural networks (PNNs) remain functionally shallow and difficult to scale. Here we establish a theory-guided framework showing that power stability and complex-field correlation are the fundamental prerequisites for scalable, coherent PNNs. Building on these macroscopic principles, we introduce the Coherent, Compensated and Cross-connected (C3) unit - an architecture that integrates coherent nonlinearity, active loss compensation and native optical residual connectivity. Implemented on a silicon-on-insulator platform, the C3 unit provides reconfigurable activation functions and dynamic energy stabilization without external amplification. We validate this framework using a width-constrained spiral benchmark, in which the C3 unit substantially improves parameter utilization and power robustness relative to incoherent nonlinearities. In a high-complexity 1,623-class recognition task, our C3-enabled coherent residual network (CoP-ResNet) achieves a top-1 accuracy of 77.92%, whereas non-residual architectures fail to converge. Together, these results offer a physically grounded, theory-guided pathway toward greater optical processing depth, laying the foundation for next-generation, large-scale photonic computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Terahertz Emission Nanoscopy of Spintronic Photocurrents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capturing ultrafast spin and charge photocurrents on nanoscopic scales is essential for fundamental research in physics and engineering, as well as for future applications, such as novel spinorbitronic devices. Accessing the fundamental dynamics driven by changes in electronic energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum requires probing that simultaneously resolves their native spatiotemporal scales: femtoseconds and nanometers. However, experimental approaches achieving this simultaneous resolution remain scarce and instrumentally demanding.
  While near-field probing offers promising platforms to combine ultrafast and nanometer resolution, a major challenge is the observation of in-plane propagation dynamics, required for studying many application-relevant, high-speed phenomena from carrier transport in 2D materials to spin-to-charge conversion in spintronic terahertz emitters (STEs). However, near-field scanning probes are primarily sensitive to out-of-plane electric fields.
  Here we present a solution to this challenge by performing terahertz (THz) emission nanoscopy (TEN) of a photoexcited fiber-coupled STE using a scanning-probe microscope. We uncover a counterintuitive, dipolar evolution of the near-field THz signal, which we show originates from the scanning-probe's inherent sensitivity to local out-of-plane electric fields that emerge in our case from spatially confined in-plane charge currents. Our findings resolve ambiguities regarding the sensitivity of near-field probes to ultrafast in-plane charge transport and establish TEN as a fully vectorial probe for the spatiotemporal imaging of coupled nanoscale THz charge and spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Accessibility of doping ranges of semiconductors by terahertz spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While established semiconductor measurement techniques such as four-point probe or capacitance-voltage measurements require a physical contact to the material, terahertz spectroscopy is completely contact-free. Its capability to measure the doping of semiconductors is well known, yet the exact doping ranges that are accessible to terahertz spectroscopy are not obvious. Therefore, we introduce a sensitivity metric to clarify whether a semiconductor sample can be characterized in principle by reflection terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. This quantity takes into account the semiconductor material with a certain layer thickness, doping type, and doping level and is based on numerical simulations. In this work, we calculate this sensitivity value for relevant semiconductor materials (SiC, Si, GaN) in realistic layer stacks with up to three layers. It is used to create meaningful heat maps depending on the thicknesses and charge carrier densities of the sample structures of interest. The plausibility of the sensitivity is validated by mapping a variety of measurements with terahertz techniques from us and from other groups onto these heat maps. Based on these, the accessible range of charge carrier densities for terahertz spectroscopy spans roughly from 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$ to 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$, but with dependencies on material, doping type, and sample thickness. Furthermore, the sensitivity value allows for a substantiated assessment of the possible benefits future improvements of photoconductive antennas and terahertz systems could have, which is demonstrated by simulations based on varied bandwidths.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Guided Waves in MoS2 thin flakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guided acoustic waves in two-dimensional materials are a key channel for energy transport and dissipation, yet their generation and propagation in transition metal dichalcogenides remain poorly understood. Here, we employ in-situ and spatially decoupled ultra-fast optical pump-probe techniques to investigate guided waves in MoS2 flakes with thicknesses between 90 and 410 nm. We observe a propagating acoustic excitation with a constant velocity of (6.7 +/- 0.8) km/s, independent of thickness. Finite element simulations and symmetry analysis reveal that these vibrations deviate from the classical Lamb wave model and are better described as a superposition of decoupled longitudinal and shear modes. We show that their optical detectability is governed by the Poisson effect: longitudinal components modulate the flake thickness and generate a measurable signal, whereas shear motion remains largely optically invisible. An intrinsic attenuation length of approximately 3.3 microns indicates that dissipation is dominated by material-specific mechanisms rather than geometric spreading. Finally, we demonstrate remote excitation across a nanometric step, enabling acoustic generation in optically inaccessible regions. These results provide a foundation for nanoscale phononic circuits and engineered in-plane energy transport in 2D-based optomechanical and quantum acoustic devices.</description>

      <title>Experimental Asynchronous Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Cryptographic Conferencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum cryptographic conferencing (QCC) protocol, which distributes identical secure keys to user groups, is a crucial component of the quantum network. Previous experimental works have implemented the measurement-device-independent (MDI) QCC, of which the key rate in an $N$-user network scales down as $R\sim O(\eta^N)$, respectively. Building on the MDI QCC protocol, the asynchronous MDI (AMDI) QCC protocol theoretically integrates the mode pairing scheme into QCC, significantly boosting the key rate to $R\sim O(\eta)$, which is independent of the number of users, and thus demonstrating greater application potential. Experimentally, in this work, we implement the three-user AMDI QCC network without global phase tracking by adopting the fast Fourier transform-based frequency difference estimation and the phase drift compensation technique. Finally, we achieve a key rate of about $4.470\times10^{-9}$ bits per pulse under a maximum overall loss of about 59.6 dB. This work provides a scalable solution for the development of large-scale quantum communication networks in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a geometrical formulation of nonlinear electrodynamics by expressing its principal symbol as an optical metric-induced object. Under the assumption of no birefringence, we show that the evolution of linear perturbations can be recast as a covariant divergence on a curved, field-dependent background, enabling the application of quantum field theory techniques as in Maxwell's theory in curved backgrounds. This geometric reformulation opens a new route for analogue models potentially implementable in laboratory via tailored nonlinear metamaterials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A method is presented for fabrication of femtosecond laser written waveguides in glass to remove the need for polishing of substrates after processing. It is shown that by amplitude masking the fabrication laser beam near the sample edge and increasing the pulse energy it is possible to write waveguides that are not affected by edge aberrations and display mode profiles well matched to single mode fiber. Results are presented for different depths in fused silica and borosilicate glass substrates. The transmission from fiber to photonic circuit is significantly improved for situations where it is not possible to polish glass substrates after laser writing, creating new opportunities in photonic packaging.</description>

      <title>Profiling THz Beams With Off-Label Use of Infrared Microbolometric Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visualizing the spatial profile of light beams is essential for evaluating irradiance, characterizing beam quality, and achieving precise alignment. In the optical spectral range, this is readily performed using silicon-based CCD and CMOS cameras. In the terahertz (THz) range, however, it typically requires specialized detectors with prohibitive costs. Here, we show that an infrared (IR) camera can be used outside of its labeled specifications to achieve similar performance as a dedicated microbolometric THz camera, at under 1% of the THz camera's cost. We compared the cameras by characterizing THz beam profiles from two sources: a pulsed broadband THz beam produced through optical rectification in organic crystals, and a narrowband quasi-continuous-wave (quasi-CW) THz beam emitted by a quantum cascade laser. For the broadband THz radiation, the beam width measured by the two cameras differed by only ~ 6%, well within the pixel resolution limit, and in the narrowband quasi-CW case by just ~ 1.3%. Additionally, both cameras show linear responsivity over a comparable irradiance range. These results expand the applicability of conventional IR cameras to the THz range, suggesting that they will become routine tools for high-fidelity THz beam diagnostics and imaging in scientific and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Particle-like topologies of light in turbulent complex media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The basic building blocks of many forms of optical topologies are particle-like singularities in phase and polarisation, giving rise to lines of darkness that weave complex threads in 3D space. Although known for half a century since seminal work on dislocations in wave trains, their behaviour in complex media remains under debate, especially with respect to their relative stability. Here we show that polarisation and phase vortices behave identically in one-sided turbulent complex channels. We perform complementary numerical and experimental studies using atmospheric turbulence as a test case, demonstrating agreement and equivalent dynamics. Our work addresses open questions on optical topologies and will be relevant to their harnessing for applications such as sensing, communication, imaging, and information transfer in noisy or complex environments.</description>

      <title>Classification and reconstruction for single-pixel imaging with classical and quantum neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-pixel cameras are an effective solution for imaging outside the visible spectrum, where traditional CMOS/CCD cameras have challenges. When combined with machine learning, they can analyze images quickly enough for practical applications. Solving the problem of high-dimensional single-pixel visualization can potentially be accelerated via quantum machine learning, thereby expanding the range of practical problems. In this work, we simulated a single-pixel imaging experiment using Hadamard basis patterns, where images from the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and FashionMNIST items of clothing dataset were used as objects. There were selected 64 measurements with maximum variance (6% of the number of pixels in the image). We created algorithms for classifying and reconstructing images based on these measurements using classical fully-connected neural networks and parameterized quantum circuits. Classical and quantum classifiers showed the best accuracies of 96% and 95% for MNIST and 84% and 81% for FashionMNIST, respectively, after 6 training epochs, which is a quite competitive result. In the area of intersection by the number of parameters of the quantum and classical classifiers, the quantum demonstrates results no worse than the classical one, even better by a value of about 1-3%. Image reconstruction was also demonstrated using classical and quantum neural networks after 10 training epochs; the best structural similarity index measure values were 0.76 and 0.26 for MNIST and 0.73 and 0.22 for FashionMNIST, respectively, which indicates that the problem in such a formulation turned out to be too difficult for quantum neural networks in such a configuration for now.</description>

      <title>Full-field mapping of spatially varying polarization entanglement generated from spontaneous parametric down-conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03586v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-photon states generated from spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) can display entanglement in all degrees of freedom (DoFs) of light, including spatial, temporal, and polarization. The coupling between different DoFs of a two-photon state has been shown to display rich structures that enable novel and robust information processing schemes. While existing literature has studied these couplings by post-selecting the SPDC field, a comprehensive understanding of the inherent spatial-polarization coupling produced in the SPDC process is still lacking. This work produces a full spatial map of the polarization entanglement generated across the entire SPDC field. We observe an entire class of near-maximally polarization-entangled states with an average concurrence of $0.8303\pm0.0004$, which, together with a certified spatial dimensionality of 148, could potentially offer access to a 251-dimensional hyperentanglement. The spatial-polarization coupling manifests as radially or linearly varying polarization-entangled states, whose wavefunctions are dependent on the transverse momenta of the down-converted photons and the pump beam, respectively. Our study lays important groundwork for further exploiting the coupling between entanglement in different DoFs for future quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a model of binary random number generator (RNG) based on a Brillouin optomechanical system. The device uses a hard excitation mode in a Brillouin optomechanical system, where thermal noise induces spontaneous transitions between two stable states in the hard excitation mode. We demonstrate the existence of an amplitude criterion for observing these transitions and show that the probability distribution of their occurrence in the non-generating and generating states can be precisely controlled by the amplitude of an external pump wave. At the same time, the use of a low-intensity seed wave allows for the control of the transition times between states. We demonstrate that the proposed random number generator successfully passes the standard tests NIST SP 800-22. The obtained result opens a way for development of an all-optical integrated True RNG, generating a sequence of random bits with equal probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical thermodynamics has recently emerged as a theoretical framework describing a Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) modal power distribution of multimoded nonlinear photonic circuits. However, its applicability is constrained to systems exhibiting weak nonlinear mode-mode interactions. Here, by employing a Transfer Integral Operator, we circumvent this limitation and establish a steady-state interacting RJ modal distribution -- referred to as non-ideal RJ (NIRJ) -- with renormalized temperature and optical chemical potential. This also builds a natural bridge with earlier work on grand-canonical statistical-mechanical formulations of discrete nonlinear systems. The theory derives the optical analogue of the compressibility factor, which controls the transition from an ideal, non-interacting equation of state (EoS) to a van der Waals-like interacting EoS.</description>
