      <title>Short hierarchically hyperbolic groups I: uncountably many coarse median structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the mapping class group of a sphere with five punctures admits uncountably many non-equivalent, coarsely equivariant coarse median structures, falsifying a folklore belief. We obtain the same result for all cocompactly cubulated large type Artin groups, and in this case the coarse medians we produce are not induced by cubulations. In the process, we develop the theory of short hierarchically hyperbolic groups (HHGs), which also include Artin groups of large and hyperbolic type, graph manifolds groups, and extensions of Veech groups. We develop tools to modify their hierarchical structure, including using quasimorphisms to construct quasilines that serve as coordinate spaces, and this is where the abundance of coarse median structures comes from. These tools are of independent interest, and we use them in a forthcoming paper to study quotients of short HHGs.</description>

      <title>An extension formula for right Bol loops arising from Bol reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a new extension formula for right Bol loops. We prove the necessary or sufficient conditions for the extension to be right Bol. We describe the most important invariants: right multiplication group, nuclei, and center. We show that the core is an involutory quandle which is the disjoint union of two isomorphic involutory quandles. We also derive further results on the structure group of the core of the extension.</description>

      <title>On residual finiteness of graphs of free groups with cyclic edge groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize which groups splitting as finite graphs of free groups with cyclic edge groups are residually finite. Such a group $G$ is residually finite if and only if it does not contain a \emph{very unbalanced element}, an element satisfying a small set of group equations and non-equations. From a presentation of $G$, we construct a finite labeled graph $\Gamma$, and show that the existence of very unbalanced elements in $G$ is equivalent to an easily-detectable property of this graph. This provides a simple algorithm deciding whether $G$ is residually finite. This characterization confirms a conjecture of Wise.</description>

      <title>Infinite groups with isomorphic power graph and commuting graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate certain graphs defined on groups, with a focus on infinite groups. The graphs discussed are the power graph, the enhanced power graph, and the commuting graph whose vertex set is a group $G$. The power graph is a graph in which two vertices are adjacent if one is some power of the other. In the enhanced power graph, an edge joins two vertices if they generate a cyclic subgroup of $G$. In the commuting graph, two vertices are adjacent if they commute in $G$. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for any two of these graphs to be equal. This extends existing results for finite groups. In addition, we show that the power graph of the locally quaternion group is isomorphic to the commuting graph of the locally dihedral group. Lastly, we also answer a question posed by P. J. Cameron about the existence of groups $G_1$ and $G_2$ both of whom have power graph not equal to commuting graph but the power graph of $G_1$ and the commuting graph of $G_2$ are isomorphic.</description>

      <title>A Permutation Group Isomorphic to the $n$-Qubit Projective Clifford Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a permutation group of degree $2(4^n-1)$, which is isomorphic to the $n$-qubit projective Clifford group. To establish this result, we study the centralizers of the $z$ gate and the phase gate within the $n$-qubit projective Clifford group by employing the normal form of the Clifford operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\sigma_i$ be the braid actions on infinite Grassmannian cluster algebras induced from Fraser's braid group actions. Let $\mathsf{T}_i$ be the braid group actions on (quantum) Grothendieck rings of Hernandez-Leclerc category ${\mathscr C}_\mathfrak{g}^0$ of affine type $A_n^{(1)}$, and $\mathsf{R}_i$ the braid group actions on the corresponding extended crystals. In the paper, we prove that the actions $\sigma_i$ coincide with the braid group actions $\mathsf{T}_i$ and $\mathsf{R}_i$.</description>

      <title>Searching for non-order-preserving braids algorithmically</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An $n$-strand braid is order-preserving if its action on the free group $F_n$ preserves some bi-order of $F_n$. A braid $\beta$ is order-preserving if and only if the link $L$ obtained as the union of the closure of $\beta$ and its axis has bi-orderable complement. We describe and implement an algorithm which, given a non-order-preserving braid $\beta$, confirms this property and returns a proof that $\beta$ is indeed not order-preserving. Guided by the algorithm, we prove that the infinite family of simple 3-braids $\sigma_1\sigma_2^{2m+1}$ are not order-preserving for any integer $m$.</description>

      <title>Finding an Isomorphism between the Riordan Group and a Subgroup of the Double Riordan Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Riordan group is a set of infinite lower-triangular matrices defined by two generating functions, $g$ and $f$. The elements of the group are called Riordan arrays, denoted by $(g,f)$, and the $k$th column of a Riordan array is given by the function $gf^k$. The Double Riordan group is defined similarly using three generating functions $g$, $f_1$, and $f_2$, where $g$ is an even function and $f_1$ and $f_2$ are odd functions. This group generalizes the Checkerboard subgroup of the Riordan group, where $g$ is even and $f$ is odd. An open question posed by Davenport, Shapiro, and Woodson was if there exists an isomorphism between the Riordan group and a subgroup of the Double Riordan group. This question is answered in this article.</description>

      <title>On dynamical skew braces and skew bracoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical skew braces are known to produce solutions to the quiver-theoretic Yang--Baxter equation. Under a technical hypothesis, we prove that these solutions are braided groupoids (and hence skew bracoids in the sense of Sheng, Tang and Zhu). Conversely, every connected braided groupoid can be parallelised, making it isomorphic to a dynamical skew brace. We study the combinatorics of these objects, depending on some strings of integer invariants.</description>

Abstract: Wise's Quasiconvex Hierarchy Theorem classifying hyperbolic virtually compact special groups in terms of quasiconvex hierarchies played an essential role in Agol's proof of the Virtual Haken Conjecture. Answering a question of Wise, we construct a new virtual quasiconvex hierarchy for relatively hyperbolic virtually compact special groups. We use this hierarchy to prove a generalization of Wise's Malnormal Special Quotient Theorem for relatively hyperbolic virtually compact special groups with arbitrary peripheral subgroups.</description>

      <title>Critical classes of power graphs and reconstruction of directed power graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a graph $\Gamma=(V,E)$, we consider the common closed neighbourhood of a subset of vertices and use this notion to introduce a Moore closure operator in $V.$ We also consider the closed twin equivalence relation in which two vertices are equivalent if they have the same closed neighbourhood. Those notions are deeply explored when $\Gamma$ is the power graph associated with a finite group $G$. In that case, among the corresponding closed twin equivalence classes, we introduce the concepts of plain, compound and critical classes. The study of critical classes, together with properties of the Moore closure operator, allow us to correct a mistake in the proof of {\rm \cite[Theorem 2 ]{Cameron_2}} and to deduce a simple algorithm to reconstruct the directed power graph of a finite group from its undirected counterpart, as asked in \cite[Question 2]{GraphsOnGroups}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the topological complexity of a finite index subgroup of a hyperbolic group is linear in its index. This follows from a more general result relating the size of the quotient of a free cocompact action of hyperbolic group on a graph to the minimal number of cells in a simplicial classifying space for the group. As a corollary we prove that any two isomorphic finite-index subgroups of a non-elementary hyperbolic group have the same index.</description>

      <title>A complete classification of shuffle groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01037v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For positive integers $k$ and $n$, the shuffle group $G_{k,kn}$ is generated by the $k!$ permutations of a deck of $kn$ cards performed by cutting the deck into $k$ piles with $n$ cards in each pile, and then perfectly interleaving these cards following a certain permutation of the $k$ piles. For $k=2$, the shuffle group $G_{2,2n}$ was determined by Diaconis, Graham and Kantor in 1983. The Shuffle Group Conjecture states that, for general $k$, the shuffle group $G_{k,kn}$ contains $\mathrm{A}_{kn}$ whenever $k\notin\{2,4\}$ and $n$ is not a power of $k$. In particular, the conjecture in the case $k=3$ was posed by Medvedoff and Morrison in 1987. The only values of $k$ for which the Shuffle Group Conjecture has been confirmed so far are powers of $2$, due to recent work of Amarra, Morgan and Praeger based on Classification of Finite Simple Groups. In this paper, we confirm the Shuffle Group Conjecture for all cases using results on $2$-transitive groups and elements of large fixed point ratio in primitive groups.</description>

      <title>A Combinatorial Generalisation of Rank two Complex Reflection Groups via Generators and Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex reflection groups of rank two are precisely the finite groups in the family of groups that we call J-reflection groups. These groups are particular cases of J-groups as defined by Achar &amp; Aubert in 2008. The family of J-reflection groups generalises both complex reflection groups of rank two and toric reflection groups, a family of groups defined and studied by Gobet. We give uniform presentations by generators and relations of J-reflection groups, which coincide with the presentations given by Brou\'e, Malle and Rouquier when the groups are finite. In particular, these presentations provide uniform presentations for complex reflection groups of rank two where the generators are reflections (however the proof uses the classification of irreducible complex reflection groups). Moreover, we show that the center of J-reflection groups is cyclic, generalising what happens for irreducible complex reflection groups of rank two and toric reflection groups. Finally, we classify J-reflection groups up to reflection isomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Affine groups as flag-transitive and point-primitive automorphism groups of symmetric designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate symmetric designs admitting a flag-transitive and point-primitive affine automorphism group. We prove that if an automorphism group $G$ of a symmetric $(v,k,\lambda)$ design with $\lambda$ prime is point-primitive of affine type, then $G=2^{6}{:}\mathrm{S}_{6}$ and $(v,k,\lambda)=(16,6,2)$, or $G$ is a subgroup of $\mathrm{A\Gamma L}_{1}(q)$ for some odd prime power $q$. In conclusion, we present a classification of flag-transitive and point-primitive symmetric designs with $\lambda$ prime, which says that such an incidence structure is a projective space $\mathrm{PG}(n,q)$, it has parameter set $(15,7,3)$, $(7, 4, 2)$, $(11, 5, 2)$, $(11, 6, 2)$, $(16,6,2)$ or $(45, 12, 3)$, or $v=p^d$ where $p$ is an odd prime and the automorphism group is a subgroup of $\mathrm{A\Gamma L}_{1}(q)$.</description>

Abstract: We study topological full groups attached to groupoid models for left regular representations of Garside categories. Groups arising in this way include Thompson's group $V$ and many of its variations such as R\"over-Nekrashevych groups. Our key observation is that a Garside structure for the underlying small category induces a new Garside structure for a new small category of bisections, and that our topological full group coincides with the fundamental group of the enveloping groupoid of the new category. As a consequence, we solve the word problem and identify general criteria for establishing finiteness properties of our topological full groups. In particular, we show that topological full groups arising from products of shifts of finite type are of type ${\rm F}_{\infty}$, answering a natural question left open by Matui.</description>
