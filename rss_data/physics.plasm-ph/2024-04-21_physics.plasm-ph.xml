      <title>Full Shot Predictions for the DIII-D Tokamak via Deep Recurrent Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although tokamaks are one of the most promising devices for realizing nuclear fusion as an energy source, there are still key obstacles when it comes to understanding the dynamics of the plasma and controlling it. As such, it is crucial that high quality models are developed to assist in overcoming these obstacles. In this work, we take an entirely data driven approach to learn such a model. In particular, we use historical data from the DIII-D tokamak to train a deep recurrent network that is able to predict the full time evolution of plasma discharges (or "shots"). Following this, we investigate how different training and inference procedures affect the quality and calibration of the shot predictions.</description>

      <title>Design and Modeling of Indirectly-Driven Magnetized Implosions on the NIF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of magnetic fields to improve the performance of hohlraum-driven implosions on the National Ignition Facility (NIF) is discussed. The focus is on magnetically insulated inertial confinement fusion (ICF), where the primary field effect is to reduce electron-thermal and alpha-particle loss from the compressed hotspot (magnetic pressure is of secondary importance). We summarize the requirements to achieve this state. The design of recent NIF magnetized hohlraum experiments is presented. These are close to earlier shots in the three-shock, high-adiabat (BigFoot) campaign, subject to the constraints that magnetized NIF targets must be fielded at room-temperature, and use &lt; 1 MJ of laser energy to avoid risk of optics damage from stimulated Brillouin scattering. We present results from the original magnetized hohlraum platform, as well as a later variant which gives higher hotspot temperature. In both platforms, imposed fields (at the capsule center) of up to 28 T increase the fusion yield and hotspot temperature. Integrated radiation-magneto-hydrodynamic (rad-MHD) modeling with the Lasnex code of these shots is shown, where laser power multipliers and a saturation clamp on cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) are developed to match the time of peak capsule emission and the P2 Legendre moment of the hotspot x-ray image. The resulting fusion yield and ion temperature agree decently with the measured relative effects of the field, although the absolute simulated yields are higher than the data by 2.0-2.7X. The tuned parameters and yield discrepancy are comparable for experiments with and without an imposed field, indicating the model adequately captures the field effects. Self-generated and imposed fields are added sequentially to simulations of one BigFoot NIF shot to understand how they alter target dynamics.</description>

      <title>Enhanced plasma ion heating by lasers in inhomogeneous external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown direct ion heating (vashistha2020new,Juneja_2023) by lasers EM (Electromagnetic) wave interacting with a plasma threaded by an external uniform magnetic field. The EM wave frequency was near the lower hybrid (LH) resonance frequency. The LH resonance occurs at the edge of the pass band of the magnetized dispersion relation. The group speed of the wave is negligible at resonance. In these studies, the energy absorption remains essentially confined at the plasma surface. However, to heat the ions in the bulk plasma and at a desired location, a tailored inhomogeneous external magnetic field profile has been chosen here. The strength of the magnetic field at the plasma edge is such that the EM wave frequency lies inside the pass band, where the group velocity has a significant value. It enables the wave to enter the bulk plasma. The external magnetic field is then spatially tailored appropriately to have the LH resonance at a desired spatial location inside the plasma. The Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations using the OSIRIS4.0 platform have been carried out, which demonstrates that the EM wave pulse comes to a standstill at the location of the resonance. The wave pulse is observed to break down subsequently, and the energy consequently goes dominantly to the local plasma ions. The absorption is significantly enhanced compared to the case in which the magnetic field profile was homogeneous. The dependence of absorption on the choice of magnetic field profile, the laser intensity, etc., has also been carried out.</description>

      <title>The MEMENTO code for modelling of macroscopic melt motion in fusion devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MEMENTO (MEtallic Melt Evolution in Next-step TOkamaks) code is a new numerical implementation of the physics model originally developed for the MEMOS-U code with the objective to self-consistently describe the generation of melt and its subsequent large scale dynamics in fusion devices and to assess the damage of metallic reactor armor under powerful normal and off-normal plasma events. The model has been validated in multiple dedicated EUROfusion experiments. MEMENTO solves the heat and phase transfer problem coupled with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the shallow water approximation for the thin liquid film over the solid metal and with the current propagation equations on a domain that features a time-evolving deforming metal-plasma interface. The code utilizes non-uniform and adaptive meshing along with sub-cycling in time facilitated by the AMReX open-source framework as well as AMReX's built-in parallelization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Risk of Proliferation via Fissile Material Breeding in ARC-class Fusion Reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Construction of a nuclear weapon requires access to kilogram-scale quantities of fissile material, which can be bred from fertile material like U-238 and Th-232 via neutron capture. Future fusion power plants, with total neutron source rates in excess of $10^{20}$ n/s, could breed weapons-relevant quantities of fissile material on short timescales, posing a breakout proliferation risk. The ARC-class fusion reactor design is characterized by demountable high temperature superconducting magnets, a FLiBe liquid immersion blanket, and a relatively small size ($\sim$ 4 m major radius, $\sim$ 1 m minor radius). We use the open-source Monte Carlo neutronics code OpenMC to perform self-consistent time-dependent simulations of a representative ARC-class blanket to assess the feasibility of a fissile breeding breakout scenario. We find that a significant quantity of fissile material can be bred in less than six months of full power operation for initial fertile inventories ranging from 5 to 50 metric tons, representing a non-negligible proliferation risk. We further study the feasibility of this scenario by examining other consequences of fissile breeding such as reduced tritium breeding ratio, extra heat from fission and decay heat, isotopic purity of bred material, and self-protection time of irradiated blanket material. We also examine the impact of Li-6 enrichment on fissile breeding and find that it substantially reduces breeding rate, motivating its use as a proliferation resistance tool.</description>

      <title>Tearing-mediated reconnection in magnetohydrodynamic poorly ionized plasmas. I. Onset and linear evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high-Lundquist-number plasmas, reconnection proceeds via onset of tearing, followed by a nonlinear phase during which plasmoids continuously form, merge, and are ejected from the current sheet (CS). This process is understood in fully ionized, magnetohydrodynamic plasmas. However, many plasma environments, such as star-forming molecular clouds and the solar chromosphere, are poorly ionized. We use theory and computation to study tearing-mediated reconnection in such poorly ionized systems. In this paper, we focus on the onset and linear evolution of this process. In poorly ionized plasmas, magnetic nulls on scales below $v_{\rm A,n0}/\nu_{\rm ni0}$, with $v_{\rm A,n0}$ the neutral Alfv\'{e}n speed and $\nu_{\rm ni0}$ the neutral-ion collision frequency, will self-sharpen via ambipolar diffusion. This sharpening occurs at an increasing rate, inhibiting the onset of reconnection. Once the CS becomes thin enough, however, ions decouple from neutrals and thinning of the CS slows, allowing tearing to onset in a time of order $\nu_{\rm ni0}^{-1}$. We find that the wavelength and growth rate of the mode that first disrupts the forming sheet can be predicted from a poorly ionized tearing dispersion relation; as the plasma recombination rate increases and ionization fraction decreases, the growth rate becomes an increasing multiple of $\nu_{ni0}$ and the wavelength becomes a decreasing fraction of $v_{\rm A,n0}/\nu_{\rm ni0}$.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Matsubara series expansion for imaginary-time correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Fourier-Matsubara series expansion is derived for imaginary-time correlation functions that constitutes the imaginary-time generalization of the infinite Matsubara series for equal-time correlation functions. The expansion is consistent with all known exact properties of imaginary-time correlation functions and opens up new avenues for the utilization of quantum Monte Carlo simulation data. Moreover, the expansion drastically simplifies the computation of imaginary-time density-density correlation functions with the finite temperature version of the self-consistent dielectric formalism. Its existence underscores the utility of imaginary-time as a complementary domain for many-body physics.</description>
