      <title>On the Dirichlet boundary value problem on Cartan-Hadamard manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Dirichlet boundary value problem on Cartan-Hadamard manifolds, focusing on the non-existence of bounded (viscosity) solutions to semi-linear elliptic equations of the form $\Delta u + f(u) = 0$ in domains with prescribed asymptotic boundary, extending previous results by Bonorino and Klaser originally established for hyperbolic spaces. Using a novel comparison technique based on convex hypersurfaces inspired by Choi, G\'alvez, and Lozano, we overcome the absence of totally geodesic foliations, which are instrumental in the hyperbolic space. Our results highlight the interplay between curvature, the spectrum of the Laplacian, and the geometry of the asymptotic boundary.</description>

      <title>Transport equation theory in the Triebel-Lizorkin spaces and its applications to the ideal fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a general theory for the transport equation within the framework of Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. We first derive commutator estimates in these spaces, dispensing with the conventional divergence-free condition, via the Bony paraproduct decomposition and vector-valued maximal function inequalities. Building on these estimates and combining the method of characteristics with a compactness argument, we then obtain the new a priori estimates and prove local well-posedness for the transport equation in Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. The resulting theory is applicable to a wide range of evolution equations, including models for incompressible and compressible ideal fluid flows, shallow water waves, among others. As an illustration, we consider the incompressible ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system. Employing the general transport theory developed here yields a complete local well-posedness result in the sense of Hadamard, covering both sub-critical and critical regularity regimes, and provides corresponding blow-up criteria for the ideal MHD equations in Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. Our results refine and substantially extend earlier work in this direction.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of drift effects in the quasi-geostrophic equation arising from nonlinear symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper compares two similar diffusion equations that appear in meteorology. One is the quasi-geostrophic equation, and the other is the convection-diffusion equation. Both are two-dimensional bilinear equations, and the order of differentiation is the same. Naturally, their scales also coincide. However, the direction in which the nonlinear effects act differs: one acts along the isothermal surface, while the other acts along the temperature gradient in a specified direction. The main assertion quantifies this difference through the large-time behavior of their solutions. In particular, the nonlinear distortions in the asymptotic profiles of both equations are compared. In this context, the spatial symmetry of the first approximation plays a crucial role, but the solutions require no symmetry.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of the lowest Robin eigenvalue in exterior domains of the hyperbolic plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Robin Laplacian in the exterior of a bounded simply-connected Lipschitz domain in the hyperbolic plane. We show that the essential spectrum of this operator is $[\frac14,\infty)$ and that, under convexity assumption on the domain, there exist discrete eigenvalues below $\frac14$ if, and only if, the Robin parameter is below a non-positive critical constant, which depends on the shape of the domain. As the main result, we prove that the lowest Robin eigenvalue for the exterior of a bounded geodesically convex domain $\Omega$ in the hyperbolic plane does not exceed such an eigenvalue for the exterior of the geodesic disk, whose geodesic curvature of the boundary is not smaller than the averaged geodesic curvature of the boundary of $\Omega$. This result implies as a consequence that under fixed area or fixed perimeter constraints the exterior of the geodesic disk maximises the lowest Robin eigenvalue among exteriors of bounded geodesically convex domains. Moreover, we obtain under the same geometric constraints a reverse inequality between the critical constants.</description>

      <title>High-Contrast Transmission Resonances for the Lam\'e System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Lam\'e transmission problem in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with a bounded isotropic elastic inclusion in a high-contrast setting, where the interior-to-exterior Lam\'e moduli and densities scale like $1/\tau$ as $\tau\to0$. We study the scattering resonances of the associated self-adjoint Hamiltonian, defined as the poles of the meromorphic continuation of its resolvent.
  We obtain a sharp asymptotic description of resonances near the real axis as $\tau\to0$. Near each nonzero Neumann eigenvalue of the interior Lam\'e operator there is a cluster of resonances lying just below it in the complex plane; in this wavelength-scale regime the imaginary parts are of order $\tau$ with non-vanishing leading coefficients. In addition, near zero (a subwavelength regime), we identify resonances with real parts of order $\sqrt{\tau}$ and prove a lifetime dichotomy: their imaginary parts are of order $\tau$ generically, but of order $\tau^2$ for an explicit admissible set $\mathcal E$. This yields a classification of long-lived elastic resonances in the high-contrast limit.
  We also establish resolvent asymptotics for both fixed-size resonators and microresonators. We derive explicit expansions with a finite-rank leading term and quantitative remainder bounds, valid near both wavelength-scale and subwavelength resonances. For microresonators, at the wavelength scale the dominant contribution is an anisotropic elastic point scatterer. Near the zero eigenvalue, the leading-order behaviour is of monopole or dipole type, and we give a rigorous criterion distinguishing the two cases.</description>

      <title>Global minimizers for a two-sided biharmonic Alt-Caffarelli problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study global minimizers of biharmonic analogues of the Alt-Caffarelli functional. It turns out that half-space solutions are global minimizers for the two-sided Alt-Caffarelli functional, but not in the one-sided case. In addition, we identify a further class of global minimizers, all of which have constant Laplacian. Recent work by J. Lamboley and M. Nahon reduces potential global minimizers in dimension two to four possible categories. Our work shows that three of these categories persist in any dimension and are in fact global minimizers.
  Moreover, we show that minimizers of the two-sided biharmonic Alt-Caffarelli problem do in general not satisfy a partial differential equation, not even with a signed measure as right-hand-side. This is in sharp contrast to the corresponding one-sided problem.</description>

      <title>A Riemannian Autocorrelation Function and its Application to Non-Local Isoperimetric Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a family of non-local isoperimetric energies $E_{\gamma,\varepsilon}$ on the round sphere $M = S^n$, where the non-local interaction kernel $K_\varepsilon$ is the fundamental solution of the Helmholtz operator $1 - \varepsilon^2 \Delta$. To analyse these energies, we introduce a Riemannian autocorrelation function $c_\Omega$ associated to a measurable set $\Omega\subset M$, defined on any compact, connected, oriented Riemannian manifold without boundary $(M^n,g)$ of dimension $n\ge2$. This function is intimately linked to Matheron's set covariogram from convex geometry. By establishing a characterisation of functions of bounded variation $BV(M)$ in terms of geodesic difference quotients, we show that $\Omega$ has finite perimeter if and only if $c_\Omega$ is Lipschitz, and we relate the Lipschitz constant to the perimeter of $\Omega$. We show that on the round sphere $E_{\gamma,\varepsilon}$ admits a reformulation in terms of $c_\Omega$, which allows us to compute the limit as $\varepsilon \to 0$ in a variational sense, that is, in the framework of $\Gamma$-convergence.</description>

      <title>A proof of the soliton resolution conjecture for the Benjamin--Ono equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a proof of the soliton resolution conjecture for the Benjamin--Ono equation, namely every solution with sufficiently regular and decaying initial data can be written as a finite sum of soliton solutions with different velocities up to a radiative remainder term in the long--time asymptotics. We provide a detailed correspondence between the spectral theory of the Lax operator associated to the initial data and the different terms of the soliton resolution expansion. The proof is based on a new use of a representation formula of the solution due to the second author, and on a detailed analysis of the distorted Fourier transform associated to the Lax operator.</description>

      <title>Michael-Simon inequality for anisotropic energies close to the area via multilinear Kakeya-type bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an anisotropic integrand $F:\text{Gr}_k(\mathbb R^n)\to(0,\infty)$, we can generalize the classical isotropic area by looking at the functional $$\mathcal{F}(\Sigma^k):=\int_\Sigma F(T_x\Sigma)\,d\mathcal{H}^k.$$ While a monotonicity formula is not available for critical points, when $k=2$ and $n=3$ we show that the Michael-Simon inequality holds if $F$ is convex and close to $1$ (in $C^1$), meaning that $\mathcal{F}$ is close to the usual area.
  Our argument is partly based on some key ideas of Almgren, who proved this result in an unpublished manuscript, but we largely simplify his original proof by showing a new functional inequality for vector fields on the plane, which can be seen as a quantitative version of Alberti's rank-one theorem.
  As another byproduct, we also show Michael-Simon for another class of integrands which includes the $\ell^p$ norms for $p\in(1,\infty)$. For a general $F$ satisfying the atomic condition, we also show that the validity of Michael-Simon is equivalent to compactness of rectifiable varifolds.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the convex integration technique applied to singular stochastic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singular stochastic partial differential equations informally refer to the partial differential equations with rough random force that leads to the products in the nonlinear terms becoming ill-defined. Besides the theories of regularity structures and paracontrolled distributions, the technique of convex integration has emerged as a possible approach to construct a solution to such singular stochastic partial differential equations. We review recent developments in this area, and also demonstrate that an application of the convex integration technique to prove non-uniqueness seems unlikely for a particular singular stochastic partial differential equation, specifically the $\Phi^{4}$ model from quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider general parameter to solution maps $\theta \mapsto \mathcal G(\theta)$ of non-linear partial differential equations and describe an approach based on a Banach space version of the implicit function theorem to verify the gradient stability condition of Nickl&amp;Wang (JEMS 2024) for the underlying non-linear inverse problem, providing also injectivity estimates and corresponding statistical identifiability results. We illustrate our methods in two examples involving a non-linear reaction diffusion system as well as a McKean--Vlasov interacting particle model, both with periodic boundary conditions. We apply our results to prove the polynomial time convergence of a Langevin-type algorithm sampling the posterior measure of the interaction potential arising from a discrete aggregate measurement of the interacting particle system.</description>

      <title>Malliavin Calculus for the stochastic Cahn-Hilliard equation driven by fractional noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic partial differential equation analyzed in this work is the Cahn-Hilliard equation perturbed by an additive fractional white noise (fractional in time and white in space). We work in the case of one spatial dimension and apply Malliavin calculus to investigate the existence of a density for the stochastic solution $u$. In particular, we show that $u$ admits continuous paths almost surely and construct a localizing sequence through which we prove that its Malliavin derivative exists locally, and that its law is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $\bf R$, establishing thus that a density exists. A key contribution of this work is the analysis of the stochastic integral appearing in the mild formulation: we derive sharp estimates for the expectation of the $p$-th power ($p \geq 2$) of the $L^{\infty}(D)$-norm of this stochastic integral as well as for the integral involving the $L^{\infty}(D)$-norm of the operator associated with the kernel appearing in the integral representation of the fractional noise, all of which are essential for this study.</description>

Abstract: We prove that, under the H\"ormander criterion on an It\^{o} process, all its martingale observables are smooth. As a consequence, we also obtain a generalized Feynman-Kac formula providing smooth solutions to certain PDE boundary-value problems, while allowing for degenerate diffusions as well as boundary stopping (under very mild boundary regularity assumptions). We also highlight an application to a question posed on Schramm-Loewner evolutions, by making certain Girsanov transform martingales accessible via It\^{o} calculus.</description>

      <title>Unbounded symbols, heat flow, and Toeplitz operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We disprove the natural domain extension of the Berger--Coburn heat-flow conjecture for Toeplitz operators on the Bargmann space and identify the failure mechanism as a gap between pointwise and uniform control of a Gaussian averaging of the squared modulus of the symbol, a gap that is invisible to the linear form $T_g$. We establish that the form-defined operator $T_g$ and the natural-domain operator $U_g$ decouple in the unbounded symbols regime: while $T_g$ is governed by linear averaging, $U_g$ is controlled by the quadratic intensity of $|g|^2$. We construct a smooth, nonnegative radial symbol $g$ satisfying the coherent-state admissibility hypothesis with bounded heat transforms for all time $t&gt;0$; for this symbol, $T_g$ is bounded, yet $U_g$ is unbounded. This is a strictly global phenomenon: under the coherent-state hypothesis, local singularities are insufficient to cause unboundedness, leaving the ``geometry at infinity'' as the sole obstruction. Boundedness of $U_g$ is equivalent to the condition that $|g|^2 d\mu$ is a Fock--Carleson measure, a condition strictly stronger than the linear average $g d\mu$ governing $T_g$. Finally, regarding the gap between the known sub-critical sufficiency condition and the critical heat time, we prove that heat-flow regularity is irreversible in this context and show that bootstrapping strategies cannot resolve the gap between sufficiency and critical time.</description>

      <title>On The large Time Asymptotics of Schr\"odinger type equations with General Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.00724v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the Schr\"odinger equation with a general interaction term, which may be linear or nonlinear, time dependent and including charge transfer potentials, we prove the global solutions are asymptotically given by the sum of a free wave and a weakly localized part. The proof is based on constructing in a new way the Free Channel Wave Operator, and further tools from the recent works \cite{Liu-Sof1,Liu-Sof2,SW2020}. This work generalizes the results of the first part of \cite{Liu-Sof1,Liu-Sof2} to arbitrary dimension, and non-radial data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f\in W^{3,1}_{\mathrm{loc}}(\Omega)$ be a function defined on a connected open subset $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb R^2$. We will show that its graph is contained in a quadratic surface if and only if $f$ is a weak solution to a certain system of third-order partial differential equations unless the Hessian determinant of $f$ is non-positive everywhere on $\Omega$. Moreover, we will prove that the system is, in a sense, the simplest possible in a wide class of differential equations, which will lead to the classification of all polynomial partial differential equations satisfied by parametrizations of generic quadratic surfaces. Although we will mainly use the tools of linear and commutative algebra, the theorem itself is also somewhat related to holomorphic functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the degenerate or singular fully nonlinear dead-core systems coupled with strong absorption terms. We establish several properties, including improved regularity of viscosity solutions along the free boundary, non-degeneracy, a measure estimate of the free boundary, Liouville-type results, and the behavior of blow-up solution. We also derive sharp regularity estimates for viscosity solutions to H\'{e}non-type equations with a degenerate weight and strong absorption, governed by a degenerate fully nonlinear operator. Our results are new even for the model equations involving degenerate Laplacian operators.</description>

      <title>Global solutions for supersonic flow of a Chaplygin gas past a conical wing with a shock wave detached from the leading edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03406v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first investigate the mathematical aspects of supersonic flow of a Chaplygin gas past a conical wing with diamond-shaped cross sections in the case of a shock wave detached from the leading edges. The flow under consideration is governed by the three-dimensional steady compressible Euler equations. For the Chaplygin gas, all characteristics are linearly degenerate, and shocks are reversible and characteristic. Using these properties, we can determine the location of the shock in advance and reformulate our problem as an oblique derivative problem for a nonlinear degenerate elliptic equation in conical coordinates. By establishing a Lipschitz estimate, we show that the equation is uniformly elliptic in any subdomain strictly away from the degenerate boundary, and then further prove the existence of a solution to the problem via the continuity method and vanishing viscosity method.</description>

      <title>Talenti comparison results for solutions to $p$-Laplace equation on multiply connected domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last years comparison results of Talenti type for Elliptic Problems have been widely investigated. In this paper we obtain a comparison result for the $p$-Laplace operator in multiply connected domains with Robin boundary condition on the exterior boundary and non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on the interior one, generalizing the results obtained in \cite{ANT, AGM} to this type of domains. This will be a generalization to Robin boundary condition of the results obtained in \cite{B, B2}, with an improvement of the $L^2$ comparison in the case $p=2$. As a consequence, we obtain a Bossel-Daners and Saint-Venant type inequalities for multiply connected domains.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Thomas-Fermi theory for 2D abelian anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional abelian anyons are, in the magnetic gauge picture, represented as fermions coupled to magnetic flux tubes. For the ground state of such a system in a trapping potential, we theoretically and numerically investigate a Hartree approximate model, obtained by restricting trial states to Slater determinants and introducing a self-consistent magnetic field, locally proportional to matter density. This leads to a fermionic variant of the Chern-Simons-Schr{\"o}dinger system. We find that for dense systems, a semi-classical approximation yields qualitatively good results. Namely, we derive a density functional theory of magnetic Thomas-Fermi type, which correctly captures the trends of our numerical results. In particular, we explore the subtle dependence of the ground state with respect to the fraction of magnetic flux units attached to particles.</description>

      <title>The formation of gradient-driven singular structures of codimension one and two in two-dimensions: The case study of ferronematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a two-dimensional variational model for ferronematics -- composite materials formed by dispersing magnetic nanoparticles into a liquid crystal matrix. The model features two coupled order parameters: a Landau-de Gennes~$\mathbf{Q}$-tensor for the liquid crystal component and a magnetisation vector field~$\mathbf{M}$, both of them governed by a Ginzburg-Landau-type energy. The energy includes a singular coupling term favouring alignment between~$\mathbf{Q}$ and~$\mathbf{M}$. We analyse the asymptotic behaviour of (not necessarily minimizing) critical points as a small parameter~$\varepsilon$ tends to zero. Our main results show that the energy concentrates along distinct singular sets: the (rescaled) energy density for the~$\mathbf{Q}$-component concentrates, to leading order, on a finite number of singular points, while the energy density for the~$\mathbf{M}$-component concentrate along a one-dimensional rectifiable set. Moreover, we prove that the curvature of the singular set for the $\M$-component (technically, the first variation of the associated varifold) is concentrated on a finite number of points, i.e.~the singular set for the~$\Q$-component.</description>

      <title>Local H\"older Regularity for Quasilinear Elliptic Equations with Mixed Local-Nonlocal Operators, Variable Exponents, and Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish local boundedness and local H\"older continuity of weak solutions to the following prototype problem:
  $$ -\operatorname{div}\left(|x|^{-2 \beta}|\nabla u|^{\mathbf{q}-2} \nabla u\right)+(-\Delta)_{p(\cdot, \cdot), \beta}^{s(\cdot, \cdot)} u=0 \quad \text { in } \quad \Omega, $$
  where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n, n \geq 2$, is a bounded domain. The nonlocal operator is defined by
  $$ (-\Delta)_{p(\cdot, \cdot), \beta}^{s(\cdot, \cdot)} u(x):=\mathrm{P} . \mathrm{V} . \int_{\Omega} \frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^{p(x, y)-2}(u(x)-u(y))}{|x-y|^{n+s(x, y) p(x, y)}} \frac{1}{|x|^\beta|y|^\beta} \mathrm{d} y $$
  Here, $p: \Omega \times \Omega \rightarrow(1, \infty)$ and $s: \Omega \times \Omega \rightarrow(0,1)$ are measurable functions, $\mathbf{q}:=\operatorname{ess}_{\Omega \times \Omega} p$, and $0 \leq \beta&lt;n$. Our approach is analytic and relies on an adaptation of the De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory to a mixed local-nonlocal framework with variable exponents and weights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23982v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel class of regularizations of the Perona-Malik equation with variable exponents, of forward-backward parabolic type, which possess a variational structure and have potential applications in image processing. The existence of Young measure solutions to the Neumann initial-boundary value problem for the proposed equation is established via Sobolev approximation and the vanishing viscosity limit. The proofs rely on Rothe's method, variational principles, and Young measure theory. The theoretical results confirm numerical observations concerning the generic behavior of solutions with suitably chosen variable exponents.</description>

      <title>Segregated Solutions to Critical Elliptic Systems in High Dimensions ($N \geq 5$)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence of multiple segregated solutions to the critical coupled Schr\"odinger system \[ \begin{cases} -\Delta u_{1} = K_1(| y|) | u_{1}|^{2^*-2}u_{1}+\beta | u_{2}|^{\frac{2^{*}}{2}}| u_{1}|^{\frac{2^{*}}{2}-2}u_{1}, &amp; y\in \mathbb R^N,\\ -\Delta u_{2} = K_2(| y|) | u_{2}|^{2^*-2}u_{2}+\beta | u_{1}|^{\frac{2^{*}}{2}}| u_{2}|^{\frac{2^{*}}{2}-2}u_{2}, &amp; y\in\mathbb R^N,\\ u_{1},u_{2}\geq0, u_{1},u_{2}\in C_0(\mathbb R^{N})\cap D^{1,2}(\mathbb R^N), \end{cases} \] with $N \geq 5$, $2^* = \frac{2N}{N-2}$, radial potentials $K_1, K_2 &gt; 0$,and repulsive coupling $\beta &lt; 0$.Under the assumption that $K_1$ and $K_2$ attain local maxima at distinct radii $r_0 \ne \rho_0$ with precise asymptotic expansions near these points, we prove the existence of infinitely many non-radial segregated solutions $(u_{1,k}, u_{2,k})$ for all sufficiently large integers $k$. These solutions exhibit multiple bumps concentrating on two separate circles of radius $r_0$ and $\rho_0$ respectively. Moreover, each component develops a "dead core'' near the concentration points of the other. The proof overcomes the sublinear and non-smooth nature of the coupling term ($2^*/2 -1 &lt; 1$) by constructing a tailored complete metric space and combining a finite-dimensional reduction with a novel tail minimization argument.</description>

      <title>On the forward self-similar solutions to the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the global existence of forward self-similar solutions to the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for any divergence-free initial velocity that is homogeneous of degree $-1$ and locally H\"older continuous. This result requires no smallness assumption on the initial data. In sharp contrast to the three-dimensional case, where $(-1)$-homogeneous vector fields are locally square-integrable, the major difficulty for the 2D problem is the criticality in the sense that the initial kinetic energy is locally infinite at the origin, and the initial vorticity fails to be locally integrable, so that the classical local energy estimates are not available. Our key ideas are to decompose the solution into a linear part solving the heat equation and a finite-energy perturbation part, and to exploit a kind of inherent cancellation relation between the linear part and the perturbation part. These, together with suitable choices of multipliers, enable us to control the interaction terms and to establish the $H^1$-estimates for the perturbation part. Furthermore, we can get an optimal pointwise estimate via investigating the corresponding Leray equations in weighted Sobolev spaces.This gives the faster decay of the perturbation part at infinity and compactness, which play important roles in proving the existence of global-in-time self-similar solutions.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability of extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in spherical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the codimension-one nonlinear asymptotic stability of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family of black holes in the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-neutral scalar field model, up to and including the event horizon. More precisely, we show that there exists a teleologically defined, codimension-one "submanifold" $\mathfrak M_\mathrm{stab}$ of the moduli space of spherically symmetric characteristic data for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field system lying close to the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family, such that any data in $\mathfrak M_\mathrm{stab}$ evolve into a solution with the following properties as time goes to infinity: (i) the metric decays to a member of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family uniformly up to the event horizon, (ii) the scalar field decays to zero pointwise and in an appropriate energy norm, (iii) the first translation-invariant ingoing null derivative of the scalar field is approximately constant on the event horizon $\mathcal H^+$, (iv) for "generic" data, the second translation-invariant ingoing null derivative of the scalar field grows linearly along the event horizon. Due to the coupling of the scalar field to the geometry via the Einstein equations, suitable components of the Ricci tensor exhibit non-decay and growth phenomena along the event horizon. Points (i) and (ii) above reflect the "stability" of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family and points (iii) and (iv) verify the presence of the celebrated "Aretakis instability" for the linear wave equation on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in the full nonlinear Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field model.</description>

      <title>A note on the $L_p$-Brunn-Minkowski inequality for intrinsic volumes and the $L_p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17896v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first goal of this paper is to improve some of the results in \cite{BCPR}. Namely, we establish the $L_p$-Brunn-Minkwoski inequality for intrinsic volumes for origin-symmetric convex bodies that are close to the ball in the $C^2$ sense for a certain range of $p&lt;1$ (including negative values) and we prove that this inequality does not hold true in the entire class of origin-symmetric convex bodies for any $p&lt;1$. The second goal is to establish a uniqueness result for the (closely related) $L_p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem. More specifically, we show uniqueness in the symmetric case when $p\in[0,1)$ and the data function $g$ in the right hand side is sufficiently close to the constant 1. One of the main ingredients of the proof is the existence of upper and lower bounds for the (convex) solution, that depend only $\|\log g\|_{L^\infty}$, a fact that might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>P\'olya's conjecture up to $\epsilon$-loss and quantitative estimates for the remainder of Weyl's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04307v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be a bounded Lipschitz domain. For any $\epsilon\in (0,1)$ we show that for any Dirichlet eigenvalue $\lambda_k(\Omega)&gt;\Lambda(\epsilon,\Omega)$, it holds \begin{align*} k&amp;\le (1+\epsilon)\frac{|\Omega|\omega(n)}{(2\pi)^n}\lambda_k(\Omega)^{n/2}, \end{align*} where $\Lambda(\epsilon,\Omega)$ is given explicitly. This reduces the $\epsilon$-loss version of P\'olya's conjecture to a computational problem. This estimate is based on quantitative estimates on the remainder of the Weyl law with explicit constants, which we give a new proof without using Neumann eigenvalues. Our arguments in deriving such uniform estimates yield also, in all dimensions $n\ge 2$, classes of domains that may even have rather irregular shapes or boundaries but satisfy P\'olya's conjecture. Another key observation is that on strip-tiling domains (and therefore any triangles for instance) one actually has better eigenvalue estimates than P\'olya conjectured.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Stability of Non-Linearly Damped Contraction Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stability properties of an abstract class of semi-linear systems. Our main result establishes rational rates of decay for classical solutions assuming a certain non-uniform observability estimate for the linear part and suitable conditions on the non-linearity. We illustrate the strength of our abstract results by applying them to a one-dimensional wave equation with weak non-linear damping and to an Euler-Bernoulli beam with a tip mass subject to non-linear damping.</description>

      <title>Milstein-type Schemes for Hyperbolic SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article studies the temporal approximation of hyperbolic semilinear stochastic evolution equations with multiplicative Gaussian noise by Milstein-type schemes. We take the term hyperbolic to mean that the leading operator generates a contractive, not necessarily analytic $C_0$-semigroup. Optimal convergence rates are derived for the pathwise uniform strong error \[
  E_h^\infty := \Big(\mathbb{E}\Big[\max_{1\le j \le M}\|U_{t_j}-u_j\|_X^p\Big]\Big)^{1/p} \] on a Hilbert space $X$ for $p\in [2,\infty)$. Here, $U$ is the mild solution and $u_j$ its Milstein approximation at time $t_j=jh$ with step size $h&gt;0$ and final time $T=Mh&gt;0$. For sufficiently regular nonlinearity and noise, we establish strong convergence of order one, with the error satisfying $E_h^\infty\lesssim h\sqrt{\log(T/h)}$ for rational Milstein schemes and $E_h^\infty \lesssim h$ for exponential Milstein schemes. This extends previous results from parabolic to hyperbolic SPDEs and from exponential to rational Milstein schemes. Moreover, root-mean-square error estimates are strengthened to pathwise uniform estimates. Numerical experiments validate the convergence rates for the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation. Further applications to Maxwell's and transport equations are included.</description>

      <title>A Unified Spectral Framework for Aging, Heterogeneous, and Distributed Order Systems via Weighted Weyl-Sonine Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While General Fractional Calculus has successfully expanded the scope of memory operators beyond power-laws, standard formulations remain predominantly restricted to the half-line via Riemann-Liouville or Caputo definitions. This constraint artificially truncates the system's history, limiting the thermodynamic consistency required for modeling processes on unbounded domains. To overcome these barriers, we construct the \textbf{Weighted Weyl-Sonine Framework}, a generalized formalism that extends non-local theory to the entire real line without history truncation.
  Unlike recent algebraic approaches based on conjugation for finite intervals, we develop a rigorous harmonic analysis framework. Our central contribution is the \textbf{Generalized Spectral Mapping Theorem}, which establishes the Weighted Fourier Transform as a unitary diagonalization map for these operators. This result allows us to rigorously classify and solve distinct physical regimes under a single algebraic structure. We explicitly derive exact solutions for \textit{diffusive relaxation} (governed by Complete Bernstein Functions), \textit{inertial wave propagation} (exhibiting oscillatory dynamics), and \textit{retarded aging} (via distributed order), proving that our framework unifies the description of anomalous transport and wave mechanics in complex, time-deformed media.</description>
