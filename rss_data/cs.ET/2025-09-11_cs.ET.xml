      <title>Qubit-Efficient QUBO Formulation for Constrained Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has emerged as a promising alternative for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The standard approach for encoding optimization problems on quantum processing units (QPUs) involves transforming them into their Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) representation. However, encoding constraints of optimization problems, particularly inequality constraints, into QUBO requires additional variables, which results in more qubits. Considering the limited availability of qubits in NISQ machines, existing encoding methods fail to scale due to their reliance on large numbers of qubits. We propose a generalized exponential penalty framework for QUBO inequality constraints inspired by a class of exponential functions, which we call exponential penalization. This paper presents an encoding strategy for inequality constraints in combinatorial optimization problems, inspired by a class of exponential functions, which we call exponential penalization. The initial idea of using exponential penalties for QUBO formulation was introduced by Montanez-Barrera et al. by applying a specific exponential function to reduce qubit requirements. In this work, we extend that approach by conducting a comprehensive study on a broader class of exponential functions, analyzing their theoretical properties and empirical performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that an exponential penalization achieves 57%, 83% qubit number reduction for Bin Packing Problem (BPP) and Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), respectively. And we demonstrate comparable solution quality to classical with a probability of 6% and 21% accuracy for BPP with 8 and TSP with 12 qubits, respectively.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Array-Aided Hybrid Beamforming for Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is one of the pivotal supporting technologies for next-generation wireless communication networks. As an emerging technical means, the new six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) system can effectively improve the communication and sensing performance of ISAC systems. However, related research on the architecture based on three-dimensional rotatable antennas (RA) remains relatively limited. Especially under the influence of non-ideal channel characteristics, how to balance system performance and hardware cost control through beamforming technology in non-ideal channels has become a crucial issue to be solved urgently. Given the significant advantages of hybrid beamforming technology in balancing system performance and hardware complexity, this paper focuses on the channel model considering effective aperture loss under the RA architecture and studies the sub-connected hybrid beamforming design for multi-user ISAC systems. Aiming at the non-convex nature with coupled variables in this problem, this paper first transforms the complex fractional objective function using the Fractional Programming (FP) framework, and then proposes an algorithm based on the Alternating Optimization (AO) architecture, which achieves optimization by alternately solving five subproblems. Among them, the closed-form update expression of the array rotation angle is derived through the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, and a two-stage Gradient Ascent (GA) based method is proposed to optimize the antenna rotation angle. Simulation results show that compared with the traditional fixed-position antenna (FPA), the proposed method can significantly improve the overall performance of the system.</description>

      <title>Lifetime-Aware Design of Item-Level Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present FlexiFlow, a lifetime-aware design framework for item-level intelligence (ILI) where computation is integrated directly into disposable products like food packaging and medical patches. Our framework leverages natively flexible electronics which offer significantly lower costs than silicon but are limited to kHz speeds and several thousands of gates. Our insight is that unlike traditional computing with more uniform deployment patterns, ILI applications exhibit 1000X variation in operational lifetime, fundamentally changing optimal architectural design decisions when considering trillion-item deployment scales. To enable holistic design and optimization, we model the trade-offs between embodied carbon footprint and operational carbon footprint based on application-specific lifetimes. The framework includes: (1) FlexiBench, a workload suite targeting sustainability applications from spoilage detection to health monitoring; (2) FlexiBits, area-optimized RISC-V cores with 1/4/8-bit datapaths achieving 2.65X to 3.50X better energy efficiency per workload execution; and (3) a carbon-aware model that selects optimal architectures based on deployment characteristics. We show that lifetime-aware microarchitectural design can reduce carbon footprint by 1.62X, while algorithmic decisions can reduce carbon footprint by 14.5X. We validate our approach through the first tape-out using a PDK for flexible electronics with fully open-source tools, achieving 30.9kHz operation. FlexiFlow enables exploration of computing at the Extreme Edge where conventional design methodologies must be reevaluated to account for new constraints and considerations.</description>

      <title>Interpretability as Alignment: Making Internal Understanding a Design Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large neural models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings, raising concerns about whether their behavior reliably aligns with human values. Interpretability provides a route to internal transparency by revealing the computations that drive outputs. We argue that interpretability especially mechanistic approaches should be treated as a design principle for alignment, not an auxiliary diagnostic tool. Post-hoc methods such as LIME or SHAP offer intuitive but correlational explanations, while mechanistic techniques like circuit tracing or activation patching yield causal insight into internal failures, including deceptive or misaligned reasoning that behavioral methods like RLHF, red teaming, or Constitutional AI may overlook. Despite these advantages, interpretability faces challenges of scalability, epistemic uncertainty, and mismatches between learned representations and human concepts. Our position is that progress on safe and trustworthy AI will depend on making interpretability a first-class objective of AI research and development, ensuring that systems are not only effective but also auditable, transparent, and aligned with human intent.</description>

      <title>The Role of Legacy Mobile Networks in Infrastructure Resilience: Evidence from the Southern Brazil Flood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the resilience of mobile communication networks during the extreme flooding that affected Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, in May 2024. Based on regulatory data and technical insights from operators, the study identifies the leading causes of mobile network disruptions, primarily related to flooding and prolonged power outages. The results reveal the significant vulnerability of modern networks (4G/5G) during the event and the essential role played by legacy technologies (2G/3G) in sustaining basic connectivity under adverse conditions. The findings underscore the necessity of disaster-aware infrastructure planning, taking into account the ongoing significance of legacy systems, diversified power supply strategies, and resilient network designs to enhance service continuity during future crises.</description>

      <title>TRMAC: A Time-Reversal-based MAC Protocol for Wireless Networks within Computing Packages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As chiplet-based integration and many-core architectures become the norm in high-performance computing, on-chip wireless communication has emerged as a compelling alternative to traditional interconnects. However, scalable Medium Access Control (MAC) remains a fundamental challenge, particularly under dense traffic and limited spectral resources. This paper presents TRMAC, a novel cross-layer MAC protocol that exploits the spatial focusing capability of Time Reversal (TR) to enable multiple parallel transmissions over a shared frequency channel. By leveraging the quasi-deterministic nature of on-chip wireless channels, TRMAC pre-characterizes channel impulse responses to coordinate access using energy-based thresholds, eliminating the need for orthogonal resource allocation or centralized arbitration. Through detailed physical-layer simulation and system-level evaluation on diverse traffic, TRMAC demonstrates comparable or superior performance to existing multi-channel MAC protocols, achieving low latency, high throughput, and strong scalability across hundreds of cores. TRMAC provides a low-complexity, high-efficiency solution for future Wireless Networks-on-Chip (WNoCs), particularly in chiplet-based systems where spatial reuse and modularity are critical. With simulations we prove that TRMAC can be utilized for parallel transmissions with a single frequency channel with a similar throughput and latency as in using multiple frequency bands omitting the need for complex transceivers. This work establishes a new design direction for MAC protocols that are tightly integrated with the underlying channel physics to meet the demands of next-generation computing platforms.</description>

      <title>FAMES: Fast Approximate Multiplier Substitution for Mixed-Precision Quantized DNNs--Down to 2 Bits!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18055v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A widely-used technique in designing energy-efficient deep neural network (DNN) accelerators is quantization. Recent progress in this direction has reduced the bitwidths used in DNN down to 2. Meanwhile, many prior works apply approximate multipliers (AppMuls) in designing DNN accelerators to lower their energy consumption. Unfortunately, these works still assume a bitwidth much larger than 2, which falls far behind the state-of-the-art in quantization area and even challenges the meaningfulness of applying AppMuls in DNN accelerators, since a high-bitwidth AppMul consumes much more energy than a low-bitwidth exact multiplier! Thus, an important problem to study is: Can approximate multipliers be effectively applied to quantized DNN models with very low bitwidths? In this work, we give an affirmative answer to this question and present a systematic solution that achieves the answer: FAMES, a fast approximate multiplier substitution method for mixed-precision DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate an average 28.67% energy reduction on state-of-the-art mixed-precision quantized models with bitwidths as low as 2 bits and accuracy losses kept under 1%. Additionally, our approach is up to 300x faster than previous genetic algorithm-based methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Assisted Vehicle Routing: Realizing QAOA-based Approach on Gate-Based Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a fundamental combinatorial optimization challenge with broad applications in logistics and transportation. In this work, we present a quantum-assisted framework that integrates the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) with a link-based formulation of VRP. Our approach encodes flow conservation and subtour elimination directly into the cost Hamiltonian, preserving graph structure while avoiding ancillary qubits. We design and implement the full pipeline on a gate-based quantum computer, including problem encoding, circuit synthesis, and execution on IBM Quantum System One. Experimental results on small VRP instances highlight the effects of penalty scaling, coefficient normalization, and circuit depth on solution feasibility under hardware noise. While scalability remains constrained by circuit complexity and decoherence, the study demonstrates a practical pathway for implementing VRP on quantum hardware and identifies methodological directions for advancing near-term quantum optimization.</description>
