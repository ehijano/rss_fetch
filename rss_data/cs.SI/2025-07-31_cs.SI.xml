      <title>Opinion formation in Wikipedia Ising networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study properties of opinion formation
  on Wikipedia Ising Networks. Each Wikipedia article
  is represented as a node and links are formed by citations of
  one article to another generating a directed network
  of a given language edition with millions of nodes.
  Ising spins are placed at each node
  and their orientation up or down is determined by a majority vote
  of connected neighbors. At the initial stage there are only
  a few nodes from two groups with fixed competing opinions up and down
  while other nodes are assumed to have no initial opinion with no
  effect on the vote. The competition of two opinions is modeled by
  an asynchronous Monte Carlo process converging to a spin polarized
  steady-state phase.
  This phase remains stable with respect to small fluctuations
  induced by an effective temperature of the Monte Carlo process.
  The opinion polarization at the steady-state provides
  opinion (spin) preferences for each node. In the framework of
  this Ising Network
  Opinion Formation model we analyze the influence and competition between
  political leaders, world countries and social concepts.
  This approach is also generalized to the competition between
  three groups of
  different opinions described by three colors, for example
  Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping or USA, Russia, China
  within English, Russian and Chinese editions of Wikipedia of March 2025.
  We argue that this approach provides a generic description of
  opinion formation in various complex networks.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models for Influence Maximization on Temporal Networks: A Guide to Make the Best Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing prominence of temporal networks in online social platforms and dynamic communication systems has made influence maximization a critical research area. Various diffusion models have been proposed to capture the spread of information, yet selecting the most suitable model for a given scenario remains challenging. This article provides a structured guide to making the best choice among diffusion models for influence maximization on temporal networks. We categorize existing models based on their underlying mechanisms and assess their effectiveness in different network settings. We analyze seed selection strategies, highlighting how the inherent properties of influence spread enable the development of efficient algorithms that can find near-optimal sets of influential nodes. By comparing key advancements, challenges, and practical applications, we offer a comprehensive roadmap for researchers and practitioners to navigate the landscape of temporal influence maximization effectively.</description>

      <title>Human Mobility in Epidemic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human mobility forms the backbone of contact patterns through which infectious diseases propagate, fundamentally shaping the spatio-temporal dynamics of epidemics and pandemics. While traditional models are often based on the assumption that all individuals have the same probability of infecting every other individual in the population, a so-called random homogeneous mixing, they struggle to capture the complex and heterogeneous nature of real-world human interactions. Recent advancements in data-driven methodologies and computational capabilities have unlocked the potential of integrating high-resolution human mobility data into epidemic modeling, significantly improving the accuracy, timeliness, and applicability of epidemic risk assessment, contact tracing, and intervention strategies. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the current landscape in human mobility-informed epidemic modeling. We explore diverse sources and representations of human mobility data, and then examine the behavioral and structural roles of mobility and contact in shaping disease transmission dynamics. Furthermore, the review spans a wide range of epidemic modeling approaches, ranging from classical compartmental models to network-based, agent-based, and machine learning models. And we also discuss how mobility integration enhances risk management and response strategies during epidemics. By synthesizing these insights, the review can serve as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners, bridging the gap between epidemiological theory and the dynamic complexities of human interaction while charting clear directions for future research.</description>

      <title>The role of media memorability in facilitating startups' access to venture capital funding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Media reputation plays an important role in attracting venture capital investment. However, prior research has focused too narrowly on general media exposure, limiting our understanding of how media truly influences funding decisions. As informed decision-makers, venture capitalists respond to more nuanced aspects of media content. We introduce the concept of media memorability - the media's ability to imprint a startup's name in the memory of relevant investors. Using data from 197 UK startups in the micro and nanotechnology sector (funded between 1995 and 2004), we show that media memorability significantly influences investment outcomes. Our findings suggest that venture capitalists rely on detailed cues such as a startup's distinctiveness and connectivity within news semantic networks. This contributes to research on entrepreneurial finance and media legitimation. In practice, startups should go beyond frequent media mentions to strengthen brand memorability through more targeted, meaningful coverage highlighting their uniqueness and relevance within the broader industry conversation.</description>

      <title>From News Source Sharers to Post Viewers: How Topic Diversity and Conspiracy Theories Shape Engagement With Misinformation During a Health Crisis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online engagement with misinformation threatens societal well-being, particularly during health crises when susceptibility to misinformation is heightened in a multi-topic context. Here, we focus on the COVID-19 pandemic and address a critical gap in understanding engagement with multi-topic misinformation on social media at two user levels: news source sharers (who post news items) and post viewers (who engage with news posts). To this end, we analyze 7273 fact-checked source news items and their associated posts on X through the lens of topic diversity and conspiracy theories. We find that false news, especially those containing conspiracy theories, exhibits higher topic diversity than true news. At news source sharer level, false news has a longer lifetime and receives more posts on X than true news, with conspiracy theories further extending its longevity. However, topic diversity does not significantly influence news source sharers' engagement. At post viewer level, contrary to news source sharer level, posts characterized by heightened topic diversity receive more reposts, likes, and replies. Notably, post viewers tend to engage more with misinformation containing conspiracy narratives: false news posts that contain conspiracy theories, on average, receive 40.8% more reposts, 45.2% more likes, and 44.1% more replies compared to those without conspiracy theories. Our findings suggest that news source sharers and post viewers exhibit distinct engagement patterns on X, offering valuable insights into refining misinformation interventions at these two user levels.</description>

      <title>Masked Language Models are Good Heterogeneous Graph Generalizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) excel at capturing structural and semantic information in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), while struggling to generalize across domains and tasks. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), a recent study explored the integration of HGNNs with LLMs for generalizable heterogeneous graph learning. However, this approach typically encodes structural information as HG tokens using HGNNs, and disparities in embedding spaces between HGNNs and LLMs have been shown to bias the LLM's comprehension of HGs. Moreover, since these HG tokens are often derived from node-level tasks, the model's ability to generalize across tasks remains limited. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective Masked Language Modeling-based method, called MLM4HG. MLM4HG introduces metapath-based textual sequences instead of HG tokens to extract structural and semantic information inherent in HGs, and designs customized textual templates to unify different graph tasks into a coherent cloze-style 'mask' token prediction paradigm. Specifically,MLM4HG first converts HGs from various domains to texts based on metapaths, and subsequently combines them with the unified task texts to form a HG-based corpus. Moreover, the corpus is fed into a pretrained LM for fine-tuning with a constrained target vocabulary, enabling the fine-tuned LM to generalize to unseen target HGs. Extensive cross-domain and multi-task experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superior generalization performance of MLM4HG over state-of-the-art methods in both few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/MLM4HG.</description>

      <title>Long-Time and Short-Time Dynamics in a Weighted-Median Opinion Model on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social interactions influence people's opinions. In some situations, these interactions eventually yield a consensus opinion; in others, they can lead to opinion fragmentation and the formation of different opinion groups in the form of ``echo chambers''. Consider a social network of individuals with continuous-valued scalar opinions, and suppose that they can change their opinions when they interact with each other. In many models of the opinion dynamics of individuals in a network, it is common for opinion updates to depend on the mean opinion of interacting individuals. As an alternative, which may be more realistic in some situations, we study an opinion model with an opinion-update rule that depends on the weighted median of the opinions of interacting individuals. Through numerical simulations of our median-update opinion model, we investigate how the final opinion distribution depends on network structure. For configuration-model networks, we also derive a mean-field approximation for the asymptotic dynamics of the opinion distribution when there are infinitely many individuals. We numerically investigate its accuracy for short-time opinion dynamics on various networks.</description>

      <title>User Location Disclosure Fails to Deter Overseas Criticism but Amplifies Regional Divisions on Chinese Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the behavioral effects of a user location disclosure policy implemented by Sina Weibo, China's largest microblogging platform, using a high-frequency dataset of uncensored user engagement, including tens of thousands of comments, on 165 prominent government and media accounts. Exploiting the platform's abrupt rollout of IP-based location tags on April 28, 2022, we compare user behavior in comment sections before and after the policy change. Although the policy was publicly justified as a measure to curb misinformation and counter foreign influence, we find no decline in participation by overseas users. Instead, it significantly reduced domestic engagement with local issues outside users' home provinces, particularly among critical comments. Evidence suggests this effect was not driven by generalized fear or concerns about credibility, but by a rise in regionally discriminatory replies that increased the social cost of cross-provincial engagement. Our findings indicate that identity disclosure tools can produce unintended consequences by activating existing social divisions in ways that reinforce state control without direct censorship.</description>
