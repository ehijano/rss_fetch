      <title>A conditional algebraic proof of the logarithmic Kazhdan-Lusztig correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The logarithmic Kazhdan-Lusztig correspondence is a conjectural equivalence between braided tensor categories of representations of small quantum groups and representations of certain vertex operator algebras.
  In this article we prove such an equivalence, and more general versions, using mainly algebraic arguments that characterize the representation category of the quantum group by quantities that are accessible on the vertex algebra side. Our proof is conditional on suitable analytic properties of the vertex algebra and its representation category. More precisely, we assume that it is a finite braided rigid monoidal category where the Frobenius-Perron dimensions are given by asymptotics of analytic characters.</description>

      <title>Pre-Calabi-Yau algebras and oriented gravity properad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dual cyclic Hochschild complex $Cyc^\bullet(A,\mathbb{K})$ of a (possibly, infinite-dimensional) $A_\infty$-algebra $(A,\mu)$ and prove that any pre-Calabi-Yau extension $\pi$ of the given $A_\infty$ structure $\mu$ in $A$ induces on the cyclic cohomology of $(A,\mu)$ a representation of a new dg properad of oriented ribbon graphs. We compute the cohomology of that properad in terms of the compactly supported cohomology groups of moduli spaces $\mathcal{M}_{g,m+n}$ of algebraic curves of genus $g$ with $m+n$ marked points.
  We also show that the gravity operad acts naturally on the higher Hochschild cohomology of any pre-CY algebra $(A, \pi)$.</description>

      <title>A Conjecture of Warnaar-Zudilin from Deformations of Lie Superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a collection of $q$-series identities conjectured by Warnaar and Zudilin and appearing in recent work with H. Kim in the context of superconformal field theory. Our proof utilizes a deformation of the simple affine vertex operator superalgebra $L_k(\mathfrak{osp}_{1|2n})$ into the principal subsuperspace of $L_k(\mathfrak{sl}_{1|2n+1})$ in a manner analogous to earlier work of Feigin-Stoyanovsky. This result fills a gap left by Stoyanovsky, showing that for all positive integers $N$, $k$ the character of the principal subspace of type $A_N$ at level $k$ can be identified with the (super)character of a simple affine vertex operator (super)algebra at the same level.</description>

      <title>Matched pairs and Yang-Baxter operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Ferri and Sciandra introduced two equivalent algebraic structures, matched pair of actions on an arbitrary Hopf algebra and Yetter-Drinfeld brace. In fact, they equivalently produce braiding operators satisfying the braid equation, thus generalize the construction of Yang-Baxter operators by Lu, Yan and Zhu from braiding operators on groups, and also by Angiono, Galindo and Vendramin from cocommutative Hopf braces. In this paper, we provide equivalence conditions for such kind of Yang-Baxter operators to be involutive. Particularly, we give a positive answer for an open problem raised by Ferri and Sciandra, namely, a matched pair of actions on a Hopf algebra $H$ induces an involutive Yang-Baxter operator if and only if its intrinsic Hopf algebra in the category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over $H$ is braided commutative. As an illustration, we use a simplified characterization to classify matched pairs of actions on the 8-dimensional non-semisimple Hopf algebra $A_{C_2\times C_2}$ and analyze the associated Yang-Baxter operators to find that they are all involutive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of the Kauffman bracket skein algebra of a surface that is generated by loops and arcs between marked points on the interior or boundary, up to skein relations defined by Muller and Roger-Yang. We compute the center of this Muller-Roger-Yang skein algebra and show that it is almost Azumaya when the quantum parameter $q$ is a primitive $n$-th root of unity with odd $n$. We also discuss the implications on the representation theory of the Muller-Roger-Yang generalized skein algebra.</description>

      <title>Nijenhuis operators and mock-Lie bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Nijenhuis mock-Lie algebra is a mock-Lie algebra equipped with a Nijenhuis operator. The purpose of this paper is to extend the well-known results about Nijenhuis mock-Lie algebras to the realm of mock-Lie bialgebras. It aims to characterize Nijenhuis mock-Lie bialgebras by generalizing the concepts of matched pairs and Manin triples of mock-Lie algebras to the context of Nijenhuis mock-Lie algebras. Moreover, we discuss formal deformation theory and explore infinitesimal formal deformations of Nijenhuis mock-Lie algebras, demonstrating that the associated cohomology corresponds to a deformation cohomology. Moreover, we define abelian extensions of Nijenhuis mock-Lie algebras and show that equivalence classes of such extensions are linked to cohomology groups. The coboundary case leads to the introduction of an admissible mock-Lie-Yang-Baxter equation (mLYBe) in Nijenhuis mock-Lie algebras, for which the antisymmetric solutions give rise to Nijenhuis mock-Lie bialgebras. Furthermore, the notion of $\mathcal O$-operator on Nijenhuis mock-Lie algebras is introduced and connected to mock-Lie-Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

Abstract: By using characteristic cycles, we build a morphism from the canonical bases of integrable highest weight modules of quantum groups to the top Borel-Moore homology groups of Nakajima's quiver and tensor product varieties, and compare the canonical bases and the fundamental classes. As an application, we show that Nakajima's realization of irreducible highest weight modules and their tensor products can be defined over integers. We also prove Nakajima's conjecture on the canonical isomorphism of tensor product varieties.</description>

      <title>Extending structures for anti-dendriform algebras and anti-dendriform bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first explore the extending structures problem by the unified product for anti-dendriform algebras. In particular,the crossed product and non-abelian extension are studied. Furthermore, we explore the inducibility problem of pairs of automorphisms associated with a non-abelian extension of anti-dendriform algebras, and derive the fundamental sequences of Wells. Then we introduce the bicrossed products and matched pairs of anti-dendriform algebras to solve the factorization problem. Finally, we introduce the notion of anti-dendriform D-bialgebras as the bialgebra structures corresponding to double construction of associative algebras with respect to the commutative Cone cocycles. Both of them are interpreted in terms of certain matched pairs of associative algebras as well as the compatible anti-dendriform algebras. The study of coboundary cases leads to the introduction of the AD-YBE, whose skew-symmetric solutions give coboundary anti-dendriform D-bialgebras. The notion of O-operators of anti-dendriform algebras is introduced to construct skew-symmetric solutions of the AD-YBE. We also characterize the relationship between the skew-symmetric solutions of AD-YBE and O-operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the families of bialgebras or Hopf algebras over fields for which the product in the corresponding category is finite-dimensional, answering a question of M. Lorenz: if the ground field is infinite then bialgebra or Hopf products are finite-dimensional precisely when the factors are, with at most one of dimension $&gt;1$; over finite fields the necessary and sufficient condition is instead that factors be finite-dimensional with at most finitely many of dimension $&gt;1$; finally, these statements hold for coalgebras as well, provided the family is finite. We also characterize (a) finite field extensions as precisely those whose underlying scalar extension functor preserves coalgebra, or bialgebra, or Hopf algebra products (correcting an error in the literature); (b) algebraic field extensions as those along which finite coalgebra (bialgebra, Hopf algebra) products are preserved; and (c) again algebraic field extensions as precisely those which intertwine cofree coalgebras on vector spaces, or cofree bialgebras (Hopf algebras) on algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on semiprime skew left braces provided by semidirect products. We show that if a semidirect product $B_1\rtimes B_2$ is semiprime and $B_1$ is Artinian, then $B_1$ must be semiprime. Moreover, we prove that the semidirect product of strongly semiprime skew left braces is strongly semiprime. Finally, following \cite[Question $1$]{smoktunowicz2024more}, we provide examples of skew left braces of abelian type that are non-simple and strongly prime.</description>

      <title>$N=1$ super Virasoro tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the category of $C_1$-cofinite modules for the universal $N=1$ super Virasoro vertex operator superalgebra $\mathcal{S}(c,0)$ at any central charge $c$ is locally finite and admits the vertex algebraic braided tensor category structure of Huang-Lepowsky-Zhang. For central charges $c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t)=\frac{15}{2}-3(t+t^{-1})$ with $t\notin\mathbb{Q}$, we show that this tensor category is semisimple, rigid, and slightly degenerate, and we determine its fusion rules. For central charge $c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(1)=\frac{3}{2}$, we show that this tensor category is rigid and that its simple modules have the same fusion rules as $\mathrm{Rep}\,\mathfrak{osp}(1\vert 2)$, in agreement with earlier fusion rule calculations of Milas. Finally, for the remaining central charges $c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t)$ with $t\in\mathbb{Q}^\times$, we show that the simple $\mathcal{S}(c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t),0)$-module $\mathcal{S}_{2,2}$ of lowest conformal weight $h^{\mathfrak{ns}}_{2,2}(t)=\frac{3(t-1)^2}{8t}$ is rigid and self-dual, except possibly when $t^{\pm 1}$ is a negative integer or when $c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t)$ is the central charge of a rational $N=1$ superconformal minimal model.
  As $\mathcal{S}_{2,2}$ is expected to generate the category of $C_1$-cofinite $\mathcal{S}(c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t),0)$-modules under fusion, rigidity of $\mathcal{S}_{2,2}$ is the first key step to proving rigidity of this category for general $t\in\mathbb{Q}^\times$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article develops a theory of cell combinatorics and cell 2-representations for differential graded 2-categories. We introduce two types of partial preorders, called the strong and weak preorder. We then analyse and compare them. The weak preorder is more easily tractable, while the strong preorder is more closely related to the combinatorics of the associated homotopy 2-representations. To each left cell, we associate a maximal ideal spectrum, and each maximal ideal gives rise to a differential graded cell 2-representation. We prove that any strong cell is contained in a weak cell and that there is a bijection between the corresponding maximal ideal spectra. Finally, we classify weak and strong cell 2-representations for dg 2-categories of projective bimodules over finite-dimensional differential graded algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a number of results linking properties of actions by compact groups (both quantum and classical) on Banach spaces, such as uniform continuity, spectrum finiteness and extensibility of the actions across several constructions. Examples include: (a) a unitary representation of a compact quantum group induces a continuous action on the $C^*$-algebra of bounded operators if and only if it has finitely many isotypic components, and hence is uniformly continuous; (b) a compact quantum group is finite if and only if its continuous actions on $C^*$-algebras lift to continuous actions on either the multiplier algebras or von Neumann envelopes thereof; (c) a (classical) locally compact group $\mathbb{G}$ is discrete if and only if the forgetful functor from $\mathbb{G}$-acted-upon compact $T_2$ spaces back to compact $T_2$ spaces creates coproducts; (d) a representation of a linearly reductive quantum group has finitely many isotypic components if and only if its restrictions to two topologically-generating quantum subgroups, one of which is normal, do; (e) equivalent characterizations of uniform continuity for actions of compact groups on Banach spaces, e.g. that such an action is uniformly continuous if and only if its restrictions to a pro-torus and to pro-$p$ subgroups are.</description>

      <title>Quantum cellular automata and categorical dualities of spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dualities play a central role in the study of quantum spin chains, providing insight into the structure of quantum phase diagrams and phase transitions. In this work we study categorical dualities, which are defined as bounded-spread isomorphisms between algebras of symmetry-respecting local operators on a spin chain. We consider generalized global symmetries that correspond to unitary fusion categories, which are represented by matrix-product operator algebras. A fundamental question about dualities is whether they can be extended to quantum cellular automata on the larger algebra generated by all local operators that respect the unit matrix-product operator. For conventional global symmetries, which are on-site representations of finite groups, this larger algebra is simply the tensor product of algebras associated to individual spins in the chain. We present a solution to the extension problem using the machinery of Doplicher-Haag-Roberts bimodules. Our solution provides a crisp categorical criterion for when an extension of a duality exists. We show that the set of possible extensions form a torsor over the invertible objects in the relevant symmetry category. As a corollary, we obtain a classification result concerning dualities in the group case.</description>

      <title>Langlands Duality and Invariant Differential Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Langlands duality is one of the most influential topics in mathematical research. It has many different appearances and influential subtopics. Yet there is a topic that until now seems unrelated to the Langlands program. That is the topic of invariant differential operators. That is strange since both items are deeply rooted in Harish-Chandra's representation theory of semisimple Lie groups. In this paper we start building the bridge between the two programs.</description>

      <title>Highest weight vectors, shifted topological recursion and quantum curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the theory of topological recursion by considering Airy structures whose partition functions are highest weight vectors of particular $\mathcal{W}$-algebra representations. Such highest weight vectors arise as partition functions of Airy structures only under certain conditions on the representations. In the spectral curve formulation of topological recursion, we show that this generalization amounts to adding specific terms to the correlators $ \omega_{g,1}$, which leads to a ``shifted topological recursion'' formula. We then prove that the wave-functions constructed from this shifted version of topological recursion are WKB solutions of families of quantizations of the spectral curve with $ \hbar$-dependent terms. In the reverse direction, starting from an $\hbar$-connection, we find that it is of topological type if the exact same conditions that we found for the Airy structures are satisfied. When this happens, the resulting shifted loop equations can be solved by the shifted topological recursion obtained earlier.</description>

      <title>Affine highest weight structures on module categories over quiver Hecke algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the category of finitely generated graded modules over the quiver Hecke algebra of arbitrary type admits numerous stratifications in the sense of Kleshchev. A direct consequence is that the full subcategory corresponding to the quantum unipotent subgroup associated with any Weyl group element is an affine highest weight category. Our results significantly generalize earlier works by Kato, Brundan, Kleshchev, McNamara and Muth. The key ingredient is a realization of standard modules via determinantial modules. We utilize the technique of R-matrices to study these standard modules.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sampling for Pauli Measurement-Based Shadow Tomography in Direct Fidelity Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A constant number of random Clifford measurements allows the classical shadow protocol to perform Direct Fidelity Estimation (DFE) with high precision. However, estimating properties of an unknown quantum state is expected to be more feasible with random Pauli measurements than with random Clifford measurements in the near future. Inspired by the importance sampling technique applied to sampling Pauli measurements for DFE, we show that similar strategies can be derived from classical shadows. Specifically, we describe efficient methods using Pauli measurements to perform DFE with GHZ and W states, establishing tighter bounds ($\approx \times 14.22$ for GHZ, $\approx \times 16$ for W) on the number of measurements required for desired precision.</description>

      <title>Simple algebras and exact module categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We verify a conjecture of Etingof and Ostrik, stating that an algebra object in a finite tensor category is exact if and only if it is a finite direct product of simple algebras. Towards that end, we introduce an analogue of the Jacobson radical of an algebra object, similar to the Jacobson radical of a finite-dimensional algebra. We give applications of our main results in the context of incompressible finite symmetric tensor categories.</description>
