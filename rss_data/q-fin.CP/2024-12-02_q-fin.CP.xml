      <title>GRU-PFG: Extract Inter-Stock Correlation from Stock Factors with Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of stocks and industries presents challenges for stock prediction. Currently, stock prediction models can be divided into two categories. One category, represented by GRU and ALSTM, relies solely on stock factors for prediction, with limited effectiveness. The other category, represented by HIST and TRA, incorporates not only stock factors but also industry information, industry financial reports, public sentiment, and other inputs for prediction. The second category of models can capture correlations between stocks by introducing additional information, but the extra data is difficult to standardize and generalize. Considering the current state and limitations of these two types of models, this paper proposes the GRU-PFG (Project Factors into Graph) model. This model only takes stock factors as input and extracts inter-stock correlations using graph neural networks. It achieves prediction results that not only outperform the others models relies solely on stock factors, but also achieve comparable performance to the second category models. The experimental results show that on the CSI300 dataset, the IC of GRU-PFG is 0.134, outperforming HIST's 0.131 and significantly surpassing GRU and Transformer, achieving results better than the second category models. Moreover as a model that relies solely on stock factors, it has greater potential for generalization.</description>

      <title>Deep learning interpretability for rough volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning methods have become a widespread toolbox for pricing and calibration of financial models. While they often provide new directions and research results, their `black box' nature also results in a lack of interpretability. We provide a detailed interpretability analysis of these methods in the context of rough volatility - a new class of volatility models for Equity and FX markets. Our work sheds light on the neural network learned inverse map between the rough volatility model parameters, seen as mathematical model inputs and network outputs, and the resulting implied volatility across strikes and maturities, seen as mathematical model outputs and network inputs. This contributes to building a solid framework for a safer use of neural networks in this context and in quantitative finance more generally.</description>

      <title>Dynamic ETF Portfolio Optimization Using enhanced Transformer-Based Models for Covariance and Semi-Covariance Prediction(Work in Progress)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the use of Transformer-based models to predict both covariance and semi-covariance matrices for ETF portfolio optimization. Traditional portfolio optimization techniques often rely on static covariance estimates or impose strict model assumptions, which may fail to capture the dynamic and non-linear nature of market fluctuations. Our approach leverages the power of Transformer models to generate adaptive, real-time predictions of asset covariances, with a focus on the semi-covariance matrix to account for downside risk. The semi-covariance matrix emphasizes negative correlations between assets, offering a more nuanced approach to risk management compared to traditional methods that treat all volatility equally.
  Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that Transformer-based predictions of both covariance and semi-covariance significantly enhance portfolio performance. Our results show that portfolios optimized using the semi-covariance matrix outperform those optimized with the standard covariance matrix, particularly in volatile market conditions. Moreover, the use of the Sortino ratio, a risk-adjusted performance metric that focuses on downside risk, further validates the effectiveness of our approach in managing risk while maximizing returns.
  These findings have important implications for asset managers and investors, offering a dynamic, data-driven framework for portfolio construction that adapts more effectively to shifting market conditions. By integrating Transformer-based models with the semi-covariance matrix for improved risk management, this research contributes to the growing field of machine learning in finance and provides valuable insights for optimizing ETF portfolios.</description>
