      <title>On Gautschi &amp; Stirling Identities, Asymptotics and Inequalities for the Pi (or Gamma) Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive two-sided bounds for a class of Stirling-type asymptotic formulas for piecewise logarithmic interpolations of the pi function, and hence also for the factorials and the gamma functions. The bounds are derived by first proving some integral identity versions of Gautschi's inequality and a class of Stirling-type asymptotic formulas, and then bounding these integrals by asymptotically optimal bounds. Additionally, all the proofs given rely only on common elementary arguments and connect, generalise and possibly improve various results that have been published previously. Lastly, we provide numerical comparisons concerning the effectiveness and behaviour of the bounds and approximations in a graphical manner, which clearly indicate that the bounds are asymptotically optimal.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on eigenvalue spacing for decaying potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study decaying half-line Schr\"odinger operators and the local eigenvalue spacing of their Dirichlet restrictions. While absolutely continuous spectrum is strongly associated with bulk universality and clock behavior, singular spectral measures can correspond to varied local behaviors. In this work, the rate of decay of the potential is shown to give upper bounds for the spacing of Dirichlet eigenvalues on finite intervals.</description>

      <title>Wave Packets and Eigenvalue Estimates for Limiting Operators on the Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional spatio-spectral limiting operators \[ T_R := P_{D(R)} B_S P_{D(R)} : L^2(\mathbb{R}^2) \rightarrow L^2(\mathbb{R}^2), \] where $D(R)$ is a disk of radius $R&gt;1$, $S\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ is a domain with well-shaped boundary, $P_{D(R)}$ is the orthogonal projection on the subspace of functions supported on $D(R)$, and $B_S$ is the orthogonal projection on the subspace of functions whose Fourier transform is supported on $S$. We construct a disk-adapted wave-packet frame for $L^2(D(R))$ with frame bounds uniform in $R$ using Gevrey-$s$ cutoffs ($s&gt;1$) to obtain near-exponential Fourier localization. Exploiting these localization estimates, we bound the size of the eigenvalue plunge-region for $T_R$ and prove that for each $s&gt;1$ and each $\varepsilon\in(0,1/2)$, \[ \#\{k : \lambda_k(T_R)\in(\varepsilon,1-\varepsilon)\} = O\!\left(R (\log(R/\varepsilon))^{1+2s}\right), \] with constants depending on $s$ and the geometric parameters of $S$. This bound improves existing plunge-region estimates in the classical setting where both domains are disks, when $\varepsilon$ scales like $R^{-\nu}$ for a fixed $\nu &gt; 0$. By an affine transformation, the same result holds if $D(R)$ is a scaled ellipse.</description>

      <title>Irrationality of rapidly converging series: a problem of Erd\H{o}s and Graham</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Answering a question of Erd\H{o}s and Graham, we show that the double exponential growth condition $\limsup_{n\to\infty}a_n^{1/\phi^n}=\infty$ for a monotonically increasing sequence of positive integers $\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$, together with the bound $a_n a_{n+1}\geq n^{1+\tau}$, is sufficient for the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/(a_n a_{n+1})$ to have an irrational sum; here $\phi$ denotes the golden ratio $(1+\sqrt{5})/2$ and $\tau&gt;0$. We also provide a positive generalization to $\sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/(a_n^{w_0}\cdots a_{n+d-1}^{w_{d-1}})$, and a negative result showing that some of its instances are essentially optimal. The original problem was autonomously solved by the AI agent \emph{Aletheia}, powered by Gemini Deep Think, while the remaining material is largely a product of human-AI interactions.</description>

      <title>Weighted Sobolev Spaces and Distributional Spectral Theory for Generalized Aging Operators via Transmutation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral analysis of operators in heterogeneous and aging media typically requires a functional framework that extends beyond the standard Hilbertian setting. In this paper, we establish a rigorous distributional theory for a class of non-local operators, termed Weighted Weyl-Sonine operators, by employing a structure-preserving transmutation method. We construct the Weighted Schwartz Space $\mathcal{S}_{\psi,\omega}$ and its topological dual, the space of Weighted Tempered Distributions $\mathcal{S}'_{\psi,\omega}$, ensuring that the underlying Fr\'echet topology is consistent with the infinitesimal generator of the aging dynamics. This topological foundation allows us to: (i) extend the Weighted Fourier Transform to generalized functions as a unitary isomorphism; (ii) provide an explicit spectral characterization of the weighted Dirac delta $\delta_{\psi,\omega}$ and its scaling laws under geometric dilations; and (iii) introduce a scale of Weighted Sobolev Spaces $H^{s}_{\psi,\omega}$ defined via spectral multipliers. A central result is the derivation of a sharp embedding theorem, $|u(t)| \le C \omega(t)^{-1} \|u\|_{H^s_{\psi,\omega}}$, which rigorously connects abstract spectral energy to the pointwise decay induced by the weight $\omega$. This framework provides a unified geometric characterization of several fractional regimes, including the Hadamard and Riemann-Liouville cases, within a single operator-theoretic architecture.</description>

      <title>On the Asymptotics of Orthogonal Polynomials on Multiple Intervals with Non-Analytic Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18656v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials for measures that are differentiable, but not necessarily analytic, multiplicative perturbations of Jacobi-like measures supported on disjoint intervals. We analyze the Fokas-Its-Kitaev Riemann-Hilbert problem using the Deift-Zhou method of nonlinear steepest descent and its $\overline{\partial}$ extension due to Miller and McLaughlin. Our results extend that of Yattselev in the case of Chebyshev-like measures with error bounds that give similar rates while allowing less regular perturbations. For the general Jacobi-like case, we present, what appears to be the first result for asymptotics when the perturbation of the measure is only assumed to be differentiable with bounded second derivative.</description>

      <title>From Complex--Analytic Models to Dyadic Methods: A Real--Variable Approach to Hypersingular Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24972v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Cheng--Fang--Wang--Yu on the hypersingular Bergman projection, we develop a real-variable, dyadic framework for hypersingular operators in regimes where strong-type bounds fail on the critical line. Our main new input is what we call the Forelli--Rudin method: a dyadic real-variable mechanism, inspired by complex-analytic Forelli--Rudin type arguments, that provides a flexible way to obtain critical-line and endpoint estimates for general hypersingular operators.
  In the unit disc setting with $1&lt;t&lt;3/2$, we obtain a full characterization of the $(p,q)$ mapping theory for the dyadic hypersingular maximal operator $\mathcal M_t^{\mathcal D}$, in particular including estimates on the critical line $1/q-1/p=2t-2$ and a weighted endpoint criterion in the radial setting. In addition, we establish a novel two-weight estimate for $\mathcal M_t^{\mathcal D}$ in the range $p&gt;q$, valid for any $t&gt;0$. We also prove endpoint estimates for the hypersingular Bergman projection \[ K_{2t}f(z)=\int_{\mathbb D}\frac{f(w)}{(1-z\overline w)^{2t}}\,dA(w), \] with particular emphasis on the weak-type bound at the endpoint $(p,q)=\bigl(\tfrac{1}{3-2t},1\bigr)$. Finally, we introduce a class of hypersingular cousin of sparse operators in $\mathbb R^n$ associated with graded sparse families, quantified by the sparseness $\eta$ and a new structural parameter (the degree) $K_{\mathcal S}$, and we characterize the corresponding strong and weak type regimes in terms of $(n,t,\eta,K_{\mathcal S})$.
  Our real-variable perspective addresses an inquiry raised by Cheng--Fang--Wang--Yu on developing effective real-analytic tools in the hypersingular regime for both $\mathcal M_t^{\mathcal D}$ and $K_{2t}$, and it also provides a new route toward the critical-line analysis of Forelli--Rudin type operators and related hypersingular operators in both real and complex settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.03391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse a certain family of cellular integrals, which are period integrals on the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{0,8}$ of curves of genus zero with eight marked points, and give rise to simultaneous rational approximations to $\zeta(3)$ and $\zeta(5)$. By exploiting the action of a large symmetry group on these integrals, we construct an infinite $effective$ sequence of rational approximations $p/q$ to $\zeta(5)$ satisfying \[ 0&lt;\bigg|\zeta(5)-\frac pq\bigg|&lt;\frac1{q^{0.86}}. \]</description>

      <title>Global weak solution of 3-D focusing energy-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we prove the existence of global weak solutions to the three-dimensional focusing energy-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation in the non-radial case. Furthermore, we prove the weak-strong uniqueness for some class of initial data. The main ingredient of our new approach is to use solutions of an energy-critical Ginzburg-Landau equation as approximations for the corresponding nonlinear Sch\"ordinger equation.
  In our proofs, we first show the dichotomy of global well-posedness versus finite time blow-up of energy-critical Ginzburg-Landau equation in $\dot{H}^1( \mathbb{R}^d)$ for $d = 3,4 $ when the energy is less than the energy of the stationary solution $W$. We follow the strategy of C. E. Kenig and F. Merle [25,26], using a concentration-compactness/rigidity argument to reduce the global well-posedness to the exclusion of a critical element. The critical element is ruled out by dissipation of the Ginzburg-Landau equation, including local smoothness, backwards uniqueness and unique continuation. The existence of global weak solution of the three dimensional focusing energy-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in the non-radial case then follows from the global well-posedness of the energy-critical Ginzburg-Landau equation via a limitation argument. We also adapt the arguments of M. Struwe [37,38] to prove the weak-strong uniqueness when the $\dot{H}^1$-norm of the initial data is bounded by a constant depending on the stationary solution $W$.</description>

      <title>Counting domino and lozenge tilings of reduced domains with Pad\'{e}-type approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new method for studying gap probabilities in a class of discrete determinantal point processes with double contour integral kernels. This class of point processes includes uniform measures of domino and lozenge tilings as well as their doubly periodic generalizations. We use a Fourier series approach to simplify the form of the kernels and to characterize gap probabilities in terms of Riemann-Hilbert problems.
  As a first illustration of our approach, we obtain an explicit expression for the number of domino tilings of reduced Aztec diamonds in terms of Pad\'e approximants, by solving the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem explicitly. As a second application, we obtain an explicit expression for the number of lozenge tilings of (simply connected) reduced hexagons in terms of Hermite-Pad\'e approximants. For more complicated domains, such as hexagons with holes, the number of tilings involves a generalization of Hermite-Pad\'e approximants.</description>
