      <title>Optimal dual frames and dual pairs for probability modelled erasures using weighted average of operator norm and spectral radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prime focus of this paper is the study of optimal duals of a given finite frame as well as optimal dual pairs, in the context of probability modelled erasures of frame coefficients. We characterize optimal dual frames (and dual pairs) which, among all dual frames (and dual pairs), minimize the maximum measure of the error operator obtained while considering all possible locations of probabilistic erasures of frame coefficients in the reconstruction with respect to each dual frame(dual pair). For a given weight number sequence associated with the probabilities, the measure of the probabilistic error operator is taken to be the weighted average of the operator norm and the spectral radius. Using this as an optimality measure, the existence and uniqueness of optimal dual frames (and optimal dual pairs) and their topological properties are studied. Also, their relations with probabilistic optimal dual frames as well as dual pairs in other contexts, such as those obtained using operator norm and spectral radius as the measure of the error operator, are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamical bounds for long-range operators with skew-shift potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ Weyl's method and Vinogradov's method to analyze skew-shift dynamics on semi-algebraic sets. Consequently, we improve the quantum dynamical upper bounds of Jitomirskaya-Powell, Liu, and Shamis-Sodin for long-range operators with skew-shift potentials.</description>

      <title>New matrix perturbation bounds and applications I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20207v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix perturbation bounds (such as Weyl and Davis-Kahan) are frequently used in many branches of mathematics. Most of the classical results in this area are optimal, in the worst case analysis. However, in modern applications, both the ground and the nose matrices frequently have extra structural properties. For instance, it is often assumed that the ground matrix is essentially low rank, and the nose matrix is random or pseudo-random. We aim to rebuild a part of perturbation theory, adapting to these modern assumptions. The key idea to to exploit the skewness between the leading eigenvectors of the ground matrix and the noise matrix. We will do this by combining the classical contour integration method with new combinatorial ideas, resulting in a new machinery, which has a wide range of applications. Our new bounds are optimal under mild assumptions, with direct applications to central problems in many different areas. Among others, we derive a sharp result for the perturbation of a low rank matrix with random perturbation, answering an open question in this area. Next, we derive new, optimal, results concerning covariance estimator of the spiked model, an important model in statistics, bridging two different directions of current research. Finally, we use our results on the perturbation of eigenspaces to derive new results concerning eigenvalues of deterministic and random matrices. In particular, we obtain new results concerning the outliers in the deformed Wigner model and the least singular value of random matrices with non-zero mean.</description>

      <title>Global Spectral Gap in Bosonic Molecular Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04640v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a neutral bosonic molecule in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation without spin and assume the physically obvious assertion that a neutral molecule prefers to break into smaller neutral clusters. We prove the existence of a global in space/uniform spectral gap between the ground state and first excited state energies. To do so, we improve upon previous results using a different tool, the time-independent Feshbach-Schur map.</description>
