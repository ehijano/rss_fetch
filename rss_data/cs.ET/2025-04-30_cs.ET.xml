      <title>Evaluation of Switching Technologies for Reflective and Transmissive RISs at Sub-THz Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the upcoming 6G wireless networks, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces are an essential technology, enabling dynamic beamforming and signal manipulation in both reflective and transmissive modes. It is expected to utilize frequency bands in the millimeter-wave and THz, which presents unique opportunities but also significant challenges. The selection of switching technologies that can support high-frequency operation with minimal loss and high efficiency is particularly complex. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of advanced components such as Schottky diodes, memristor switches, liquid metal-based switches, phase change materials, and RF-SOI technology in RIS designs as an alternative to overcome limitations inherent in traditional technologies in D-band (110-170 GHz).</description>

      <title>Cybersecurity for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of autonomous vehicles is bringing a major shift in the automotive industry. However, as these vehicles become more connected, cybersecurity threats have emerged as a serious concern. Protecting the security and integrity of autonomous systems is essential to prevent malicious activities that can harm passengers, other road users, and the overall transportation network. This paper focuses on addressing the cybersecurity issues in autonomous vehicles by examining the challenges and risks involved, which are important for building a secure future. Since autonomous vehicles depend on the communication between sensors, artificial intelligence, external infrastructure, and other systems, they are exposed to different types of cyber threats. A cybersecurity breach in an autonomous vehicle can cause serious problems, including a loss of public trust and safety. Therefore, it is very important to develop and apply strong cybersecurity measures to support the growth and acceptance of self-driving cars. This paper discusses major cybersecurity challenges like vulnerabilities in software and hardware, risks from wireless communication, and threats through external interfaces. It also reviews existing solutions such as secure software development, intrusion detection systems, cryptographic protocols, and anomaly detection methods. Additionally, the paper highlights the role of regulatory bodies, industry collaborations, and cybersecurity standards in creating a secure environment for autonomous vehicles. Setting clear rules and best practices is necessary for consistent protection across manufacturers and regions. By analyzing the current cybersecurity landscape and suggesting practical countermeasures, this paper aims to contribute to the safe development and public trust of autonomous vehicle technology.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Risks of LLM-Generated Web Application Code: A Security-Centric Evaluation of Code Generation Capabilities in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enhanced software development processes, minimizing the time and effort required for coding and enhancing developer productivity. However, despite their potential benefits, code generated by LLMs has been shown to generate insecure code in controlled environments, raising critical concerns about their reliability and security in real-world applications. This paper uses predefined security parameters to evaluate the security compliance of LLM-generated code across multiple models, such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Claude, Gemini and Grok. The analysis reveals critical vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms, session management, input validation and HTTP security headers. Although some models implement security measures to a limited extent, none fully align with industry best practices, highlighting the associated risks in automated software development. Our findings underscore that human expertise is crucial to ensure secure software deployment or review of LLM-generated code. Also, there is a need for robust security assessment frameworks to enhance the reliability of LLM-generated code in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Cognitive maps are generative programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Making sense of the world and acting in it relies on building simplified mental representations that abstract away aspects of reality. This principle of cognitive mapping is universal to agents with limited resources. Living organisms, people, and algorithms all face the problem of forming functional representations of their world under various computing constraints. In this work, we explore the hypothesis that human resource-efficient planning may arise from representing the world as predictably structured. Building on the metaphor of concepts as programs, we propose that cognitive maps can take the form of generative programs that exploit predictability and redundancy, in contrast to directly encoding spatial layouts. We use a behavioral experiment to show that people who navigate in structured spaces rely on modular planning strategies that align with programmatic map representations. We describe a computational model that predicts human behavior in a variety of structured scenarios. This model infers a small distribution over possible programmatic cognitive maps conditioned on human prior knowledge of the world, and uses this distribution to generate resource-efficient plans. Our models leverages a Large Language Model as an embedding of human priors, implicitly learned through training on a vast corpus of human data. Our model demonstrates improved computational efficiency, requires drastically less memory, and outperforms unstructured planning algorithms with cognitive constraints at predicting human behavior, suggesting that human planning strategies rely on programmatic cognitive maps.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Hybrid Reinforcement Learning Framework for Dynamic Path Planning in Autonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel quantum classical hybrid framework is proposed that synergizes quantum with Classical Reinforcement Learning. By leveraging the inherent parallelism of quantum computing, the proposed approach generates robust Q tables and specialized turn cost estimations, which are then integrated with a classical Reinforcement Learning pipeline. The Classical Quantum fusion results in rapid convergence of training, reducing the training time significantly and improved adaptability in scenarios featuring static, dynamic, and moving obstacles. Simulator based evaluations demonstrate significant enhancements in path efficiency, trajectory smoothness, and mission success rates, underscoring the potential of framework for real time, autonomous navigation in complex and unpredictable environments. Furthermore, the proposed framework was tested beyond simulations on practical scenarios, including real world map data such as the IIT Delhi campus, reinforcing its potential for real time, autonomous navigation in complex and unpredictable environments.</description>

      <title>Bitcoin, a DAO?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates whether Bitcoin can be regarded as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), what insights it may offer for the broader DAO ecosystem, and how Bitcoin governance can be improved. First, a quantitative literature analysis reveals that Bitcoin is increasingly overlooked in DAO research, even though early works often classified it as a DAO. Next, the paper applies a DAO viability framework - centering on collective intelligence, digital democracy, and adaptation - to examine Bitcoin's organizational and governance mechanisms. Findings suggest that Bitcoin instantitates key DAO principles by enabling open participation, and employing decentralized decision-making through Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), miner signaling, and user-activated soft forks. However, this governance carries potential risks, including reduced clarity on who truly 'votes' due to the concentration of economic power among large stakeholders. The paper concludes by highlighting opportunities to refine Bitcoin's deliberation process and reflecting on broader implications for DAO design, such as the absence of a legal entity. In doing so, it underscores Bitcoin's continued relevance as an archetype for decentralized governance, offering important findings for future DAO implementations.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of Quantum Transpilers: Evaluating the Performance of qiskit-braket-provider, qBraid-SDK, and Pytket Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of popular SDK-to-SDK quantum transpilers (that is transpilers that takes a quantum circuit from an initial SDK and output a quantum circuit in another SDK), focusing on critical metrics such as correctness, failure rate, and transpilation time. To ensure unbiased evaluation and accommodate diverse quantum computing scenarios, we developed two dedicated tools: RandomQC, for generating random quantum circuits across various types (pure random, VQE-like, and SDK-specific circuits), and Benchmarq, to streamline the benchmarking process. Using these tools, we benchmarked prominent quantum transpilers as of February 2024. Our results highlight the superior performance of the qiskit-braket-provider, a specialized transpiler from Qiskit to Braket, achieving a remarkably low failure rate of 0.2%. The qBraid-SDK, offering generalized transpilation across multiple SDKs, demonstrated robust but slower performance. The pytket extensions, while fast, faced limitations with complex circuits due to their one-to-one transpilation approach. In particular, the exceptional performance of the qiskit-bracket-provider stems not only from its specialization but also from its architecture, which combines one-to-one transpilation with gate decomposition for unsupported gates, enhancing both speed and capability. This study aims to provide practical guidelines to users of SDK-to-SDK quantum transpilers and guidance to developers for improving the design and development of future tools.</description>

      <title>MQFL-FHE: Multimodal Quantum Federated Learning Framework with Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01858v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) in federated learning (FL) has led to significant advances in data privacy. However, during the aggregation phase, it often results in performance degradation of the aggregated model, hindering the development of robust representational generalization. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal quantum federated learning framework that utilizes quantum computing to counteract the performance drop resulting from FHE. For the first time in FL, our framework combines a multimodal quantum mixture of experts (MQMoE) model with FHE, incorporating multimodal datasets for enriched representation and task-specific learning. Our MQMoE framework enhances performance on multimodal datasets and combined genomics and brain MRI scans, especially for underrepresented categories. Our results also demonstrate that the quantum-enhanced approach mitigates the performance degradation associated with FHE and improves classification accuracy across diverse datasets, validating the potential of quantum interventions in enhancing privacy in FL.</description>
