      <title>Spectral Homogenization of the Radiative Transfer Equation via Low-Rank Tensor Train Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative transfer in absorbing-scattering media requires solving a transport equation across a spectral domain with 10^5 - 10^6 molecular absorption lines. Line-by-line (LBL) computation is prohibitively expensive, while existing approximations sacrifice spectral fidelity. We show that the Young-measure homogenization framework produces solution tensors I that admit low-rank tensor-train (TT) decompositions whose bond dimensions remain bounded as the spectral resolution Ns increases. Using molecular line parameters from the HITRAN database for H2O and CO2, we demonstrate that: (i) the TT rank saturates at r = 8 (at tolerance e = 10^-6) from Ns = 16 to 4096, independent of single-scattering albedo, Henyey-Greenstein asymmetry, temperature, and pressure; (ii) quantized tensor-train (QTT) representations achieve sub-linear storage scaling; (iii) in a controlled comparison using identical opacity data and transport solver, the homogenized approach achieves over an order of magnitude lower L2 error than the correlated-k distribution at equal cost; and (iv) for atomic plasma opacity (aluminum at 60 eV, TOPS database), the TT rank saturates at r = 15 with fundamentally different spectral structure (bound-bound and bound-free transitions spanning 12 decades of dynamic range), confirming that rank boundedness is a property of the transport equation rather than any particular opacity source. These results establish that the spectral complexity of radiative transfer has a finite effective rank exploitable by tensor decomposition, complementing the spatial-angular compression achieved by existing TT and dynamical low-rank approaches.</description>

      <title>Inelastic Constitutive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks: A generalized framework for automated discovery of interpretable inelastic material models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key problem of solid mechanics is the identification of the constitutive law of a material, that is, the relation between strain and stress. Machine learning has lead to considerable advances in this field lately. Here we introduce inelastic Constitutive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (iCKANs). This novel artificial neural network architecture can discover in an automated manner symbolic constitutive laws describing both the elastic and inelastic behavior of materials. That is, it can translate data from material testing into corresponding elastic and inelastic potential functions in closed mathematical form. We demonstrate the advantages of iCKANs using both synthetic data and experimental data of the viscoelastic polymer materials VHB 4910 and VHB 4905. The results demonstrate that iCKANs accurately capture complex viscoelastic behavior while preserving physical interpretability. It is a particular strength of iCKANs that they can process not only mechanical data but also arbitrary additional information available about a material (e.g., about temperature-dependent behavior). This makes iCKANs a powerful tool to discover in the future also how specific processing or service conditions affect the properties of materials.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Higher-Order Harmonic Surface Tessellations for Additively Manufactured Air-to-Air Heat Exchangers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Air-to-air heat exchangers are vital for energy recovery and thermal management but often suffer from reduced effectiveness, high pressure losses, and increased pumping power in conventional designs. Advances in additive manufacturing have enabled nature-inspired geometries, such as lattice and triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) structures, which enhance heat transfer through complex first-order surfaces but frequently cause excessive pressure drops. This study proposes an optimized higher-order harmonic heat-transfer surface tessellation developed through an optimization framework integrating analytical and numerical methods. The goal is to improve the overall thermal-hydraulic performance of the heat exchanger over a range of operating conditions. Results of sensitivity analysis show that secondary surface modification of this type can yield significant increase in the effectiveness reaching up to 70% although with associated increase in the pressure drop. The secondary surface wave frequency was found to be a more important control parameter than the amplitude in achieving high thermal-hydraulic performance. Additionally, we show that the optimized second order harmonic-type structure achieved relatively higher effectiveness and lower pressure-drop than the gyroid structure in the turbulent flow regime for Re&gt;=7000. Although the gyroid TPMS structure had relatively higher effectiveness in the laminar and weakly turbulent flow regime, the associated pressure drop was found to be significantly higher than that of the harmonic-type structure.</description>

      <title>Observer-robust energy condition verification for warp drive spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present \textbf{warpax}, an open-source, GPU-accelerated Python toolkit for observer-robust energy condition analysis of warp drive spacetimes. Existing tools evaluate energy conditions for a finite sample of observer directions; \textbf{warpax} replaces discrete sampling with continuous, gradient-based optimization over the timelike observer manifold (rapidity and boost direction), backed by Hawking--Ellis algebraic classification. At Type~I stress-energy points, which comprise ${&gt;}\,96$\% of all grid points across the tested metrics, an algebraic eigenvalue check determines energy-condition satisfaction \emph{exactly}, independent of any observer search or rapidity cap. At non-Type~I points the optimizer provides rapidity-capped diagnostics. Stress-energy tensors are computed from the ADM metric via forward-mode automatic differentiation, eliminating finite-difference truncation error. Geodesic integration with tidal-force and blueshift analysis is also included.
  We analyze five warp drive metrics (Alcubierre, Lentz, Van~Den~Broeck, Nat\'ario, Rodal) and one warp shell metric (used primarily as a numerical stress test). For the Rodal metric, the standard Eulerian-frame analysis misses violations at over $28\%$ of grid points (dominant energy condition) and over $15\%$ (weak energy condition). Even where the Eulerian frame identifies the correct violation set, observer optimization reveals that violation severity can be orders of magnitude larger (e.g.\ Alcubierre weak energy condition: ${\sim}\,90{,}000\times$ at rapidity cap $\zeta_{\max} = 5$, scaling as $e^{2\zeta_{\max}}$). These results demonstrate that single-frame evaluation can systematically underestimate both the spatial extent and the magnitude of energy condition violations in warp drive spacetimes. \textbf{warpax} is freely available at https://github.com/anindex/warpax.</description>

      <title>PINEAPPLE: Physics-Informed Neuro-Evolution Algorithm for Prognostic Parameter Inference in Lithium-Ion Battery Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate, real-time, yet non-destructive estimation of internal states in lithium-ion batteries is critical for predicting degradation, optimizing usage strategies, and extending operational lifespan. Here, we introduce PINEAPPLE (Physics-Informed Neuro-Evolution Algorithm for Prognostic Parameter inference in Lithium-ion battery Electrodes), a novel framework that integrates physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with an evolutionary search algorithm to enable rapid, scalable, and interpretable parameter inference with potential for application to next-generation batteries. The meta-learned PINN utilizes fundamental physics principles to achieve accurate zero-shot prediction of electrode behavior with test errors below 0.1$\%$ while maintaining an order-of-magnitude speed-up over conventional solvers. PINEAPPLE demonstrates robust parameter inference solely from voltage-time discharge curves across multiple batteries from the open-source CALCE repository, recovering the evolution of key internal state parameters such as Li-ion diffusion coefficients across usage cycles. Notably, the inferred cycle-dependent evolution of these parameters exhibit consistent trends across different batteries without any customized degradation physics-embedded heuristic, highlighting the effective regularizing effect and robustness that can be conferred through incorporation of fundamental physics in PINEAPPLE. By enabling computationally efficient, real-time parameter estimation, PINEAPPLE offers a promising route towards the non-destructive, physics-based characterization of inter-cell and intra-cell variability of battery modules and battery packs, thereby unlocking new opportunities for downstream on-the-fly needs in next-generation battery management systems such as individual cell-scale state-of-health diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Lattice and Orbital-Resolved Fermiology of Metallenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomically thin metallenes have emerged as a new member of the two-dimensional (2D) materials family. Recent experimental realization of metallenes in the {\AA}ngstr\"om limit has further intensified interest in this class of 2D materials. However, achieving sub-atomic insight into them demands the most detailed and systematic characterization of their electronic structure. Such understanding is essential for the rational design and exploitation of their properties in plasmonics, catalysis, and quantum optics. Existing electronic-structure studies are either scattered or focus on a few selected systems, and a comprehensive view of their band structures and Fermi surfaces remains missing. Here, we address this gap by studying 45 elemental metallenes in six monolayer lattices (honeycomb, square, hexagonal, and their buckled forms) using density-functional theory. We found that lattice type primarily fixes the shape and radial placement of the Fermi-lines, while out-of-plane buckling introduces controlled modifications: it shortens long straight Fermi-line segments, and occasionally creates, removes, or merges small Fermi-line pockets. The electronic configuration determines which orbital type dominates the Fermi level. We summarized Fermiology using a single score for each element, termed pocketness, derived from four descriptors that combine element properties (symmetry, coordination) with electronic characteristics (dispersion, Fermi-surface topology). This score enables targeted angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) tests, controlled Lifshitz transitions, and provides a predictive basis for transport and device applications.</description>

      <title>Rigorous electromagnetic quasinormal-mode method made easy for users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full-wave numerical methods based on quasinormal modes (QNMs) offer valuable physical insights and computational efficiency for analyzing electromagnetic resonators. However, despite their advantages, many researchers in electromagnetism continue to favor real-frequency domain or time-domain approaches, often using finite element or finite-difference time-domain methods. This preference stems from various factors, including the perception that QNM theory is still developing or requires advanced mathematical tools from complex analysis. In this work, we combine numerical techniques with accurate ap-proximations to simplify the computation of QNMs and enable ultrafast reconstructions us-ing QNM expansions. The result is a new approach that is straightforwardly accessible to users familiar with real-frequency methods. We demonstrate the practicality of our ap-proach through an open-source package [Doi: 10.5281/zenodo.18708748] implemented within a widely-used commercial photonics software.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning force-field models for dynamical simulations of metallic magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent advances in machine learning (ML) force-field methods for Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) simulations of itinerant electron magnets, focusing on scalability and transferability. Built on the principle of locality, a deep neural network model is developed to efficiently and accurately predict the electron-mediated forces governing spin dynamics. Symmetry-aware descriptors constructed through a group-theoretical approach ensure rigorous incorporation of both lattice and spin-rotation symmetries. The framework is demonstrated using the prototypical s-d exchange model widely employed in spintronics. ML-enabled large-scale simulations reveal novel nonequilibrium phenomena, including anomalous coarsening of tetrahedral spin order on the triangular lattice and the freezing of phase separation dynamics in lightly hole-doped, strong-coupling square-lattice systems. These results establish ML force-field frameworks as scalable, accurate, and versatile tools for modeling nonequilibrium spin dynamics in itinerant magnets.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics of swift-electron momentum transfer to a large spherical nanoparticle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Swift electrons from highly focused beams produced in aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopes offer a powerful route for probing and manipulating matter at the nanoscale. Although linear momentum transfer from swift electrons to nanoparticles has been investigated theoretically and experimentally, subsequent analyzes revealed that several earlier predictions relied on non-causal dielectric functions or insufficient numerical convergence, leading to spurious sign reversals in the transferred momentum. Here, we derive analytical expressions and develop a numerically efficient electrodynamic framework to compute the linear momentum transferred from a swift electron to an isolated spherical nanoparticle described by a fully causal, local dielectric response. We apply our framework to large nanoparticles with 50 nm radius and explicitly resolve the spectral density of linear momentum transfer across the full frequency domain. Using causal dielectric functions for aluminum and bismuth, we analyze the role of electron velocity, impact parameter, and material-specific resonances. We find that, when causality and full multipolar convergence are enforced, the net transverse linear momentum transferred to spherical nanoparticles remains attractive toward the electron trajectory for all nanoparticles considered, despite the presence of material-dependent sign changes in individual electric and magnetic contributions. These results contrast with earlier theoretical predictions of net repulsive behavior and indicate that additional physical mechanisms beyond the present isolated, local description are required to account for experimentally observed repulsion. Our work establishes a robust reference framework for momentum transfer calculations and provides quantitative benchmarks relevant for electron-beam-based nanoscale manipulation.</description>

      <title>Pole-Expansion of the T-Matrix Based on a Matrix-Valued AAA-Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition matrix (T-matrix) is a complete description of an object's linear scattering response. As such, it has found wide adoption for the theoretical and computational description of multiple-scattering phenomena. In its original form, the T-matrix describes the interaction of a scatterer with a monochromatic source. In practice, however, information about the T-matrix is usually needed in an extended spectral domain. To access the frequency-dispersion, one might naively sample T-matrices over a finely resolved set of discrete frequencies and store one T-matrix per frequency. This approach has multiple drawbacks: it is computationally expensive, requires excessive memory, and it disregards the physical origin of the spectral features, weakening physical interpretability. To overcome these major limitations, we leverage a pole-expansion technique to represent the T-matrix with arbitrary frequency resolution within a selected frequency domain via a set of resonant contributions. A matrix-valued variant of the recently established adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (AAA) algorithm for rational approximation enables us to compute the pole-expansion at minimal computational cost using only a small number of direct evaluations. We demonstrate the benefits of such a representation with examples ranging from semi-analytically accessible scatterers to quasi-dual bound states in the continuum. To allow the wider community to capitalize on these findings, we provide open-source tools to perform the presented pole-expansion of the T-matrix.</description>

Abstract: In the current era of quantum computing, robust and efficient tools are essential to bridge the gap between simulations and quantum hardware execution. In this work, we introduce a machine learning approach to characterize the noise impacting a quantum chip and emulate it during simulations. Our algorithm leverages reinforcement learning, offering increased flexibility in reproducing various noise models compared to conventional techniques such as randomized benchmarking or heuristic noise models. The effectiveness of the RL agent has been validated through simulations and testing on real superconducting qubits. Additionally, we provide practical use-case examples for the study of renowned quantum algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel technique for amortized posterior estimation using Normalizing Flows trained with likelihood-weighted importance sampling. This approach allows for the efficient inference of theoretical parameters in high-dimensional inverse problems without the need for posterior training samples. We implement the method on multi-modal benchmark tasks in 2D and 3D to check for the efficacy. A critical observation of our study is the impact of the topology of the base distributions on the modelled posteriors. We find that standard unimodal base distributions fail to capture disconnected support, resulting in spurious probability bridges between modes. We demonstrate that initializing the flow with a Gaussian Mixture Model that matches the cardinality of the target modes significantly improves reconstruction fidelity, as measured by some distance and divergence metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Transformer-based and standard Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to be the best performers in classifying different types of jets, they require substantial computational power. We explore the scope of using a lightweight and scalable version of EfficientNet architecture, along with global features of the jet. The end product is computationally inexpensive but is capable of competitive performance. We showcase the efficacy of our network in tagging top-quark jets in a sea of other light quark and gluon jets. The work also sheds light on the importance of global features for both the accuracy and the apparent redundancy of the network's complexity.</description>

      <title>Multigroup Radiation Diffusion on a Moving Mesh: Implementation in RICH and Application to Tidal Disruption Events</title>

Abstract: Radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) determines the bulk evolution and observable emission in a wide variety of high-energy astrophysical phenomena. Due to their complexity, RHD problems must usually be studied through numerical simulation. We have extended the publicly available RICH code, which previously solved the equations of RHD in the limit of grey flux-limited diffusion (FLD), to operate with a multigroup FLD solver. RICH is a semi-Lagrangian code that solves the equations of RHD on an unstructured moving mesh, and is the first multigroup RHD moving mesh code, making it uniquely applicable to problems with extreme dynamic range and dynamically important radiation forces. We validate our multigroup module against multiple analytic benchmarks, including a novel test of the RHD Doppler term. The computational efficiency of the code is aided by a novel scheme to accelerate convergence in optically thick cells by limiting the absorption coefficients. Finally, we apply multigroup \textsc{rich} in a pilot three dimensional study of a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE), using a $10^4 M_\odot$ intermediate-mass black hole. Our simulations self-consistently produce a bright early-time X-ray flash prior to peak optical/UV light, in qualitative agreement with post-processing of (grey) RICH simulations of supermassive black hole TDEs, as well as X-ray observations of the TDE AT 2022dsb.</description>

      <title>MAD-SURF: a machine learning interatomic potential for molecular adsorption on coinage metal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting how organic molecules adsorb, assemble, and interact on metal surfaces is central to surface chemistry and molecular electronics, particularly in the context of interpreting high-resolution scanning probe microscopy. Yet, the application of first-principles simulations to interfaces is hampered by the computational cost for evaluating the electronic structure for the large number of atoms typically involved. We hereby present MAD-SURF, a machine learning interatomic potential specifically tailored for molecular adsorption on coinage metal surfaces. Trained on a broad dataset spanning diverse molecules, adsorption motifs, surfaces, molecular dynamics trajectories and non-covalent aggregates, MAD-SURF achieves accuracy comparable to the underlying DFT reference while enabling simulations orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory. The model reliably reproduces energies, forces and adsorption geometries across the three coinage metal substrates. We demonstrate its capabilities on experimentally characterized systems, including organic monolayers, polycyclic aggregates, flexible biomolecules and the long-range herringbone reconstruction of gold. By merging accuracy, speed, and generalizability, MAD-SURF offers a practical framework for accelerating atomistic simulations and advancing data-driven workflows in surface science.</description>
