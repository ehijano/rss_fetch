      <title>A Tight VC-Dimension Analysis of Clustering Coresets with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider coresets for $k$-clustering problems, where the goal is to assign points to centers minimizing powers of distances. A popular example is the $k$-median objective $\sum_{p}\min_{c\in C}dist(p,C)$. Given a point set $P$, a coreset $\Omega$ is a small weighted subset that approximates the cost of $P$ for all candidate solutions $C$ up to a $(1\pm\varepsilon )$ multiplicative factor. In this paper, we give a sharp VC-dimension based analysis for coreset construction. As a consequence, we obtain improved $k$-median coreset bounds for the following metrics:
  Coresets of size $\tilde{O}\left(k\varepsilon^{-2}\right)$ for shortest path metrics in planar graphs, improving over the bounds $\tilde{O}\left(k\varepsilon^{-6}\right)$ by [Cohen-Addad, Saulpic, Schwiegelshohn, STOC'21] and $\tilde{O}\left(k^2\varepsilon^{-4}\right)$ by [Braverman, Jiang, Krauthgamer, Wu, SODA'21].
  Coresets of size $\tilde{O}\left(kd\ell\varepsilon^{-2}\log m\right)$ for clustering $d$-dimensional polygonal curves of length at most $m$ with curves of length at most $\ell$ with respect to Frechet metrics, improving over the bounds $\tilde{O}\left(k^3d\ell\varepsilon^{-3}\log m\right)$ by [Braverman, Cohen-Addad, Jiang, Krauthgamer, Schwiegelshohn, Toftrup, and Wu, FOCS'22] and $\tilde{O}\left(k^2d\ell\varepsilon^{-2}\log m \log |P|\right)$ by [Conradi, Kolbe, Psarros, Rohde, SoCG'24].</description>

      <title>Isometric simplices for high-order anisotropic mesh adaptation. Part I: Definition and existence of isometric triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic mesh adaptation with Riemannian metrics has proven effective for generating straight-sided meshes with anisotropy induced by the geometry of interest and/or the resolved physics. Within the continuous mesh framework, anisotropic meshes are thought of as discrete counterparts to Riemannian metrics. Ideal, or unit, simplicial meshes consist only of simplices whose edges exhibit unit or quasi-unit length with respect to a given Riemannian metric. Recently, mesh adaptation with high-order (i.e., curved) elements has grown in popularity in the meshing community, as the additional flexibility of high-order elements can further reduce the approximation error. However, a complete and competitive methodology for anisotropic and high-order mesh adaptation is not yet available. The goal of this paper is to address a key aspect of metric-based high-order mesh adaptation, namely, the adequacy between a Riemannian metric and high-order simplices. This is done by extending the notions of unit simplices and unit meshes, central to the continuous mesh framework, to high-order elements. The existing definitions of a unit simplex are reviewed, then a broader definition involving Riemannian isometries is introduced to handle curved and high-order simplices. Similarly, the notion of quasi-unitness is extended to curved simplices to tackle the practical generation of high-order meshes. Proofs of concept for unit and (quasi-)isometric meshes are presented in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>A cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff metric approach for quantifying molecular similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce, for the first time, a cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric method to analyze 1-dimensional and higher-dimensional (co)homology groups, focusing on loops, voids, and higher-dimensional cavity structures in simplicial complexes, to address typical clustering questions arising in molecular data analysis. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance quantifies the dissimilarity between two metric spaces. In this framework, molecules are represented as simplicial complexes, and their cohomology vector spaces are computed to capture intrinsic topological invariants encoding loop and cavity structures. These vector spaces are equipped with a suitable distance measure, enabling the computation of the Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric to evaluate structural dissimilarities. We demonstrate the methodology using organic-inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) structures. The results highlight the effectiveness of this approach in clustering various molecular structures. By incorporating geometric information, our method provides deeper insights compared to traditional persistent homology techniques.</description>
