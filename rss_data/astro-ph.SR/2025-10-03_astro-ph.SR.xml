      <title>Diffusion Modeling of the Three-Dimensional Magnetic Field in the Sun's Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel generative denoising diffusion model for synthesizing the Sun's three-dimensional coronal magnetic field, a complex and dynamic region characterized by evolving magnetic structures. Despite daily variability, these structures exhibit recurring patterns and long-term cyclic trends, presenting unique modeling challenges and opportunities at the intersection of physics and machine learning. Our generative approach employs an innovative architecture influenced by Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO), operating within the spherical harmonic domain, where the scalar field corresponds directly to the magnetic potential under physical constraints. We trained this model using an extensive dataset comprising 11.7 years of daily coupled simulations from the Air Force Data Assimilative Photospheric Flux Transport-Wang Sheeley Arge (ADAPT-WSA) model, further enhanced by data augmentation. Initial results demonstrate the model's capability to conditionally generate physically realistic magnetic fields reflective of distinct phases within the 11-year solar cycle: from solar minimum ($S = 0$) to solar maximum ($S = 1$). This approach represents a significant step toward advanced generative three-dimensional modeling in Heliophysics, with potential applications in solar forecasting, data assimilation, inverse problem-solving, and broader impacts in areas such as procedural generation of physically-informed graphical assets.</description>

      <title>Orbital Period Changes in Recurrent Nova T Corona Borealis Prove That It Is Not a Type Ia Supernovae Progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T Corona Borealis (T CrB) is a recurrent nova and a symbiotic star that is commonly highlighted as the best case for being a progenitor of a Type Ia supernova (SNIa) within the framework of single-degenerate models. This exemplar can be tested by measuring whether the white dwarf (WD) mass ($M_{\rm WD}$) is increasing over each eruption cycle. This is a balance between the mass ejected during each nova event ($M_{\rm ejecta}$) and the mass accreted onto the WD between the nova events ($M_{\rm accreted}$). I have used all 206 radial velocities from 1946--2024 to measure the orbital period just after the 1946 eruption to be $P_{\rm post}$=227.6043 days, while the steady orbital period change ($\dot{P}$) is ($-$3.1$\pm$1.6)$\times$10$^{-6}$. I have used my full 213,730 magnitude $B$ and $V$ light curve from 1842--2025 to measure the times of maximum brightness in the ellipsoidal modulations to construct the $O-C$ from 1866--1946. I fit the broken parabola shape, to find the orbital period immediately before the 1946 eruption to be $P_{\rm pre}$=227.4586 days. The orbital period changed by $\Delta P$=$+$0.146$\pm$0.019 days. With Kepler's Law, conservation of angular momentum, and the well-measured binary properties, the ejecta mass in 1946 is 0.00074$\pm$0.00009 M$_{\odot}$. $M_{\rm accreted}$ is reliably measured to be 1.38$\times$10$^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$ from the accretion luminosity. $M_{\rm ejecta}$ is larger than $M_{\rm accreted}$ by 540$\times$, so $M_{\rm WD}$ is {\it decreasing} every eruption cycle. T CrB can never become a SNIa.</description>

      <title>Orbital Period Changes of Recurrent Nova U Scorpii Demonstrate that M$_{\rm ejecta}$=26$\times$M$_{\rm accreted}$ and Is Not a Type Ia Supernova Progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent nova U Scorpii (U Sco) is one of the prototypes for a Type Ia supernova progenitor. The logic is that the white dwarf is near the Chandrasekhar mass and gas is accumulating onto its surface at a near-maximal accretion rate, so it will soon increase its mass to the supernova trigger. But the white dwarf loses mass every nova eruption, so the issue is balancing the mass ejected ($M_{\rm ejecta}$) against the mass accreted between eruptions ($M_{\rm accreted}$). Measuring $M_{\rm accreted}$ can be done in several ways to useable accuracy. But the old methods for measuring $M_{\rm ejecta}$ (involving the flux in hydrogen emission lines) are all with real error bars of 2--3 orders of magnitude. The only solution is to measure the change of the orbital period across the nova eruption ($\Delta P$). But this solution requires a vast photometric program of eclipse timings stretching decades. For U Sco, a program started in 1989, now reaches its culmination with measures of $\Delta P$ for the eruptions of 1999, 2010, 2016, and 2022. This paper reports on 52 new eclipse times (for a total of 218 eclipses 1945--2025), plus a new theory result allowing for the confident calculation of $M_{\rm ejecta}$ from $\Delta P$. The four eruptions ejected a total of (103$\pm$14)$\times$$10^{-6}$ $M_{\odot}$, while the white dwarf accreted 4$\times$$10^{-6}$ $M_{\odot}$ over the four previous eruption cycles. With M$_{\rm ejecta}$=26$\times$M$_{\rm accreted}$, the U Sco white dwarf is losing large masses each eruption cycle, so U Sco can never produce a Type Ia supernova.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an Accretion Burst in a Free-Floating Planetary-Mass Object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a long-lasting burst of disk accretion in Cha J11070768-7626326 (Cha 1107-7626), a young, isolated, 5-10 M$_{\mathrm{Jupiter}}$ object. In spectra taken with XSHOOTER at ESO's Very Large Telescope as well as NIRSPEC and MIRI on the James Webb Space Telescope, the object transitions from quiescence in April-May 2025 to a strongly enhanced accretion phase in June-August 2025. The line flux changes correspond to a 6-8-fold increase in the mass accretion rate, reaching $10^{-7}$ M$_{\mathrm{Jupiter}}$yr$^{-1}$, the highest measured in a planetary-mass object. During the burst, the H$\alpha$ line develops a double-peaked profile with red-shifted absorption, as observed in stars and brown dwarfs undergoing magnetospheric accretion. The optical continuum increases by a factor of 3-6; the object is $\sim$1.5-2 mag brighter in the R-band during the burst. Mid-infrared continuum fluxes rise by 10-20%, with clear changes in the hydrocarbon emission lines from the disk. We detect water vapour emission at 6.5-7 $\mu m$, which were absent in quiescence. By the end of our observing campaign, the burst was still ongoing, implying a duration of at least two months. A 2016 spectrum also shows high accretion levels, suggesting that this object may undergo recurring bursts. The observed event is inconsistent with typical variability in accreting young stars and instead matches the duration, amplitude and line spectrum of an EXor-type burst, making Cha1107-7626 the first substellar object with evidence of a potentially recurring EXor burst.</description>

      <title>PRESOL: a web-based computational setting for feature-based flare forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares are the most explosive phenomena in the solar system and the main trigger of the events' chain that starts from Coronal Mass Ejections and leads to geomagnetic storms with possible impacts on the infrastructures at Earth. Data-driven solar flare forecasting relies on either deep learning approaches, which are operationally promising but with a low explainability degree, or machine learning algorithms, which can provide information on the physical descriptors that mostly impact the prediction. This paper describes a web-based technological platform for the execution of a computational pipeline of feature-based machine learning methods that provide predictions of the flare occurrence, feature ranking information, and assessment of the prediction performances.</description>

      <title>Low- and high-velocity `water fountains': different evolutionary stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: `Water fountains' (WFs) are optically obscured evolved stars, most of them thought to be in the post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) phase, characterized by H$_{2}$O maser emission tracing molecular jets. Interestingly, four WFs (IRAS 15445$-$5449, IRAS 18019$-$2216, IRAS 18443$-$0231, and IRAS 18464$-$0140) and one WF candidate (IRAS 18480+0008) are potential planetary nebulae (PNe) because they exhibit radio continuum emission, suggesting the presence of a photoionized region characteristic of PNe. To classify these objects, we obtained K-band (2.0-2.3 $\mu$m) spectra of these WFs, including the only WF PN known (IRAS 15103$-$5754) for comparison. Our spectra reveal two group of sources: (i) `low-velocity' WFs with H$_2$O maser velocity spread of $\lesssim$50 km s$^{-1}$ (IRAS 18019$-$2216, IRAS 18464$-$0140, and IRAS 18480+0008) showing the CO band at 2.29 $\mu$m in absorption, typical of cool giant stars, and no emission lines; and (ii) `high-velocity' WFs, velocity spread of $\gtrsim$50 km s$^{-1}$ (IRAS 15103$-$5754, IRAS 15445$-$5449, and IRAS 18443$-$0231), exhibiting emission lines of Br$\gamma$, He I, and H$_2$, consistent with hotter central stars and/or shock-excited emission. The emission line ratios of these lines in IRAS 18443$-$0231 indicates that it may be a nascent PN. The spectrum of IRAS 15445$-$5449 also shows a CO band and Na I doublet in emission, suggesting the presence of a compact circumstellar disk and/or active mass loss. These results favor the previously suggested notion that the difference between low- and high-velocity WFs is not simply a projection effect but reflects intrinsically different evolutionary stages. Moreover, the results are also consistent with the idea of an increase in the jet ejection velocity as the post-AGB evolution proceeds.</description>

      <title>A Large Sample of JWST/NIRSpec Brown Dwarfs: New Distant Discoveries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs are essential probes of stellar and planetary formation, yet their low luminosities pose challenges for detection at large Galactic distances. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its unprecedented near-infrared sensitivity, enables the discovery and characterization of distant substellar objects, including those in the Milky Way's thick disk and halo. We conducted a systematic search using over 40,000 publicly available JWST/NIRSpec PRISM/CLEAR spectra and identified 68 brown dwarfs through spectral template matching and visual inspection. Among them, 12 are newly identified candidates, including 8 T dwarfs and 4 M/L dwarfs, most at distances exceeding 1 kpc. Remarkably, two sources -- JWST J001418.22-302223.2 and JWST J033240.07-274907.8 -- are found at distances greater than 5 kpc, making them the most distant brown dwarfs within the Milky Way. Spectral fits were performed using a nested sampling Monte Carlo algorithm with three model grids: Sonora Elf Owl, LOWZ, and SAND. The analysis reveals that cloud-free models are unable to reproduce L/T transition spectra, whereas the SAND model provides a more accurate representation of cloud effects in metal-poor environments. With the newly identified distant brown dwarfs, we also investigated the vertical metallicity gradient of brown dwarfs. Overall, the metallicities do not show an evident trend with Galactic height $|Z|$, due to the limited sample size and the uncertainties in metallicity measurements.</description>

      <title>Chemical transport by weakly nonlinear internal gravity waves in stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While it is well-known that internal gravity waves (IGWs) transport chemicals in the radiative zones of stars, there remains substantial uncertainty on the amount of, and physical mechanism behind, this transport. Most previous studies have relied on heuristic theories, or numerical simulations that may be hard to extrapolate to stellar parameters. In this work, we present the first rigorous asymptotic calculation of (passive) chemical transport by IGWs, in the limit of small wave amplitude. We find that the net transport by a coherent packet of waves scales like wave amplitude to the fourth power, and verify these analytic calculations with numerical simulations. Because the transport is equally likely to be positive as negative, the transport by a random superposition of waves is expected to scale as wave amplitude to the eighth power. These results show that closer comparisons between theoretical arguments and numerical calculations are essential for interpreting numerical simulations of chemical transport by IGWs, and making accurate predictions of this process for stellar evolution modeling.</description>

      <title>Observations of a Faint Nonthermal Onset before a GOES C-class Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analysis of a GOES C1-class flare from 2022 September 6, which was jointly observed as occulted by Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope ARray (NuSTAR) and on-disk by Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX). NuSTAR observed faint coronal nonthermal emission as well as plasma heating &gt; 10 MK, starting 7 minutes prior to the flare. This onset emission implies that during this time, there is a continuous electron acceleration in the corona which could also be responsible for the observed heating. The nonthermal model parameters remained consistent throughout the entire onset, indicating that the electron acceleration process persisted during this time. Furthermore, the onset coincided with a series of type III radio bursts observed by Long Wavelength Array-1, further supporting the presence of electron acceleration before the flare began. We also performed spectral analysis of the impulsive flare emission with STIX (thermal and footpoint emission). STIX footpoints and the onset coronal source were found to have similar electron distribution power-law indices, but with increased low-energy cut-off during the flare time. This could suggest that the nonthermal onset is an early signature of the acceleration mechanism that occurs during the main phase of the flare.</description>

      <title>Flare-Driven Plasma Dynamics and Elemental Abundance Redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the advent of X-ray and EUV spectroscopy, the discovery of the First Ionization Potential (FIP) effect--where coronal elemental compositions diverge from their photospheric values based on the element's FIP--has remained a key puzzle in solar and stellar astrophysics. These deviations exhibit significant fluctuations during flares, yet their connection to plasma dynamics has remained unclear. Here, we report a clear correlation between temperature-sensitive flaring plasma emission and element-specific abundance changes for a solar flare. These findings indicate that energy deposition in the chromosphere drives plasma evaporation from different chromospheric heights, modulating elemental abundances. Hydrodynamic simulations support these observations, showing that varying energy deposition magnitudes generate plasma upflows from different chromospheric heights, leading to element-specific FIP fractionation. These results provide new insights into the dynamic coupling of flare energy, plasma flows, and abundance variability, with implications for understanding coupling between different atmospheric layers.</description>

      <title>Near-infrared photometry of the central stars of planetary nebulae with the VVVX survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving accurate photometric characterizations of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) toward the galactic plane is significantly hindered by the high levels of interstellar extinction in these regions. However, near-infrared (NIR) observations offer a more effective alternative, as extinction is substantially reduced at these wavelengths. By mitigating the effects of interstellar extinction via NIR observations of the Galactic disk and bulge, we seek to improve the identification and characterization of CSPNe in these regions, enabling a deeper understanding of their properties and evolutionary status. We used NIR photometry from the VISTA Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea (VVV) survey and its extension VVVX to define the NIR photometry of a large sample of CSPNe recently identified with Gaia EDR3 data. We explored the optical and NIR properties of all CSPNe in our sample and searched for eclipsing binary candidates among them by employing relevant catalogs. We present a homogeneous catalog of 1274 CSPNe, including their Z, Y, H, J, and K NIR magnitudes and errors. We also include our findings on the photometric properties of our sample. We report 14 CSPNe with a large IR excess indicating cool companions and/or surrounding discs and 56 eclipsing binary candidates. Based on the present VVVX CSPN catalog, we conclude that NIR photometry can prove valuable for further and in-depth studies of CSPNe. Subsequent studies ought to focus on exploring the true nature of the CSPNe that present IR excess as well as eclipsing-binary CSPNe candidates.</description>

      <title>Rotation Periods for Stars in Open Cluster NGC 6819 From Kepler IRIS Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an updated catalog of stellar rotation periods for the 2.5 Gyr open cluster NGC 6819 using the Kepler IRIS light curves from superstamp data. Our analysis uses Gaussian Process modeling to extract robust rotation signals from image subtraction light curves, allowing us unprecedented data access and measurement precision in the crowded cluster field. After applying stringent quality and contamination cuts, we identify 271 reliable rotation periods, representing by far the largest sample of rotators measured in a single intermediate-age cluster. Compared to previous work, which relied on only ~30 stars, our catalog extends the gyrochronological sequence of NGC 6819 with an order of magnitude more measurements and improved precision. The expanded dataset reveals both the expected temperature-dependent spin-down trend and substantial scatter at fixed effective temperature, including a bimodal distribution of fast and slow rotators. We also identify a distinct ``pile-up'' sequence consistent with predictions of weakened magnetic braking at critical Rossby numbers. These results strengthen this cluster's role as a benchmark for stellar spin evolution, while also highlighting the limitations of traditional gyrochronology at older ages. The final catalog and the model implementations are all available on Zenodo.</description>

      <title>Solar Hegemony: M-Dwarfs Are Unlikely to Host Observers Such as Ourselves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With no firm evidence for life beyond our solar system, inferences about the population observers such as ourselves rests upon the Earth as a single input, at least for now. Whilst the narrative of our home as a 'humdrum' system has become ingrained in the public psyche via Sagan, there are at least two striking facts about our existence which we know are certainly unusual. First, the stelliferous period spans ~10Tyr - yet here we are living in the first 0.1% of that volume. Second, over three-quarters of all stars are low-mass M-dwarfs, stars with no shortage of rocky habitable-zone planets - and yet, again, our existence defies this trend, previously dubbed the Red Sky Paradox. Two plausible resolutions are that a) stars below a certain mass, $M_{crit}$, do not produce observers, and, b) planets have a truncated temporal window for observers, $T_{win}$, negating the longevity advantage of M-dwarfs. We develop a Bayesian model that encompasses both datums and jointly explores the two resolutions covariantly. Our analysis reveals that 1) the hypothesis that these observations are mere luck is disfavored with an overwhelming Bayes factor of ~1600; 2) some truncation of low-mass stars is indispensable, lowering $T_{win}$ alone cannot well-explain the observations; and, 3) the most conservative limit on $M_{crit}$ occurs when fixing $T_{win}=10$Gyr, yielding $M_{crit}&gt;0.34 M_{\odot}$ [$0.74 M_{\odot}$] to 2$\sigma$ [1$\sigma$]. Our work challenges the tacit assumption of M-dwarfs being viable seats for observers and, indirectly, even life.</description>

      <title>Advancing Interstellar Science: A Global Framework for Comprehensive Study of Interstellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The operation of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) marks a transformative moment in humanity's capacity to detect and characterize interstellar objects (ISOs). With projections indicating an increase from a few detections per decade to potentially one every few months, humanity stands at the threshold of unprecedented scientific opportunity offering revolutionary insights into the nature of rocky materials, building blocks of life and technological products from other star systems. This white paper proposes the establishment of the United Nations Committee on Interstellar Objects (UNCIO), a specialized body designed to coordinate global scientific research, maximize observational coverage, and ensure optimal scientific return from these extraordinary objects from outside the solar system through systematic investigation in cosmochemistry, astrobiology, planetary sciences, fundamental physics, advanced technologies and materials science. The proposed framework addresses critical gaps in our current international infrastructure: the absence of coordinated detection, classification and intercept capabilities, insufficient protocols for rapid scientific response and international policy decisions to time-sensitive observations, and the need for effective science communication to maintain government and public support for these ambitious investigations and global threats to Earth. Drawing from successful international collaborations in areas such as the International Space Station (ISS) and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), UNCIO would operate through a dual structure: an executive board for time-critical scientific decisions and an expanded committee for comprehensive stakeholder representation. This initiative is not merely aspirational but urgently practical.</description>

      <title>The Progenitor of the S147 Supernova Remnant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The supernova remnant (SNR) S147 contains the pulsar PSR J0538+2817 and a likely unbound binary companion, HD 37424. It is the only good Galactic candidate for a binary unbound by a core-collapse supernova (SN). Using Gaia DR3 parallaxes and photometry, we select the stars local to SNR S147 in a cylinder with a projected radius of $100$ pc and a parallax range of $0.614 &lt; \varpi &lt; 0.787$ mas (a length of $\simeq 360$ pc). We individually model the most luminous of these stars. The two most luminous single stars are the unbound binary companion, HD 37424, and HD 37367, with estimated masses of $(13.51\pm0.05) M_{\odot}$ and $(14.30\pm0.09) M_{\odot}$, respectively. The two most luminous binary systems are the spectroscopic binary HD 37366 and the eclipsing binary ET Tau that have primary masses of $(20.9\pm0.12) M_{\odot}$ and $(16.7\pm0.09) M_{\odot}$, respectively. We model the Gaia color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of this local stellar population using both single stars and a model consisting of noninteracting binaries using Solar metallicity PARSEC isochrones. For both models, the estimated age distributions of the $439$ $M_{G} &lt; 0$ mag stars favor a high mass progenitor of $21.5M_{\odot}-41.1M_{\odot}$ for the SN.</description>

      <title>Jittering jets in stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the one-dimensional stellar evolution code MESA, we find that all our models in the initial mass range of 12-40 Mo, regardless of whether they have hydrogen-rich, hydrogen-stripped, or helium+hydrogen-stripped envelopes, have at least one significant strong convective zone in the inner core, which can facilitate the jittering-jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). We focus on stripped-envelope CCSN progenitors that earlier studies of the JJEM did not study, and examine the angular momentum parameter j=rVconv, where r is the radius of the layer and Vconv is the convective velocity according to the mixing length theory. In all models, there is at least one prominent convective zone with j&gt;2e15 cm^2/s inside the mass coordinate that is the maximum baryonic mass of a neutron star (NS), m=2.65 Mo. According to the JJEM, convection in these zones seeds instabilities above the newly born NS, leading to the formation of intermittent accretion disks that launch pairs of jittering jets, which in turn explode the star. Our finding is encouraging for the JJEM, although it does not show that the intermittent accretion disks indeed form. We strengthen the claim that, according to the JJEM, there are no failed CCSNe and that all massive stars explode. In demonstrating the robust convection in the inner core of stripped-envelope CCSN progenitors, we add to the establishment of the JJEM as the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Cloud-Driven Atmospheric Dynamics &amp; Chemistry of an Isolated Exoplanet Analog with Harmonic Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs near the L/T spectral transition exhibit enhanced spectrophotometric variability over field brown dwarfs. Patchy clouds, auroral processes, stratospheric hot spots, and complex carbon chemistry have all been proposed as potential sources of this variability. Using time-resolved, low-to-mid-resolution spectroscopy collected with the JWST/NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments, we apply harmonic analysis to SIMP J0136, a highly variable, young, isolated planetary-mass object. Odd harmonics (k=3) at pressure levels (&gt; 1 bar) corresponding to iron and forsterite cloud formation suggest North/South hemispheric asymmetry in the cloudy, and likely equatorial, regions. We use the inferred harmonics, along with 1-D substellar atmospheric models, to map the flux variability by atmospheric pressure level. These vertical maps demonstrate robust interaction between deep convective weather layers and the overlying stratified and radiative atmosphere. We identify distinct time-varying structures in the near-infrared that we interpret as planetary-scale wave (e.g., Rossby or Kelvin)-associated cloud modulation. We detect variability in water (S/N = 14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands, providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the lowest pressures (&lt; 100 mbar), we find that the mapped methane lines transition from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral heating via electron precipitation.</description>

      <title>Apsidal motion and proximity effects in the massive binary BD+60 497</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The eccentric short-period O-star binary BD+60 497 is an interesting laboratory in which to study tidal interactions in massive binary systems, notably via the detection and characterisation of apsidal motion. The rate of apsidal motion in such systems can help constrain their age and provide insight into the degree of mass concentration in the interior of massive stars. We used spectroscopic data collected over two decades to reconstruct the individual spectra of the stars and to establish their epoch-dependent radial velocities. An orbital solution, explicitly accounting for apsidal motion was adjusted to the data. Space-borne photometric time series were analysed with Fourier methods and with binary models. We derived a rate of apsidal motion of $6.15^{+1.05}_{-1.65}$ degree/yr, which suggests an age of $4.13^{+0.42}_{-1.37}$ Myr. The disentangled spectra unveiled a curious change in the spectral properties of the secondary star between the epochs 2002-2003 and 2018-2022 with the secondary spectrum appearing to be of an earlier spectral type over recent years. Photometric data show variability at the 6 mmag level on the period of the binary system, which is hard to explain in terms of proximity effects. Whilst the rate of apsidal motion agrees well with theoretical expectations, the changes in the reconstructed secondary spectrum hint at a highly non-uniform surface temperature distribution for this star. Different effects are discussed that could contribute to the photometric variations. The current most-likely explanation is a mix of proximity effects and tidally excited oscillations</description>

      <title>Constraining the Mass Loss and the Kinetic Energy of Solar Coronal Mass Ejections with Far-Ultraviolet Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar eruptive events, such as flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), can affect planetary habitability by disturbing the stability of their atmospheres. For instance, strong stellar flares and CMEs can trigger atmospheric escape and, in extreme cases, may strip away the atmosphere completely. While stellar flares have been observed and explored at a wide range of wavelengths, the physical properties of stellar CMEs remain unconstrained due to the difficulty in observing them. In this context, the Sun provides our only window on the potential characteristics of CMEs on Sun-like stars. A correlation between solar X-ray flare peak flux and the mass of flare-associated solar CMEs has been reported using solar data collected during Solar Cycle 23 (Aarnio et al. 2011). Here, we build upon that work. We extend the correlation into the far-UV (FUV), where stellar flares are, and will continue to be, routinely detected with existing and future FUV observatories by incorporating data spanning two entire Solar Cycles (23 and 24; 1996-2019). Using three different space missions (CMEs from LASCO/SOHO, X-ray flare events from XRS/GOES, and FUV flares from AIA/SDO), we report a correlation between FUV flare peak flux and energy centered at 1600 {\AA} and mass, kinetic energy, and linear speed of flare-associated CMEs. These empirical relations enable estimates of CME masses and kinetic energies from FUV flares on Sun-like stars. While direct stellar CME detections remain elusive, the correlations derived here are likely applicable to Sun-like stars and provide a working framework for evaluating exoplanet atmospheric erosion.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Theory of Multipole Moments and Shape of Stationary Rotating Fluid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14712v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the longstanding challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating classical Newtonian potential theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that improves both the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method employs Lie group theory and exponential mapping to characterize vector flows associated with rotational deformations. We derive functional equations for perturbations in density and gravitational potential, resolved analytically using the shift operator and Neumann series. This extends Clairaut's classical linear theory into the nonlinear regime. The resulting formulation yields an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing hydrostatic equilibrium under rotation without assuming slow rotation. This generalized Clairaut equation incorporates nonlinear effects and accommodates large rotational speeds. We validate the theory by deriving exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and the unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques to analyze radial harmonics of the shape function and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order spectral corrections and derive boundary conditions for radial harmonics. This enables accurate computation of Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments, offering a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational deformations in astrophysical systems.</description>
