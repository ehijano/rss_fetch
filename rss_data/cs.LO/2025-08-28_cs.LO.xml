      <title>The Power of Regular Constraint Propagation (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The past decade has witnessed substantial developments in string solving. Motivated by the complexity of string solving strategies adopted in existing string solvers, we investigate a simple and generic method for solving string constraints: regular constraint propagation. The method repeatedly computes pre- or post-images of regular languages under the string functions present in a string formula, inferring more and more knowledge about the possible values of string variables, until either a conflict is found or satisfiability of the string formula can be concluded. Such a propagation strategy is applicable to string constraints with multiple operations like concatenation, replace, and almost all flavors of string transductions. We demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of this method theoretically and experimentally. On the theoretical side, we show that RCP is sound and complete for a large fragment of string constraints, subsuming both straight-line and chain-free constraints, two of the most expressive decidable fragments for which some modern string solvers provide formal completeness guarantees. On the practical side, we implement regular constraint propagation within the open-source string solver OSTRICH.
  Our experimental evaluation shows that this addition significantly improves OSTRICH's performance and makes it competitive with existing solvers. In fact, it substantially outperforms other solvers on random PCP and bioinformatics benchmarks. The results also suggest that incorporating regular constraint propagation alongside other techniques could lead to substantial performance gains for existing solvers.</description>

      <title>Between Markov and restriction: Two more monads on categories for relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of categories abstracting the structural properties of relations has been extensively developed over the years, resulting in a rich and diverse body of work. A previous paper offered a survey providing a modern and comprehensive presentation of these ``categories for relations'' as instances of gs-monoidal categories, showing how they arise as Kleisli categories of suitable symmetric monoidal monads. The end result was a taxonomy that organised numerous related concepts in the literature, including in particular Markov and restriction categories. This paper further enriches the taxonomy: it proposes two categories that are once more instances of gs-monoidal categories, yet more abstract than Markov and restriction categories. They are characterised by an axiomatic notion of mass and domain of an arrow, the latter one of the key ingredient of restriction categories, which generalises the domain of partial functions. The paper then introduces mass and domain preserving monads, proving that the associated Kleisli categories in fact preserve the corresponding equations and that these monads arise naturally for the categories of semiring-weighted relations.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous LLM Methods for Ontology Learning (Few-Shot Prompting, Ensemble Typing, and Attention-Based Taxonomies)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive system for addressing Tasks A, B, and C of the LLMs4OL 2025 challenge, which together span the full ontology construction pipeline: term extraction, typing, and taxonomy discovery. Our approach combines retrieval-augmented prompting, zero-shot classification, and attention-based graph modeling -- each tailored to the demands of the respective task. For Task A, we jointly extract domain-specific terms and their ontological types using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Training data was reformulated into a document to terms and types correspondence, while test-time inference leverages semantically similar training examples. This single-pass method requires no model finetuning and improves overall performance through lexical augmentation Task B, which involves assigning types to given terms, is handled via a dual strategy. In the few-shot setting (for domains with labeled training data), we reuse the RAG scheme with few-shot prompting. In the zero-shot setting (for previously unseen domains), we use a zero-shot classifier that combines cosine similarity scores from multiple embedding models using confidence-based weighting. In Task C, we model taxonomy discovery as graph inference. Using embeddings of type labels, we train a lightweight cross-attention layer to predict is-a relations by approximating a soft adjacency matrix. These modular, task-specific solutions enabled us to achieve top-ranking results in the official leaderboard across all three tasks. Taken together these strategies showcase the scalability, adaptability, and robustness of LLM-based architectures for ontology learning across heterogeneous domains.

      <title>Formal Verification of Physical Layer Security Protocols for Next-Generation Communication Networks (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19430v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formal verification is crucial for ensuring the robustness of security protocols against adversarial attacks. The Needham-Schroeder protocol, a foundational authentication mechanism, has been extensively studied, including its integration with Physical Layer Security (PLS) techniques such as watermarking and jamming. Recent research has used ProVerif to verify these mechanisms in terms of secrecy. However, the ProVerif-based approach limits the ability to improve understanding of security beyond verification results. To overcome these limitations, we re-model the same protocol using an Isabelle formalism that generates sound animation, enabling interactive and automated formal verification of security protocols. Our modelling and verification framework is generic and highly configurable, supporting both cryptography and PLS. For the same protocol, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis (secrecy and authenticity in four different eavesdropper locations under both passive and active attacks) using our new web interface. Our findings not only successfully reproduce and reinforce previous results on secrecy but also reveal an uncommon but expected outcome: authenticity is preserved across all examined scenarios, even in cases where secrecy is compromised. We have proposed a PLS-based Diffie-Hellman protocol that integrates watermarking and jamming, and our analysis shows that it is secure for deriving a session key with required authentication. These highlight the advantages of our novel approach, demonstrating its robustness in formally verifying security properties beyond conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Intersection Types for a Computational Lambda-Calculus with Global State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.01358v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the semantics of an untyped lambda-calculus equipped with operators representing read and write operations from and to a global store. We adopt the monadic approach to model side-effects and treat read and write as algebraic operations over a monad. We introduce operational and denotational semantics and a type assignment system of intersection types and prove that types are invariant under the reduction and expansion of term and state configurations. Finally, we characterize convergent terms via their typings.</description>

      <title>Positive Hennessy-Milner Logic for Branching Bisimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07380v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Labelled transitions systems can be studied in terms of modal logic and in terms of bisimulation. These two notions are connected by Hennessy-Milner theorems, that show that two states are bisimilar precisely when they satisfy the same modal logic formulas. Recently, apartness has been studied as a dual to bisimulation, which also gives rise to a dual version of the Hennessy-Milner theorem: two states are apart precisely when there is a modal formula that distinguishes them.
  In this paper, we introduce "directed" versions of Hennessy-Milner theorems that characterize when the theory of one state is included in the other. For this we introduce "positive modal logics" that only allow a limited use of negation. Furthermore, we introduce directed notions of bisimulation and apartness, and then show that, for this positive modal logic, the theory of $s$ is included in the theory of $t$ precisely when $s$ is directed bisimilar to $t$. Or, in terms of apartness, we show that $s$ is directed apart from $t$ precisely when the theory of $s$ is not included in the theory of $t$. From the directed version of the Hennessy-Milner theorem, the original result follows.
  In particular, we study the case of branching bisimulation and Hennessy-Milner Logic with Until (HMLU) as a modal logic. We introduce "directed branching bisimulation" (and directed branching apartness) and "Positive Hennessy-Milner Logic with Until" (PHMLU) and we show the directed version of the Hennessy-Milner theorems. In the process, we show that every HMLU formula is equivalent to a Boolean combination of Positive HMLU formulas, which is a very non-trivial result. This gives rise to a sublogic of HMLU that is equally expressive but easier to reason about.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Dependency Quantified Boolean Formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetries have been exploited successfully within the realms of SAT and QBF to improve solver performance in practical applications and to devise more powerful proof systems. As a first step towards extending these advancements to the class of dependency quantified Boolean formulas (DQBFs), which generalize QBF by allowing more nuanced variable dependencies, this work develops a comprehensive theory to characterize symmetries for DQBFs. We also introduce the notion of symmetry breakers of DQBFs, along with a concrete construction, and discuss how to detect DQBF symmetries algorithmically using a graph-based approach. Moreover, we empirically study the presence of symmetries in benchmark formulas and their impact on solving times.</description>

      <title>Relative fixed points of functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how the relatively initial or relatively terminal fixed points for a well-behaved functor $F$ form a pair of adjoint functors between $F$-coalgebras and $F$-algebras. We use the language of locally presentable categories to find sufficient conditions for existence of this adjunction. We show that relative fixed points may be characterized as (co)equalizers of the free (co)monad on $F$. In particular, when $F$ is a polynomial functor on $\mathsf{Set}$ the relative fixed points are a quotient or subset of the free term algebra or the cofree term coalgebra. We give examples of the relative fixed points for polynomial functors and an example which is the Sierpinski carpet. Lastly, we prove a general preservation result for relative fixed points.</description>

      <title>Putnam-AXIOM: A Functional and Static Benchmark for Measuring Higher Level Mathematical Reasoning in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current mathematical reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are approaching saturation, with some achieving &gt; 90% accuracy, and are increasingly compromised by training-set contamination. We introduce Putnam-AXIOM, a benchmark of 522 university-level competition problems drawn from the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, and Putnam-AXIOM Variation, an unseen companion set of 100 functional variants generated by programmatically perturbing variables and constants. The variation protocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances -- yielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's o1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy drops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The remaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and highlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement "boxed" accuracy with Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores reasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM therefore provides a rigorous, contamination-resilient evaluation framework for assessing advanced mathematical reasoning of LLMs. Data and evaluation code are publicly available at https://github.com/brando90/putnam-axiom.</description>
