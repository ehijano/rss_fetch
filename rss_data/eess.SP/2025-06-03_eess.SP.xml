      <title>Movable Antenna Enhanced Federated Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models via Hybrid Client Selection Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) training in 6G networks faces stringent latency and energy constraints while operating over bandwidth-limited wireless links. A commonly adopted workflow separates training into a centralized pre-training phase and a federated fine-tuning phase on domain-specific data; however, over-the-air (OTA) gradient aggregation during fine-tuning remains vulnerable to fading and interference. This study explores the integration of movable antennas (MAs), whose element positions can be reconfigured in real time, to mitigate such channel impairments. An auxiliary channel representation embeds transmit power terms in the effective gain, thereby removing explicit power-control variables. We derive the convergence bound that determines the relationship between the final fine-tuning loss to OTA noise and the distribution shift between the two data stages, measured via the Wasserstein distance. These findings lead to a mixed integer, nonconvex resource allocation problem that jointly determines the numbers of global rounds, CPU frequencies, mini-batch sizes, positions of MAs, and beamformers under latency-energy constraints. We propose a hybrid successive convex approximation (SCA) and penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm to solve the problem. Experiments with the OpenLLaMA v2 model with 3 billion parameters demonstrate up to $95\%$ faster convergence and over $90\%$ lower total energy consumption relative to the leading wireless federated learning baselines, underscoring the promise of MAs-assisted federated LLM fine-tuning for 6G edge intelligence.</description>

      <title>STARS-assisted Near-field ISAC: Sensor Deployment and Beamforming Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting surface (STARS) assisted near-field (NF) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework is proposed, where the radio sensors are installed on the STARS to directly conduct the distance-domain sensing by exploiting the characteristic spherical wavefront. A new squared position error bound (SPEB) expression is derived to reveal the dependence on beamforming (BF) design and sensor deployment. To balance the trade-off between the SPEB and the sensor deployment cost, a cost function minimization problem, a cost function minimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the sensor deployment, the active and passive BF, subject to communication and power consumption constraints. For the sensor deployment optimization, a joint sensor deployment algorithm is proposed by invoking the successive convex approximation. Under a specific relationship between the sensor numbers and BF design, we derive the optimal sensor interval in a closed-form expression. For the joint BF optimization, a penalty-based method is invoked. Simulation results validated that the derived SPEB expression is close to the exact SPEB, which reveals the Fisher information Matrix of position estimation in NF can be approximated as a diagonal matrix. Furthermore, the proposed algorithms achieve the best SPEB performance than the benchmark schemes accompanying the lowest deployment cost.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Uniform Circular Array on Near-field ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel uniform circular array (UCA) based near-field (NF) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework is proposed, where the Cylindrical coordinate is invoked to evaluate the joint positioning performance. The joint squared position error bound (SPEB) of the sensing target (ST) is derived for the coplanar and non-coplanar cases. For the coplanar case, where the ST is located in the coplanar region of the UCA, the approximate Cram{\'e}r-Rao bound (CRB) expressions for the separate angle and distance estimation are given by exploiting the uniform spherical wavefront model. A SPEB minimization problem is formulated with the constraints of communication requirement and power budget, where the closed-form solution to minimize the CRB of the angle is derived. Inspired by the close-form expression, a low complexity vector-based quadratic transformation (VQF) algorithm is proposed by invoking the Rayleigh quotient. For the non-coplanar case, where the ST is located beyond the coplanar region of the UCA, the separate CRBs over three-dimensional coordinates and the joint SPEB approximations are derived. To minimize the SPEB performance, the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) method and extended low-complexity VQF algorithm are proposed. Numerical results validated that i) the Fisher Information Matrix about angle and distance in NF propagation can be approximated as a diagonal matrix with the trinity loss; ii) Compared with the uniform planar array, the UCA achieve better positioning performance when ST located in the coplanar of the antenna array; and iii) the proposed VQF algorithms reach higher solution precision than conventional SDR algorithm with much less computation complexity.</description>

      <title>Power-of-Two (PoT) Weights in Large Language Models (LLMs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complexity of Neural Networks is increasing rapidly due to the massive increase in model parameters. Specifically, in Large Language Models (LLMs), the number of model parameters has grown exponentially in the past few years, for example, from 1.5 billion parameters in GPT2 to 175 billion in GPT3. This raises a significant challenge for implementation, especially for Edge devices where memory and processing power are very limited. In this work, we investigate reducing LLM complexity with special type of quantization, power of two (PoT), for linear layers weights and transformer tables. PoT not only provides memory reduction but more importantly provides significant computational reduction through converting multiplication to bit shifting. We obtained preliminary results of PoT quantization on Nano-GPT implementation using Shakespeare dataset. We then extended results to 124-M GPT-2 model. The PoT quantization results are shown to be very promising with cross entropy loss degradation $\approx$[1.3-0.88] with number of bits range [4-6] to represent power levels.</description>

      <title>Single-layer Circular SIW Filtenna With Beam Scanning Capability for 5G Millimeter Wave Communication Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this communication, two novel low-cost single-layer filtering antennas (filtennas) are proposed for millimeter wave (mmWave) applications. The proposed filtennas consists of a compact circular substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) cavity, a metal post close to the center of the cavity for power feeding, a metal post in the center for modes controlling, and a slot for radiating power. In the passband, the fundamental TM010 mode and the TM110 mode in the circular SIW cavity are excited by the feeding post. In addition, thanks to the high-pass characteristics of the cavity, it exhibits more than 20 dB suppression in the lower frequency band. There are three radiation nulls in Filtenna 1 and one radiation null in Filtenna 2 in the upper band which increase the suppression level as high as 18 dB. As a proof of concept, the proposed filtennas are fabricated and measured. It is shown that the Filtenna 1 can achieve simulated and measured -10 dB impedance fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 7.1% (27.14 - 29.13 GHz) and 8.6% (27.62 - 30.11 GHz), respectively. While filtenna 2 can achieve simulated and measured -10 dB FBW of 7.4% (27.86 - 29.99 GHz) and 10.1% (28.11 - 31.09 GHz), respectively. The filtennas features stable radiation patterns with an average gain of 5.0 dBi. The lower and upper sideband suppression levels for both filtennas exceed 18 dB. These filtennas are good candidates for 5G mmWave applications, as they simultaneously provide beam scanning and filtering capability with a low cost, and single layer structure.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-based Information-Theoretic Transceivers for High-Order Modulation Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network (NN)-based end-to-end (E2E) communication systems, in which each system component may consist of a portion of a neural network, have been investigated as potential tools for developing artificial intelligence (Al)-native E2E systems. In this paper, we propose an NN-based bitwise receiver that improves computational efficiency while maintaining performance comparable to baseline demappers. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel symbol-wise autoencoder (AE)-based E2E system that jointly optimizes the transmitter and receiver at the physical layer. We evaluate the proposed NN-based receiver using bit-error rate (BER) analysis to confirm that the numerical BER achieved by NN-based receivers or transceivers is accurate. Results demonstrate that the AE-based system outperforms baseline architectures, particularly for higher-order modulation schemes. We further show that the training signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) significantly affects the performance of the systems when inference is conducted at different SNR levels.</description>

      <title>Physics-based Generative Models for Geometrically Consistent and Interpretable Wireless Channel Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, machine learning (ML) methods have become increasingly popular in wireless communication systems for several applications. A critical bottleneck for designing ML systems for wireless communications is the availability of realistic wireless channel datasets, which are extremely resource-intensive to produce. To this end, the generation of realistic wireless channels plays a key role in the subsequent design of effective ML algorithms for wireless communication systems. Generative models have been proposed to synthesize channel matrices, but outputs produced by such methods may not correspond to geometrically viable channels and do not provide any insight into the scenario being generated. In this work, we aim to address both these issues by integrating established parametric, physics-based geometric channel (PPGC) modeling frameworks with generative methods to produce realistic channel matrices with interpretable representations in the parameter domain. We show that generative models converge to prohibitively suboptimal stationary points when learning the underlying prior directly over the parameters due to the non-convex PPGC model. To address this limitation, we propose a linearized reformulation of the problem to ensure smooth gradient flow during generative model training, while also providing insights into the underlying physical environment. We evaluate our model against prior baselines by comparing the generated, scenario-specific samples in terms of the 2-Wasserstein distance and through its utility when used for downstream compression tasks.</description>

      <title>A Family of Robust Generalized Adaptive Filters and Application for Time-series Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuous development of new adaptive filters (AFs) based on novel cost functions (CFs) is driven by the demands of various application scenarios and noise environments. However, these algorithms typically demonstrate optimal performance only in specific conditions. In the event of the noise change, the performance of these AFs often declines, rendering simple parameter adjustments ineffective. Instead, a modification of the CF is necessary. To address this issue, the robust generalized adaptive AF (RGA-AF) with strong adaptability and flexibility is proposed in this paper. The flexibility of the RGA-AF's CF allows for smooth adaptation to varying noise environments through parameter adjustments, ensuring optimal filtering performance in diverse scenarios. Moreover, we introduce several fundamental properties of negative RGA (NRGA) entropy and present the negative asymmetric RGA-AF (NAR-GA-AF) and kernel recursive NRGA-AF (KRNRGA-AF). These AFs address asymmetric noise distribution and nonlinear filtering issues, respectively. Simulations of linear system identification and time-series prediction for Chua's circuit under different noise environments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms in comparison to existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Transient Error Analysis of the LMS and RLS Algorithm for Graph Signal Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the proposal of the least mean square (LMS) and recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm for graph signal processing (GSP) provides excellent solutions for processing signals defined on irregular structures such as sensor networks. The existing work has completed the steady state error analysis of the GSP LMS algorithm and GSP RLS algorithm in Gaussian noise scenarios, and a range of values for the step size of the GSP LMS algorithm has also been given. Meanwhile, the transient error analysis of the GSP LMS algorithm and GSP RLS algorithm is also important and challenging. Completing the above work will help to quantitatively analyze the performance of the graph signal adaptive estimation algorithm at transient moments, which is what this paper is working on. By using formula derivation and mathematical induction, the transient errors expressions of the GSP LMS and GSP RLS algorithm are given in this paper. Based on the Brazilian temperature datasets, the related simulation experiments are executed, which strongly demonstrate the correctness of our proposed theoretical analysis</description>

      <title>Attention-Aided MMSE for OFDM Channel Estimation: Learning Linear Filters with Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), accurate channel estimation is crucial. Classical signal processing based approaches, such as minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation, often require second-order statistics that are difficult to obtain in practice. Recent deep neural networks based methods have been introduced to address this; yet they often suffer from high complexity. This paper proposes an Attention-aided MMSE (A-MMSE), a novel model-based DNN framework that learns the optimal MMSE filter via the Attention Transformer. Once trained, the A-MMSE estimates the channel through a single linear operation for channel estimation, eliminating nonlinear activations during inference and thus reducing computational complexity. To enhance the learning efficiency of the A-MMSE, we develop a two-stage Attention encoder, designed to effectively capture the channel correlation structure. Additionally, a rank-adaptive extension of the proposed A-MMSE allows flexible trade-offs between complexity and channel estimation accuracy. Extensive simulations with 3GPP TDL channel models demonstrate that the proposed A-MMSE consistently outperforms other baseline methods in terms of normalized MSE across a wide range of SNR conditions. In particular, the A-MMSE and its rank-adaptive extension establish a new frontier in the performance complexity trade-off, redefining the standard for practical channel estimation methods.</description>

      <title>The Coupling Effect of Sensing Targets on the Environment for 3GPP ISAC Channels: Observation, Modeling, and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing And Communication (ISAC) has been identified as a key 6G application by ITU and 3GPP, with standardization efforts already underway. Sensing tasks, such as target localization, demand more precise characterization of the sensing target (ST) in ISAC channel modeling. The ST couples complexly with environmental scatterers, potentially blocking some multipaths and generating new ones, resulting in power variations compared to the original channel. To accurately model this effect, this paper proposes a coupled ISAC channel model based on measurements and validates it through similarity analysis between simulated and measured channels. In this work, we first conduct ISAC channel measurements in an indoor factory scenario at 105 GHz, where the multipath power variations caused by the ST's interaction with the environment are clearly observed. Then, we propose an ISAC channel modeling framework that incorporates two novel parameters: the Blockage-Region Coupling Factor (BR-CF) and the Forward-Scattering (FS)-CF, which characterize the spatial region and intensity of the coupling effect, respectively. Finally, the proposed model is validated through similarity comparison with measured data, demonstrating higher accuracy for both LoS and NLoS scenarios compared to the non-coupled model. This realistic ISAC channel model provides an effective framework for capturing the ST-environment coupling effect, supporting the design and evaluation of ISAC technologies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the second-order characteristics of the radar return signal from a swarm of rotor drones. We consider the case of a swarm of identical drones, with each a number of rotors comprised of a number of rotor blades. By considering the orientation and speed of each rotor as stochastic variables, we derive expressions for the autocorrelation function (ACF) and power spectral density (PSD). The ACF and PSD are in the form of an infinite series with coefficients that drop to zero at a predictable limit. Thus in practical applications, the series may be truncated. As a special case, we show that for deterministic rotor speed, the ACF can be expressed in closed form. We further investigate how system parameters (Blade length, Rotor speed, number of blades, and number of drones) influence the derived expressions for the ACF and PSD.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing, Computing and Semantic Communication for Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for integrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (ISCSC) within vehicular networks comprising a roadside unit (RSU) and multiple autonomous vehicles. Both the RSU and the vehicles are equipped with local knowledge bases to facilitate semantic communication. The framework incorporates a secure communication design to ensure that messages intended for specific vehicles are protected against interception. In this model, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed by the RSU to accurately track all vehicles. We formulate a joint optimization problem that balances maximizing the probabilistically constrained semantic secrecy rate for each vehicle while minimizing the sum of the posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound (PCRB), subject to the RSU's computing capabilities. This non-convex optimization problem is addressed using Bernstein-type inequality (BTI) and alternating optimization (AO) techniques. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating its advantages in reliable sensing, high data throughput, and secure communication.</description>

      <title>Joint Activity Detection and Channel Estimation for Massive Connectivity: Where Message Passing Meets Score-Based Generative Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive connectivity supports the sporadic access of a vast number of devices without requiring prior permission from the base station (BS). In such scenarios, the BS must perform joint activity detection and channel estimation (JADCE) prior to data reception. Message passing algorithms have emerged as a prominent solution for JADCE under a Bayesian inference framework. The existing message passing algorithms, however, typically rely on some hand-crafted and overly simplistic priors of the wireless channel, leading to significant channel estimation errors and reduced activity detection accuracy. In this paper, we focus on the problem of JADCE in a multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) grant-free random access network. We propose to incorporate a more accurate channel prior learned by score-based generative models into message passing, so as to push towards the performance limit of JADCE. Specifically, we develop a novel turbo message passing (TMP) framework that models the entire channel matrix as a super node, rather than factorizing it element-wise. This design enables the seamless integration of score-based generative models as a minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) denoiser. The variance of the denoiser, which is essential in message passing, can also be learned through score-based generative models. Our approach, termed score-based TMP for JADCE (STMP-JADCE), takes full advantages of the powerful generative prior and, meanwhile, benefits from the fast convergence speed of message passing. Numerical simulations show that STMP-JADCE drastically enhances the activity detection and channel estimation performance compared to the state-of-the-art baseline algorithms.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Pinching-Antenna Systems in Multicast Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pinching-antenna system (PASS) reconfigures wireless links through pinching beamforming, in which the activated locations of pinching antennas (PAs) along dielectric waveguides are optimized. This article investigates the application of PASS in multicast communication systems, where pinching beamforming is designed to maximize the multicast rate. i) In the single-waveguide scenario, a closed-form solution for the optimal activated location is derived under the assumption of a single PA and linearly distributed users. Based on this, a closed-form expression for the achievable multicast rate is obtained and proven to be larger than that of conventional fixed-location antenna systems. For the general multiple-PA case with arbitrary user distributions, an element-wise alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed to design the pinching beamformer. ii) In the multiple-waveguide scenario, an AO-based method is developed to jointly optimize the transmit and pinching beamformers. Specifically, the transmit beamformer is updated using a majorization-minimization (MM) framework together with second-order cone programming (SOCP), while the pinching beamformer is optimized via element-wise sequential refinement. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that: i) PASS achieves significantly higher multicast rates than conventional fixed-location antenna systems, particularly when the number of users and spatial coverage increase; ii) increasing the number of PAs further improves the multicast performance of PASS.</description>

      <title>Over-the-air Multifunctional Wideband Electromagnetic Signal Processing using Dynamic Scattering Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet the stringent requirements of next-generation wireless networks, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is expected to become massive and pervasive. Unfortunately, this could pose scalability issues in terms of complexity, power consumption, cost, and processing latency. Therefore, novel technologies and design approaches, such as the recently introduced holographic MIMO paradigm, must be investigated to make future networks sustainable. In this context, we investigate the concept of a dynamic scattering array (DSA) as a versatile electromagnetic (EM) structure capable of performing joint wave-based computing and radiation by moving the processing from the digital domain to the EM domain. We provide a general, wideband analytical framework for modeling the DSA, which includes a power matching network and realistic reconfigurable loads. Then we introduce specific design algorithms, and apply them to various use cases. We demonstrate that some recent EM processing structures can be seen as particular cases of our general framework. The examples presented in the numerical results corroborate the potential of DSAs to reduce complexity and the number of radiofrequency (RF) chains in holographic MIMO systems while achieving enhanced EM wave processing and radiation flexibility for tasks such as beamforming and single- and multi-user MIMO, also exhibiting superdirectivity capabilities.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Sounding in ISAC networks: Design and Implementation of a Multi-Node Testbed with Synchronized Airborne and Ground-Based Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) capabilities become more prevalent in the mobile 6G radio landscape, there is a substantial opportunity to enhance situational awareness across diverse applications through multi-static radar sensing within meshed ISAC networks. To facilitate the development and testing of detection and localization algorithms across diverse scenarios, this paper introduces a synchronized distributed channel sounding testbed with airborne and ground-based multi-channel transceiver nodes with centimeter-level positioning accuracy enabled by real-time kinematic (RTK) and inertial navigation system (INS) data. Our modular experimental measurement system is designed to include stationary sensor nodes and light-weight to medium-weight mobile nodes deployable on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), cars, pedestrians, and cyclists. Utilizing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware, specifically software defined radios (SDRs), the testbed encourages reproducibility in academic research laboratories. We detail the individual modules and integration steps required to achieve the specified performance. The testbed's capabilities are validated through a real-world measurement campaign, including stationary and flying sensor nodes, aimed at detecting radar targets such as vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircrafts, small hexacopters, cars and vulnerable road users (VRUs) in air-to-air (A2A) and air-to-ground (A2G) scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to the sixth-generation (6G) network is anticipated to redefine wireless transceiver architectures, demanding higher adaptability and efficiency at the antenna layer. Electromagnetically reconfigurable antennas (ERAs) have emerged as a promising solution capable of dynamically reconfiguring wireless channels to meet these requirements. This article presents an overview of recent advancements in ERA technology, underscoring its transformative potential for 6G applications. Drawing from several initial studies, we demonstrate that ERAs can significantly enhance communication rates and hardware efficiency. Nevertheless, critical challenges remain in hardware design and signal processing methodologies, necessitating concerted efforts from both the antenna and communication communities. We identify these gaps and outline key research directions to fully unlock the capabilities of ERAs in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>On the Use of Bj\"orck Sequences in LEO-based PNT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of Bj\"orck sequences, a class of constant amplitude zero autocorrelation (CAZAC) sequences, as a potential candidate for the design of positioning reference signals (PRS) in Low Earth Orbit (LEO)-based positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) systems. Unlike legacy systems such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) or terrestrial networks (TNs), LEO-based systems experience large Doppler shifts and delay spreads, where traditional orthogonalization methods become ineffective. Compared to commonly used sequences such as Gold and Zadoff-Chu (ZC), Bj\"orck sequences offer improved ambiguity function behavior, nearly ideal autocorrelation, greater resilience to interference, and accurate delay estimation in high Doppler environments. We further propose a novel sequence construction method to extend Bj\"orck sequences to non-prime lengths while minimizing cyclic autocorrelation. Focusing on LEO-based non-terrestrial network (NTN) localization, we evaluate positioning accuracy under various interference conditions, comparing the performance of Bj\"orck sequences against Gold sequences, which are traditionally used for PRS generation. While Bj\"orck sequences demonstrate strong performance in Doppler-rich environments, we identify an inherent Doppler-dependent behavior that may lead to sequence misidentification. To mitigate this, we propose two strategies: 1) leveraging the availability of a coarse Doppler estimate and 2) employing sequence subset selection to ensure sufficient separation between sequences to account for maximum Doppler uncertainty. Finally, we present scalable sequence reuse strategies for large LEO constellations.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Multiuser Localization Based on Extremely Large Antenna Array with Limited RF Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large antenna array (ELAA) not only effectively enhances system communication performance but also improves the sensing capabilities of communication systems, making it one of the key enabling technologies in 6G wireless networks. This paper investigates the multiuser localization problem in an uplink Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system, where the base station (BS) is equipped with an ELAA to receive signals from multiple single-antenna users. We exploit analog beamforming to reduce the number of radio frequency (RF) chains. We first develop a comprehensive near-field ELAA channel model that accounts for the antenna radiation pattern and free space path loss. Due to the large aperture of the ELAA, the angular resolution of the array is high, which improves user localization accuracy. However, it also makes the user localization problem highly non-convex, posing significant challenges when the number of RF chains is limited. To address this issue, we use an array partitioning strategy to divide the ELAA channel into multiple subarray channels and utilize the geometric constraints between user locations and subarrays for probabilistic modeling. To fully exploit these geometric constraints, we propose the array partitioning-based location estimation with limited measurements (APLE-LM) algorithm based on the message passing principle to achieve multiuser localization. We derive the Bayesian Cramer-Rao Bound (BCRB) as the theoretical performance lower bound for our formulated near-field multiuser localization problem. Extensive simulations under various parameter configurations validate the proposed APLE-LM algorithm. The results demonstrate that APLE-LM achieves superior localization accuracy compared to baseline algorithms and approaches the BCRB at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).</description>

      <title>Training Beam Design for Channel Estimation in Hybrid mmWave MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training beam design for channel estimation with infinite-resolution and low-resolution phase shifters (PSs) in hybrid analog-digital milimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is considered in this paper. By exploiting the sparsity of mmWave channels, the optimization of the sensing matrices (corresponding to training beams) is formulated according to the compressive sensing (CS) theory. Under the condition of infinite-resolution PSs, we propose relevant algorithms to construct the sensing matrix, where the theory of convex optimization and the gradient descent in Riemannian manifold is used to design the digital and analog part, respectively. Furthermore, a block-wise alternating hybrid analog-digital algorithm is proposed to tackle the design of training beams with low-resolution PSs, where the performance degeneration caused by non-convex constant modulus and discrete phase constraints is effectively compensated to some extent thanks to the iterations among blocks. Finally, the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) based estimator is adopted for achieving an effective recovery of the sparse mmWave channel. Simulation results demonstrate the performance advantages of proposed algorithms compared with some existing schemes.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Directional Modulation for RIS-Aided Movable Antenna MIMO Systems with Hardware Impairments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) are a promising technology to achieve a significant enhancement in rate for future wireless networks. The pioneering investigation on near-field directional modulation design for a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted MA system is presented, with the base station equipped with a MA array. To maximize the secrecy sum rate (Max-SSR) with hardware impairments (HWIs) and imperfect channel state information (CSI), which involves a joint optimization of beamforming vectors for confidential messages and artificial noise (AN), power allocation factors, phase shift matrices, MA positions, and receive beamforming vectors. Firstly, the transmit beamforming vectors and phase shift matrices are iteratively optimized, leveraging leakage theory and phase alignment techniques. Then, two novel algorithms for discrete MA positioning are proposed, respectively, employing uniform and compressed sensing (CS)-based non-uniform grouping strategies. Subsequently, the AN is considered and designed as the additional energy required for zero-space projection, and the receive beamforming vector is derived using the minimum mean square error (MMSE) method. The proposed algorithms have low computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Under HWIs and imperfect CSI, the proposed algorithm can achieve a 28\% enhancement in SSR performance while reducing the number of antennas by 37.5\% compared to traditional fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised-ISAR-Net Enables Fast Sparse ISAR Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous sparse inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging methods based on unfolded neural networks have been developed for high-quality image reconstruction with sparse measurements. However, their training typically requires paired ISAR images and echoes, which are often difficult to obtain. Meanwhile, one property can be observed that for a certain sparse measurement configuration of ISAR, when a target is rotated around its center of mass, only the image of the target undergoes the corresponding rotation after ISAR imaging, while the grating lobes do not follow this rotation and are solely determined by the sparse-sampling pattern. This property is mathematically termed as the equivariant property. Taking advantage of this property, an unfolded neural network for sparse ISAR imaging with self-supervised learning, named SS-ISAR-Net is proposed. It effectively mitigates grating lobes caused by sparse radar echo, allowing high-quality training to be achieved using only sparse radar echo data. The superiority of the proposed SS-ISAR-Net, compared to existing methods, is verified through experiments with both synthetic and real-world measurement data.</description>

      <title>A Group-Wise Narrow Beam Design for Uplink Channel Estimation in Hybrid Beamforming Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider uplink channel estimation for massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems with partially connected hybrid beamforming (PC-HBF) structures. Existing beam design and channel estimation schemes are usually based on ideal assumptions and require transmitting pilots across multiple timeslots, making them unsuitable for practical PC-HBF systems. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a novel beam design and a corresponding channel estimation algorithm to achieve accurate and real-time uplink channel estimation. Firstly, we introduce a group-wise narrow beam design in the vertical dimension to suppress interference from undesired angular components and improve vertical angle estimation accuracy,which divides the columns of the uniform planar array (UPA)into groups and the vertical angle interval into sub-intervals.In this way, each group is assigned with a narrow beam to cover one vertical angle sub-interval, and the set of narrow beams is designed based on the filter design theory. Secondly, we optimize the antenna grouping pattern using the Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA), balancing interference suppression and resolution capability in the horizontal dimension, leading to a better horizontal angle estimation performance. Finally, we design a low-complexity group-wise subspace constrained variational Bayesian inference (GW-SC-VBI) algorithm to fully take advantage of the proposed beam design to achieve both low-complexity and high-accurate channel estimation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves notable performance gains over baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Scalable Association of Users in CF-mMIMO: A Synergy of Communication, Sensing, and JCAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) is a key enabler for the sixth generation (6G) networks, offering unprecedented spectral efficiency and ubiquitous coverage. In CF-mMIMO systems, the association of user equipments (UEs) to access points (APs) is a critical challenge, as it directly impacts network scalability, interference management, and overall system performance. Conventional association methods primarily focus on optimizing communication performance. However, with the emergence of sensing and joint communication and sensing (JCAS) requirements, conventional approaches become insufficient. To address this challenge, we propose a scalable user association (SUA) scheme for CF-mMIMO networks, considering heterogeneous UE requirements. Designed to enhance the performance of both sensing and communication, the proposed SUA scheme aims to ensure network scalability. This is achieved by dynamically assigning APs to UEs based on their specific service requirements (communication, sensing, or JCAS), while considering link quality, interference mitigation, and network-related constraints. Specifically, the proposed SUA scheme employs AP masking, link prioritization, and an optimization-based association mechanism to select the most suitable APs for each UE. Simulations show that, compared to conventional CF-mMIMO methods, the proposed SUA scheme significantly reduces interference and computational runtime, while improving the symbol error rate for communication and the probability of detection for sensing.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Adaptive Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-based robust adaptive beamforming (RAB) enables enhanced robustness against model uncertainties, such as steering vector mismatches and interference-plus-noise covariance matrix estimation errors. Existing DRO-based RAB methods primarily rely on uncertainty sets characterized by the first- and second-order moments. In this work, we propose a novel Wasserstein DRO-based beamformer, using the worst-case signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio maximization formulation. The proposed method leverages the Wasserstein metric to define uncertainty sets, offering a data-driven characterization of uncertainty. We show that the choice of the Wasserstein cost function plays a crucial role in shaping the resulting formulation, with norm-based and Mahalanobis-like quadratic costs recovering classical norm-constrained and ellipsoidal robust beamforming models, respectively. This insight highlights the Wasserstein DRO framework as a unifying approach, bridging deterministic and distributionally robust beamforming methodologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites in the next generation (Next-G) communication systems has been gaining traction over the last few years due to their potential for providing global connectivity with low latency. Since they are the closest to the earth they come with their own set of disadvantages including high vulnerability to jamming and interference. To address these issues, this paper introduces a resilient, self-healing network designed to optimize signal quality under dynamic interference and adversarial conditions. The network leverages inter-satellite communication and an intelligent algorithm selection process, incorporating combining techniques like distributed-Maximal Ratio Combining (d-MRC), distributed-Linear Minimum Mean Squared Error Estimation (d-LMMSE), and Selection Combining (SC). These algorithms are selected to improve performance by adapting to changing network conditions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, we develop a software-defined radio (SDR)-based hardware testbed and perform detailed performance evaluations. Additionally, we present results from field tests conducted on the AERPAW testbed, which validate the proposed combining solutions in real-world scenarios. The results show that our approach makes LEO satellite networks more reliable and better able to handle interference, making them suitable for critical communications.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Integrated Communication and Computation via Non-Terrestrial Networks with Uncertainty Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-terrestrial network (NTN)-based integrated communication and computation empowers various emerging applications with global coverage. Yet this vision is severely challenged by the energy issue given the limited energy supply of NTN nodes and the energy-consuming nature of communication and computation. In this paper, we investigate the energy-efficient integrated communication and computation for the ground node data through a NTN, incorporating an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a satellite. We jointly consider ground data offloading to the UAV, edge processing on the UAV, and the forwarding of results from UAV to satellite, where we particularly address the uncertainties of the UAV-satellite links due to the large distance and high dynamics therein. Accordingly, we propose to minimize the weighted energy consumption due to data offloading, UAV computation, UAV transmission, and UAV propulsion, in the presence of angular uncertainties under Gaussian distribution within the UAV-satellite channels. The formulated problem with probabilistic constraints due to uncertainties is converted into a deterministic form by exploiting the Bernstein-type inequality, which is then solved using a block coordinate descent framework with algorithm design. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance superiority of our proposal in terms of energy sustainability, along with the robustness against uncertain non-terrestrial environments.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum MIMO Receivers for The Multi-User Uplink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have emerged as a promising solution for evolving wireless receivers from the classical to the quantum domain. To further unleash their great potential in wireless communications, we propose a flexible architecture for Rydberg atomic quantum multiple-input multiple-output (RAQ-MIMO) receivers in the multi-user uplink. Then the corresponding signal model of the RAQ-MIMO system is constructed by paving the way from quantum physics to classical wireless communications. Explicitly, we outline the associated operating principles and transmission flow. We also validate the linearity of our model and its feasible region. Based on our model, we derive closed-form asymptotic formulas for the ergodic achievable rate (EAR) of both the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) receivers operating in uncorrelated fading channels (UFC) and the correlated fading channels (CFC), respectively. Furthermore, we theoretically characterize the EAR difference both between the UFC and CFC scenarios, as well as MRC and ZF schemes. More particularly, we quantify the superiority of RAQ-MIMO receivers over the classical massive MIMO (M-MIMO) receivers, specifying an increase of $\log_{2} \Pi$ of the EAR per user, $\Pi$-fold reduction of the users' transmit power, and $\sqrt[\nu]{\Pi}$-fold increase of the transmission distance, respectively, where $\Pi = \text{ReceiverGainRatio} / \text{ReceiverNoisePowerRatio}$ of the single-sensor receivers and $\nu$ is the path-loss exponent. Our simulation results reveal that, compared to classical M-MIMO receivers, our RAQ-MIMO scheme can either realize $\sim 12$ bits/s/Hz/user ($\sim 8$ bits/s/Hz/user) higher EAR, or $\sim 10000$-fold ($\sim 500$-fold) lower transmit power, or alternatively, $\sim 100$-fold ($\sim 21$-fold) longer distance in free-space transmissions, in the standard quantum limit (photon shot limit).</description>

      <title>From Turbulence to Tranquility: AI-Driven Low-Altitude Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Altitude Economy (LAE) networks own transformative potential in urban mobility, emergency response, and aerial logistics. However, these networks face significant challenges in spectrum management, interference mitigation, and real-time coordination across dynamic and resource-constrained environments. After addressing these challenges, this study explores three core elements for enabling intelligent LAE networks as follows machine learning-based spectrum sensing and coexistence, artificial intelligence (AI)-optimized resource allocation and trajectory planning, and testbed-driven validation and standardization. We highlight how federated and reinforcement learning techniques support decentralized, adaptive decision-making under mobility and energy constraints. In addition, we discuss the role of real-world platforms such as AERPAW in bridging the gap between simulation and deployment and enabling iterative system refinement under realistic conditions. This study aims to provide a forward-looking roadmap toward developing efficient and interoperable AI-driven LAE ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Enabling Scalable Distributed Beamforming via Networked LEO Satellites Towards 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose scalable distributed beamforming schemes over low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks that rely solely on statistical channel state information for downlink orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems. We begin by introducing the system model and presenting a pragmatic yet effective analog beamformer and user-scheduling design. We then derive a closed-form lower bound on the ergodic sum rate, based on the hardening bound, for the digital beamformer design. Next, we formulate a per-satellite power-constrained sum-rate maximization problem, whose centralized solution, obtained via the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) framework, establishes performance limits and motivates decentralized strategies. We subsequently introduce two decentralized optimization schemes, based on approximating the hardening bound and decentralizing the WMMSE framework, for representative inter-satellite link topologies. In the Ring scheme, satellites update beamformers locally and exchange intermediate parameters sequentially. In the Star scheme, edge satellites update beamformers locally and in parallel, achieving consensus on intermediate parameters at a central satellite using a penalty-dual decomposition framework. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our distributed designs achieve near-centralized performance with superior scalability, substantially outperforming simple closed-form beamformers and single-satellite baselines in sum rate. Additionally, the delay-overhead trade-off between the two topologies is revealed.</description>

      <title>Unified Interference-Aware Water-Filling for QoS-Constrained Communication, Sensing, and JRC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water-filling (WF) algorithms are pivotal in maximizing capacity and spectral efficiency in multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, traditional WF approaches cater solely to communication requirements, neglecting the emerging heterogeneity of 6G, including sensing and joint radar-communication (JRC). As these diverse demands grow in importance and have different Quality of Service (QoS) constraints, traditional WF becomes inadequate. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a unified interference-aware and QoS-constrained WF algorithm for systems with communication, sensing, and JRC. The proposed algorithm enables power allocation for multi-user MIMO systems, effectively addressing interference and balancing the support for heterogeneous user requirements.</description>

      <title>Local Ambiguity Shaping for Doppler-Resilient Sequences Under Spectral and PAPR Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on designing Doppler-resilient sequences with low local Ambiguity Function (AF) sidelobes, subject to certain spectral and Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) constraints. To achieve this, we propose two distinctoptimization algorithms: (i) an Alternating Minimization (AM) algorithm for superior Weighted Peak Sidelobe Level (WPSL) minimization, and (ii) a low-complexity Augmented Lagrangian-assisted Majorization Minimization (ALaMM) algorithm with effective WPSL suppression. The proposed schemes hold great potential for sequence design in future 6G and integrated sensing and communication applications, supporting robust sensing under spectral coexistence constraints in high-mobility scenarios.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01696v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This tutorial aims to provide signal processing (SP) and machine learning (ML) practitioners with vital tools, in an accessible way, to answer the question: How to deal with missing data? There are many strategies to handle incomplete signals. In this paper, we propose to group these strategies based on three common tasks: i) missing-data imputation, ii) estimation with missing values and iii) prediction with missing values. We focus on methodological and experimental results through specific case studies on real-world applications. Promising and future research directions, including a better integration of informative missingness, are also discussed. We hope that the proposed conceptual framework and the presentation of recent missing-data problems related will encourage researchers of the SP and ML communities to develop original methods and to efficiently deal with new applications involving missing data.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the Combined Effective Radiation Pattern of UAV-Mounted Antennas and Ground Station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based communication typically involves a link between a UAV-mounted antenna and a ground station. The radiation pattern of both antennas is influenced by nearby reflecting surfaces and scatterers, such as the UAV body and the ground. Experimentally characterizing the effective radiation patterns of both antennas is challenging, as the received power depends on their interaction. In this study, we learn a combined radiation pattern from experimental UAV flight data, assuming the UAV travels with a fixed orientation (constant yaw angle and zero pitch/roll). We validate the characterized radiation pattern by cross-referencing it with experiments involving different UAV trajectories, all conducted under identical ground station and UAV orientation conditions. Experimental results show that the learned combined radiation pattern reduces received power estimation error by up to 10 dB, compared to traditional anechoic chamber radiation patterns that neglect the effects of the UAV body and surrounding objects.</description>

      <title>Feature Fusion and Knowledge-Distilled Multi-Modal Multi-Target Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the surveillance and defense domain, multi-target detection and classification (MTD) is considered essential yet challenging due to heterogeneous inputs from diverse data sources and the computational complexity of algorithms designed for resource-constrained embedded devices, particularly for Al-based solutions. To address these challenges, we propose a feature fusion and knowledge-distilled framework for multi-modal MTD that leverages data fusion to enhance accuracy and employs knowledge distillation for improved domain adaptation. Specifically, our approach utilizes both RGB and thermal image inputs within a novel fusion-based multi-modal model, coupled with a distillation training pipeline. We formulate the problem as a posterior probability optimization task, which is solved through a multi-stage training pipeline supported by a composite loss function. This loss function effectively transfers knowledge from a teacher model to a student model. Experimental results demonstrate that our student model achieves approximately 95% of the teacher model's mean Average Precision while reducing inference time by approximately 50%, underscoring its suitability for practical MTD deployment scenarios.</description>

      <title>Neuro2Semantic: A Transfer Learning Framework for Semantic Reconstruction of Continuous Language from Human Intracranial EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoding continuous language from neural signals remains a significant challenge in the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. We introduce Neuro2Semantic, a novel framework that reconstructs the semantic content of perceived speech from intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. Our approach consists of two phases: first, an LSTM-based adapter aligns neural signals with pre-trained text embeddings; second, a corrector module generates continuous, natural text directly from these aligned embeddings. This flexible method overcomes the limitations of previous decoding approaches and enables unconstrained text generation. Neuro2Semantic achieves strong performance with as little as 30 minutes of neural data, outperforming a recent state-of-the-art method in low-data settings. These results highlight the potential for practical applications in brain-computer interfaces and neural decoding technologies.</description>

      <title>Helmet ultrasound for brain imaging in post-hemicraniectomy patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noninvasive imaging deep into the adult brain at submillimeter and millisecond scales remains a challenge in medical imaging. Here, we report a helmet based ultrasound brain imager built from a customized helmet, a scanned ultrasound array, and three dimensional printing for real time imaging of human brain anatomical and functional information. Through its application to post hemicraniectomy patients in a sitting position, we achieved volumetric brain tissue structural, vascular, and blood flow images at centimeter scale depths with submillimeter and millisecond spatiotemporal resolutions. We also demonstrated the system capability to track cerebral blood flow over repeated imaging sessions, including during motion prone conditions. Our brain imager circumvents the skull and bridges the gap between high resolution human brain imaging and wearable convenience. This imager may serve as a platform for further investigations into human brain dynamics in post hemicraniectomy patients and offer insights into the brain that could surpass those obtained from non human primate studies.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Fronthaul Signaling for Uplink Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel resource-efficient over-the-air(OTA) computation framework to address the huge fronthaul computational and control overhead requirements in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks. We show that the global sufficient statistics to decode the data symbols can be computed OTA using the locally available information at the access points (APs). We provide the essential signal processing aspects at the APs and the central processing unit (CPU) to facilitate the OTA computation of sufficient statistics. The proposed framework scales effectively with an increase in the number of APs. We also make a comprehensive study of the benefits of an OTA framework compared to a conventional digital fronthaul in terms of the overhead associated in transferring the sufficient statistics from the APs to the CPU. To evaluate the performance of the OTA framework, we give closed-form expressions for the mean-square error (MSE)of the estimators of sufficient statistics and the overall data estimator. Furthermore, we assess the symbol error rate (SER)and bit error rate (BER) of the user equipment (UEs) data to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and benchmark them against the state-of-the-art wired fronthaul networks.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Channel Modeling for Molecular Communications in Tubular Environments with Heterogeneous Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC), one of the emerging techniques in the field of communication, is entering a new phase following several decades of foundational research. Recently, attention has shifted toward MC in liquid media, particularly within tubular environments, due to novel application scenarios. The spatial constraints of such environments make accurate modeling of molecular movement in tubes more challenging than in traditional free-space channels. In this paper, we propose a three-dimensional channel model for molecular communications with an absorbing ring-shaped receiver in a tubular environment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study to model the impact of an absorbing ring-shaped receiver on the channel response in tube-based MC systems. The problem is formulated as a partial differential equation with heterogeneous boundary conditions, and an approximate solution is derived under flow-dominated conditions. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated through particle-based simulations. We anticipate that the results of this study will contribute to the design of practical MC systems in real-world tubular environments.</description>

      <title>Conceal Truth while Show Fake: T/F Frequency Multiplexing based Anti-Intercepting Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In wireless communication adversarial scenarios, signals are easily intercepted by non-cooperative parties, exposing the transmission of confidential information. This paper proposes a true-and-false (T/F) frequency multiplexing based anti-intercepting transmission scheme capable of concealing truth while showing fake (CTSF), integrating both offensive and defensive strategies. Specifically, through multi-source cooperation, true and false signals are transmitted over multiple frequency bands using non-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing. The decoy signals are used to deceive non-cooperative eavesdropper, while the true signals are hidden to counter interception threats. Definitions for the interception and deception probabilities are provided, and the mechanism of CTSF is discussed. To improve the secrecy performance of true signals while ensuring decoy signals achieve their deceptive purpose, we model the problem as maximizing the sum secrecy rate of true signals, with constraint on the decoy effect. Furthermore, we propose a bi-stage alternating dual-domain optimization approach for joint optimization of both power allocation and correlation coefficients among multiple sources, and a Newton's method is proposed for fitting the T/F frequency multiplexing factor. In addition, simulation results verify the efficiency of anti-intercepting performance of our proposed CTSF scheme.</description>

      <title>anyECG-chat: A Generalist ECG-MLLM for Flexible ECG Input and Multi-Task Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has sparked interest in their application to electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. However, existing ECG-focused MLLMs primarily focus on report generation tasks, often limited to single 12-lead, short-duration (10s) ECG inputs, thereby underutilizing the potential of MLLMs. To this end, we aim to develop a MLLM for ECG analysis that supports a broader range of tasks and more flexible ECG inputs. However, existing ECG-QA datasets are often monotonous. To address this gap, we first constructed the anyECG dataset, which encompasses a wide variety of tasks, including report generation, abnormal waveform localization, and open-ended question answering. In addition to standard hospital ECGs, we introduced long-duration reduced-lead ECGs for home environments and multiple ECG comparison scenarios commonly encountered in clinical practice. Furthermore, we propose the anyECG-chat model, which supports dynamic-length ECG inputs and multiple ECG inputs. We trained the model using a three-stage curriculum training recipe with the anyECG dataset. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted, demonstrating that anyECG-chat is capable of supporting various practical application scenarios, including not only common report generation tasks but also abnormal waveform localization for long-duration reduced-lead ECGs in home environments and comprehensive comparative analysis of multiple ECGs.</description>

      <title>On the Stability of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks: A Probabilistic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01213v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing graph-structured data, achieving remarkable success across diverse applications. However, the theoretical understanding of the stability of these models, i.e., their sensitivity to small changes in the graph structure, remains in rather limited settings, hampering the development and deployment of robust and trustworthy models in practice. To fill this gap, we study how perturbations in the graph topology affect GCNN outputs and propose a novel formulation for analyzing model stability. Unlike prior studies that focus only on worst-case perturbations, our distribution-aware formulation characterizes output perturbations across a broad range of input data. This way, our framework enables, for the first time, a probabilistic perspective on the interplay between the statistical properties of the node data and perturbations in the graph topology. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate their benefits over existing baselines, in terms of both representation stability and adversarial attacks on downstream tasks. Our results demonstrate the practical significance of the proposed formulation and highlight the importance of incorporating data distribution into stability analysis.</description>

      <title>Learning Perceptually Relevant Temporal Envelope Morphing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal envelope morphing, the process of interpolating between the amplitude dynamics of two audio signals, is an emerging problem in generative audio systems that lacks sufficient perceptual grounding. Morphing of temporal envelopes in a perceptually intuitive manner should enable new methods for sound blending in creative media and for probing perceptual organization in psychoacoustics. However, existing audio morphing techniques often fail to produce intermediate temporal envelopes when input sounds have distinct temporal structures; many morphers effectively overlay both temporal structures, leading to perceptually unnatural results. In this paper, we introduce a novel workflow for learning envelope morphing with perceptual guidance: we first derive perceptually grounded morphing principles through human listening studies, then synthesize large-scale datasets encoding these principles, and finally train machine learning models to create perceptually intermediate morphs. Specifically, we present: (1) perceptual principles that guide envelope morphing, derived from our listening studies, (2) a supervised framework to learn these principles, (3) an autoencoder that learns to compress temporal envelope structures into latent representations, and (4) benchmarks for evaluating audio envelope morphs, using both synthetic and naturalistic data, and show that our approach outperforms existing methods in producing temporally intermediate morphs. All code, models, and datasets will be made publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>Lessons Learned from the URGENT 2024 Speech Enhancement Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The URGENT 2024 Challenge aims to foster speech enhancement (SE) techniques with great universality, robustness, and generalizability, featuring a broader task definition, large-scale multi-domain data, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. Nourished by the challenge outcomes, this paper presents an in-depth analysis of two key, yet understudied, issues in SE system development: data cleaning and evaluation metrics. We highlight several overlooked problems in traditional SE pipelines: (1) mismatches between declared and effective audio bandwidths, along with label noise even in various "high-quality" speech corpora; (2) lack of both effective SE systems to conquer the hardest conditions (e.g., speech overlap, strong noise / reverberation) and reliable measure of speech sample difficulty; (3) importance of combining multifaceted metrics for a comprehensive evaluation correlating well with human judgment. We hope that this endeavor can inspire improved SE pipeline designs in the future.</description>

      <title>The Promise of Spiking Neural Networks for Ubiquitous Computing: A Survey and New Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a class of bio -inspired networks that leverage sparse, event-driven signaling to achieve low-power computation while inherently modeling temporal dynamics. Such characteristics align closely with the demands of ubiquitous computing systems, which often operate on resource-constrained devices while continuously monitoring and processing time-series sensor data. Despite their unique and promising features, SNNs have received limited attention and remain underexplored (or at least, under-adopted) within the ubiquitous computing community. To address this gap, this paper first introduces the core components of SNNs, both in terms of models and training mechanisms. It then presents a systematic survey of 76 SNN-based studies focused on time-series data analysis, categorizing them into six key application domains. For each domain, we summarize relevant works and subsequent advancements, distill core insights, and highlight key takeaways for researchers and practitioners. To facilitate hands-on experimentation, we also provide a comprehensive review of current software frameworks and neuromorphic hardware platforms, detailing their capabilities and specifications, and then offering tailored recommendations for selecting development tools based on specific application needs. Finally, we identify prevailing challenges within each application domain and propose future research directions that need be explored in ubiquitous community. Our survey highlights the transformative potential of SNNs in enabling energy-efficient ubiquitous sensing across diverse application domains, while also serving as an essential introduction for researchers looking to enter this emerging field.</description>

      <title>Practical Short-Length Coding Schemes for Binary Distributed Hypothesis Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the design of practical shortlength coding schemes for Distributed Hypothesis Testing (DHT). While most prior work on DHT has focused on informationtheoretic analyses, deriving bounds on Type-II error exponents via achievability schemes based on quantization and quantizebinning, the practical implementation of DHT coding schemes has remained largely unexplored. Moreover, existing practical coding solutions for quantization and quantize-binning approaches were developed for source reconstruction tasks considering very long code length, and they are not directly applicable to DHT. In this context, this paper introduces efficient shortlength implementations of quantization and quantize-binning schemes for DHT, constructed from short binary linear block codes. Numerical results show the efficiency of the proposed coding schemes compared to uncoded cases and to existing schemes initially developed for data reconstruction. In addition to practical code design, the paper derives exact analytical expressions for the Type-I and Type-II error probabilities associated with each proposed scheme. The provided analytical expressions are shown to predict accurately the practical performance measured from Monte-Carlo simulations of the proposed schemes. These theoretical results are novel and offer a useful framework for optimizing and comparing practical DHT schemes across a wide range of source and code parameters.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning of Balanced Signed Graphs via Sparse Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signed graphs are equipped with both positive and negative edge weights, encoding pairwise correlations as well as anti-correlations in data. A balanced signed graph is a signed graph with no cycles containing an odd number of negative edges. Laplacian of a balanced signed graph has eigenvectors that map via a simple linear transform to ones in a corresponding positive graph Laplacian, thus enabling reuse of spectral filtering tools designed for positive graphs. We propose an efficient method to learn a balanced signed graph Laplacian directly from data. Specifically, extending a previous linear programming (LP) based sparse inverse covariance estimation method called CLIME, we formulate a new LP problem for each Laplacian column $i$, where the linear constraints restrict weight signs of edges stemming from node $i$, so that nodes of same / different polarities are connected by positive / negative edges. Towards optimal model selection, we derive a suitable CLIME parameter $\rho$ based on a combination of the Hannan-Quinn information criterion and a minimum feasibility criterion. We solve the LP problem efficiently by tailoring a sparse LP method based on ADMM. We theoretically prove local solution convergence of our proposed iterative algorithm. Extensive experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our balanced graph learning method outperforms competing methods and enables reuse of spectral filters, wavelets, and graph convolutional nets (GCN) constructed for positive graphs.</description>

      <title>EEG Foundation Models for BCI Learn Diverse Features of Electrophysiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain computer interface (BCI) research, as well as increasing portions of the field of neuroscience, have found success deploying large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) pre-training methods in conjunction with vast public repositories of data. This approach of pre-training foundation models using label-free, self-supervised objectives offers the potential to learn robust representations of neurophysiology, potentially addressing longstanding challenges in neural decoding. However, to date, much of this work has focused explicitly on standard BCI benchmarks and tasks, which likely overlooks the multitude of features these powerful methods might learn about brain function as well as other electrophysiological information. We introduce a new method for self-supervised BCI foundation model pre-training for EEG inspired by a transformer-based approach adapted from the HuBERT framework originally developed for speech processing. Our pipeline is specifically focused on low-profile, real-time usage, involving minimally pre-processed data and just eight EEG channels on the scalp. We show that our foundation model learned a representation of EEG that supports standard BCI tasks (P300, motor imagery), but also that this model learns features of neural data related to individual variability, and other salient electrophysiological components (e.g., alpha rhythms). In addition to describing and evaluating a novel approach to pre-training BCI models and neural decoding, this work opens the aperture for what kind of tasks and use-cases might exist for neural data in concert with powerful AI methods.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design with Partial Channel Estimation and Feedback for FDD RIS-Assisted Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beamforming design with partial channel estimation and feedback for frequency-division duplexing (FDD) reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted systems is considered in this paper. We leverage the observation that path angle information (PAI) varies more slowly than path gain information (PGI). Then, several dominant paths are selected among all the cascaded paths according to the known PAI for maximizing the spectral efficiency of downlink data transmission. To acquire the dominating path gain information (DPGI, also regarded as the path gains of selected dominant paths) at the base station (BS), we propose a DPGI estimation and feedback scheme by jointly beamforming design at BS and RIS. Both the required number of downlink pilot signals and the length of uplink feedback vector are reduced to the number of dominant paths, and thus we achieve a great reduction of the pilot overhead and feedback overhead. Furthermore, we optimize the active BS beamformer and passive RIS beamformer by exploiting the feedback DPGI to further improve the spectral efficiency. From numerical results, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithms over the conventional schemes.</description>

      <title>Application based Evaluation of an Efficient Spike-Encoder, "Spiketrum"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15927v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spike-based encoders represent information as sequences of spikes or pulses, which are transmitted between neurons. A prevailing consensus suggests that spike-based approaches demonstrate exceptional capabilities in capturing the temporal dynamics of neural activity and have the potential to provide energy-efficient solutions for low-power applications. The Spiketrum encoder efficiently compresses input data using spike trains or code sets (for non-spiking applications) and is adaptable to both hardware and software implementations, with lossless signal reconstruction capability. The paper proposes and assesses Spiketrum's hardware, evaluating its output under varying spike rates and its classification performance with popular spiking and non-spiking classifiers, and also assessing the quality of information compression and hardware resource utilization. The paper extensively benchmarks both Spiketrum hardware and its software counterpart against state-of-the-art, biologically-plausible encoders. The evaluations encompass benchmarking criteria, including classification accuracy, training speed, and sparsity when using encoder outputs in pattern recognition and classification with both spiking and non-spiking classifiers. Additionally, they consider encoded output entropy and hardware resource utilization and power consumption of the hardware version of the encoders. Results demonstrate Spiketrum's superiority in most benchmarking criteria, making it a promising choice for various applications. It efficiently utilizes hardware resources with low power consumption, achieving high classification accuracy. This work also emphasizes the potential of encoders in spike-based processing to improve the efficiency and performance of neural computing systems.</description>

      <title>Context-Enhanced CSI Tracking Using Koopman-Inspired Dual Autoencoders in Dynamic Wireless Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20123v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for tracking and predicting Channel State Information (CSI) by leveraging Physics-Informed Autoencoders (PIAE) integrated with a learned Koopman operator. The proposed approach models CSI as a nonlinear dynamical system governed by both intrinsic channel behavior and exogenous contextual factors such as position, temperature, and atmospheric conditions. The architecture comprises dual autoencoders-one dedicated to CSI and another to contextual inputs-linked via a shared latent state space, within which the Koopman operator captures the linear temporal evolution of CSI dynamics. This coupling enables accurate, data-driven forecasting of CSI trajectories while maintaining interpretability through a structured, physics-consistent representation. The framework supports real-time updates to the Channel Knowledge Map (CKM), enhancing the adaptability and reliability of communication systems in complex and time-varying environments. By unifying Koopman theory with learned latent representations, the proposed method provides a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for next-generation wireless networks. Empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness in delivering high-fidelity CSI predictions under diverse channel conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems are prone to privacy violations, once they aim at handling sensitive identifiable information in several applications. This paper raises the necessity of implementing privacy-preservation measures on the design of cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output ISAC systems. To that purpose, given an adversary model, we propose an iterative framework of two blocks, precoder design and access point selection. The precoder design aims at maximizing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at the sensing receivers given communication constraints. The access point selection aims at minimizing the mutual information between the received signal at users and the sensing signal, by rearranging the access points that transmit ISAC-signals and the sensing receivers. Results show that a reduction in the probability of detection by the adversary is obtained with this method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically inspired computational paradigm, enabling energy-efficient data processing through spike-based information transmission. Despite notable advancements in hardware for SNNs, spike encoding has largely remained software-dependent, limiting efficiency. This paper addresses the need for adaptable and resource-efficient spike encoding hardware by presenting an area-optimized hardware implementation of the Spiketrum algorithm, which encodes time-varying analogue signals into spatiotemporal spike patterns. Unlike earlier performance-optimized designs, which prioritize speed, our approach focuses on reducing hardware footprint, achieving a 52% reduction in Block RAMs (BRAMs), 31% fewer Digital Signal Processing (DSP) slices, and a 6% decrease in Look-Up Tables (LUTs). The proposed implementation has been verified on an FPGA and successfully integrated into an IC using TSMC180 technology. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in real-world applications, including sound and ECG classification. This work highlights the trade-offs between performance and resource efficiency, offering a flexible, scalable solution for neuromorphic systems in power-sensitive applications like cochlear implants and neural devices.</description>

      <title>Positioning-Aided Channel Estimation for Multi-LEO Satellite Cooperative Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05808v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a multi-low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite system that simultaneously provides positioning and communication services to terrestrial user terminals. To address the challenges of channel estimation in LEO satellite systems, we propose a novel two-timescale positioning-aided channel estimation framework, exploiting the distinct variation rates of position-related parameters and channel gains inherent in LEO satellite channels. Using the misspecified Cram\'er-Rao bound (MCRB) theory, we systematically analyze positioning performance under practical imperfections, such as inter-satellite clock bias and carrier frequency offset. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate how position information derived from downlink positioning can enhance uplink channel estimation accuracy, even in the presence of positioning errors, through an MCRB-based analysis. To overcome the constraints of limited link budgets and communication rates associated with single-satellite-based communication, we develop a multi-LEO satellite cooperative beamforming strategy for downlink communication, capitalizing on the benefit of cluster-wise satellites cooperation. Theoretical analyses and numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in achieving high-precision downlink positioning under practical imperfections, facilitating uplink channel estimation, and enabling efficient downlink communication.</description>

      <title>LLM4SG: Large Language Models for Scatterer Generation via Synesthesia of Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Guided by Synesthesia of Machines (SoM), the nonlinear mapping relationship between sensory and communication information serves as a powerful tool to enhance both the accuracy and generalization of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) multi-modal intelligent channel modeling (MMICM) in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). To explore the general mapping relationship between physical environment and electromagnetic space, a new intelligent sensing-communication integration dataset, named V2V-M3, is constructed for multiple scenarios in V2V communications with multiple frequency bands and multiple vehicular traffic densities (VTDs). Leveraging the strong representation and cross-modal inference capabilities of large language models (LLMs), a novel LLM-based method for Scatterer Generation (LLM4SG) from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds is developed. To address the inherent and significant differences across multi-modal data, synergistically optimized four-module architecture, i.e., preprocessor, embedding, backbone, and output modules, are designed by considering the sensing/channel characteristics and electromagnetic propagation mechanism. On the basis of cross-modal representation alignment and positional encoding, the network of LLM4SG is fine-tuned to capture the general mapping relationship between LiDAR point clouds and scatterers. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LLM4SG achieves superior performance in full-sample and generalization testing, significantly outperforming small models across different frequency bands, scenarios, and VTDs.</description>

      <title>NMCSE: Noise-Robust Multi-Modal Coupling Signal Estimation Method via Optimal Transport for Cardiovascular Disease Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals are linked by a latent coupling signal representing the electrical-to-mechanical cardiac transformation. While valuable for cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection, this coupling signal is traditionally estimated using deconvolution methods that amplify noise, limiting clinical utility. In this paper, we propose Noise-Robust Multi-Modal Coupling Signal Estimation (NMCSE), which reformulates the problem as distribution matching via optimal transport theory. By jointly optimizing amplitude and temporal alignment, NMCSE mitigates noise amplification without additional preprocessing. Integrated with our Temporal-Spatial Feature Extraction network, NMCSE enables robust multi-modal CVD detection. Experiments on the PhysioNet 2016 dataset with realistic hospital noise demonstrate that NMCSE reduces estimation errors by approximately 30% in Mean Squared Error while maintaining higher Pearson Correlation Coefficients across all tested signal-to-noise ratios. Our approach achieves 97.38% accuracy and 0.98 AUC in CVD detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating robust performance for real-world clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Sampling and Uniqueness Sets in Graphon Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the properties of sampling sets on families of large graphs by leveraging the theory of graphons and graph limits. To this end, we extend to graphon signals the notion of removable and uniqueness sets, which was developed originally for the analysis of signals on graphs. We state the formal definition of a $\Lambda-$removable set and conditions under which a bandlimited graphon signal can be represented in a unique way when its samples are obtained from the complement of a given $\Lambda-$removable set in the graphon. By leveraging such results we show that graphon representations of graphs and graph signals can be used as a common framework to compare sampling sets between graphs with different numbers of nodes and edges, and different node labelings. Additionally, given a sequence of graphs that converges to a graphon, we show that the sequences of sampling sets whose graphon representation is identical in $[0,1]$ are convergent as well. We exploit the convergence results to provide an algorithm that obtains approximately close to optimal sampling sets. Performing a set of numerical experiments, we evaluate the quality of these sampling sets. Our results open the door for the efficient computation of optimal sampling sets in graphs of large size.</description>

      <title>Aerial Relay to Achieve Covertness and Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, a delay-tolerant unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relayed covert and secure communication framework is investigated. In this framework, a legitimate UAV serves as an aerial relay to realize communication when the direct link between the terrestrial transmitter and receiver is blocked and also acts as a friendly jammer to suppress the malicious nodes presented on the ground. Subsequently, considering the uncertainty of malicious nodes' positions, a robust fractional programming optimization problem is built to maximize energy efficiency by jointly optimizing the trajectory of the UAV, the transmit power of the transmitter, and the time-switching factor. For the extremely complicated covert constraint, Pinsker's inequality, Jensen's inequality, and the bisection search method are employed to construct a tractable shrunken one. After this, an alternate optimization-based algorithm is proposed to solve the fractional programming optimization problem. To achieve low complexity, we design the primal-dual search-based algorithm and the successive convex approximation-based algorithm, respectively, for each sub-problem. Numerical results show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Pre-Training and Personalized Fine-Tuning via Over-the-Air Federated Meta-Learning: Convergence-Generalization Trade-Offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11569v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For modern artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as large language models (LLMs), the training paradigm has recently shifted to pre-training followed by fine-tuning. Furthermore, owing to dwindling open repositories of data and thanks to efforts to democratize access to AI models, pre-training is expected to increasingly migrate from the current centralized deployments to federated learning (FL) implementations. Meta-learning provides a general framework in which pre-training and fine-tuning can be formalized. Meta-learning-based personalized FL (meta-pFL) moves beyond basic personalization by targeting generalization to new agents and tasks. This paper studies the generalization performance of meta-pFL for a wireless setting in which the agents participating in the pre-training phase, i.e., meta-learning, are connected via a shared wireless channel to the server. Adopting over-the-air computing, we study the trade-off between generalization to new agents and tasks, on the one hand, and convergence, on the other hand. The trade-off arises from the fact that channel impairments may enhance generalization, while degrading convergence. Extensive numerical results validate the theory.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Filtering with RKHS Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a generalized theory of convolutional signal processing and neural networks for Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). Leveraging the theory of algebraic signal processing (ASP), we show that any RKHS allows the formal definition of multiple algebraic convolutional models. We show that any RKHS induces algebras whose elements determine convolutional operators acting on RKHS elements. This approach allows us to achieve scalable filtering and learning as a byproduct of the convolutional model, and simultaneously take advantage of the well-known benefits of processing information in an RKHS. To emphasize the generality and usefulness of our approach, we show how algebraic RKHS can be used to define convolutional signal models on groups, graphons, and traditional Euclidean signal spaces. Furthermore, using algebraic RKHS models, we build convolutional networks, formally defining the notion of pointwise nonlinearities and deriving explicit expressions for the training. Such derivations are obtained in terms of the algebraic representation of the RKHS. We present a set of numerical experiments on real data in which wireless coverage is predicted from measurements captured by unmaned aerial vehicles. This particular real-life scenario emphasizes the benefits of the convolutional RKHS models in neural networks compared to fully connected and standard convolutional operators.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Robotic Radio Source Localization via a Novel Gaussian Mixture Filtering Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a new Gaussian Mixture Filter (GMF) to improve the estimation performance for the autonomous robotic radio signal source search and localization problem in unknown environments. The proposed filter is first tested with a benchmark numerical problem to validate the performance with other state-of-the-practice approaches such as Particle Filter (PF) and Particle Gaussian Mixture (PGM) filters. Then the proposed approach is tested and compared against PF and PGM filters in real-world robotic field experiments to validate its impact for real-world applications. The considered real-world scenarios have partial observability with the range-only measurement and uncertainty with the measurement model. The results show that the proposed filter can handle this partial observability effectively whilst showing improved performance compared to PF, reducing the computation requirements while demonstrating improved robustness over compared techniques.</description>

      <title>TeleMoM: Consensus-Driven Telecom Intelligence via Mixture of Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in specialized domains like telecommunication (Telecom) due to technical complexity, specialized terminology, and rapidly evolving knowledge. Traditional methods, such as scaling model parameters or retraining on domain-specific corpora, are computationally expensive and yield diminishing returns, while existing approaches like retrieval-augmented generation, mixture of experts, and fine-tuning struggle with accuracy, efficiency, and coordination. To address this issue, we propose Telecom mixture of models (TeleMoM), a consensus-driven ensemble framework that integrates multiple LLMs for enhanced decision-making in Telecom. TeleMoM employs a two-stage process: proponent models generate justified responses, and an adjudicator finalizes decisions, supported by a quality-checking mechanism. This approach leverages strengths of diverse models to improve accuracy, reduce biases, and handle domain-specific complexities effectively. Evaluation results demonstrate that TeleMoM achieves a 9.7\% increase in answer accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness in Telecom applications.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Movable Antennas in Wideband Multi-User MIMO With Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Movable antennas represent an emerging field in telecommunication research and a potential approach to achieving higher data rates in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications when the total number of antennas is limited. Most solutions and analyses to date have been limited to \emph{narrowband} setups. This work complements the prior studies by quantifying the benefit of using movable antennas in \emph{wideband} MIMO communication systems. First, we derive a novel uplink wideband system model that also accounts for distortion from transceiver hardware impairments. We then formulate and solve an optimization task to maximize the average sum rate by adjusting the antenna positions using particle swarm optimization. Finally, the performance with movable antennas is compared with fixed uniform arrays and the derived theoretical upper bound. The numerical study concludes that the data rate improvement from movable antennas over other arrays heavily depends on the level of hardware impairments, the richness of the multi-path environments, and the number of subcarriers. The present study provides vital insights into the most suitable use cases for movable antennas in future wideband systems.</description>

      <title>Particle Gibbs without the Gibbs bit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04611v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exact parameter and trajectory inference in state-space models is typically achieved by one of two methods: particle marginal Metropolis-Hastings (PMMH) or particle Gibbs (PGibbs). PMMH is a pseudo-marginal algorithm which jointly proposes a new trajectory and parameter, and accepts or rejects both at once. PGibbs instead alternates between sampling from the trajectory, using an algorithm known as conditional sequential Monte Carlo (CSMC) and the parameter in a Hastings-within-Gibbs fashion. While particle independent Metropolis Hastings (PIMH), the parameter-free version of PMMH, is known to be statistically worse than CSMC, PGibbs can induce a slow mixing if the parameter and the state trajectory are very correlated. This has made PMMH the method of choice for many practitioners, despite theory and experiments favouring CSMC over PIMH for the parameter-free problem. In this article, we describe a formulation of PGibbs which bypasses the Gibbs step, essentially marginalizing over the trajectory distribution in a fashion similar to PMMH. This is achieved by considering the implementation of a CSMC algortihm for the state-space model integrated over the joint distribution of the current parameter and the parameter proposal. We illustrate the benefits of method on a simple example known to be challenging for PMMH.</description>

      <title>Polarforming Antenna Enhanced Sensing and Communication: Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel polarforming antenna (PA) to achieve cost-effective wireless sensing and communication. Specifically, the PA can enable polarforming to adaptively control the antenna's polarization electrically as well as tune its position/rotation mechanically, so as to effectively exploit polarization and spatial diversity to reconfigure wireless channels for improving sensing and communication performance. We study an PA-enhanced integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system that utilizes user location sensing to facilitate communication between an PA-equipped base station (BS) and PA-equipped users. First, we model the PA channel in terms of transceiver antenna polarforming vectors and antenna positions/rotations. We then propose a two-timescale ISAC protocol, where in the slow timescale, user localization is first performed, followed by the optimization of the BS antennas' positions and rotations based on the sensed user locations; subsequently, in the fast timescale, transceiver polarforming is adapted to cater to the instantaneous channel state information (CSI), with the optimized BS antennas' positions and rotations. We propose a new polarforming-based user localization method that uses a structured time-domain pattern of pilot-polarforming vectors to extract the common stable components in the PA channel across different polarizations based on the parallel factor (PARAFAC) tensor model. Moreover, we maximize the achievable average sum-rate of users by jointly optimizing the fast-timescale transceiver polarforming, including phase shifts and amplitude variations, along with the slow-timescale antenna rotations and positions at the BS. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of polarforming-based localization algorithm and demonstrate the performance advantages of polarforming, antenna placement, and their joint design.</description>

      <title>ALPCAHUS: Subspace Clustering for Heteroscedastic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a key tool in the field of data dimensionality reduction. Various methods have been proposed to extend PCA to the union of subspace (UoS) setting for clustering data that come from multiple subspaces like K-Subspaces (KSS). However, some applications involve heterogeneous data that vary in quality due to noise characteristics associated with each data sample. Heteroscedastic methods aim to deal with such mixed data quality. This paper develops a heteroscedastic-focused subspace clustering method, named ALPCAHUS, that can estimate the sample-wise noise variances and use this information to improve the estimate of the subspace bases associated with the low-rank structure of the data. This clustering algorithm builds on K-Subspaces (KSS) principles by extending the recently proposed heteroscedastic PCA method, named LR-ALPCAH, for clusters with heteroscedastic noise in the UoS setting. Simulations and real-data experiments show the effectiveness of accounting for data heteroscedasticity compared to existing clustering algorithms.

      <description>arXiv:2505.20760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polarforming emerges as a promising technique for manipulating the polarization of electromagnetic (EM) waves by shaping the polarization of an antenna into a desired state. By dynamically adjusting antenna polarization, polarforming enables real-time polarization matching or mismatching with received EM waves, thereby leveraging polarization degrees of freedom (DoFs) to enhance wireless communication performance. In this article, we first present an overview of the fundamental principles and design approaches underlying the polarforming technique. We then analyze the key advantages of polarforming, including hardware cost reduction, depolarization mitigation, channel adaptation, signal power enhancement, and interference suppression. Furthermore, we explore promising applications of polarforming for next-generation wireless networks. Numerical case studies demonstrate the substantial performance gains of polarforming over conventional fixed-polarization antenna (FPA) systems, along with a discussion of implementation challenges to motivate future research.</description>

      <title>Fast Compressed-Domain N-Point Discrete Fourier Transform: The "Twiddless" FFT Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present the \emph{twiddless fast Fourier transform (TFFT)}, a novel algorithm for computing the $N$-point discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The TFFT's divide strategy builds on recent results that decimate an $N$-point signal (by a factor of $p$) into an $N/p$-point compressed signal whose DFT readily yields $N/p$ coefficients of the original signal. However, existing compression-domain DFT analyses have been limited to computing only the even-indexed DFT coefficients. With TFFT, we overcome this limitation by efficiently computing both \emph{even- and odd-indexed} DFT coefficients in the compressed domain with $O(N \log N)$ complexity. TFFT introduces a new recursive decomposition of the DFT problem, wherein $N/2^i$ coefficients of the original input are computed at recursion level $i$, with no need for twiddle factor multiplications or butterfly structures. Additionally, TFFT generalizes the input length to $N = c \cdot 2^k$ (for $k \geq 0$ and non-power-of-two $c &gt; 0$), reducing the need for zero-padding and potentially improving efficiency and stability over classical FFTs. We believe TFFT represents a \emph{novel paradigm} for DFT computation, opening new directions for research in optimized implementations, hardware design, parallel computation, and sparse transforms.</description>
