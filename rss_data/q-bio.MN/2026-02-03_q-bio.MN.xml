      <title>RAG-GNN: Integrating Retrieved Knowledge with Graph Neural Networks for Precision Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network topology excels at structural predictions but fails to capture functional semantics encoded in biomedical literature. We present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) embedding framework that integrates graph neural network representations with dynamically retrieved literature-derived knowledge through contrastive learning. Benchmarking against ten embedding methods reveals task-specific complementarity: topology-focused methods achieve near-perfect link prediction (GCN: 0.983 AUROC), while RAG-GNN is the only method achieving positive silhouette scores for functional clustering (0.001 vs. negative scores for all baselines). Information-theoretic decomposition shows network topology contributes 77.3% of predictive information, while retrieved documents provide 8.6% unique information. Applied to cancer signaling networks (379 proteins, 3,498 interactions), the framework identifies DDR1 as a therapeutic target based on retrieved evidence of synthetic lethality with KRAS mutations. These results establish that topology-only and retrieval-augmented approaches serve complementary purposes: structural prediction tasks are solved by network topology alone, while functional interpretation uniquely benefits from retrieved knowledge.</description>

      <title>Recurrent neural chemical reaction networks trained to switch dynamical behaviours through learned bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both natural and synthetic chemical systems not only exhibit a range of non-trivial dynamics, but also transition between qualitatively different dynamical behaviours as environmental parameters change. Such transitions are called bifurcations. Here, we show that recurrent neural chemical reaction networks (RNCRNs), a class of chemical reaction networks based on recurrent artificial neural networks that can be trained to reproduce a given dynamical behaviour, can also be trained to exhibit bifurcations. First, we show that RNCRNs can inherit some bifurcations defined by smooth ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Second, we demonstrate that the RNCRN can be trained to infer bifurcations that allow it to approximate different target behaviours within different regions of parameter space, without explicitly providing the bifurcation itself in the training. These behaviours can be specified using target ODEs that are discontinuous with respect to the parameters, or even simply by specifying certain desired dynamical features in certain regions of the parameter space. To achieve the latter, we introduce an ODE-free algorithm for training the RNCRN to display designer oscillations, such as a heart-shaped limit cycle or two coexisting limit cycles.</description>

      <title>Determining the Equivalence of Small Zero-one Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-one reaction networks are pivotal to cellular signaling, and establishing the equivalence of such networks represents a foundational computational challenge in the realm of chemical reaction network research. Herein, we propose a high-efficiency approach for identifying the equivalence of zero-one networks. Its efficiency stems from a set of criteria tailored to judge the equivalence of steady-state ideals derived from zero-one networks, which effectively reduces the computational cost associated with Gr\"obner basis calculations. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can successfully categorize more than three million networks by their equivalence within a feasible timeframe. Also, our computational results for two important classes of quadratic zero-one networks (3-dimensional with 3 species, 6 reactions; 4-dimensional with 4 species, 5 reactions) show that they have no positive steady states for a generic choice of rate constants, implying these small networks generically exhibit neither multistability nor periodic orbits.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Space of Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living systems operate out of equilibrium, continuously consuming energy to sustain organised, functional states. Their emergent behaviour usually relies on a set of interconnected chemical reaction networks (CRNs) driven by external fluxes that keep some species at fixed concentrations. Hence, uncovering the principles governing the functioning of these CRNs is crucial to understand how living systems generate and regulate complexity. While kinetics plays a key role in shaping detailed dynamical phenomena, the range of operations of a CRN is fundamentally constrained by thermodynamics. Here, we introduce and analytically derive the "thermodynamic space" of a CRN, i.e., the range of accessible stationary concentrations that can be realized under a given energetic budget. We establish analogous bounds for reaction affinities, shedding light on how global thermodynamic properties, such as the total non-equilibrium driving, can limit local non-equilibrium quantities. We illustrate our results in various paradigmatic examples, demonstrating how the onset of complex behaviors is intimately tangled with the presence of non-equilibrium conditions. By providing a general tool for analysing CRNs, the presented framework constitutes a stepping stone to deepen our ability to predict complex out-of-equilibrium phenomena and design artificial chemical systems, starting from the sole knowledge of the underlying thermodynamic properties.</description>
