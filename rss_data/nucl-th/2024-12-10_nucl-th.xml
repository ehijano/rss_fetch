      <title>Signatures of Jet Drift in QGP Hard Probe Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hard probe tomography of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy ion collisions has long been a preeminent goal of the high-energy nuclear physics program. In service of this goal, the isotropic modification of jets and high-energy hadrons has been studied in great detail at the leading-power (eikonal) level, with effects originating from sub-eikonal $\mathcal{O}(\mu/E)$ anisotropic interactions presumed to be small. We present the first investigation of sub-eikonal, collective-flow-induced asymmetric jet broadening (jet drift) in event-by-event $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV PbPb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider using the new Anisotropic Parton Evolution (APE) computational framework. We show that jet drift imparts a sizeable enhancement of elliptic flow ($v_2$) and increases the mean acoplanarity for low and intermediate energy particles ($p_T &lt; 10$ GeV). Importantly, these novel modifications to hard probe observables are shown to survive averaging over events and collision geometry. They couple to the collective flow of the medium seen by the jet and encode information about the QGP dynamics inaccessible to studies considering only isotropic, eikonal level effects.</description>

      <title>Spin polarization of an expanding and rotating system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the longitudinal spin polarization of a relativistic fluid of massive spin-1/2 particles undergoing a boost-invariant expansion in the longitudinal direction and rotating in the transverse plane. We express the polarization vector in terms of spin moments and derive closed equations of motion for the latter using spin kinetic theory with a nonlocal relaxation time approximation. These equations of motion are valid at any time of the evolution, from the free-streaming regime to the hydrodynamic regime. At late time, the polarization features contributions from gradients of the fluid velocity and of the temperature, that emerge from the nonlocal part of the collision term. Our results can be used to explore polarization phenomena in the context of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Large-scale shell-model study of 2$\nu$ECEC process in $^{78}$Kr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the systematic study of $2\nu$ECEC process in the $^{78}$Kr using large-scale shell-model calculations with the GWBXG effective interaction. We first validate the efficiency of the utilized interaction by comparing the theoretical low-lying energy spectra, the kinematic moment of inertia, and reduced transition probabilities with the experimental data for both the parent and grand-daughter nuclei $^{78}$Kr and $^{78}$Se, respectively. Additionally, we examine the shell-model level densities of the $1^+$ states in the intermediate nucleus $^{78}$Br, comparing them with the predictions from the Back-shifted Fermi gas model. We analyze the variation of cumulative nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) for the $2\nu$ECEC process in $^{78}$Kr as a function of $1^+$ state energies in the intermediate nucleus $^{78}$Br up to the saturation level. Our estimated half-life for $^{78}$Kr, extracted from the shell-model predicted NMEs, shows good agreement with the experimental value. The Gamow-Teller transitions from the lowest $1^+$ state of $^{78}$Br via both the EC$+\beta^+$ and $\beta^-$-channels are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Implications of latest NICER data for the neutron star equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an update to our previously performed Bayesian inference analyses of the neutron star matter equation-of-state and related quantities, the additional impact of the recently published NICER data of PSR J0437-4751 is examined. Including the mass and radius distributions of this pulsar in our data base results in modest shifts from previously inferred median posterior values of radii $R$ and central densities $n_c$ for representative $1.4\,M_\odot$ and $2.1\,M_\odot$ neutron stars: radii are reduced by about $0.2-0.3$ km to values of $R_{1.4} = 12.1\pm 0.5$ km and $R_{2.1} = 11.9^{+0.5}_{-0.6}$ km (at the 68\% level); central densities increase slightly to values of $n_c(1.4\,M_\odot)/n_0 = 2.8\pm 0.3$ and $n_c(2.1\,M_\odot)/n_0 = 3.8_{-0.7}^{+0.6}$ (in units of equilibrium nuclear matter density, $n_0 = 0.16$ fm$^{-3}$), i.e., they still fall below five times nuclear saturation density at the 68\% level. As a further significant result, the evidence established by analyzing Bayes factors for a negative trace anomaly measure, $\Delta = 1/3-P/\varepsilon &lt; 0$, inside heavy neutron stars is raised to strong.</description>

      <title>Identifying weak critical fluctuations of intermittency in heavy-ion collisions with topological machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large density fluctuations of conserved charges have been proposed as a promising signature for exploring the QCD critical point in heavy-ion collisions. These fluctuations are expected to exhibit a fractal or scale-invariant behavior, which can be probed by intermittency analysis. Recent high-energy experimental studies reveal that the signal of critical fluctuations related to intermittency is very weak and thus could be easily obscured by the overwhelming background particles in the data sample. Employing a point cloud neural network with topological machine learning, we can successfully classify weak signal events from background noise by the extracted distinct topological features, and accurately determine the intermittency index for weak signal event samples.</description>

      <title>Estimating theoretical uncertainties of the two-nucleon observables by using backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to calculate theoretical uncertainties in few-nucleon calculations that makes use of automatic differentiation. We demonstrate this method in deuteron bound state and nucleon - nucleon scattering calculations. Backpropagation, implemented in the Python pytorch library, is used to calculate the gradients with respect to model parameters and propagate errors from these parameters to the deuteron binding energy and selected phase-shift parameters. The uncertainty values obtained using this approach are validated by directly sampling from the potential parameters. We find very good agreement between two ways of estimating that uncertainty.</description>

      <title>$q_T$-slicing with multiple jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern collider phenomenology requires unprecedented precision for the theoretical predictions, for which slicing techniques provide an essential tool at next-to-next-to-leading order in the strong coupling. The most popular slicing variable is based on the transverse momentum $q_T$ of a color-singlet final state, but its generalization to final states with jets is known to be very difficult. Here we propose two generalizations of $q_T$ that can be used for jet processes, providing proof of concept with an NLO slicing for $pp \to 2$ jets and presenting factorization formulae that pave the way for extending our approach to NNLO. One of these extensions only applies to planar Born processes, such as $pp \to 2$ jets, but offers a dramatic simplification of the soft function. We also discuss how our approach can directly be extended to obtain predictions for the fragmentation of hadrons. This presents a promising path for high-precision QCD calculations with multi-jet final states.</description>

      <title>Superfluid fraction in the polycrystalline crust of a neutron star: role of BCS pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The breaking of translational symmetry in the inner crust of a neutron star leads to the depletion of the neutron superfluid reservoir similarly to cold atomic condensates in optical lattices and in supersolids. The suppression of the superfluid fraction is studied in the BCS theory for superfluid velocities much smaller than Landau's critical velocity treating the crust as a body-centered cubic polycrystal. To this end, fully three-dimensional band structure calculations have been carried out. Although the formation of Cooper pairs is essential for the occurrence of superfluidity, the superfluid fraction is found to be insensitive to the pairing gap. In the intermediate region of the inner crust at the average baryon number density 0.03~fm$^{-3}$, only 8\% of the free neutrons are found to participate to the superflow. This very low superfluid fraction challenges the classical interpretation of pulsar frequency glitches.</description>

      <title>On the quarkonium-in-jet collinear fragmentation at moderate-to-large transverse momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report progress on the Heavy-Flavor Non-Relativistic Evolution (HF-NRevo) setup, a novel methodology to address quarkonium formation within the fragmentation approximation. Our study sheds light on the moderate to large transverse-momentum sector, where the leading-twist collinear fragmentation of a single parton prevails over the higher-twist fragmentation from a constituent heavy-quark pair produced in the hard scattering. As for the initial energy-scale inputs, we rely on nonrelativistic next-to-leading calculations for all the parton-to-quarkonia fragmentation channels. Preliminary sets of variable-flavor number-scheme (VFNS) fragmentation functions, named NRFF1.0, are built via an evolution-threshold enhanced DGLAP scheme. Taking NRFF1.0 as a starting point, we use HF-NRevo to address the collinear fragmentation of quarkonia inside jets.</description>

      <title>Effective theory for strongly attractive one-dimensional fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional system of two-component fermions in the limit of strong attractive particle-particle interactions. First, we analyze scattering in the corresponding few-body problem, which is analytically solvable via Bethe ansatz. This allows us to engineer effective interactions between the system's effective degrees of freedom: fermions and bosonic dimers (tightly bound pairs of fermions). We argue that, although these interactions are strong, the resulting effective problem can be mapped onto a weakly interacting one, paving the way for the use of perturbation theory. This finding simplifies studies of many-fermion systems under confinement that are beyond reach of state-of-the-art numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Testing for isospin symmetry breaking with extensive calculations of isotope shift factors in potassium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise evaluation of the isotope shift (IS) factors for seven low-lying potassium (K) states is achieved using relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory. The energies of these states are assessed and compared with experimental data to confirm the accuracy of the wave functions calculated at varying RCC theory approximations and highlight the significance of many-body and relativistic effects in determining the energies and IS factors of K. Various methods are used to compute the IS factors, with the finite-field (FF) approach yielding results that align with observed and semi-empirical data. This consistency is attributed to orbital relaxation effects that are naturally present in the FF method but emerge only through complex interactions in other techniques. Using the IS factors derived from FF, we review the mean square radius difference between $^{38m}$K and $^{39}$K. From this difference and muonic atom x-ray spectroscopy, we deduce the absolute radius of $^{38m}$K using an updated calculation of the nuclear polarizability effect. Finally, we evaluate the isospin symmetry breaking (ISB) in this isotriplet by integrating the radius of $^{38m}$K with an updated radius of $^{38}$Ca, concluding that the ISB is compatible with zero. This finding offers a stringent benchmark for nuclear model calculations of ISB corrections in nuclear beta decay, which play a key role in determining the $V_{ud}$ matrix element.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the derivation of second-order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics to incorporate the effects of baryon current, a non-vanishing chemical potential, and a realistic equation of state. Starting from a microscopic quantum theory, we employ a quasiparticle approximation to describe the evolution of hydrodynamic degrees of freedom and establish its connection to the Wigner formalism. Using methods from relativistic kinetic theory, we perform a second-order expansion to derive a closed set of equations for the components of the stress-energy tensor and the baryon current. The resulting transport coefficients, which depend on the equation of state, are obtained through a unified prescription that ensures thermodynamic consistency.</description>

      <title>Mapping spatial distributions within pseudoscalar mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several aspects of the internal structure of pseudoscalar mesons, accessible through generalized parton distributions in their zero-skewness limit, are examined. These include electromagnetic and gravitational form factors related to charge and mass densities; and distributions in the impact parameter space. To this end, we employ an algebraically viable framework that is based upon the valence-quark generalized parton distribution expressed explicitly in terms of the associated distribution function and a profile function that governs the off-forward dynamics. The predominantly analytical nature of this scheme yields several algebraic results and relations while also facilitating the exploration of insightful limiting cases. With a suitable input distribution function, guided either by experiment or theory, and with an appropriate choice of the profile function, it is possible to provide testable predictions for spatial distributions of valence quarks inside pseudoscalar mesons. When comparison is possible, these predictions align well with existing experimental data as well as the findings of reliable theoretical approaches and lattice QCD.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate $f-$mode oscillations ($\ell$ = 2) in quarkyonic neutron stars with dark matter, employing the Cowling approximation within the framework of linearized general relativity. The relativistic mean-field approach is used to compute various macroscopic properties of neutron stars. The analysis focuses on three key free parameters in the model: transition density, QCD confinement scale, and dark matter (DM) Fermi momentum, all of which significantly affect the properties of $f-$mode oscillations. The inclusion of dark matter in quarkyonic equations of state leads to notable variations in $f-$mode frequencies. Despite these changes, several universal relations among the oscillation properties are found to hold, demonstrating their robustness in the presence of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Chiral QCD phase in equilibrium with Hadron Gas and the location of the critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07006</link>
      <description>arXiv:1812.07006v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a description of the equation of state of QCD matter with restored chiral symmetry, which is in thermal and chemical equilibrium with the hadronic phase. The hadron gas is described with thermodynamically consistent volume corrections. The chiral phase is composed of a set of few quark condensates, each of which corresponds to a family of hadrons with specific quark content. On the boundary between the two phases we apply the requirement of conservation of particle numbers per family. We use lattice calculations for temperatures below the transition curve to determine hadronic volumes. We find that the pion system plays decisive role in the shift of the transition from higher order (crossover) to first order. For four volume models we calculate the location of the critical point as function of critical temperature $T_c$ at vanishing baryon density. Particularly, if we additionally impose the equality between the densities of quarks contained in mesons and baryons, we find a critical point residing in the interval of baryon chemical potential $\mu_B \simeq$ 233-267 MeV and of temperature $T \simeq$ 153-158 MeV.</description>

      <title>Dynamical induced quark spin polarization by magnetic field at the early stage of heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic process of quark spin polarization induced by magnetic fields at the pre-thermal stage in heavy-ion collisions by using the recently developed theoretical tool of chiral kinetic theory. Our findings demonstrate that the spin polarization of quarks is highly sensitive to the interactions between quarks. These interactions can delay the decay of early spin polarization vector while accelerating the decay of later spin polarization vector. Specifically, our simulations show the detailed process of how magnetic fields polarize quarks within the fireball and reveal that quark interactions lead to an acceleration effect on the average spin. Notably, the fireball of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in its early stages exhibits an incomplete electromagnetic response effect, which differs from the response predicted by Lenz's law. This discrepancy arises from quantum corrections involving the interactions between quark spin and electromagnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Role of Quantum Entanglement in Heavy Ion Collisions through Elliptic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between initial spatial anisotropy and final state momentum anisotropy in heavy ion collisions through the analysis of elliptic flow ($v_2$) as a function of transverse momentum ($p_T$). Building upon previous studies on thermalization in heavy ion collisions using transverse momentum distributions, we extend the analysis to the $p_T$ dependence of $v_2$ in Pb-Pb and Xe-Xe collisions. By employing a two-component model to extract the thermal and hard scattering contributions to the elliptic flow, we aim to gain further insights into the role of quantum entanglement in the rapid thermalization and collective behavior of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).</description>

      <title>Strong-field magnetohydrodynamics for neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a formulation of magnetohydrodynamics which can be used to describe the evolution of strong magnetic fields in neutron star interiors. Our approach is based on viewing magnetohydrodynamics as a theory with a one-form global symmetry and developing an effective field theory for the hydrodynamic modes associated with this symmetry. In the regime where the local velocity and temperature variations can be neglected, we derive the most general constitutive relation consistent with symmetry constraints for the electric field in the presence of a strong magnetic field. This constitutive relation not only reproduces the phenomena of Ohmic decay, ambipolar diffusion, and Hall drift derived in a phenomenological model by Goldreich and Reisenegger, but also reveals new terms in the evolution of the magnetic field which cannot easily be seen from such microscopic models. This formulation gives predictions for novel diffusion behaviors of small perturbations around a constant background magnetic field, and for the two-point correlation functions among various components of the electric and magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Excitation by Near-Resonant Electron Transition in $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06815v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical considerations are made for the nuclear excitation from the ground state to the 8 eV $^{229m}$Th isomer via near-resonant electron transitions in Sb-like ($q=39+$) thorium ions. The energy of the first excited atomic state ($J=7/2$) in the $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ ion is estimated to be 8.308$\pm$0.011 eV, which is very close to the new reference value for the $^{229m}$Th nuclear isomer energy, 8.356 eV [Zhang et al., Nature 633, 63 (2024)]. Therefore, the $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ ion provides a unique opportunity to study the nuclear excitation by electron transition process under well-defined atomic conditions in the regime of extremely low nuclear excitation energy. Our results indicate that the upper theoretical limit for the $^{229m}$Th isomer excitation rate reaches an enormous value of $1.27\times10^{16}$ s$^{-1}$ at resonance ($\Delta=0$ meV), but drops many orders of magnitude for the value of electronic transition energy within its uncertainty interval. Additionally, it was shown that using an electron beam ion trap, the production of the $^{229}$Th isomer can reach rates ranging from a few to approximately $7\times10^{19}$ $^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Search for baryon junctions in e+A collisions at the Electron Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constituent quarks in a nucleon are the essential elements in the standard ``quark model" associated with the electric charge, spin, mass, and baryon number of a nucleon. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) describes nucleon as a composite object containing current quarks (valence quarks and sea (anti-)quarks) and gluons. These subatomic elements and their interactions are known to contribute in complex ways to the overall nucleon spin and mass. In the early development of QCD theory in the 1970s, an alternative hypothesis postulated that the baryon number might manifest itself through a non-perturbative configuration of gluon fields forming a Y-shaped topology known as the gluon junction. In this work, we propose to test such hypothesis by measuring (i) the Regge intercept of the net-baryon distributions for $e$+($p$)Au collisions, (ii) baryon and charge transport in the isobaric ratio between $e$+Ru and $e$+Zr collisions, and (iii) target flavor dependence of proton and antiproton yields at large rapidity, transported from the hydrogen and deuterium targets in $e+p$(d) collisions. Our study indicates that these measurements at the EIC can help determine what carries the baryon number.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal Anisotropy Scaling Functions for Identified Particle and Anti-Particle Species across Beam Energies: Insights into Baryon Junction Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the beam energy dependence of azimuthal anisotropy scaling functions for mesons and baryons in Pb+Pb and Au+Au collisions across \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7\) GeV to 5.02 TeV. Species-dependent \(v_2(p_T, \text{cent})\) measurements are used to derive scaling functions that unify anisotropy data across particle species, revealing the interplay between radial flow, hadronic re-scattering, and baryon junction effects. Results show that baryon junctions significantly enhance baryon \(v_n\) at low \(\sqrt{s_{NN}}\), where the baryon chemical potential (\(\mu_B\)) is high, driving a pronounced baryon--anti-baryon anisotropy difference. This difference diminishes with increasing \(\sqrt{s_{NN}}\), reflecting the reduced influence of baryon junctions at higher energies. The non-monotonic behavior of the specific shear viscosity (\(\eta/s\)) and radial flow parameters for anti-baryons suggests a transition in expansion dynamics near \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 39\) GeV, potentially linked to the QCD critical point. These findings provide new constraints on baryon transport mechanisms, baryon junction contributions, and the equation of state (EOS) and transport coefficients for baryon-rich matter.</description>

      <title>Second-order hyperfine correction to H, D, and $^3$He energy levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complete second-order hyperfine-interaction correction is calculated for centroid energy levels of H, D, and $^3$He atoms. For $^3$He, the corrections of $-2.075$~kHz and $-0.305$~kHz beyond the leading hyperfine-mixing contribution are obtained for the $2^1S$ and $2^3S$ states, respectively. These results shift the nuclear charge radii difference derived from the $^3$He -$^4$He isotope shift and largely resolve the previously reported disagreement between the muonic and electronic helium determinations [van der Werf et al., arXiv:2306.02333 (2023); Schuhmann et al., arXiv:2305.11679 (2023)].</description>

      <title>Lattice gradient flows (de-)stabilizing topological sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of topological charge under gradient flow taking the admissibility condition into account. For the $SU(2)$ Wilson gauge theory with $\beta=2.45$ and $L^4=12^4$, we numerically show that the gradient flows with the Iwasaki and DBW2 gauge actions stabilize the topological sectors significantly, and they have qualitatively different behaviors compared with the Wilson and tree-level Symanzik flows. By considering the classical continuum limit of the flow actions, we discuss that the coefficient of dimension-$6$ operators has to be positive for stabilizing the one-instanton configuration, and the Iwasaki and DBW2 actions satisfy this criterion while the Wilson and Symanzik actions do not. Moreover, we observe that the DBW2 flow stabilizes the topological sectors at the very early stage of the flow ($\hat{t}\approx 0.5$--$1$), which suggests that the use of the DBW2 action for the gradient flow is computationally efficient to determine the gauge topology.</description>
