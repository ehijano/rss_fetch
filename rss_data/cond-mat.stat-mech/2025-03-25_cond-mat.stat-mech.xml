      <title>Lanczos-Pascal approach to correlation functions in chaotic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equilibration is a ubiquitous phenomenon in chaotic quantum systems. Given the variety and multitude of condensed matter-type chaotic quantum systems, it may be considered as surprising how simple dynamics often are on the level of few body observables. In the context of this paper simple implies "in good agreement with a superpostion of only a few exponentially damped oscillations". We follow the (possibly somewhat odd) idea that it may be precisely the complexity of chaotic systems that entails the simpleness of their dynamics. We do so employing the framework of the recently resurged recursion method comprising Lanczos coefficients to generate the dynamics. We find that the structure of the Lanczos coefficients that enables simpleness is in accord with the operator growth hypothesis. We present a method to explicitly construct approximations to the dynamics from the Lanczos coefficients. These approximations result as simple for various chaotic spin systems. While the consideration applies to systems in the thermodynamic limit, we compare our approximations to state-of-the-art numerics for large but finite quantum systems and obtain good agreement.</description>

      <title>Matrix approach to generalized ensemble theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a concise framework for generalized ensemble theory through a matrix-based approach. By introducing an observation matrix, any discrete probability distribution, including those for non-equilibrium steady states, can be expressed as a generalized Boltzmann distribution, with observables and conjugate variables as the basis and coordinates in a linear space. In this framework, we identify the minimal sufficient statistics required for inferring the Boltzmann distribution. Furthermore, we show that the Hadamard and Vandermonde matrices are suitable observation matrices for spin systems and random walks. In master equation systems, the probability flux observation matrix facilitates the identification of detailed balance violations. Our findings provide a new approach to developing generalized ensemble theory for non-equilibrium steady-state systems.</description>

      <title>Identifying Ising and percolation phase transitions based on KAN method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern machine learning, grounded in the Universal Approximation Theorem, has achieved significant success in the study of phase transitions in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems. However, identifying the critical points of percolation models using raw configurations remains a challenging and intriguing problem. This paper proposes the use of the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network, which is based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem, to input raw configurations into a learning model. The results demonstrate that the KAN can indeed predict the critical points of percolation models. Further observation reveals that, apart from models associated with the density of occupied points, KAN is also capable of effectively achieving phase classification for models where the sole alteration pertains to the orientation of spins, resulting in an order parameter that manifests as an external magnetic flux, such as the Ising model.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory instability in an Ostwald ripening process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers an Ostwald ripening process in which new droplets are injected at a constant rate, with a fixed distribution of radii, and in which droplets are removed when they grow to a specified maximum radius. This process exhibits a transition from a steady state to a limit cycle as a parameter is varied. The instability is shown to be related to the roots of the Laplace transform of a response kernel. A model is described which gives a good approximation of the period of the limit cycle. The model may also exhibit chaotic behaviour. The relevance of the model to atmospheric precipitation is discussed.</description>

      <title>Generic power laws in higher-dimensional lattice models with multidirectional hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that lattice models in $d&gt;1$ dimensions with mass-conserving and multidirectional hopping dynamics exhibit power-law correlations for generic parameter values, even {\it far} from phase transition point (if any). The key idea for generating the algebraic decay is the notion of {\it multidirectional} hopping, which means that several chunks of masses, or several particles, can hop out simultaneously from a lattice site in multiple directions, consequently breaking detailed balance. Notably, the systems are described by continuous-time Markov jump processes, are diffusive, {\it lattice-rotation symmetric}, spatially homogeneous and thus have {\it no} net mass current. Using hydrodynamic and exact microscopic theory, we show that, in dimensions $d &gt; 1$, the steady-state static density-density and ``activity''-density correlations in the thermodynamic limit decay {\it universally} as $\sim 1/r^{(d+2)}$ at large distance $r=|{\bf r}|$; the strength of the power law is exactly calculated for several models and expressed in terms of the bulk-diffusion coefficient and mobility tensor. In particular, our theory explains why center-of-mass-conserving dynamics, used to model disordered {\it hyperuniform} state of matter, should result in generic long-ranged correlations in the systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main mechanisms and conditions of interaction of lava-like fuel-containing materials (LFCM) with the atmosphere, water and aqueous solutions are presented. The mechanisms of destruction of the LFCM surface, including ion-exchange processes, hydrolysis, dissolution, oxidation, etc., were analyzed. Inhomogeneous diffusion coefficients for UO$_{2}^{2+}$, Cs$^{+}$ ions at the interface "aqueous solution of radioactive elements - LFCM" were calculated. The interdiffusion processes and the rate of penetration into the porous medium of the reaction front of the internal hydrolysis of the silicon-oxygen network during interaction with an aqueous solution were analyzed, where the reaction and adsorption processes are hidden in the rate of internal hydrolysis.</description>

      <title>Linear statistics at the microscopic scale for the 2D Coulomb gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the classical Coulomb gas in two dimensions at the inverse temperature $\beta=2$, confined within a droplet of radius $R$ by a rotationally invariant potential $U(r)$. For $U(r)\sim r^2$ this describes the eigenvalues of the complex Ginibre ensemble of random matrices. We study linear statistics of the form ${\cal L}_N = \sum_{i=1}^N f(|{\bf x}_i|)$, where ${\bf x}_i$'s are the positions of the $N$ particles, in the large $N$ limit with $R=O(1)$. It is known that for smooth functions $f(r)$ the variance ${\rm Var} \,{\cal L}_N= O(1)$, while for an indicator function relevant for the disk counting statistics, all cumulants of ${\cal L}_N$ of order $q \geq 2$ behave as $\sim \sqrt{N}$. In addition, for smooth functions, it was shown that the cumulants of ${\cal L}_N$ of order $q \geq 3$ scale as $\sim N^{2-q}$. Surprisingly it was found that they depend only on $f'(|\bf x|)$ and its derivatives evaluated exactly at the boundary of the droplet. To understand this property, and interpolate between the two behaviors (smooth versus step-like), we study the microscopic linear statistics given by $f(r) \to f_N(r) = \phi((r-\hat r) \sqrt{N}/\xi)$, which probes the fluctuations at the scale of the inter-particle distance. We compute the cumulants of ${\cal L}_N$ at large $N$ for a fixed $\phi(u)$ at arbitrary $\xi$. For large $\xi$ they match the predictions for smooth functions which shows that the leading contribution in that case comes from a boundary layer of size $1/\sqrt{N}$ near the boundary of the droplet. Finally we show that the full probability distribution of ${\cal L}_N$ take two distinct large deviation forms, in the regime ${\cal L}_N \sim \sqrt{N}$ and ${\cal L}_N \sim N$ respectively. We also discuss applications of our results to fermions in a rotating harmonic trap and to the Ginibre symplectic ensemble.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of density fluctuations in the boundary driven Quantum Symmetric Simple Inclusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the boundary driven Quantum Symmetric Simple Inclusion Process (QSSIP) which describes a one-dimensional system of bosonic particles with stochastic nearest-neighbor hopping, modeled as a Brownian motion, with gain/loss processes at the endpoints of the chain driving the system out-of-equilibrium. Although the averaged QSSIP dynamics differs from that of the Quantum Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process (QSSEP) - the analogous system where bosons are replaced by fermions - we show that, paradoxically, the dynamics of their matrices of two-point functions, along with all their fluctuations, coincide. In contrary, the underlying classical models differs significantly, as the bosonic statistics allow the inclusion of multiple particles at the same site, in contrast to (symmetric) simple exclusion processes (SSEP). We provide an exact derivation of the large deviation function of density fluctuations in QSSIP and, as a consequence, in the classical inclusion process (SSIP) by exploiting its quantum formulation. Remarkably, our study highlights that, both in QSSEP and QSSIP, fluctuations of the local densities are typically classical, i.e. the cumulant generating functions of the local densities are asymptotically self-averaging and converge toward those of the classical SSEP and SSIP, realization-wise. This provides a test of the conjectured almost sure classical behavior of transport fluctuations, at leading order in the system size, in noisy diffusive quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Content-Addressable Memory with a Content-Free Energy Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Content-addressable memory, i.e. stored information that can be retrieved from content-based cues, is key to computation. Besides natural and artificial neural networks, physical learning systems have recently been shown to have remarkable ability in this domain. While classical neural network models encode memories as energy minima, biochemical systems have been shown to be able to process information based on purely kinetic principles. This opens the question of whether neural networks can also encode information kinetically. Here, we propose a minimal model for content-addressable memory in which the kinetics, and not the energy function, are used to encode patterns. We find that the performance of this kinetic encoding approach is comparable to that of classical energy-based encoding schemes. This highlights the fundamental significance of the kinetic stability of kinetic traps as an alternative to the thermodynamic stability of energy minima, offering new insights into the principles of computation in physical and synthetic systems.</description>

      <title>Optimizing compensation in Ising spin-$1/2$ site-diluted trilayered square ferrimagnets: Insights from Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs Monte Carlo simulations using the Metropolis algorithm to investigate the thermomagnetic properties of a site-diluted trilayered ferrimagnetic system with spin-$1/2$ particles placed on square monolayers. The system is composed of two different types of theoretical atoms, labeled $A$ and $B$, resulting in two distinct configurations, $ABA$ and $AAB$. Atoms of the same type $(A-A$ and $B-B)$ exhibit ferromagnetic interactions, while unlike atoms $(A-B)$ display antiferromagnetic interactions. The $A$-layers are randomly site-diluted with non-magnetic atoms and the percentage of dilution is varied from 5\% to 45\%. Depending upon the concentration of these impurities, both the compensation and critical points shift, leading to different equilibrium ferrimagnetic behaviors. The phase area in the Hamiltonian parameter space, \textit{without} compensation, scales according to the relation: $\ln |A(\rho)/\tilde{A}|=ae^{b\rho}$ . Attention is paid to the mathematical relationships between the compensation temperature and the concentration of nonmagnetic impurities. Suggested mathematical formulas reveal how the threshold impurity concentration is linked to the Hamiltonian parameters.</description>

      <title>Advances of Mayer's cluster approach in quantitative theoretical description of phase transitions for various lattice models of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resent achievements in statistical theory, namely, a possibility to reproduce almost unlimited Mayer's activity series based on the information about their convergence radius, on the one hand, and generalization of the lattice statistics by eliminating the simplification of nearest-neighbor interactions, on the other hand, have allowed accurate quantitative description of the condensation in lattice gases, spontaneous magnetization in ferromagnets, and spinodal decomposition in binary mixtures by evaluating only several irreducible cluster integrals (virial coefficients). In particular, the results of calculations indicate qualitative and even quantitative universality in the behavior of the mentioned lattice systems of different geometry and dimensionality at the same values of a certain reduced temperature when that behavior is expressed in terms of some dimensionless parameters. An additional possibility to describe the order-disorder phase transitions in some other lattice systems (e.g., antiferromagnets and alloys) is also discussed in the paper.</description>

      <title>Entropy of a restricted primitive model electrolyte using a mean electrostatic potential approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excess entropy of restricted primitive model electrolytes is calculated using a potential based approach through the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann and the modified Poisson-Boltzmann theories. The theories are utilized in conjunction with a statistical thermodynamics equation that is shown to be equivalent to thermodynamic integration. Electrolyte systems having ionic valencies 1:1 and 2:2 with diameters $3 \times 10^{-10}$~m and 4.25 $\times 10^{-10}$ m are treated over a wide range of concentrations. The exact radial distribution functions for the model electrolytes obtained from Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble are compared with the corresponding theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the radial distribution functions from the theories and the simulations are used in the Laird-Haymet entropy expansion equations [J. Chem. Phys., 1994, 100, 3775] to estimate the excess entropy of the solutions. These equations take into account multi-particle distribution functions, which are approximated using a ``ring'' term. In general, the modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory gives results that are more consistent with the simulation data than those from the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann theory. The results show that the excess entropy is negative with its absolute value increasing for 1:1 electrolytes with increasing concentration. The symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann values are slightly overestimated, while the modified Poisson-Boltzmann values are slightly underestimated relative to the simulations. The curves for 1:1 electrolytes including that from the Laird-Haymet equations are consistent with each other, while only the MPB curves for 2:2 electrolytes at $4.25 \times 10^{-10}$ m are qualitative relative to the simulations up to about 1 mol/dm$^{3}$. The 2:2 electrolyte curves reveal a characteristic inflection and plateau....</description>

      <title>Path integral calculation for emergence of rapid evolution from demographic stochasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:1403.7865v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genetic variation in a population can sometimes arise so fast as to modify ecosystem dynamics. Such phenomena have been observed in natural predator-prey systems, and characterized in the laboratory as showing unusual phase relationships in population dynamics, including a $\pi$ phase shift between predator and prey (evolutionary cycles) and even undetectable prey oscillations compared to those of the predator (cryptic cycles). Here we present a generic individual-level stochastic model of interacting populations that includes a subpopulation of low nutritional value to the predator. Using a master equation formalism, and by mapping to a coherent state path integral solved by a system-size expansion, we show that evolutionary and cryptic quasicycles can emerge generically from the combination of intrinsic demographic fluctuations and clonal mutations alone, without additional biological mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Quantum null energy condition in quenched 2d CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum null energy condition (QNEC) is a lower bound on the expectation value of the null-null component of the energy-momentum tensor in terms of null variations of the entanglement entropy. A stronger version of the QNEC (the primary QNEC) is expected to hold in 1+1 dimensional conformal field theories (CFT). QNEC has been shown to impose non-trivial quantum thermodynamic restrictions on irreversible entropy production in quenches in 1+1 dimensional holographic CFTs. It is therefore natural to study if QNEC imposes similar bounds in other quench setups. In this paper we study QNEC in the Calabrese-Cardy global and local joining quenches using standard CFT techniques. In the global quench we show that the primary QNEC must hold at sufficiently early times and find that it imposes bounds on the four point correlators of twist fields in a boundary state. This is a constraint on the set of boundary states that satisfy the primary QNEC. Furthermore, we find that a violation of the primary QNEC implies a violation of the averaged null energy condition (ANEC) in a conformally transformed frame. In the local quench we find similar bounds on four point correlators from both the primary and the usual QNEC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hallmark in natural systems, self-organization often stems from very simple interaction rules between individual agents. While single-species self-propelled particle (SPP) systems are well understood, the behavior of binary mixtures with general alignment interactions remains largely unexplored with few scattered results hinting at the existence of a rich emergent phase behavior. Here, we investigate systematically a generalization of the two-species Vicsek model with reciprocal intra- and interspecies (anti)alignment couplings, uncovering a rich phenomenology of emergent states. Notably, we show that rather than destroying polar order, anti-aligning interactions can promote phase separation and the emergence of global polar order. In doing so, we uncover a novel phase separation mechanism. We further find these coexistence patterns can be generalized to multi-species systems with cyclic alignment interactions.</description>

      <title>Accelerating and enhancing thermodynamic simulations of electrochemical interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrochemical interfaces are crucial in catalysis, energy storage, and corrosion, where their stability and reactivity depend on complex interactions between the electrode, adsorbates, and electrolyte. Predicting stable surface structures remains challenging, as traditional surface Pourbaix diagrams tend to either rely on expert knowledge or costly $\textit{ab initio}$ sampling, and neglect thermodynamic equilibration with the environment. Machine learning (ML) potentials can accelerate static modeling but often overlook dynamic surface transformations. Here, we extend the Virtual Surface Site Relaxation-Monte Carlo (VSSR-MC) method to autonomously sample surface reconstructions modeled under aqueous electrochemical conditions. Through fine-tuning foundational ML force fields, we accurately and efficiently predict surface energetics, recovering known Pt(111) phases and revealing new LaMnO$_\mathrm{3}$(001) surface reconstructions. By explicitly accounting for bulk-electrolyte equilibria, our framework enhances electrochemical stability predictions, offering a scalable approach to understanding and designing materials for electrochemical applications.</description>

      <title>Large $N$ Wess-Zumino model at finite temperature and large chemical potential in $3d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model at large $N$ in $(2+1)$ dimension. We introduce a chemical potential($\mu$) at finite temperature($T$). The non-trivial fixed point of this model is described by a pair of coupled gap equations. This fixed point behaves as a thermal CFT for all values of the coupling. We find that at large chemical potential these coupled equations simplify and solutions become analytically tractable. We solve them analytically for all values of the coupling at this limit. The solutions admit a systematic series expansion in $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Thus, using the solutions of the gap equation at large chemical potential we can evaluate the analytic form of the partition function, stress tensor and spin-1 current as a perturbative expansion in orders of $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Applying the OPE inversion formula on the scalar and fermion two point functions of the theory, we compute higher spin currents at large $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-giant number fluctuations and nematic order in microswimmer suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Giant number fluctuations (GNFs), whereby the standard deviation $\Delta N$ in the local number of particles $\langle N \rangle$ grows faster than $\sqrt{\langle N \rangle}$, are a hallmark property of dry active matter systems with orientational order, such as a collection of granular particles on a vibrated plate. This contrasts with momentum-conserving ("wet") active matter systems, such as suspensions of swimming bacteria, where no theoretical prediction of GNFs exist, although numerous experimental observations of such enhanced fluctuations have been reported. In this Letter, we numerically confirm the emergence of super-Gaussian number fluctuations in a 3-dimensional suspension of pusher microswimmers undergoing a transition to collective motion. These fluctuations emerge sharply above the transition, but only for sufficiently large values of the bacterial persistence length $\ell_p = v_s / \lambda$, where $v_s$ is the bacterial swimming speed and $\lambda$ the tumbling rate. Crucially, these "pseudo-GNFs" differ from true GNFs, as they only occur on length scales shorter than the typical size $\xi$ of nematic patches in the collective motion state, which is in turn proportional to the single-swimmer persistence length $\ell_p$. Our results thus suggest that observations of enhanced density fluctuations in biological active matter systems actually represent transient effects that decay away beyond mesoscopic length scales, and raises the question to what extent "true" GNFs with universal properties can exist in the presence of fluid flows.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic Mechanics of Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Ref. arXiv:2502.08816, Hawking radiation was analyzed through a statistical mechanics framework, revealing a structured microstate description of black hole horizons and information transfer into the radiation background. This study extends that approach by formulating Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation in the language of stochastic mechanics, employing an analytical Langevin framework and a numerical Euler iteration scheme. Both methods confirm that small black holes behave as thermal systems with Gaussian noise, while larger black holes develop a structured noise spectrum that aligns with the gradual contraction of the horizon. This suggests an alternative interpretation of Hawking radiation as an effective surface fuzziness, encoding horizon-scale fluctuations. The appendix provides a Wolfram Mathematica blueprint for numerical simulations, open to heuristic modifications for further exploration of black hole noise spectra.</description>

      <title>The probability of almost all eigenvalues being real for the elliptic real Ginibre ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate real eigenvalues of real elliptic Ginibre matrices of size $n$, indexed by the asymmetric parameter $\tau \in [0,1]$. In both the strongly and weakly non-Hermitian regimes, where $\tau \in [0,1)$ is fixed or $1-\tau=O(1/n)$, respectively, we derive the asymptotic expansion of the probability $p_{n,n-2l}$ that all but a finite number $2l$ of eigenvalues are real. In particular, we show that the expansion is of the form $$\begin{align*} \log p_{n, n-2l} = \begin{cases} a_1 n^2 +a_2 n + a_3 \log n +O(1) &amp;\text{at strong non-Hermiticity}, \\ b_1 n +b_2 \log n + b_3 +o(1) &amp;\text{at weak non-Hermiticity}, \end{cases} \end{align*}$$ and we determine all coefficients explicitly. Furthermore, in the special case where $l=1$, we derive the full-order expansions. For the proofs, we employ distinct methods for the strongly and weakly non-Hermitian regimes. In the former case, we utilise potential-theoretic techniques to analyse the free energy of elliptic Ginibre matrices conditioned to have $n-2l$ real eigenvalues, together with strong Szeg\H{o} limit theorems. In the latter case, we utilise the skew-orthogonal polynomial formalism and the asymptotic behaviour of the Hermite polynomials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry and Many-Body Landau-Zener Tunneling in Time-dependent Quantum Systems with Instantaneous Quantum Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum geometric effects in time-dependent quantum many-body systems quenched from integrable systems through a unitary transformation whose phase operator is linear in time. We establish a theorem stating that the Berry connection matrix thus all associated geometric quantities of the time-dependent many-body system, can be precisely characterized by excitations up to two-particle processes derived from the quantum integrable system. This geometric characterization provides a powerful lens for analyzing dynamical transitions in driven many-body settings. To illustrate the many-body geometric influence, we analyze a prototypical time-dependent Ising chain subjected to both a small longitudinal field and a slowly rotating transverse field, whose low-energy physics in the scaling limit is instantaneously governed by the quantum $E_8$ integrable field theory. Focusing on the quantum geometric potential (QGP), we show the QGP continuously suppresses the instantaneous energy gaps with decreasing longitudinal field, thereby enhancing many-body Landau-Zener tunneling as evidenced by the Loschmidt echo and its associated spectral entropy. The critical threshold for the longitudinal field strength is determined, where the spectral entropy linearly increases with system size and exhbits hyperscaling behavior when approaching to the threshold. When the longitudinal field passes the threshold and decreases toward zero, the QGP continuously leads to vanishing instantaneous energy gaps involving more low-energy excitations, resulting in increasing spectral entropy indicative of many-body Landau-Zener tunneling. Our results unveil telltale quantum geometric signatures in time-dependent many-body systems, elucidating the intricate interplay between quantum geometry and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation in Stillinger-Weber Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical properties of liquid and supercooled liquid silicon, modeled using the Stillinger-Weber (SW) potential, to examine the validity of the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation. Towards this end, we examine the relationship among various dynamical quantities, including (i) the macroscopic transport coefficients - self diffusion coefficient $D$ and viscosity $\eta$, (ii) relaxation time $\tau_{\alpha}$ as well as (iii) lengthscale dependent relaxation times $\tau_{\alpha}(q)$ over a broad range of temperature $T$, pressure $P$ and density $\rho$ covering both equilibrium and metastable liquid state points in the phase diagram. Our study shows a weak break down in SE relation involving $D$ and $\eta$, and the loci of \Revision{the breakdown of the SE relation} (SEB) is found in the high T liquid phase. The $\tau_{\alpha}$, when used as a proxy to $\eta$, shows distinct breakdown in the SE relation whose loci is found in the supercooled liquid phase. Interestingly, certain parts of the phase diagram shows that loci of onset of slow dynamics lie below the loci of SEB, suggesting a regime that exhibits Arrhenius but non-Fickian behaviour. Computation of $\tau_{\alpha}(q)$ enables us to extract the lengthscale associated with the Fickian to non-Fickian behaviour using which we show that the \Revision{breakdown of the SE relation} occurs only below a specific lengthscale at a given temperature. Further we also compare the SEB loci with other features of the phase behaviour, including the loci of compressiblity maximum, density maximum as well as diffusivity maximum.</description>

Abstract: Configurational entropy can impact crystallization processes, tipping the scales between structures of nearly equal internal energy. Using alloyed single crystals of Gd2PdSi3 in the AlB2-type structure, we explore the formation of complex layer sequences made from alternating, two-dimensional triangular and honeycomb slabs. A four-period and an eight-period stacking sequence are found to be very close in internal energy, the latter being favored by entropy associated with covering the full configuration space of interlayer bonds. Possible consequences of polytype formation on magnetism in Gd2PdSi3 are discussed.</description>

      <title>Transport in multifractal Kraichnan flows: from turbulence to Liouville quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviors of fluid parcel trajectories in a multifractal extension of the Kraichnan model of turbulent advection, obtained by coupling one-dimensional monofractal white-in-time Gaussian flows to a frozen-in-time Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC). The resulting random flows are characterized by the interplay between a smoothness exponent $\xi\in(0,1)$ controlling the correlation decay of the Gaussian component and the intermittency parameter $\gamma \in (0,\sqrt 2)$ prescribing the deviations from self-similarity. In recent numerical work, this coupling was observed to induce a smoothing effect, whereby two-particle separations exhibit behavior similar to those in (monofractal) Gaussian flows only with increased smoothness exponent. The purpose of this work is to develop a rigorous theory of this phenomenon, contrasting the quenched setting where the GMC has prescribed realization to an annealed setting where the GMC is averaged over. Using the theory of 1D Markov processes we characterize the Lagrangian flow through boundary behaviors at the origin for the two-particle separation process upon varying $\xi$ and $\gamma$. This extends to a multifractal setting the stochastic/deterministic transition and the coalescing/non-coalescing transition well known in the monofractal Kraichnan setting. We show that the separation process present some analogies with multiplicative 1D versions of the Liouville Brownian Motion, a canonical diffusion evolving within a random landscape induced by the GMC and previously introduced in the context of Liouville quantum gravity. In particular, both quenched and annealed phase diagrams are retrieved upon considering a multiplicative Liouville Brownian motion characterized by a smoothness parameter $\xi+\gamma^2$ and an intermittency exponent $\gamma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of minimising the connection time between non-equilibrium steady states of the Brownian Gyrator. This is a paradigmatic model in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, an overdamped Brownian particle trapped in a two-dimensional elliptical potential, with the two degrees of freedom $(x,y)$ coupled to two, in principle different, thermal baths with temperatures $T_x$ and $T_y$, respectively. Application of Pontryagin's Maximum Principle reveals that shortest protocols belong to the boundaries of the control set defined by the limiting values of the parameters $(k,u)$ characterising the elliptical potential. We identify two classes of optimal minimum time protocols, i.e. brachistochrones: (i) regular bang-bang protocols, for which $(k,u)$ alternatively take their minimum and maximum values allowed, and (ii) infinitely degenerate singular protocols. We thoroughly investigate the minimum connection time over the brachistochrones in the limit of having infinite capacity for compression. A plethora of striking phenomena emerge: sets of states attained at null connection times, discontinuities in the connection time along adjacent target states, and the fact that, starting from a state in which the oscillators are coupled, uncoupled states are impossible to reach in a finite time.</description>

      <title>Partial presentence of memory in bubble breakup: incomplete universality acquired by broken symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01793v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a water drop falls from a faucet, the drop is created with the formation of an axisymmetric constriction region, which thins down to breakup. Near the singularity of the breakup the physics at small scales becomes important, which could lead to universal dynamics independent of the scales setting the initial boundary conditions, as if memories were lost. This is true in the drop breakup surrounded by air or less viscous fluid, but not in the bubble breakup surrounded by more viscous fluid, under no geometrical confinement. Recently, it has been reported that the axisymmetry at the constriction region can be broken when a system of bubble breakup is confined. Here, we focus on the confined and non-axisymmetric breakup and find its dynamics self-similar: shapes of the liquid-air interface at different times collapsing onto a master curve. Unexpectedly, the master curve depends on the smallest among the length scales setting the initial boundary conditions but not on the other scales: The system retains partial memory, acquiring an incomplete universality by broken symmetry. Furthermore, we find the collapse is space-time dependent: the collapse onto the linear region of the master curve near the breakup tip persists for long time after breakup, while the parabolic region away from the tip is observed only for short time. We elucidate the physics in our findings, including the space-time dependent collapse, exploiting analogy with critical phenomena, which has guided recent developments across physics.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a general approximate method for calculating the one-body correlations and the momentum distributions of one-dimensional Bose gases at finite interaction strengths and temperatures trapped in smooth confining potentials. Our method combines asymptotic techniques for the long-distance behavior of the gas (similar to Luttinger liquid theory) with known short-distance expansions. We derive analytical results for the limiting cases of strong and weak interactions, and provide a general procedure for calculating one-body correlations at any interaction strength. A step-by-step explanation of the numerical method used to compute Green's functions (needed as input to our theory) is included. We benchmark our method against exact numerical calculations and compare its predictions to recent experimental results.</description>

Abstract: We derive the law of entropy non-decrease directly from the Kelvin-Planck principle for simple and compound systems without using the Clausius inequality. A key of the derivation is a formulation of entropy in terms of work by a Carnot machine operating between a system and a single heat reservoir, which is equivalent to Clausius entropy based on heat and Gyftopoulos-Beretta entropy based on work. We also characterize entropy as the thermodynamic cost to create from one state to another.</description>

Abstract: Constraint Satisfaction Problems are ubiquitous in fields ranging from the physics of solids to artificial intelligence. In many cases, such systems undergo a transition when the ratio of constraints to variables reaches some value $\alpha_{\textrm{crit}}$. Above this critical value, it is exponentially unlikely that all constraints can be mutually satisfied. We calculate the probability that constraints can all be satisfied, $P(\textrm{SAT})$, for the spherical perceptron. Traditional replica methods, such as the Parisi ansatz, fall short. We find a new ansatz, the jammed Parisi ansatz, that correctly describes the behavior of the system in this regime. With the jammed Parisi ansatz, we calculate $P(\textrm{SAT})$ for the first time and match previous computations of thresholds. We anticipate that the techniques developed here will be applicable to general constraint satisfaction problems and the identification of hidden structures in data sets.</description>

      <title>Exact Spectral Function of One-Dimensional Bose Gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.15221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exactly solved models provide rigorous understanding of many-body phenomena in strongly correlated systems. In this article, we report a breakthrough in uncovering universal many-body correlated properties of quantum integrable Lieb-Liniger model. We calculate exactly the dynamical correlation functions by computing the form factor through a newly developed method, by which we are capable of calculating all possible "relative excitations" over the ground state or a finite temperature state at a high precision. Consequently, full spectral functions obtained for the model manifests the unique power-law singularity behaviour at the spectral threshold, confirming the validity of nonlinear Luttinger liquid theory. Our method advances the theory of dynamical correlation functions with high precision towards the thermodynamic limit, and is capable of benchmarking experimental observation of such novel correlated properties.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the rates of statistical divergences and mutual information via stochastic thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical divergences are important tools in data analysis, information theory, and statistical physics, and there exist well known inequalities on their bounds. However, in many circumstances involving temporal evolution, one needs limitations on the rates of such quantities, instead. Here, several general upper bounds on the rates of some f-divergences are derived, valid for any type of stochastic dynamics (both Markovian and non-Markovian), in terms of information-like and/or thermodynamic observables. As special cases, the analytical bounds on the rate of mutual information are obtained. The major role in all those limitations is played by temporal Fisher information, characterizing the speed of global system dynamics, and some of them contain entropy production, suggesting a link with stochastic thermodynamics. Indeed, the derived inequalities can be used for estimation of minimal dissipation and global speed in thermodynamic stochastic systems. Specific applications of these inequalities in physics and neuroscience are given, which include the bounds on the rates of free energy and work in nonequilibrium systems, limits on the speed of information gain in learning synapses, as well as the bounds on the speed of predictive inference and learning rate. Overall, the derived bounds can be applied to any complex network of interacting elements, where predictability and thermodynamics of network dynamics are of prime concern.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing of all orders for Arnol'd cat map lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08521v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the recently introduced classical Arnol'd cat map lattice field theories, which are chaotic, are exponentially mixing to all orders. Their mixing times are well-defined and are expressed in terms of the Lyapunov exponents, more precisely by the combination that defines the inverse of the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of these systems. We prove by an explicit recursive construction of correlation functions, that these exhibit $l-$fold mixing for any $l= 3,4,5,\ldots$. This computation is relevant for Rokhlin's conjecture, which states that 2-fold mixing induces $l-$fold mixing for any $l&gt;2$. Our results show that 2-fold exponential mixing, while being necessary for any $l-$fold mixing to hold it is nevertheless not sufficient for Arnol'd cat map lattice field theories.</description>

      <title>Quantum reservoir probing of quantum phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07097v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are highly remarkable phenomena manifesting in quantum many-body systems. However, their precise identifications in equilibrium systems pose significant theoretical and experimental challenges. Thus far, dynamical detection protocols employing global quantum quenches have been proposed, wherein transitions are discerned via global nonequilibrium excitations. In this work, we demonstrate that quantum phase transitions can be detected through localized out-of-equilibrium excitations induced by local quantum quenches. While the resulting dynamics after the quench is influenced by both the local quench operation and the intrinsic dynamics of the quantum system, the effects of the former are exclusively extracted using the cutting-edge framework called quantum reservoir probing (QRP). Through the QRP, we find that the impacts of the local quenches vary across different quantum phases and are significantly suppressed by quantum fluctuations amplified near quantum critical points; consequently, phase boundaries are precisely delineated. We demonstrate that the QRP can detect quantum phase transitions in the paradigmatic integrable and nonintegrable quantum spin systems, and even topological quantum phase transitions, all within the identical framework employing local quantum quenches and single-site observables.</description>

      <title>Long-range multipartite entanglement near measurement-induced transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements profoundly impact quantum systems, and can be used to create novel states of matter out of equilibrium. We investigate the multipartite entanglement structure that emerges in hybrid quantum circuits involving unitaries and measurements. We describe how a balance between measurements and unitary evolution can lead to multipartite entanglement spreading to distances far greater than what is found in non-monitored systems, thus evading the usual fate of entanglement. We introduce a graphical representation based on spanning graphs that allows to infer the evolution of genuine multipartite entanglement for general subregions. We exemplify our findings on hybrid random Haar circuits that realize a 1d measurement-induced dynamical phase transition, where we find genuine 3-party entanglement at all separations. At criticality, our data is consistent with power-law decay with a tripartite exponent strictly larger than the one of the bipartite logarithmic negativity. The 4-party case is also explored. Finally, we discuss how our approach can provide fundamental insights regarding entanglement dynamics for a wide class of quantum circuits and architectures.</description>

      <title>Glassy dynamics in deep neural networks: A structural comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13098v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) share important similarities with structural glasses. Both have many degrees of freedom, and their dynamics are governed by a high-dimensional, non-convex landscape representing either the loss or energy, respectively. Furthermore, both experience gradient descent dynamics subject to noise. In this work we investigate, by performing quantitative measurements on realistic networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, the extent to which this qualitative similarity gives rise to glass-like dynamics in neural networks. We demonstrate the existence of a Topology Trivialisation Transition as well as the previously studied under-to-overparameterised transition analogous to jamming. By training DNNs with overdamped Langevin dynamics in the resulting disordered phases, we do not observe diverging relaxation times at non-zero temperature, nor do we observe any caging effects, in contrast to glass phenomenology. However, the weight overlap function follows a power law in time, with exponent $\approx -0.5$, in agreement with the Mode-Coupling Theory of structural glasses. In addition, the DNN dynamics obey a form of time-temperature superposition. Finally, dynamic heterogeneity and ageing are observed at low temperatures. These results highlight important and surprising points of both difference and agreement between the behaviour of DNNs and structural glasses.</description>

      <title>Self-trapping phenomenon, multistability and chaos in open anisotropic Dicke dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate semiclassical dynamics of a coupled atom-photon interacting system described by a dimer of anisotropic Dicke model in the presence of photon loss, exhibiting a rich variety of non-linear dynamics. Based on symmetries and dynamical classification, we characterize and chart out various dynamical phases in a phase diagram. A key feature of this system is the multistability of different dynamical states, particularly the coexistence of various superradiant phases as well as limit cycles. Remarkably, this dimer system manifests self-trapping phenomena, resulting in a photon population imbalance between the cavities. Such a self-trapped state arises from a saddle-node bifurcation, which can be understood from an equivalent Landau-Ginzburg description. Additionally, we identify a unique class of oscillatory dynamics self-trapped limit cycle, hosting self-trapping of photons. The absence of stable dynamical phases leads to the onset of chaos, which is diagnosed using the saturation value of the decorrelator dynamics. Moreover, the self-trapped states can coexist with chaotic attractor, which may have intriguing consequences in quantum dynamics. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our findings, which can be tested in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the theoretical description of electrical noise and fluctuation-induced effects in electrolytes has gained a renewed interest, enabled by stochastic field theories like stochastic density functional theory (SDFT). Such models, however, treat solvents implicitly, ignoring their generally polar nature. In the present study, starting from microscopic principles, we derive a fully explicit SDFT theory that applies to ions in a polar solvent. These equations are solved to compute observables like dynamic charge structure factors and dielectric susceptibilities. We unveil the relative importance of the different contributions (solvent, ions, cross terms) to the dynamics of electrolytes, which are key to understand the couplings between ions and the fluctuations of their microscopic environment.</description>

Abstract: We study the roughening of interfaces in phase-separated active suspensions on substrates. At both large length and timescales, we show that the interfacial dynamics belongs to the |q|KPZ universality class discussed in Besse et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 187102 (2023). This holds despite the presence of long-ranged fluid flows. At early times, however, or for sufficiently small systems, the roughening exponents are the same as those in the presence of a momentum-conserving fluid. Surprisingly, when the effect of substrate friction can be ignored, the interface becomes random beyond a de Gennes-Taupin lengthscale which depends on the interfacial tension.</description>

      <title>On Chord Dynamics and Complexity Growth in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the time evolution governed by the two-sided chord Hamiltonian in the double-scaled SYK model, which induces a probability distribution over operators in the double-scaled algebra. Through the bulk-to-boundary map, this distribution translates into dynamical profiles of bulk states within the chord Hilbert space. We derive analytic expressions for such profiles, valid across a broad parameter range and all time scales. Additionally, we demonstrate how distinct semi-classical behaviors emerge by localizing within specific energy regions in the semi-classical limit. We revisit the doubled Hilbert space formalism as an isometric map between the one-particle sector of the chord Hilbert space and the doubled zero-particle sector. Utilizing this map, we obtain analytic results for correlation functions and investigate the dynamical evolution for chord operators. Specifically, we establish an equivalence between the chord number generating function in presence of matter chords and the crossed four-point correlation function, the latter is closely related to the $6j$-symbol of $U_{\sqrt{q}}(\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$. We also explore finite-temperature effects, showing that operator spreading slows as temperature decreases. In the semi-classical limit, we perform a saddle point analysis and incorporate the one-loop determinant to derive the normalized time-ordered four-point correlation function at infinite temperature. The leading correction reproduces the \(1/N\) connected contribution observed in the large-\(p\) SYK model. Finally, we examine the time evolution of total chord number in presence of matter in the triple-scaled regime, linking it to the renormalized two-sided length in JT gravity with matter.</description>

      <title>Near linearity of the macroscopic Hall current response in infinitely extended gapped fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an infinitely extended system of fermions on a $d$-dimensional lattice with (magnetic) translation-invariant short-range interactions. We further assume that the system has a locally unique gapped ground state. Physically, this is a model for the bulk of a generic topological insulator at zero temperature, and we are interested in the current response of such a system to a constant external electric field. Using the non-equilibrium almost-stationary states approach, we prove that the longitudinal current density induced by a constant electric field of strength $\varepsilon$ is of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$, i.e. the system is an insulator in the usual sense. For the Hall current density we show instead that it is linear in $\varepsilon$ up to terms of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$. The proportionality factor $\sigma_\mathrm{H}$ is by definition the Hall conductivity, and we show that it is given by a generalization of the well known double commutator formula to interacting systems. As a by-product of our results, we find that the Hall conductivity is constant within gapped phases, and that for $d=2$ the relevant observable that "measures" the Hall conductivity in experiments, the Hall conductance, not only agrees with $\sigma_{\mathrm{H}}$ in expectation up to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$, but also has vanishing variance. A notable difference to several existing results on the current response in interacting fermion systems is that we consider a macroscopic system exposed to a small constant electric field, rather than to a small voltage drop.</description>

      <title>Gross-Neveu-Yukawa SO(2) and SO(3) tensorial criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16842v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic SO(2)- and SO(3)-invariant Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theories for real, rank-two, symmetric, traceless tensor order parameters coupled to $N_{\text{f}}$ flavors of two-component Dirac fermions. These field theories arise as an effective description of fractionalized spin-orbital liquids. The two theories are the simplest and special cases of the more general class of field theories with SO($N$) symmetric tensor order parameter coupled to Dirac fermions, in which the symmetry is low enough to allow only one, and not the usual two quartic self-interaction terms. Using two-loop renormalization group near the upper critical dimension, we demonstrate that the theory exhibits a new critical fixed point for $N=3$ and the concomitant continuous phase transition for any value of $N_{\text{f}}$. For $N=2$ the theory is equivalent to the chiral XY model. We discuss the crucial role of the symmetry-allowed sextic self-interactions in the selection of the ground state configuration in the case of SO(3). The universal quantities such as the the anomalous dimensions of order parameters and fermions, the correlation length exponent, and the mass gap ratio between order parameter and fermion masses are computed up to $\epsilon^{2}$ order.</description>

      <title>Inverse Superconductor-Insulator Transition in Weakly Monitored Josephson Junction Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control and manipulation of quantum states by measurements and bath engineering in open quantum systems have emerged as new paradigms in many-body physics. Here, taking a prototypical example of Josephson junction arrays (JJAs), we show how repetitive monitoring through continuous weak measurements and feedback can transform an insulating state in these systems to a superconductor and vice versa. We show that, even in the absence of any external thermal bath, the monitoring leads to a long-time steady state characterized by an effective `quantum' temperature in a suitably defined semiclassical limit. However, we show that the quantum dissipation due to monitoring has fundamental differences with equilibrium quantum and/or thermal dissipation in the well-studied case of JJAs in contact with an Ohmic bath. In particular, using a variational approximation, and by considering various limiting cases, we demonstrate that this difference can give rise to re-entrant steady-state phase transitions, resulting in unusual inverse transition from an effective low-temperature insulating normal state to superconducting state at intermediate temperature. Our work emphasizes the role of quantum feedback, that acts as an additional knob to control the effective temperature of non-equilibrium steady state leading to a phase diagram, not explored in earlier works on monitored and open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Viscosity of polymer melts using non-affine theory based on vibrational modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.</description>

      <title>Singular Value Decomposition and Its Blind Spot for Quantum Chaos in Non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of chaos and complexity in non-Hermitian quantum systems poses significant challenges due to the emergence of complex eigenvalues in their spectra. Recently, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method was proposed to address these challenges. In this work, we identify two critical shortcomings of the SVD approach when analyzing Krylov complexity and spectral statistics in non-Hermitian settings. First, we show that SVD fails to reproduce conventional eigenvalue statistics in the Hermitian limit for systems with non-positive definite spectra, as exemplified by a variant of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Second, and more fundamentally, Krylov complexity and spectral statistics derived via SVD cannot distinguish chaotic from integrable non-Hermitian dynamics, leading to results that conflict with complex spacing ratio analysis. Our findings reveal that SVD is inadequate for probing quantum chaos in non-Hermitian systems, and we advocate employing more robust methods, such as the bi-Lanczos algorithm, for future research in this direction.</description>

      <title>Noise equals endogenous control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic systems have a control-theoretic interpretation in which noise plays the role of endogenous control. In the weak-noise limit, relevant at low temperatures or in large populations, control is optimal and an exact mathematical mapping from noise to control is described, where the maximizing the probability of a state becomes the control objective. In Langevin dynamics noise is identified directly with control, while in general Markov jump processes, which include chemical reaction networks and electronic circuits, we use the Doi-Zel'dovich-Grassberger-Goldenfeld-Peliti path integral to identify the `response' or `tilt' field $\pi$ as control, which is proportional to the noise in the semiclassical limit. This solves the longstanding problem of interpreting $\pi$. We illustrate the mapping on multistable chemical reaction networks and systems with unstable fixed points. The noise-control mapping builds intuition for otherwise puzzling phenomena of stochastic systems: why the probability is generically a non-smooth function of state out of thermal equilibrium; why biological mechanisms can work better in the presence of noise; and how agentic behavior emerges naturally without recourse to mysticism.</description>

      <title>The Energy Barrier of Precritical Nuclei in Hard Spheres is Consistent with Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting crystal nucleation is among the most significant long--standing challenges in condensed matter. In the system most studied (hard sphere colloids), the comparison between experiments performed using static light scattering and computer simulations is woeful, with a discrepancy of over 10 orders of magnitude. The situation with other well-studied materials (such as water and sodium chloride) is no better. It has thus far proven impossible to access the regime of this discrepancy with particle-resolved techniques which might shed light on the origins of this discrepancy due to the relatively sluggish dynamics of the larger colloids required for confocal microscopy.
  Here we address this challenge with two developments. Our work is a marked improvement in the precision of mapping the state point of experiments to simulation. For this, we employed a combination of novel machine-learning methods for particle tracking and higher-order correlation functions. Our second innovation is to consider the free energy of \emph{pre--critical} nuclei which can be detected in the discrepancy regime. These are in agreement with computer simulation. This is the first time that such free energies have been directly compared between experiment and simulation in any material as far as we are aware. The agreement provides important validation of rare event sampling techniques which are used very widely in simulation, but which can seldom be directly compared with experiment.</description>
