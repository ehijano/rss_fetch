      <title>New source, new possibilities: An exploratory study of Bluesky posts referencing scholarly articles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amid the migration of academics from X, the social media platform Bluesky has been proposed as a potential alternative. To assess its viability and relevance for science communication, this study presents the first large-scale analysis of scholarly article dissemination on Bluesky, exploring its potential as a new source of social media metrics. We collected and analysed 87,470 Bluesky posts referencing 72,898 scholarly articles from February 2024 to April 2025, integrating metadata from the OpenAlex database. We examined temporal trends, disciplinary coverage, language use, textual characteristics, and user engagement. A sharp increase in scholarly activity on Bluesky was observed from November 2024, coinciding with broader academic shifts away from X. Posts primarily focus on the social, environmental, and medical sciences and are predominantly written in English. As on X, likes and reposts are much more common than replies and quotes. Nevertheless, Bluesky posts demonstrate a higher degree of textual originality than previously observed on X, suggesting greater interpretive engagement. These findings highlight Bluesky's emerging role as a credible platform for science communication and a promising source for altmetrics. The platform may facilitate not only early visibility of research outputs but also more meaningful scholarly dialogue in the evolving social media landscape.</description>

      <title>Comparing OCR Pipelines for Folkloristic Text Digitization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The digitization of historical folkloristic materials presents unique challenges due to diverse text layouts, varying print and handwriting styles, and linguistic variations. This study explores different optical character recognition (OCR) approaches for Slovene folkloristic and historical text digitization, integrating both traditional methods and large language models (LLMs) to improve text transcription accuracy while maintaining linguistic and structural integrity. We compare single-stage OCR techniques with multi-stage pipelines that incorporate machine learning-driven post-processing for text normalization and layout reconstruction. While LLM-enhanced methods show promise in refining recognition outputs and improving readability, they also introduce challenges related to unintended modifications, particularly in the preservation of dialectal expressions and historical structures. Our findings provide insights into selecting optimal digitization strategies for large-scale folklore archives and outline recommendations for developing robust OCR pipelines that balance automation with the need for textual authenticity in digital humanities research.</description>

      <title>Understanding discrepancies in the coverage of OpenAlex: the case of China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19302v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Citation indexes play a crucial role for understanding how science is produced, disseminated, and used. However, these databases often face a critical trade-off: those offering extensive and high-quality coverage are typically proprietary, whereas publicly accessible datasets frequently exhibit fragmented coverage and inconsistent data quality. OpenAlex was developed to address this challenge, providing a freely available database with broad open coverage, with a particular emphasis on non-English speaking countries. Yet, few studies have assessed the quality of the OpenAlex dataset. This paper assesses the coverage, by OpenAlex, of China's papers, which shows an abnormal trend, and compares it with other countries that do not have English as their main language. Our analysis reveals that while OpenAlex increases the coverage of China's publications, primarily those disseminated by a national database, this coverage is incomplete and discontinuous when compared to other countries' records in the database. We observe similar issues in other non-English-speaking countries, with coverage varying across regions. These findings indicate that although OpenAlex expands coverage of research outputs, continuity issues persist and disproportionately affect certain countries. We emphasize the need for researchers to use OpenAlex data cautiously, being mindful of its potential limitations in cross-national analyses.</description>

      <title>KuiSCIMA v2.0: Improved Baselines, Calibration, and Cross-Notation Generalization for Historical Chinese Music Notations in Jiang Kui's Baishidaoren Gequ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical Music Recognition (OMR) for historical Chinese musical notations, such as suzipu and l\"ul\"upu, presents unique challenges due to high class imbalance and limited training data. This paper introduces significant advancements in OMR for Jiang Kui's influential collection Baishidaoren Gequ from 1202. In this work, we develop and evaluate a character recognition model for scarce imbalanced data. We improve upon previous baselines by reducing the Character Error Rate (CER) from 10.4% to 7.1% for suzipu, despite working with 77 highly imbalanced classes, and achieve a remarkable CER of 0.9% for l\"ul\"upu. Our models outperform human transcribers, with an average human CER of 15.9% and a best-case CER of 7.6%. We employ temperature scaling to achieve a well-calibrated model with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) below 0.0162. Using a leave-one-edition-out cross-validation approach, we ensure robust performance across five historical editions. Additionally, we extend the KuiSCIMA dataset to include all 109 pieces from Baishidaoren Gequ, encompassing suzipu, l\"ul\"upu, and jianzipu notations. Our findings advance the digitization and accessibility of historical Chinese music, promoting cultural diversity in OMR and expanding its applicability to underrepresented music traditions.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Predict Citation Intent? An Experimental Analysis of In-context Learning and Fine-tuning on Open LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the ability of open Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict citation intent through in-context learning and fine-tuning. Unlike traditional approaches relying on domain-specific pre-trained models like SciBERT, we demonstrate that general-purpose LLMs can be adapted to this task with minimal task-specific data. We evaluate twelve model variations across five prominent open LLM families using zero-, one-, few-, and many-shot prompting. Our experimental study identifies the top-performing model and prompting parameters through extensive in-context learning experiments. We then demonstrate the significant impact of task-specific adaptation by fine-tuning this model, achieving a relative F1-score improvement of 8% on the SciCite dataset and 4.3% on the ACL-ARC dataset compared to the instruction-tuned baseline. These findings provide valuable insights for model selection and prompt engineering. Additionally, we make our end-to-end evaluation framework and models openly available for future use.</description>
