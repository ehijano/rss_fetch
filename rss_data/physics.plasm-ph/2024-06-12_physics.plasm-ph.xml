      <title>Report on laser-induced fluorescence transitions relevant for the microelectronics industry and sustainability applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide variety of feed gases are used to generate low-temperature plasmas for the microelectronics and the sustainability applications. These plasmas often have a complex combination of reactive and non-reactive species which may have spatial and temporal variations in the density, the temperature and the energy. Accurate knowledge of these parameters and their variations is critically important for understanding and advancing these applications through validated and predictive modeling and design of relevant devices. Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) provides both spatial and temporally resolved information about the plasma-produced radicals, ions, and metastables. However, the use of this powerful diagnostic tool requires the knowledge of optical transitions including excitation and fluorescence wavelengths which may not be available or scattered through a huge literature domain. In this manuscript, we collected, analyzed and compiled the available transitions for laser-induced fluorescence for more than 160 chemical species relevant to the microelectronics industry and the sustainability applications. A list of species with overlapping LIF excitation and fluorescence wavelengths have been identified. This summary is intended to serve as a data reference for LIF transitions and should be updated in the future.</description>

      <title>TRANSP integrated modeling code for interpretive and predictive analysis of tokamak plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive review of the TRANSP code, a sophisticated tool for interpretive and predictive analysis of tokamak plasmas, detailing its major capabilities and features. It describes the equations for particle, power, and momentum balance analysis, as well as the poloidal field diffusion equations. The paper outlines the spatial and time grids used in TRANSP and details the equilibrium assumptions and solvers. Various models for heating and current drive, including updates to the NUBEAM model, are discussed. The handling of large-scale events such as sawtooth crashes and pellet injections is examined, along with the predictive capabilities for advancing plasma profiles. The integration of TRANSP with the ITER Integrated Modeling and Analysis Suite (IMAS) is highlighted, demonstrating enhanced data access and analysis capabilities. Additionally, the paper discusses best practices and continuous integration techniques to enhance TRANSP's robustness. The suite of TRANSP tools, designed for efficient data analysis and simulation, further supports the optimization of tokamak operations and coupling with other tokamak codes. Continuous development and support ensure that TRANSP remains a major code for the analysis of experimental data for controlled thermonuclear fusion, maintaining its critical role in supporting the optimization of tokamak operations and advancing fusion research.</description>

      <title>Simplified and Flexible Coils for Stellarators using Single-Stage Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-stage optimization, also known as combined plasma-coil algorithms or direct coil optimization, has recently emerged as a possible method to expedite the design of stellarator devices by including, in a single step, confinement, stability, and engineering constraints. In this work, we show how such frameworks allow us to find new designs in a streamlined manner, yielding a broad range of new configurations. Examples are shown for stellarators with a small number of coils and quasisymmetric stellarators with only one to three coils per half field period, with external trim coils, helical coils, and a single set of coils generating both a quasi-axisymmetric and a quasi-helical equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Wakefield-driven filamentation of warm beams in plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged and quasi-neutral beams propagating through an unmagnetised plasma are subject to numerous collisionless instabilities on the small scale of the plasma skin depth. The electrostatic two-stream instability, driven by longitudinal and transverse wakefields, dominates for dilute beams. This leads to modulation of the beam along the propagation direction and, for wide beams, transverse filamentation. A three-dimensional spatiotemporal two-stream theory for warm beams with a finite extent is developed. Unlike the cold beam limit, diffusion due to a finite emittance gives rise to a dominant wavenumber, and a cut-off wavenumber above which filamentation is suppressed. Particle-in-cell simulations give excellent agreement with the theoretical model. This work provides deeper insights into the effect of diffusion on filamentation of finite beams, crucial for comprehending plasma-based accelerators in laboratory and cosmic settings.</description>

      <title>Effect of insulator end cap thickness on time-dependent Hartmann flow in a rotating mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework for analyzing plasma flow in a rotating mirror. By making a series of physical assumptions, we reduce the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in a three-dimensional cylindrical system to a one-dimensional system in a shallow, cuboidal channel within a transverse magnetic field, similar to the Hartmann flow in the ducts. We then solve the system both numerically and analytically for a range of values of the Hartmann number and calculate the dependence of the plasma flow speed on the thickness of the insulating end cap. We observe that the mean flow overshoots and decelerates before achieving a steady-state value, a phenomenon that the analytical model cannot capture. This overshoot is directly proportional to the thickness of the insulating end cap and the external electric field, with a weak dependence on the external magnetic field. Our simplified model can act as a benchmark for future simulations of the supersonic mirror device Compact Magnetic Fusion Experiment (CMFX), which will employ more sophisticated physics and realistic magnetic field geometries.</description>

      <title>TORAX: A Fast and Differentiable Tokamak Transport Simulator in JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present TORAX, a new, open-source, differentiable tokamak core transport simulator implemented in Python using the JAX framework. TORAX solves the coupled equations for ion heat transport, electron heat transport, particle transport, and current diffusion, incorporating modular physics-based and ML models. JAX's just-in-time compilation ensures fast runtimes, while its automatic differentiation capability enables gradient-based optimization workflows and simplifies the use of Jacobian-based PDE solvers. Coupling to ML-surrogates of physics models is greatly facilitated by JAX's intrinsic support for neural network development and inference. TORAX is verified against the established RAPTOR code, demonstrating agreement in simulated plasma profiles. TORAX provides a powerful and versatile tool for accelerating research in tokamak scenario modeling, pulse design, and control.</description>
