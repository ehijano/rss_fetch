      <title>Spreading Phenomena in Degenerate Diffusion Equations with Spatially Periodic Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate one-dimensional degenerate diffusion equations with generic spatially periodic reactions. Our primary contribution lies in constructing a {\it periodic traveling sharp wave} exhibiting a positive profile on the left half-line and a free boundary on the right governed by Darcy's law. To achieve this, we employ a renormalization framework, where the convergence of the renormalized solution sequence is rigorously established through uniform-in-time estimates near the free boundary, derived via delicate asymptotic analysis. Subsequently, we extend our analysis to heterogeneous reaction terms encompassing monostable, bistable or combustion-type nonlinearities, and prove a Fife-McLeod type of result (\cite{FM}): any spreading solution with compactly supported initial data converges exponentially to the constructed sharp wave.</description>

      <title>Unique Continuation of Static Over-Determined Magnetohydrodynamic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the Unique Continuation Property (UCP) for a suitably overdetermined Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) eigenvalue problem, which is equivalent to the Kalman, finite rank, controllability condition for the finite dimensional unstable projection of the linearized dynamic MHD problem. It is the ``ignition key" to obtain uniform stabilization of the dynamic nonlinear MHD system near an unstable equilibrium solution, by means of finitely many, interior, localized feedback controllers of Laseicka et. al 2025. The proof of the UCP result uses a pointwise Carleman-type estimate for the Laplacian following the approach that was introduced in Triggiani 2009 for the Navier-Stokes equations and further extended in Triggiani et. al. 2021 for the Boussinesq system.</description>

      <title>1D pressureless gas dynamics systems in a strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct explicit measure-valued solutions to the one-dimensional pressureless gas dynamics systems in a strip-like domain by introducing a new boundary potential. The constructed solution is shown to satisfy an entropy condition, and depending on the boundary data and behavior of the potentials, mass accumulation can occur at the boundaries. This paper significantly extends the analysis of our previous work [23], where the quarter-space problem for the pressureless gas dynamics model was studied for the first time.</description>

      <title>Global stability of Wright-type equations with negative Schwarzian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simplicity of the $37/24$-global stability criterion announced by E.M. Wright in 1955 and rigorously proved by B. B\'{a}nhelyi et al in 2014 for the delayed logistic equation raised the question of its possible extension for other population models. In our study, we answer this question by extending the $37/24$-stability condition for the Wright-type equations with decreasing smooth nonlinearity $f$ which has a negative Schwarzian and satisfies the standard negative feedback and boundedness assumptions. The proof contains the construction and careful analysis of qualitative properties of certain bounding relations. To validate our conclusions, these relations are evaluated at finite sets of points; for this purpose, we systematically use interval analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of prescribing Gaussian curvature and geodesic curvature in a compact surface with boundary with conical singularities and corners. Solutions are obtained using a new variational formulation, recently introduced for the regular counterpart of the problem and extended here to the singular case. As far as we know, this is the first result for the problem of prescribed curvatures in surfaces with singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be positive and $n \geq 3$ be an integer. Let $f(\cdot,\cdot): \mathbf{R}_+\times \mathbf{R}_+\to \mathbf{R}_+$ be a continuous function. In this paper, we are concerned with positive solutions to the following integral equation \[ u(x)= \int_{\mathbf{R}^n} |x-y|^p f(|y|,u(y)) dy \quad\text{in }\mathbf{R}^n\setminus\{\textbf{0}\}. \] By imposing some suitable conditions on $f$, we obtain the radially symmetry property of positive solutions to the above equation by using the method of moving spheres in integral form.</description>

      <title>Variational and nonvariational solutions for double phase variable exponent problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we examine two double-phase variable exponent problems, each formulated within a distinct framework. The first problem is non-variational, as the nonlinear term may depend on the gradient of the solution. The first main result establishes an existence property from the nonlinear monotone operator theory given by Browder and Minty. The second problem is set up within a variational framework, where we employ a well-known critical point result by Bonanno and Chinn\`{\i}. In both cases, we demonstrate the existence of at least one nontrivial solution. To illustrate the practical application of the main results, we provide examples for each problem.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and monotonicity of solutions to elliptic and parabolic fractional $p$-equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we first establish the maximum principle of the antisymmetric functions for parabolic fractional $p$-equations. Then we use it and the parabolic inequalities to provide a different proof of symmetry and monotonicity for solutions to elliptic fractional $p$-equations with gradient terms.
  Finally, base on suitable initial value, by the maximum principle of the antisymmetric functions for parabolic fractional $p$-equations, we attain symmetry and monotonicity of positive solutions in each finite time to nonlinear parabolic fractional $p$-equations on the whole space and bounded domains.
  We believe that the maximum principle and parabolic inequalities obtained here can be utilized to many elliptic and parabolic problems involving nonlinear nonlocal operators.</description>

      <title>On the global stability and large time behavior of solutions of the Boussinesq equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional viscous Boussinesq equations, which model the motion of stratified flows in a circular domain influenced by a general gravitational potential $f$. First, we demonstrate that the Boussinesq equations admit steady-state solutions only in the form of hydrostatic equilibria, given by $(\mathbf{u},\rho,p)=(0,\rho_s,p_s)$, where the pressure gradient satisfies $\nabla p_s=-\rho_s\nabla f$. Subsequently, we establish that any hydrostatic equilibrium satisfying the condition $\nabla \rho_s=\delta (x,y)\nabla f$ is linearly unstable if $\delta(x,y)$ is positive at some point $(x,y)=(x_0,y_0)$, This instability corresponds to the well-known Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Thirdly, by employing a series of regularity estimates, we reveal that although the presence of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability increases the velocity, the system ultimately converges to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. This result is achieved by analyzing perturbations around any state of hydrostatic equilibrium, including both stable and unstable configurations. Specifically, the state of hydrostatic equilibrium can be expressed as $\rho=-\gamma f+\beta$,where $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are positive constants, provided that the global perturbation satisfies additional conditions. This highlights the system's tendency to stabilize into a hydrostatic state despite the presence of instabilities.</description>

      <title>Long-time asymptotics of the KdV equation with delta function initial profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the long-time asymptotic behaviors of the solution to the KdV equation with delta function initial profile in different regions, employing the Riemann-Hilbert formulation and Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method. Despite the initial condition being discontinuous and having singularity at the origin, the long-time asymptotics of the solution to this problem exhibits remarkable richness and regularity. Specifically, when the initial value is a delta potential well, the asymptotic solution is predominantly dominated by a single soliton in certain region for $x&gt;0$, while in other regions, the dispersive tails including self-similar region, collisionless shock region and dispersive wave region, play a more significant role. Conversely, when the initial value is a delta potential barrier, the soliton region is absent, although the dispersive tails still persist. The leading-order terms of the solution in each region are derived, highlighting the efficacy of the Riemann-Hilbert formulation in elucidating the long-time behaviors of integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Lipschitz stability in the Calder\'on problem and general Zernike bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calder\'on's inverse conductivity problem has, so far, only been subject to conditional logarithmic stability for infinite-dimensional classes of conductivities and to Lipschitz stability when restricted to finite-dimensional classes. Focusing our attention on the unit ball domain in any spatial dimension $d\geq 2$, we give an elementary proof that there are (infinitely many) infinite-dimensional classes of conductivities for which there is Lipschitz stability. In particular, Lipschitz stability holds for general expansions of conductivities, allowing all angular frequencies but with limited freedom in the radial direction, if the basis coefficients decay fast enough to overcome the growth of the basis functions near the domain boundary. We construct general $d$-dimensional Zernike bases and prove that they provide examples of infinite-dimensional Lipschitz stability.</description>

      <title>On the fractional regularity for an elliptic nonlinear singular drift equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an elliptic equation with the fractional Laplacian operator $(-\Delta)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ in the dissipative term, a singular integral operator ${\bf A}(\cdot)$ in the nonlinear term, and an external source $f$. The key example is the stationary (time-independent) counterpart of the surface quasi-geostrophic equation.
  Under suitable assumptions on $f$ and natural assumptions on ${\bf A}(\cdot)$ in the setting of Sobolev spaces, our main result examines how the fractional power $\alpha$ propagates and optimally improves the regularity of weak $L^p$-solutions to this equation.</description>

      <title>Accretion and Ablation in Deformable Solids using an Eulerian Formulation: A Finite Deformation Numerical Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface growth, i.e., the addition or removal of mass from the boundary of a solid body, occurs in a wide range of processes, including the growth of biological tissues, solidification and melting, and additive manufacturing. To understand nonlinear phenomena such as failure and morphological instabilities in these systems, accurate numerical models are required to study the interaction between mass addition and stress in complex geometrical and physical settings. Despite recent progress in the formulation of models of surface growth of deformable solids, current numerical approaches require several simplifying assumptions.
  This work formulates a method that couples an Eulerian surface growth description to a phase-field approach. It further develops a finite element implementation to solve the model numerically using a fixed computational domain with a fixed discretization. This approach bypasses the challenges that arise in a Lagrangian approach, such as having to construct a four-dimensional reference configuration, remeshing, and/or changing the computational domain over the course of the numerical solution. It also enables the modeling of several settings -- such as non-normal growth of biological tissues and stress-induced growth -- which can be challenging for available methods.
  The numerical approach is demonstrated on a model problem that shows non-normal growth, wherein growth occurs by the motion of the surface in a direction that is not parallel to the normal of the surface, that can occur in hard biological tissues such as nails, horns, etc. Next, a thermomechanical model is formulated and used to investigate the kinetics of freezing and melting in ice under complex stress states, particularly to capture regelation which is a key process in frost heave and basal slip in glaciers.</description>

      <title>Anderson localized states for the nonlinear Maryland model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Anderson localization for a nonlinear perturbation of the Maryland model $H=\varepsilon\Delta+\cot\pi(\theta+j\cdot\alpha)\delta_{j,j'}$ on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. Specifically, if $\varepsilon,\delta$ are sufficiently small, we construct a large number of time quasi-periodic and space exponentially decaying solutions (i.e., Anderson localized states) for the equation $i\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=Hu+\delta|u|^{2p}u$ with a Diophantine $\alpha$. Our proof combines eigenvalue estimates of the Maryland model with the Craig-Wayne-Bourgain method, which originates from KAM theory for Hamiltonian PDEs.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior for the Brezis-Nirenberg problem. The subcritical perturbation case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the well-known Brezis-Nirenberg problem \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} -\Delta u= u^{2^*-1}+\varepsilon u^{q-1},\quad u&gt;0, &amp;{\text{in}~\Omega},\\ \quad \ \ u=0, &amp;{\text{on}~\partial \Omega}, \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $\Omega\subset \mathbb R^N$ with $N\ge 3$ is a bounded domain, $q\in(2,2^*)$ and $2^*=\frac{2N}{N-2}$ denotes the critical Sobolev exponent. It is well-known (H. Br\'{e}zis and L. Nirenberg, \newblock {\em Comm. Pure Appl. Math.}, 36(4):437--477, 1983) that the above problem admits a positive least energy solution for all $\varepsilon &gt;0$ and $q&gt;\max\{2,\frac{4}{N-2}\}$. In the present paper, we first analyze the asymptotic behavior of the positive least energy solution as $\varepsilon\to 0$ and establish a sharp asymptotic characterisation of the profile and blow-up rate of the least energy solution. Then, we prove the uniqueness and nondegeneracy of the least energy solution under some mild assumptions on domain $\Omega$. The main results in this paper can be viewed as a generalization of the results for $q=2$ previously established in the literature. But the situation is quite different from the case $q=2$, and the blow-up rate not only heavily depends on the space dimension $N$ and the geometry of the domain $\Omega$, but also depends on the exponent $q\in(\max\{2,\frac{4}{N-2}\}, 2^*)$ in a non-trivial way.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following well-known Brezis-Nirenberg problem \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} -\Delta u= u^{2^*-1}+\varepsilon u^{q-1}, \quad u&gt;0, &amp;{\text{in}~\Omega},\\ \quad \ \ u=0, &amp;{\text{on}~\partial \Omega}, \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $N\geq 3$, $\Omega$ is a smooth and bounded domain in $\R^{N}$, $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is a small parameter, $q\in (2,2^*)$ and $2^*:=\frac{2N}{N-2}$ denotes the critical Sobolev exponent. The existence of solutions to the above problem has been obtained by many authors in the literature. However, as far as the authors know, the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the above problem is still open. Here we first describe the asymptotic profile of solutions to the above problem as $\varepsilon\to 0$. Then, we derive the exact blow-up rate and characterize the concentration speed and the location of concentration points in the general case of multi-peak solutions. Finally, we prove the uniqueness, nondegeneracy and count the exact number of blow-up solutions.
  The main results in this paper give a complete picture of multi-peak blow-up phenomena in the framework of Brezis-Peletier conjecture in the case of sub-critical perturbation. On the other hand, compared with the special case $q=2$ previously studied in the literature, we observe that the exponent $q$ has a significant impact on the asymptotic behavior, uniqueness and nondegeneracy of solutions in addition to the geometry of domain $\Omega$ and space dimension $N$ which is already known in the literature.</description>

      <title>Maximal regularity estimates for the abstract Cauchy problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the Da Prato-Grisvard theory of maximal regularity estimates for sectorial operators in interpolation spaces. Specifically, for any generator $-A$ of an analytic semigroup on a Banach space $X$, we identify the interpolation spaces between $X$ and the domain $D_{A}$ of $A$ in which the part of $A$ satisfies certain maximal regularity estimates. We also establish several new results concerning both homogeneous and inhomogeneous $L^1$-maximal regularity estimates, extending and completing recent findings in the literature. These results are motivated not only by applications to problems in areas such as fluid mechanics but also by the intrinsic theoretical interest of the subject. In particular, we address the optimal choice of data spaces for the Cauchy problem associated with $A$, ensuring the existence of strong solutions with global-in-time control of their derivatives. This control is measured via the homogeneous parts of the interpolation norms in the spatial variable and weighted Lebesgue norms over the time interval. Furthermore, we characterize weighted $L^1$-estimates and establish their relationship with unweighted estimates. Additionally, we reformulate the characterization condition for $L^1$-maximal regularity due to Kalton and Portal in a priori terms that do not rely on semigroup operators. Finally, we introduce a new interpolation framework for $L^p$-maximal regularity estimates, where $p \in (1, \infty)$, within interpolation spaces generated by non-classical interpolation functors.</description>

      <title>Generalized principal eigenvalues for parabolic operators in bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce here new generalized principal eigenvalues for linear parabolic operators with heterogeneous coefficients in space and time. We consider a bounded spatial domain and an unbounded time interval $I$ : $I=\mathbb{R},\ \mathbb{R}^+$ or $\mathbb{R}^-$, and operators with coefficients having a fairly general dependence on space and time. The notions we introduce rely on the parabolic maximum principle and extend some earlier definitions introduced for elliptic operators [BNV].
  We first show that these eigenvalues hold the key to understanding the large time behavior and entire solutions of heterogeneous Fisher-KPP type equations. We then describe the relation of these quantities with principal Floquet bundles for parabolic operators which provides further characterizations of the principal eigenvalues. These allow us to derive monotonicity properties and comparisons between generalized principal eigenvalues, as well as perturbation results and further properties involving limit operators. We show that the sign of these eigenvalues encodes different versions of the maximum principle for parabolic operators. Lastly, we explicitly compute the generalized principal eigenvalues for several classes of operators such as spatial-independent, periodic, almost periodic, uniquely ergodic or random stationary ergodic coefficients.</description>

      <title>A delayed interior area-to-height estimate for the Curve Shortening Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In (Sobnack &amp; Topping; 2024a, 2024b), Topping &amp; the author proposed the principle of 'delayed parabolic regularity' for the Curve Shortening Flow; in (Sobnack &amp; Topping, 2024a), they provided a handful of proper graphical situations in which their delayed regularity framework is valid. In this paper, we show that there holds an interior graphical estimate for the Curve Shortening Flow in the spirit of the proposed framework. More precisely, we show the following $ \mathrm{L}^1_\mathrm{loc} $-to-$ \mathrm{L}^\infty_\mathrm{loc} $ estimate: If a smooth Graphical Curve Shortening Flow $ u : (-1, 1) \times [0, T) \mapsto \mathbb{R} $ starts from a function $ u_0 := u( \, \cdot \, , 0) : (-1, 1) \mapsto \mathbb{R} $ with $ \mathrm{L}^1(\!(-1,1)\!) $ norm strictly less than $ \pi T $, then after waiting for the 'magic time' $ t_\star : = \| u_0 \|_{\mathrm{L}^1(\!(-1,1)\!)} / \pi $, the size $ |u(0, t)| $ of $ u( \, \cdot \, , t) $ at the origin at any time $ t \in (t_\star, T) $ is controlled purely in terms of $ \| u_0 \|_{\mathrm{L}^1(\!(-1,1)\!)} $ and $ t - t_\star $. We apply our estimate to construct Graphical Curve Shortening Flows starting weakly from Radon measures without point masses.</description>

      <title>A remark on the zero-filter limit for the Camassa-Holm equation in $B^s_{2,\infty}(\R)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the zero-filter limit problem associated with the Camassa-Holm equation. In the work cited as \cite{C.L.L.W.L}, it was established that, under the hypothesis of initial data $u_0\in B^s_{2,r}(\R)$ with $s&gt;\frac32$ and $1\leq r&lt;\infty$, the solutions $\mathbf{S}_{t}^{\mathbf{\alpha}}(u_0)$ of the Camassa-Holm equation exhibit convergence in the $L^\infty_T(B^s_{2,r})$ norm to the unique solution of the Burgers equation as $\alpha\rightarrow 0$. Contrary to this result, the present study demonstrates that for initial data $u_0\in B^s_{2,\infty}(\R)$ the solutions of the Camassa-Holm equation fail to converge strongly in the $L^\infty_T(B^s_{2,\infty})$ norm to the Burgers equation as $\alpha\rightarrow 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. In this article we establish an $L^p$-Hodge decomposition theorem on sub-Riemannian compact contact manifolds without boundary, related to the Rumin complex of differential forms. Given an $L^p$- Rumin's form, we adopt an approach in the spirit of Morrey's book to obtain a decomposition with higher regular ``primitives'' i.e. that belong to suitable Sobolev classes. Our proof relies on recent results obtained in [4] and [6].</description>

      <title>Riemann-Hilbert problems for bi-axially symmetric null-solutions to iterated perturbed Dirac equations in R^n</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses Riemann-Hilbert boundary value problems (RHBVPs) for null solutions to iterated perturbed Dirac operators over bi-axially symmetric domains in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with Clifford-algebra-valued variable coefficients. We first resolve the unperturbed case of poly-monogenic functions, i.e., null solutions to iterated Dirac operators, by constructing explicit solutions via a bi-axially adapted Almansi-type decomposition, decoupling hierarchical structures through recursive integral operators. Then, generalizing to vector wave number-perturbed iterated Dirac operators, we extend the decomposition to manage spectral anisotropy while preserving symmetry constraints, ensuring regularity under Clifford-algebraic parameterizations. As a key application, closed-form solutions to the Schwarz problem are derived, demonstrating unified results across classical and higher-dimensional settings. The interplay of symmetry, decomposition, and perturbation theory establishes a cohesive framework for higher-order boundary value challenges in Clifford analysis.</description>

      <title>Semilinear Equations Including the Mixed Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local and global existence of solutions to a semilinear evolution equation driven by a mixed local-nonlocal operator of the form \( L = -\Delta + (-\Delta)^{\alpha/2} \), where \( 0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 2 \). The Cauchy problem under consideration is \begin{equation*} \partial_t u + t^\beta L u = -h(t) u^p, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^N, \quad t &gt; 0, \end{equation*} with nonnegative initial data \( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \). We establish the existence and uniqueness of local solutions in \( L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^N) \) using a contraction mapping argument. Furthermore, we analyze conditions for global existence, proving that solutions remain globally bounded in time under appropriate assumptions on the parameters \( \beta \), \( p \), and the function \( h(t) \).</description>

      <title>Attractors for Singular-Degenerate Porous Medium Type Equations Arising in Models for Biofilm Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time behaviour of solutions of a class of singular-degenerate porous medium type equations in bounded Lipschitz domains with mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions. The existence of global attractors is shown under very general assumptions. Assuming, in addition, that solutions are globally H\"older continuous and the reaction terms satisfy a suitable sign condition in the vicinity of the degeneracy, we also prove the existence of an exponential attractor, which, in turn, yields the finite fractal dimension of the global attractor. Moreover, we extend the results for scalar equations to systems where the degenerate equation is coupled to a semilinear reaction-diffusion equation. The study of such systems is motivated by models for biofilm growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove variational instability for small-amplitude solutions to the periodic irrotational gravity water wave problem in finite depth. Our results are based on a reformation of the water wave problem as a pseudo-differential Euler-Lagrange equation together with the local existence theory of small-amplitude waves. We use a perturbative spectral analysis of the second-variation operator in combination with a Plotnikov transformation to show instability for non-trivial solutions.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the sine-Gordon equation on tadpole graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the dynamics of solutions to the sine-Gordon equation posed on a tadpole graph $G$ and endowed with boundary conditions at the vertex of $\delta$-type. The latter generalize conditions of Neumann-Kirchhoff type. The purpose of this analysis is to establish an instability result for a certain family of stationary solutions known as \emph{single-lobe kink state profiles}, which consist of a periodic, symmetric, concave stationary solution in the finite (periodic) lasso of the tadpole, coupled with a decaying kink at the infinite edge of the graph. It is proved that such stationary profile solutions are linearly (and nonlinearly) unstable under the flow of the sine-Gordon model on the graph. The extension theory of symmetric operators, Sturm-Liouville oscillation results and analytic perturbation theory of operators are fundamental ingredients in the stability analysis. The local well-posedness of the sine-Gordon model in an appropriate energy space is also established. The theory developed in this investigation constitutes the first stability result of stationary solutions to the sine-Gordon equation on a tadpole graph.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of geometry on semilinear elliptic equations of bistable or nonlinear-field type in unbounded domains. We discover a surprising dichotomy between epigraphs that are bounded from below and those that contain a cone of aperture greater than $\pi$: the former admit at most one positive bounded solution, while the latter support infinitely many. Nonetheless, we show that every epigraph admits at most one strictly stable solution. To prove uniqueness, we strengthen the method of moving planes by decomposing the domain into one region where solutions are stable and another where they enjoy a form of compactness. Our construction of many solutions exploits a connection with Delaunay surfaces in differential geometry, and extends to all domains containing a suitably wide cone, including exterior domains.</description>

      <title>Normal conformal metrics with prescribed $Q$-Curvature in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the $Q$-curvature equation \begin{equation}\label{0.1} (-\Delta)^n u = K(x)e^{2nu}\quad\text{in} ~\mathbb{R}^{2n} \ (n \geq 2) \end{equation} where $K$ is a given non constant continuous function. Under mild growth control on $K$, we get a necessary condition on the total curvature $\Lambda_u$ for any normal conformal metric $g_u = e^{2u}|dx|^2$ satisfying $Q_{g_u} = K$ in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, or equivalently, solutions to equation with logarithmic growth at infinity. Inversely, when $K$ is nonpositive satisfying polynomial growth control, we show the existence of normal conformal metrics with quasi optimal range of total curvature and precise asymptotic behavior at infinity. If furthermore $K$ is radial symmetric, we establish the same existence result without any growth assumption on $K$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the motion of an inextensible hanging string of finite length under the action of the gravity. The motion is governed by nonlinear and nonlocal hyperbolic equations, which is degenerate at the free end of the string. We show that the initial boundary value problem to the equations of motion is well-posed locally in time in weighted Sobolev spaces at the quasilinear regularity threshold under a stability condition. This paper is a continuation of our preceding articles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Euclidean setting, Napoleon's Theorem states that if one constructs an equilateral triangle on either the outside or the inside of each side of a given triangle and then connects the barycenters of those three new triangles, the resulting triangle happens to be equilateral. The case of spherical triangles has been recently shown to be different: on the sphere, besides equilateral triangles, a necessary and sufficient condition for a given triangle to enjoy the above Napoleonic property is that its congruence class should lie on a suitable surface (namely, an ellipsoid in suitable coordinates). In this article we show that the hyperbolic case is significantly different from both the Euclidean and the spherical setting. Specifically, we establish here that the hyperbolic plane does not admit any Napoleonic triangle, except the equilateral ones. Furthermore, we prove that iterated Napoleonization of any triangle causes it to become smaller and smaller, more and more equilateral and converge to a single point in the limit.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove global well-posedness for the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation for periodic initial data in the mass-critical dimension $d=2$ for initial data of arbitrary size in the defocusing case and data below the ground state threshold in the focusing case. The result is based on a new inverse Strichartz inequality, which is proved by using incidence geometry and additive combinatorics, in particular the inverse theorems for Gowers uniformity norms by Green-Tao-Ziegler. This allows to transfer the analogous results of Dodson for the non-periodic mass-critical NLS to the periodic setting. In addition, we construct an approximate periodic solution which implies sharpness of the results.</description>

      <title>Qualitative quasi-invariance of low regularity Gaussian measures for the 1d quintic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the 1d quintic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) on the torus with initial data distributed according to the Gaussian measures with covariance operator $(1-\Delta)^{-s}$, and denoted $\mu_s$. For the full range $s&gt;\frac{9}{10}$, we prove that these Gaussian measures are quasi-invariant along the flow of (NLS), meaning that the law of the solution at any time is absolutely continuous with respect to the initial Gaussian measure. Moreover, the condition $s&gt;\frac{9}{10}$ corresponds to the threshold where the Sobolev space $H^{\frac{2}{5}+}(\mathbb{T})$ is of $\mu_s$-full measure (it is of zero $\mu_s$-measure otherwise). This is the lower regularity Sobolev space where we currently know that (NLS) is globally well-posed, thanks to a work by LI-WU-XU. The present work extends the known threshold $s&gt;\frac{3}{2}$ for the quasi-invariance down to $s&gt;\frac{9}{10}$, but we do not obtain here quantitative results on the Radon-Nikodym derivatives. Our approach is based on a work of Sun-Tzvetkov, combining a Poincar\'e-Dulac normal form reduction with energy estimates. However, our main tool to obtain these energy estimates differs: we use the Bou\'e-Dupuis variational formula instead of Wiener Chaos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a model for the spread and (de)differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and chondrocytes in a scaffold whose fibers are coated with hyaluron. The chondrocytes produce new extracellular matrix, which, together with hyaluron, serves as haptotactic cue for the stem cell migration. We prove global existence of weak solutions of the corresponding cross-diffusion system with double haptotaxis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the global existence of weak solutions of the one-dimensional Navier-Stokes-Korteweg (NSK) equations when the viscosity and the capillarity coefficients are power functions of the density, which may be zero on a set with positive measure. The proofs are based on a truncation argument combined with the Energy estimate and BD Entropy. Notably, we do not require any upper bound on the exponent of the power of the viscosity coefficient. In particular, we are able to consider very degenerate viscosity coefficient and to substantially improve previous results.</description>

      <title>A hyperbolic model for two-layer thin film flow with a perfectly soluble anti-surfactant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the motion of a two-phase thin film that consists of two immiscible viscous fluids and is endowed with an anti-surfactant solute. The presence of such solute particles induces variations of the surface tension and interfacial stress and can drive a Marangoni-type flow. We first analyze a lubrication limit and derive one-dimensional evolution equations of film heights and solute concentrations. Then, under the assumption that the capillarity and diffusion effects are negligible and the solute is perfectly soluble, we obtain a conservative first-order system in terms of film heights and concentration gradients. This reduced system is found to be strictly hyperbolic for a certain set of states and to admit an entire class of entropy/entropy-flux pairs. We also provide a strictly convex entropy for the hyperbolic system. Thus, the well-posedness for the Cauchy problem is given. Moreover, the system is almost a Temple-class system which allows to provide explicit solutions of the Riemann problem. The paper concludes with some numerical experiments using a Godunov-type finite volume method which relies on the exact Riemann solver.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give direct proofs and constructions of the trace and extension theorems for Sobolev mappings in $W^{1, 1} (M, N)$, where $M$ is Riemannian manifold with compact boundary $\partial M$ and $N$ is a complete Riemannian manifold. The analysis is also applicable to halfspaces and strips. The extension is based on a tiling the domain of the considered applications by suitably chosen dyadic cubes to construct the desired extension. Along the way, we obtain asymptotic characterizations of the $L^1$-energy of mappings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a passive scalar equation on the two-dimensional torus, where the advecting velocity field is given by a cellular flow with a randomly moving center. We prove that the passive scalar undergoes mixing at a deterministic exponential rate, independent of any underlying diffusivity. Furthermore, we show that the velocity field enhances dissipation and we establish sharp decay rates that, for large times, are deterministic and remain uniform in the diffusivity constant. Our approach is purely Eulerian and relies on a suitable modification of Villani's hypocoercivity method.</description>

      <title>Viscosity Solutions in Non-commutative Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by parallels between mean field games and random matrix theory, we develop stochastic optimal control problems and viscosity solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi equations in the setting of non-commutative variables. Rather than real vectors, the inputs to the equation are tuples of self-adjoint operators from a tracial von Neumann algebra. The individual noise from mean field games is replaced by a free semi-circular Brownian motion, which describes the large-$n$ limit of Brownian motion on the space of self-adjoint matrices. We introduce a classical common noise from mean field games into the non-commutative setting as well, allowing the problems to combine both classical and non-commutative randomness.</description>

      <title>Entropic Selection Principle for Monge's Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the small regularization limit of entropic optimal transport when the cost function is the Euclidean distance in dimensions $d &gt; 1$, and the marginal measures are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Our results establish that the limiting optimal transport plan is supported on transport rays. Furthermore, within each transport ray, the limiting transport plan uniquely minimizes a relative entropy functional with respect to specific reference measures supported on the rays. This provides a complete and unique characterization of the limiting transport plan. While similar results have been obtained for $d = 1$ in \cite{Marino} and for discrete measures in \cite{peyr\'e2020computationaloptimaltransport}, this work resolves the previously open case in higher dimensions $d&gt;1.$</description>

Abstract: In this paper we provide a new solution of the classical black box problem (the discrete Calderon problem) in the theory of circular electrical networks. Our approach is based on the explicit embedding of electrical networks into non-negative Grassmannians and generalized chamber ansatz for it. Additionally, we reveal the relationship of this problem with combinatorial properties of spanning groves and the theory of the totally non-negative matrices.

      <title>Splitting finite element approximations for quasi-static electroporoelasticity equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electroporoelasticity model, which couples Maxwell's equations with Biot's equations, plays a critical role in applications such as water conservancy exploration, earthquake early warning, and various other fields. This work focuses on investigating its well-posedness and analyzing error estimates for a splitting backward Euler finite element method. We first define a weak solution consistent with the finite element framework. Then, we prove the uniqueness and existence of such a solution using the Galerkin method and derive a priori estimates for high-order regularity. Using a splitting technique, we define an approximate splitting solution and analyze its convergence order. Next, we apply Nedelec's curl-conforming finite elements, Lagrange elements, and the backward Euler method to construct a fully discretized scheme. We demonstrate the stability of the splitting numerical solution and provide error estimates for its convergence order in both temporal and spatial variables. Finally, we present numerical experiments to validate the theoretical results, showing that our method significantly reduces computational complexity compared to the classical finite element method.</description>

      <title>On the functional Minkowski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To every log-concave function $f$ one may associate a pair of measures $(\mu_{f},\nu_{f})$ which are the surface area measures of $f$. These are a functional extension of the classical surface area measure of a convex body, and measure how the integral $\int f$ changes under perturbations. The functional Minkowski problem then asks which pairs of measures can be obtained as the surface area measures of a log-concave function. In this work we fully solve this problem.
  Furthermore, we prove that the surface area measures are continuous in correct topology: If $f_{k}\to f$, then $\left(\mu_{f_{k}},\nu_{f_{k}}\right)\to\left(\mu_{f},\nu_{f}\right)$ in the appropriate sense. Finding the appropriate mode of convergence of the pairs $\left(\mu_{f_{k}},\nu_{f_{k}}\right)$ sheds a new light on the construction of functional surface area measures. To prove this continuity theorem we associate to every convex function a new type of radial function, which seems to be an interesting construction on its own right.
  Finally, we prove that the solution to functional Minkowski problem is continuous in the data, in the sense that if $\left(\mu_{f_{k}},\nu_{f_{k}}\right)\to\left(\mu_{f},\nu_{f}\right)$ then $f_{k}\to f$ up to translations.</description>

Abstract: A rooted network consists of a connected, locally finite graph G, equipped with edge conductances and a distinguished vertex o. A nonnegative function on the vertices of G which vanishes at o, has Laplacian 1 at o, and is harmonic at all other vertices is called a potential. We prove that every infinite recurrent rooted network admits a potential tending to infinity. This is an analogue of classical theorems due to Evans and Nakai in the settings of Euclidean domains and Riemannian surfaces.</description>

      <title>The multilinear fractional sparse operator theory II: refining weighted estimates via multilinear stochastic fractional sparse forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building upon our study of the sparse bounds of generalized commutators of multilinear fractional singular integral operators in \cite{CenSong2412}, this paper seeks to further refine the main results presented in \cite{CenSong2412} in the following key aspects. Firstly, we replace pointwise domination with ($m+1$)-linear stochastic fractional reducing sparse form ${\mathcal B}_{\alpha(\eta) ,\mathcal{S},\tau,\tau',{\vec r},t}^\mathbf{b,k}$, thus providing a new approach to the vector-valued multilinear stochastic fractional sparse domination principle. Additionally, the conditions required for this result are relaxed from multilinear weak type boundedness in \cite{CenSong2412} to multilinear locally weak type boundedness $W_{\vec{p}, q}(X)$, which allows us to extend the main ideas from Lerner \cite{Lerner2019} (2019) and Lorist et al. \cite{Lorist2024} (2024). Secondly, and more importantly, we move away from the original techniques of quantitatively estimating multilinear stochastic fractional sparse operators ${\mathcal A}_{\alpha(\eta),\mathcal{S},\tau,{\vec{r}},t}^\mathbf{b,k,t}$, and instead employ a more powerful multilinear fractional \( \vec{r} \)-type maximal operator $\mathscr{M}_{\alpha(\eta),\vec{r}}$. This necessitates the development of a new class of multilinear fractional weights $ A_{(\vec{p},q),(\vec{r}, s)}(X)$ to quantitatively characterize this maximal operator, followed by revealing the norm equivalence between this maximal operator and the sparse forms introduced earlier, thereby generalizing part of the ideas of Nieraeth \cite{Nier2019} (2019). ......</description>

      <title>Time-Global Regularity of the Navier-Stokes System with Hyper-Dissipation--Turbulent Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.05692v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The question of whether the hyper-dissipative (HD) Napier-Stokes (NS) system can exhibit spontaneous formation of singularities in the super-critical regime--the hyper-diffusion being generated by a fractional power of the Laplacian, say $\beta$, confined to interval $\bigl(1, \frac{5}{4}\bigr)$--has been a major open problem in the mathematical fluid dynamics since the foundational work of J.L. Lions in 1960s. In this work, an evidence of criticality of the Laplacian is presented, more precisely, a class of plausible blow-up scenarios is ruled out as soon as $\beta$ is greater than one. While the framework is based on the scale of sparseness of the super-level sets of the positive and negative parts of the components of the higher-order derivatives of the velocity recently introduced by the authors, a major novelty in the current work is classification of the HD flows near a potential spatiotemporal singularity in two main categories, homogeneous (the case consistent with a near-steady behavior) and non-homogenous (the case consistent with the formation and decay of turbulence). The main theorem states that in the non-homogeneous case any $\beta$ greater than one prevents a singularity. In order to illustrate the impact of this result in a methodology-free setting, a two-parameter family of dynamically rescaled blow-up profiles is considered, and it is shown that as soon as $\beta$ is greater than one, a new region in the parameter space is ruled out. More importantly, the region is a neighborhood (in the parameter space) of the self-similar profile, i.e., the approximately self-similar blow-up, a prime suspect in possible singularity formation, is ruled out for all HD NS models.</description>

Abstract: We explore recent progress and open questions concerning local minima and saddle points of the Cahn--Hilliard energy in $d\geq 2$ and the critical parameter regime of large system size and mean value close to $-1$. We employ the String Method of E, Ren, and Vanden-Eijnden -- a numerical algorithm for computing transition pathways in complex systems -- in $d=2$ to gain additional insight into the properties of the minima and saddle point. Motivated by the numerical observations, we adapt a method of Caffarelli and Spruck to study convexity of level sets in $d\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>On small breathers of nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations via exponentially small homoclinic splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.14566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Breathers are nontrivial time-periodic and spatially localized solutions of nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations (PDEs). Families of breathers have been found for certain integrable PDEs but are believed to be rare in non-integrable ones such as nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations. In this paper we show that small amplitude breathers of \emph{any} temporal frequency do not exist for semilinear Klein-Gordon equations with generic analytic odd nonlinearities.
  A breather with small amplitude exists only when its temporal frequency is close to be resonant with the linear Klein-Gordon dispersion relation. Our main result is that, for such frequencies, we rigorously identify the leading order term in the exponentially small (with respect to the small amplitude) obstruction to the existence of small breathers in terms of the so-called \emph{Stokes constant}, which depends on the nonlinearity analytically, but is independent of the frequency. This gives a rigorous justification of a formal asymptotic argument by Kruskal and Segur \cite{KS87} in the analysis of small breathers.
  We rely on the spatial dynamics approach where breathers can be seen as homoclinic orbits. The birth of such small homoclinics is analyzed via a singular perturbation setting where a Bogdanov-Takens type bifurcation is coupled to infinitely many rapidly oscillatory directions. The leading order term of the exponentially small splitting between the stable/unstable invariant manifolds is obtained through a careful analysis of the analytic continuation of their parameterizations. This requires the study of another limit equation in the complexified evolution variable, the so-called \emph{inner equation}.</description>

      <title>Multiple positive solutions for a double phase system with singular nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01319v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of double phase systems which contain the singular and mixed nonlinear terms. Unlike the single equation, the mixed nonlinear terms make the problem more complicate. The geometry of the fibering mapping has multiple possibilities. To overcome the difficulties posed by the mixed nonlinear terms, we need to repeatedly construct concave functions, discuss different cases, and use the properties of concave functions and basic inequalities such as H\"{o}lder inequality, Poincar\'{e}'s inequality and Young's inequality. By the use of the Nehari manifold, the existence and multiplicity of positive solutions which have nonnegative energy are obtained.</description>

      <title>From Hamiltonian Systems to Compressible Euler Equation driven by additive H\"older noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive stochastic compressible Euler Equation from a Hamiltonian microscopic dynamics. We consider systems of interacting particles with H\"older noise and potential whose range is large in comparison with the typical distance between neighbouring particles. It is shown that the empirical measures associated to the position and velocity of the system converge to the solutions of compressible Euler equations driven by additive H\"older path(noise), in the limit as the particle number tends to infinity, for a suitable scaling of the interactions. Furthermore, explicit rates for the convergence are obtained in Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. Our proof is based on the It\^o-Wentzell-Kunita formula for Young integral.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the linear Zakharov--Kuznetsov equation with periodic boundary conditions. Employing some tools from the nonharmonic Fourier series we obtain several internal observability theorems. Then we prove various exact controllability and rapid uniform stabilization results by applying a duality principle and a general feedback construction. The method presented here introduces a new insight into the control of dispersive equations in two-dimensional cases and may be adapted to more general equations.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of Leray's flux problem for the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations in a multiply-connected planar domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The steady motion of a viscous incompressible fluid in a multiply-connected, planar, bounded domain (perforated with a large number of small holes) is modeled through the Navier-Stokes equations with non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary data satisfying the general outflow condition. Under either a symmetry assumption on the data or under a smallness condition on each of the boundary fluxes (therefore, no constraints on the magnitude of the boundary velocity are imposed), we apply the classical energy method in homogenization theory and study the asymptotic behavior of the solutions to this system as the size of the perforations goes to zero: it is shown that the effective equations remain unmodified in the limit. The main novelty of the present work lies in the obtainment of the required uniform bounds, which are achieved by a contradiction argument based on Bernoulli's law for solutions of the stationary Euler equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Steady incompressible potential flows of an inviscid or viscous fluid are considered in infinite N-dimensional cylinders with tangential boundary conditions. We show that such flows, if away from stagnation, are constant and parallel to the direction of the cylinder. This means equivalently that a harmonic function whose gradient is bounded away from zero in an infinite cylinder with Neumann boundary conditions is an affine function. The proof of this rigidity result uses a combination of ODE and PDE arguments, respectively for the streamlines of the flow and the harmonic potential function.</description>

Abstract: We use the methods of commutator and fundamental solutions to establish averaging lemmas and hypoelliptic estimates for purely kinetic transport equations. Assuming certain amount of velocity regularity for solutions, we extend our analysis using the commutator method to derive the averaging and hypoelliptic regularity properties for kinetic equations in the presence of general inhomogeneous fluxes. These results find applications in the study of hypoelliptic advection-diffusion equations and kinetic formulations of hyperbolic conservation laws including Burgers' equation with transport and isentropic gas dynamics.</description>

Abstract: With a mere usage of well-established properties of para-differential operators, the conjugacy equations in several model KAM problems are converted to para-homological equations solvable by standard fixed point argument. Such discovery greatly simplifies KAM proofs, renders the traditional KAM iteration steps unnecessary, and may suggest a systematic scheme of finding quasi-periodic solutions of realistic magnitude.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this note is to demonstrate that as soon as the hyper-diffusion exponent is greater than one, a class of finite time blow-up scenarios consistent with the analytic structure of the flow (prior to the possible blow-up time) can be ruled out. The argument is self-contained, in spirit of the regularity theory of the hyper-dissipative Navier-Stokes system in turbulent regime developed by Grujic and Xu.</description>

      <title>Unconditional deep-water limit of the intermediate long wave equation in low-regularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the unconditional deep-water limit of the intermediate long wave equation (ILW) to the Benjamin-Ono equation (BO) in low-regularity Sobolev spaces on both the real line and the circle. Our main tool is new unconditional uniqueness results for ILW in $H^s$ when $s_0&lt;s\leq \frac 14$ on the line and $s_0&lt;s&lt; \frac 12$ on the circle, where $s_0 = 3-\sqrt{33/4}\approx 0.1277$. Here, we adapt the strategy of Mo\c{s}incat-Pilod (2023) for BO to the setting of ILW by viewing ILW as a perturbation of BO and making use of the smoothing property of the perturbation term.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness for Fractional Reaction-Diffusion Systems with Mass Dissipation in $\mathbb R^N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global existence of bounded solutions to reaction-diffusion systems with fractional diffusion in the whole space $\mathbb R^N$ is investigated. The systems are assumed to preserve the non-negativity of initial data and to dissipate total mass. We first show that if the nonlinearities are at most quadratic then there exists a unique global bounded solution regardless of the fractional order. This is done by combining a regularizing effect of the fractional diffusion operator and the H\"older continuity of a non-local inhomogeneous parabolic equation. When the nonlinearities might be super-quadratic, but satisfy some intermediate sum conditions, we prove the global existence of bounded solutions by adapting the well-known duality methods to the case of fractional diffusion. In this case, the order of the intermediate sum conditions depends on the fractional order. These results extend the existing theory for mass dissipated reaction-diffusion systems to the case of non-local diffusion and unbounded domains.</description>

Abstract: We show that spinor systems with scalar self-interaction, such as the Dirac--Klein--Gordon system with Yukawa coupling or the Soler model, generically have bi-frequency solitary wave solutions. We develop the approach to stability properties of such waves and use the radial reduction to show that indeed the (linear) stability is available for a wide range of parameters. We show that only bi-frequency modes can be dynamically stable and suggest that stable bi-frequency modes can serve as storages of the Dark Matter. The approach is based on linear stability results of one-frequency solitary waves in (3+1)D Soler model, which we obtain as a by-product.</description>

      <title>An inverse problem in cell dynamics: Recovering an initial distribution of telomere lengths from measurements of senescence times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Telomeres are repetitive sequences situated at both ends of the chromosomes of eukaryotic cells. At each cell division, they are eroded until they reach a critical length that triggers a state in which the cell stops to divide: the senescent state. In this work, we are interested in the link between the initial distribution of telomere lengths and the distribution of senescence times. We propose a method to retrieve the initial distribution of telomere lengths, using only measurements of senescence times. Our approach relies on approximating our models with transport equations, which provide natural estimators for the initial telomere lengths distribution. We investigate this method from a theoretical point of view by providing bounds on the errors of our estimators, pointwise and in all Lebesgue spaces. We also illustrate it with estimations on simulations, and discuss its limitations related to the curse of dimensionality.</description>

We show that the relevant $L^p\to L^q$ Fourier extension inequality possesses extremals for all exponents $p\in[1,2]$. Moreover, for all $p\in(1,2]$, the corresponding $L^p$-extremal sequences are precompact up to symmetries.</description>

      <title>Control of Instability in a Vlasov-Poisson System Through an External Electric Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasma instabilities are a major concern in plasma science, for applications ranging from particle accelerators to nuclear fusion reactors. In this work, we consider the possibility of controlling such instabilities by adding an external electric field to the Vlasov--Poisson equations. Our approach to determining the external electric field is based on conducting a linear analysis of the resulting equations. We show that it is possible to select external electric fields that completely suppress the plasma instabilities present in the system when the equilibrium distribution and the perturbation are known. In fact, the proposed strategy returns the plasma to its equilibrium with a rate that is faster than exponential in time. We further perform numerical simulations of the nonlinear two-stream and bump-on-tail instabilities to verify our theory and to compare the different strategies that we propose in this work.</description>

      <title>On the total surface area of potato packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that if we fill without gaps a bag with infinitely many potatoes, in such a way that they touch each other in few points, then the total surface area of the potatoes must be infinite. In this context potatoes are measurable subsets of the Euclidean space, the bag is any open set of the same space. As we show, this result also holds in the general context of doubling (even locally) metric measure spaces satisfying Poincar\'e inequality, in particular in smooth Riemannian manifolds and even in some sub-Riemannian spaces.</description>

      <title>Commutator Estimates and Quantitative Local Weyl's Law for Schr\"odinger Operators with Non-Smooth Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze semi-classical Schr\"odinger operators with potentials of class $C^{1,1/2}$ and establish commutator estimates for the associated projection operators in Schatten norms. These are then applied to prove quantitative versions of the local and phase space Weyl laws in $L^p$ spaces. We study both non-interacting, and interacting particle systems. In particular, we are able to treat the case of the minimizers of the Hartree energy in the case of repulsive singular pair interactions such as the Coulomb potential.</description>

      <title>A symmetric boundary integral formulation for time-domain acoustic-elastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A symmetric boundary integral formulation for the transient scattering of acoustic waves off homogeneous elastic obstacles is analyzed. Both the acoustic scattered field and the elastodynamic excited field are represented through a direct integral representation, resulting in a coupled system of interior/exterior integral equations that is symmetrized through the introduction of an auxiliary mortar variable. The analysis of each system and of its Galerkin discretization is done through the passage to the Laplace domain, which allows for the use of convolution quadrature for time discretization. Since the operators of the acustic and elastic Calder\'on calculus appear independently of each other, the formulation is well suited for non-intrusive numerical impementations (i.e. existing codes for acoustic and elastic problems can be used without any modification). Numerical examples are provided for two-dimensional examples.</description>

      <title>Generalized Harnack Inequality for Mean Curvature Flow and Ancient Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to relax convexity assumption on some classical results in mean curvature flow. In the first half of the paper, we prove a generalized version of Hamilton's differential Harnack inequality which holds for mean convex solutions to mean curvature flow with a lower bound on $\frac{\lambda_1}{H}$ where $\lambda_1$ is the smallest principal curvature. Then, we use classical maximum principle to provide several characterizations of family of shrinking spheres for closed, mean convex ancient solution to mean curvature flow with a lower bound on $\frac{\lambda_1 + .. + \lambda_k}{H}$ for some $1 \leq k \leq d-1$, where $\lambda_1 \leq \lambda_2 \leq .. \leq \lambda_d$ are the principal curvatures.</description>

      <title>Approximation theorems for stochastic differential equations concerning weak solutions with the spatial variable involved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Watanabe's textbook, a classical approximation result indicates that if a solution exists to a stochastic differential equation, then by an approximation of the Wiener process, a sequence of solutions converges to the solution of the stochastic differential equation in probability. In the traditional approximation theorem, solutions do not contain the spatial variable. When consider the solution to a stochastic differential equation a weak one with the spatial variable involved, we may not be able to directly apply this classical approximation result. In this work, we try to extend the existing approximation result from Watanabe's textbook to the case when the solution of the stochastic differential equation a weak one with the spatial variable involved. We show that in this case, the approximation result still holds.</description>
