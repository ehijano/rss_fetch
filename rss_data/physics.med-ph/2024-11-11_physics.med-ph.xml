      <title>Considerations and recommendations from the ISMRM Diffusion Study Group for preclinical diffusion MRI: Part 3 -- Ex vivo imaging: data processing, comparisons with microscopy, and tractography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preclinical diffusion MRI (dMRI) has proven value in methods development and validation, characterizing the biological basis of diffusion phenomena, and comparative anatomy. While dMRI enables in vivo non-invasive characterization of tissue, ex vivo dMRI is increasingly being used to probe tissue microstructure and brain connectivity. Ex vivo dMRI has several experimental advantages that facilitate high spatial resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) images, cutting-edge diffusion contrasts, and direct comparison with histological data as a methodological validation. However, there are a number of considerations that must be made when performing ex vivo experiments. The steps from tissue preparation, image acquisition and processing, and interpretation of results are complex, with many decisions that not only differ dramatically from in vivo imaging of small animals, but ultimately affect what questions can be answered using the data. This work concludes a 3-part series of recommendations and considerations for preclinical dMRI. Herein, we describe best practices for dMRI of ex vivo tissue, with a focus on image pre-processing, data processing and model fitting, and tractography. In each section, we attempt to provide guidelines and recommendations, but also highlight areas for which no guidelines exist (and why), and where future work should lie. We end by providing guidelines on code sharing and data sharing, and point towards open-source software and databases specific to small animal and ex vivo imaging.</description>

      <title>Intra-operative Optimal Flow Diverter Selection for Intracranial aneurysm treatment using Angiographic parametric imaging: Feasibility study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During intracranial aneurysm (IA) treatment with Diverters (FDs), the device/parent artery diameters ratio may influence the ability of the device to induce aneurysm healing response. Oversized FDs are safer to deploy but may not induce enough hemodynamic resistance to ensure aneurysm occlusion. Methods based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) could allow optimal device selection but are time-consuming and inadequate for intra-operative guidance. To address this limitation, we propose to investigate a method for optimal FD selection using Angiographic Parametric Imaging (API) and machine learning (ML). We selected 128 pre-treatment angiographic sequences of IAs which demonstrated full occlusion at six months follow-up. For each IA, we extracted five API parameters from the aneurysm dome and normalized them to the feeding artery corresponding parameters. We dichotomized the dataset based on the FD/ proximal artery diameter ratio as undersized, if the ratio&lt;1 or if multiple FDs were used and oversized otherwise. Single API parameter and ML analysis were used to determine whether API parameters could be used to determine the need for FD under-sizing (i.e., increased flow resistance). Classification accuracy was assessed using area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUROC). In total we identified 51 and 77 cases for the undersized and oversized cohorts respectively. Single API parameter analysis yielded an inadequate AUROC ~0.5 while machine learning using all five API parameters yielded and AUROC of 0.72.</description>

      <title>In-Silico Analysis of Curve Fitting in Angiographic Parametric Imaging in Intracranial Aneurysms to Reduce Patient and Interventionalist-Induced Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Angiographic Parametric Imaging (API), accurate estimation of parameters from Time Density Curves (TDC) is crucial. However, these estimations are often marred by errors arising from factors such as patient motion, procedural preferences, image noise, and injection variability. While fitting methods like gamma-variate fitting offer a solution to recover incomplete or corrupted TDC data, they might also introduce unforeseen biases. This study investigates the trade-offs and benefits of employing gamma-variate fitting on virtual angiograms to enhance the precision of API biomarkers. Utilizing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in patient specific 3D geometries, we generated a series of high-definition virtual angiograms at distinct inlet velocities: 0.25m/s, 0.35m/s, and 0.45m/s. These velocities were investigated across injection durations ranging from 0.5s to 2.0s. From these angiograms, TDCs for aneurysms and their corresponding inlets were constructed. To emulate typical clinical challenges, we introduced noise, simulated patient motion, and generated temporally incomplete data sets. These modified TDCs underwent gamma-variate fitting. We quantified both the original and fitted TDC curves using standard angiography metrics such as Cross-Correlation (Cor), Time to Peak (TTP), Mean Transit Time (MTT), Peak Height (PH), Area Under the Curve (AUC), and Maximum Gradient (Max-Gr) for a comprehensive comparison. TDCs enhanced by gamma-variate fitting exhibited a robust correlation with vascular flow dynamics. Our results affirm that gamma-variate fitting can adeptly restore TDCs from fragmentary sequences, elevating the precision of derived API parameters.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Whole-Body PET Image Denoising Using 3D Diffusion Models with ControlNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a vital imaging modality widely used in clinical diagnosis and preclinical research but faces limitations in image resolution and signal-to-noise ratio due to inherent physical degradation factors. Current deep learning-based denoising methods face challenges in adapting to the variability of clinical settings, influenced by factors such as scanner types, tracer choices, dose levels, and acquisition times. In this work, we proposed a novel 3D ControlNet-based denoising method for whole-body PET imaging. We first pre-trained a 3D Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) using a large dataset of high-quality normal-dose PET images. Following this, we fine-tuned the model on a smaller set of paired low- and normal-dose PET images, integrating low-dose inputs through a 3D ControlNet architecture, thereby making the model adaptable to denoising tasks in diverse clinical settings. Experimental results based on clinical PET datasets show that the proposed framework outperformed other state-of-the-art PET image denoising methods both in visual quality and quantitative metrics. This plug-and-play approach allows large diffusion models to be fine-tuned and adapted to PET images from diverse acquisition protocols.</description>
