      <title>FinLlama: Financial Sentiment Classification for Algorithmic Trading Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are multiple sources of financial news online which influence market movements and trader's decisions. This highlights the need for accurate sentiment analysis, in addition to having appropriate algorithmic trading techniques, to arrive at better informed trading decisions. Standard lexicon based sentiment approaches have demonstrated their power in aiding financial decisions. However, they are known to suffer from issues related to context sensitivity and word ordering. Large Language Models (LLMs) can also be used in this context, but they are not finance-specific and tend to require significant computational resources. To facilitate a finance specific LLM framework, we introduce a novel approach based on the Llama 2 7B foundational model, in order to benefit from its generative nature and comprehensive language manipulation. This is achieved by fine-tuning the Llama2 7B model on a small portion of supervised financial sentiment analysis data, so as to jointly handle the complexities of financial lexicon and context, and further equipping it with a neural network based decision mechanism. Such a generator-classifier scheme, referred to as FinLlama, is trained not only to classify the sentiment valence but also quantify its strength, thus offering traders a nuanced insight into financial news articles. Complementing this, the implementation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning through LoRA optimises trainable parameters, thus minimising computational and memory requirements, without sacrificing accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate the ability of the proposed FinLlama to provide a framework for enhanced portfolio management decisions and increased market returns. These results underpin the ability of FinLlama to construct high-return portfolios which exhibit enhanced resilience, even during volatile periods and unpredictable market events.</description>

      <title>Blockchain scaling and liquidity concentration on decentralized exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17742v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquidity providers (LPs) on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) can protect themselves from adverse selection risk by updating their positions more frequently. However, repositioning is costly, because LPs have to pay gas fees for each update. We analyze the causal relation between repositioning and liquidity concentration around the market price, using the entry of blockchain scaling solutions, Arbitrum and Polygon, as our instruments. Lower gas fees on scaling solutions allow LPs to update more frequently than on Ethereum. Our results demonstrate that higher repositioning intensity and precision lead to greater liquidity concentration, which benefits small trades by reducing their slippage.</description>

      <title>Residual U-net with Self-Attention to Solve Multi-Agent Time-Consistent Optimal Trade Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of a deep residual U-net with self-attention to solve the the continuous time time-consistent mean variance optimal trade execution problem for multiple agents and assets. Given a finite horizon we formulate the time-consistent mean-variance optimal trade execution problem following the Almgren-Chriss model as a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. The HJB formulation is known to have a viscosity solution to the unknown value function. We reformulate the HJB to a backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) to extend the problem to multiple agents and assets. We utilize a residual U-net with self-attention to numerically approximate the value function for multiple agents and assets which can be used to determine the time-consistent optimal control. In this paper, we show that the proposed neural network approach overcomes the limitations of finite difference methods. We validate our results and study parameter sensitivity. With our framework we study how an agent with significant price impact interacts with an agent without any price impact and the optimal strategies used by both types of agents. We also study the performance of multiple sellers and buyers and how they compare to a holding strategy under different economic conditions.</description>
