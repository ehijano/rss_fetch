      <title>A correspondence between proximity homomorphisms and certain frame maps via a comonad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit the proximity frames and proximity homomorphisms as a Kleisli category of a comonad whose underlying functor takes a proximity frame to its frame of round ideals. This construction is known in the literature as {\em stable compactification} (\cite{BezHar2}). We show that the frame of round ideals naturally carries with it two proximities of interest from which two comonads are induced.</description>

      <title>Chain projection ordered categories and DRC-restriction semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a theory of chain projection ordered categories and generalize that of chain projection ordered groupoids developed by East and Azeef Muhammed recently. By using chain projection ordered categories, we obtain a structure theorem for DRC-restriction semigroups. More specifically, we prove that the category of DRC-restriction semigroups together with (2,1,1)-homomorphisms is isomorphic to the category of chain projection ordered categories together with chain projection ordered functors. Moreover, some special cases are also considered. As applications of the main theorem, we demonstrate that the existence of free projection-generated DRC-restriction semigroups associated to any strong two-sided projection algebra and reobtain the structures of projection-fundamental DRC-restriction semigroups. Our work may be regarded as an answer for the fourth problem proposed by East and Azeef Muhammed in [Advances in Mathematics, 437 (2024) 109447].</description>

      <title>Moduli stacks of quiver bundles with applications to Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a general method for constructing moduli stacks whose points are diagrams of vector bundles over a fixed base, indexed by a fixed simplicial set -- that is, quiver bundles of a fixed shape. We discuss some constraints on the base for these moduli stacks to be algebraic and observe that a large class of interesting schemes satisfy these constraints. Using this construction, we provide an alternate construction of moduli stacks of Higgs bundles along with a proof of algebraicity following readily from the algebraicity of moduli stacks of quiver bundles. One feature of our approach is that, for each of the moduli stacks we discuss, there are algebraic moduli stacks parametrizing morphisms of the objects being classified. We discuss some potential applications of this in categorifying non-abelian Hodge theory in a sense we will make precise. We also discuss potential applications of our methods and perspectives to the subjects of quiver modifications, abstract moduli theory, and homotopy theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.03858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue to develop the theory of separable higher categories, including center functors, higher centralizers, modular extensions and group theoretical higher fusion categories. Moreover, we outline a theory of orthogonal higher categories to treat anti-unitary symmetries. Using these results we derive a systematic classification of gapped quantum liquids and predict many new SPT orders in spacetime dimension $\ge3$.</description>

      <title>Building pretorsion theories from torsion theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Torsion theories play an important role in abelian categories and they have been widely studied in the last sixty years. In recent years, with the introduction of pretorsion theories, the definition has been extended to general (non-pointed) categories. Many examples have been investigated in several different contexts, such as topological spaces and topological groups, internal preorders, preordered groups, toposes, V-groups, crossed modules, etc. In this paper, we show that pretorsion theories naturally appear also in the "classical" framework, namely in abelian categories. We propose two ways of obtaining pretorsion theories starting from torsion theories. The first one uses "comparable" torsion theories, while the second one extends a torsion theory with a Serre subcategory. We also give a universal way of obtaining a torsion theory from a given pretorsion theory in additive categories. We conclude by providing several applications in module categories, internal groupoids, recollements and representation theory.</description>

      <title>Rich doctrines and Henkin's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find a possible interpretation of Henkin's Theorem in the language of existential implicational doctrines. Under some smallness assumption, starting from an implicational existential doctrine, with non-trivial fibers, we construct a new doctrine which is rich -- meaning that for every formula $\varphi(x)$ there is a constant $c$ such that $\exists x\varphi(x)$ has the same truth-value of $\varphi(c)$ -- and consistent. To obtain this result, we add a suitable amount of constants and axioms to the starting doctrine. We then show that a rich consistent doctrine admits an appropriate morphism towards the doctrine of subsets -- a model. Henkin's Theorem for doctrines follows from these two results, modeling our proof on the main lines of the original theorem.</description>

      <title>Many-valued coalgebraic logic over semi-primal varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14581v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study many-valued coalgebraic logics with semi-primal algebras of truth-degrees. We provide a systematic way to lift endofunctors defined on the variety of Boolean algebras to endofunctors on the variety generated by a semi-primal algebra. We show that this can be extended to a technique to lift classical coalgebraic logics to many-valued ones, and that (one-step) completeness and expressivity are preserved under this lifting. For specific classes of endofunctors, we also describe how to obtain an axiomatization of the lifted many-valued logic directly from an axiomatization of the original classical one. In particular, we apply all of these techniques to classical modal logic.</description>

      <title>Constructing a fully homomorphic encryption scheme with the Yoneda Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper redefines the foundations of asymmetric cryptography's homomorphic cryptosystems through the application of the Yoneda Lemma. It explicitly illustrates that widely adopted systems, including ElGamal, RSA, Benaloh, Regev's LWE, and NTRUEncrypt, directly derive from the principles of the Yoneda Lemma. This synthesis gives rise to a holistic homomorphic encryption framework named the Yoneda Encryption Scheme. Within this scheme, encryption is elucidated through the bijective maps of the Yoneda Lemma Isomorphism, and decryption seamlessly follows from the naturality of these maps. This unification suggests a conjecture for a unified model theory framework, providing a basis for reasoning about both homomorphic and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes. As a practical demonstration, the paper introduces an FHE scheme capable of processing arbitrary finite sequences of encrypted multiplications and additions without the need for additional tweaking techniques, such as squashing or bootstrapping. This not only underscores the practical implications of the proposed theoretical advancements but also introduces new possibilities for leveraging model theory and forcing techniques in cryptography to facilitate the design of FHE schemes.</description>
