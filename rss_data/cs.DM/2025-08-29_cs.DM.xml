      <title>Unclustered BWTs of any Length over Non-Binary Alphabets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for every integer $n &gt; 0$ and for every alphabet $\Sigma_k$ of size $k \geq 3$, there exists a necklace of length $n$ whose Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is completely unclustered, i.e., it consists of exactly $n$ runs with no two consecutive equal symbols. These words represent the worst-case behavior of the BWT for clustering, since the number of BWT runs is maximized. We also establish a lower bound on their number. This contrasts with the binary case, where the existence of infinitely many completely unclustered BWTs is still an open problem, related to Artin's conjecture on primitive roots.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Soft Happiness via Evolutionary Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $0\leq \rho\leq 1$, a $\rho$-happy vertex $v$ in a coloured graph shares colour with at least $\rho\mathrm{deg}(v)$ of its neighbours. Soft happy colouring of a graph $G$ with $k$ colours extends a partial $k$-colouring to a complete vertex $k$-colouring such that the number of $\rho$-happy vertices is maximum among all such colouring extensions. The problem is known to be NP-hard, and an optimal solution has a direct relation with the community structure of the graph. In addition, some heuristics and local search algorithms, such as {\sf Local Maximal Colouring} ({\sf LMC}) and {\sf Local Search} ({\sf LS}), have already been introduced in the literature. In this paper, we design Genetic and Memetic Algorithms for soft happy colouring and test them for a large set of randomly generated partially coloured graphs. Memetic Algorithms yield a higher number of $\rho$-happy vertices, but Genetic Algorithms can perform well only when their initial populations are locally improved by {\sf LMC} or {\sf LS}. Statistically significant results indicate that both Genetic and Memetic Algorithms achieve high average accuracy in community detection when their initial populations are enhanced using {\sf LMC}. Moreover, among the competing methods, the evolutionary algorithms identified the greatest number of complete solutions.</description>

      <title>Measuring Ransomware Lateral Movement Susceptibility via Privilege-Weighted Adjacency Matrix Exponentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ransomware impact hinges on how easily an intruder can move laterally and spread to the maximum number of assets. We present a graph-theoretic method to measure lateral-movement susceptibility and estimate blast radius. We build a directed multigraph where vertices represent assets and edges represent reachable services (e.g., RDP/SSH) between them. We model lateral movement as a probabilistic process using a pivot potential factor $\pi(s)$ for each service. This allows us to iteratively compute a $K$-hop compromise probability matrix that captures how compromise propagates through the network. Metrics derived from this model include: (1) Lateral-Movement Susceptibility (LMS$_K$): the average probability of a successful lateral movement between any two assets (0-1 scale); and (2) Blast-Radius Estimate (BRE$_K$): the expected percentage of assets compromised in an average attack scenario. Interactive control (SSH 22, RDP 3389) gets higher $\pi(s)$ than app-only ports (MySQL 3306, MSSQL 1433), which seldom enable pivoting without an RCE. Across anonymized enterprise snapshots, pruning high-$\pi(s)$ edges yields the largest LMS$_K$/BRE$_K$ drop, aligning with CISA guidance, MITRE ATT\&amp;CK (TA0008: Lateral Movement), and NIST SP~800-207. The framework evaluates (micro)segmentation and helps prioritize controls that reduce lateral movement susceptibility and shrink blast radius.</description>

      <title>Delta-system method: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1960 Erd\H os and Rado published a paper that, in retrospect, became one of the most influential papers in extremal set theory. They proved a result of Ramsey theoretic flavour, stating that in any sufficiently large family of sets of bounded size there is a homogeneous substructure, called a $\Delta$-system (also known under the name of a sunflower). For many qualitative results in Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science, this has become a very powerful tool to analyze complex set families. Extremal set theory flourished in the 1970's--80's, and many exciting developments happened then. One of them was the development of the $\Delta$-system method in the works of Frankl and F\"uredi. In this survey, we try to give a concise picture of this method starting from its early stages and to the modern day. We also tried to present the proofs of most of the key results. On top of this, we survey the literature on the problems that the Delta-systems was applied to.</description>

      <title>Universal vulnerability in strong modular networks with various degree distributions between inequality and equality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generally, networks are classified into two sides of inequality and equality with respect to the number of links at nodes by the types of degree distributions. One side includes many social, technological, and biological networks which consist of a few nodes with many links, and many nodes with a few links, whereas the other side consists of all nodes with an equal number of links. In comprehensive investigations between them, we have found that, as a more equal network, the tolerance of whole connectivity is stronger without fragmentation against the malfunction of nodes in a wide class of randomized networks. However, we newly find that all networks which include typical well-known network structures between them become extremely vulnerable, if a strong modular (or community) structure is added with commonalities of areas, interests, religions, purpose, and so on. These results will encourage avoiding too dense unions by connecting nodes and taking into account the balanced resource allocation between intra- and inter-links of weak communities. We must reconsider not only efficiency but also tolerance against attacks or disasters, unless no community that is really impossible.</description>

      <title>Sharp Online Hardness for Large Balanced Independent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic problem of finding large $\gamma$-balanced independent sets in dense random bipartite graphs; an independent set is $\gamma$-balanced if a $\gamma$ proportion of its vertices lie on one side of the bipartition. In the sparse regime, Perkins and Wang established tight bounds within the low-degree polynomial (LDP) framework, showing a factor-$1/(1-\gamma)$ statistical-computational gap via the Overlap Gap Property (OGP) framework tailored for stable algorithms. However, these techniques do not appear to extend to the dense setting. For the related large independent set problem in dense random graph, the best known algorithm is an online greedy procedure that is inherently unstable, and LDP algorithms are conjectured to fail even in the "easy" regime where greedy succeeds. We show that the largest $\gamma$-balanced independent set in dense random bipartite graphs has size $\alpha:=\frac{\log_b n}{\gamma(1-\gamma)}$ whp, where $n$ is the size of each bipartition, $p$ is the edge probability, and $b=1/(1-p)$. We design an online algorithm that achieves $(1-\epsilon)(1-\gamma)\alpha$ whp for any $\epsilon&gt;0$. We complement this with a sharp lower bound, showing that no online algorithm can achieve $(1+\epsilon)(1-\gamma)\alpha$ with nonnegligible probability. Our results suggest that the same factor-$1/(1-\gamma)$ gap is also present in the dense setting, supporting its conjectured universality. While the classical greedy procedure on $G(n,p)$ is straightforward, our algorithm is more intricate: it proceeds in two stages, incorporating a stopping time and suitable truncation to ensure that $\gamma$-balancedness-a global constraint-is met despite operating with limited information. Our lower bound utilizes the OGP framework; we build on a recent refinement of this framework for online models and extend it to the bipartite setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computers and algorithms play an ever-increasing role in obtaining new results in graph theory. In this survey, we present a broad range of techniques used in computer-assisted graph theory, including the exhaustive generation of all pairwise non-isomorphic graphs within a given class, the use of searchable databases containing graphs and invariants as well as other established and emerging algorithmic paradigms. We cover approaches based on mixed integer linear programming, semidefinite programming, dynamic programming, SAT solving, metaheuristics and machine learning. The techniques are illustrated with numerous detailed results covering several important subareas of graph theory such as extremal graph theory, graph coloring, structural graph theory, spectral graph theory, regular graphs, topological graph theory, special sets in graphs, algebraic graph theory and chemical graph theory. We also present some smaller new results that demonstrate how readily a computer-assisted graph theory approach can be applied once the appropriate tools have been developed.</description>

      <title>Vertex-Based Localization of generalized Tur\'{a}n Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of graphs. A graph is called $\mathcal{F}$-free if it does not contain any member of $\mathcal{F}$. Generalized Tur\'{a}n problems aim to maximize the number of copies of a graph $H$ in an $n$-vertex $\mathcal{F}$-free graph. This maximum is denoted by $ex(n, H, \mathcal{F})$. When $H \cong K_2$, it is simply denoted by $ex(n,F)$. Erd\H{o}s and Gallai established the bounds $ex(n, P_{k+1}) \leq \frac{n(k-1)}{2}$ and $ex(n, C_{\geq k+1}) \leq \frac{k(n-1)}{2}$. This was later extended by Luo \cite{luo2018maximum}, who showed that $ex(n, K_s, P_{k+1}) \leq \frac{n}{k} \binom{k}{s}$ and $ex(n, K_s, C_{\geq k+1}) \leq \frac{n-1}{k-1} \binom{k}{s}$. Let $N(G,K_s)$ denote the number of copies of $K_s$ in $G$. In this paper, we use the vertex-based localization framework, introduced in \cite{adak2025vertex}, to generalize Luo's bounds. In a graph $G$, for each $v \in V(G)$, define $p(v)$ to be the length of the longest path that contains $v$. We show that \[N(G,K_s) \leq \sum_{v \in V(G)} \frac{1}{p(v)+1}{p(v)+1\choose s} = \frac{1}{s}\sum_{v \in V(G)}{p(v) \choose s-1}\] We strengthen the cycle bound from \cite{luo2018maximum} as follows: In graph $G$, for each $v \in V(G)$, let $c(v)$ be the length of the longest cycle that contains $v$, or $2$ if $v$ is not part of any cycle. We prove that \[N(G,K_s) \leq \left(\sum_{v\in V(G)}\frac{1}{c(v)-1}{c(v) \choose s}\right) - \frac{1}{c(u)-1}{c(u) \choose s}\] where $c(u)$ denotes the circumference of $G$. We provide full proofs for the cases $s = 1$ and $s \geq 3$, while the case $s = 2$ follows from the result in \cite{adak2025vertex}. \newline Furthermore, we characterize the class of extremal graphs that attain equality for these bounds.</description>

      <title>Localized Clique Bounds in Bounded-Degree and Bounded-Path Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of graphs. A graph is said to be $\mathcal{F}$-free if it contains no member of $\mathcal{F}$. The generalized Tur\'{a}n number $ex(n,H,\mathcal{F})$ denotes the maximum number of copies of a graph $H$ in an $n$-vertex $\mathcal{F}$-free graph, while the generalized edge Tur\'{a}n number $mex(m,H,\mathcal{F})$ denotes the maximum number of copies of $H$ in an $m$-edge $\mathcal{F}$-free graph.
  It is well known that if a graph has maximum degree $d$, then it is $K_{1,d+1}$-free. Wood \cite{wood} proved that $ex(n,K_t,K_{1,d+1}) \leq \frac{n}{d+1}\binom{d+1}{t}$. More recently, Chakraborty and Chen \cite{CHAKRABORTI2024103955} established analogous bounds for graphs with bounded maximum path length: $mex(m,K_t,P_{r+1}) \leq \frac{m}{\binom{r}{2}}\binom{r}{t}$.
  In this paper, we improve these bounds using the localization technique, based on suitably defined local parameters. Furthermore, we characterize the extremal graphs attaining these improved bounds.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm for Healthcare Workforce Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Workforce scheduling in the healthcare sector is a significant operational challenge, characterized by fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills, and the critical need to control labor costs while upholding high standards of patient care. This problem is inherently multi-objective, demanding a delicate balance between competing goals: minimizing payroll, ensuring adequate staffing for patient needs, and accommodating staff preferences to mitigate burnout. We propose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models the hospital unit workforce scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization task. Our model incorporates real-world complexities, including hourly appointment-driven demand and the use of modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. By defining objective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction, the GA navigates the vast search space to identify a set of high-quality, non-dominated solutions. Demonstrated on datasets representing a typical hospital unit, the results show that our MOO-GA generates robust and balanced schedules. On average, the schedules produced by our algorithm showed a 66\% performance improvement over a baseline that simulates a conventional, manual scheduling process. This approach effectively manages trade-offs between critical operational and staff-centric objectives, providing a practical decision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators.</description>

      <title>An algorithm for accurate and simple-looking metaphorical maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: "Metaphorical maps" or "contact representations" are visual representations of vertex-weighted graphs that rely on the geographic map metaphor. The vertices are represented by countries, the weights by the areas of the countries, and the edges by contacts/ boundaries among them. The accuracy with which the weights are mapped to areas and the simplicity of the polygons representing the countries are the two classical optimization goals for metaphorical maps. Mchedlidze and Schnorr [Metaphoric Maps for Dynamic Vertex-weighted Graphs, EuroVis 2022] presented a force-based algorithm that creates metaphorical maps that balance between these two optimization goals. Their maps look visually simple, but the accuracy of the maps is far from optimal - the countries' areas can vary up to 30% compared to required. In this paper, we provide a multi-fold extension of the algorithm in [Metaphoric Maps for Dynamic Vertex-weighted Graphs, EuroVis 2022]. More specifically:
  1. Towards improving accuracy: We introduce the notion of region stiffness and suggest a technique for varying the stiffness based on the current pressure of map regions.
  2. Towards maintaining simplicity: We introduce a weight coefficient to the pressure force exerted on each polygon point based on whether the corresponding point appears along a narrow passage.
  3. Towards generality: We cover, in contrast to [Metaphoric Maps for Dynamic Vertex-weighted Graphs, EuroVis 2022], non-triangulated graphs. This is done by either generating points where more than three regions meet or by introducing holes in the metaphorical map.
  We perform an extended experimental evaluation that, among other results, reveals that our algorithm is able to construct metaphorical maps with nearly perfect area accuracy with a little sacrifice in their simplicity.</description>

      <title>Strong Sparsification for 1-in-3-SAT via Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new notion of sparsification, called \emph{strong sparsification}, in which constraints are not removed but variables can be merged. As our main result, we present a strong sparsification algorithm for 1-in-3-SAT. The correctness of the algorithm relies on establishing a sub-quadratic bound on the size of certain sets of vectors in $\mathbb{F}_2^d$. This result, obtained using the recent \emph{Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa Theorem} (Gowers, Green, Manners and Tao, Ann. Math. 2025), could be of independent interest. As an application, we improve the state-of-the-art algorithm for approximating linearly-ordered colourings of 3-uniform hypergraphs (H{\aa}stad, Martinsson, Nakajima and{\v{Z}}ivn{\'{y}}, APPROX 2024).</description>

      <title>On the complexity of constrained reconfiguration and motion planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coordinating the motion of multiple agents in constrained environments is a fundamental challenge in robotics, motion planning, and scheduling. A motivating example involves $n$ robotic arms, each represented as a line segment. The objective is to rotate each arm to its vertical orientation, one at a time (clockwise or counterclockwise), without collisions nor rotating any arm more than once. This scenario is an example of the more general $k$-Compatible Ordering problem, where $n$ agents, each capable of $k$ state-changing actions, must transition to specific target states under constraints encoded as a set $\mathcal{G}$ of $k$ pairs of directed graphs.
  We show that $k$-Compatible Ordering is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete, even when $\mathcal{G}$ is planar, degenerate, or acyclic. On the positive side, we provide polynomial-time algorithms for cases such as when $k = 1$ or $\mathcal{G}$ has bounded treewidth. We also introduce generalized variants supporting multiple state-changing actions per agent, broadening the applicability of our framework. These results extend to a wide range of scheduling, reconfiguration, and motion planning applications in constrained environments.</description>
