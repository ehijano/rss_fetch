      <title>NAZM: Network Analysis of Zonal Metrics in Persian Poetic Tradition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study formalizes a computational model to simulate classical Persian poets' dynamics of influence through constructing a multi-dimensional similarity network. Using a rigorously curated dataset based on Ganjoor's corpus, we draw upon semantic, lexical, stylistic, thematic, and metrical features to demarcate each poet's corpus. Each is contained within weighted similarity matrices, which are then appended to generate an aggregate graph showing poet-to-poet influence. Further network investigation is carried out to identify key poets, style hubs, and bridging poets by calculating degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector, and Katz centrality measures. Further, for typological insight, we use the Louvain community detection algorithm to demarcate clusters of poets sharing both style and theme coherence, which correspond closely to acknowledged schools of literature like Sabk-e Hindi, Sabk-e Khorasani, and the Bazgasht-e Adabi phenomenon. Our findings provide a new data-driven view of Persian literature distinguished between canonical significance and interextual influence, thus highlighting relatively lesser-known figures who hold great structural significance. Combining computational linguistics with literary study, this paper produces an interpretable and scalable model for poetic tradition, enabling retrospective reflection as well as forward-looking research within digital humanities.</description>

      <title>Community Detection on Noisy Stochastic Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of community detection in noisy stochastic block models. We focus on two types of noise: (1) geometric noise where a latent-space kernel affects edge formation, and (2) Erdos-Renyi model censoring where edges are masked independently. We present a new algorithm DuoSpec that de-noises the network to a pristine stochastic block model structure for better community recovery. We demonstrate on synthetic data that our algorithm outperforms existing community detection methods on noisy models. We test our algorithm on the Amazon metadata dataset and demonstrate strong results on community detection.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Information Diffusion Beyond Explicit Social Ties: A Study of Implicit-Link Diffusion on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information diffusion on social media platforms is often assumed to occur primarily through explicit social connections, such as follower or friend relationships. However, information frequently propagates beyond these observable ties -- via external websites, search engines, or algorithmic recommendations -- forming implicit links between users who are not directly connected. Despite their potential impact, the mechanisms and characteristics of such implicit-link diffusion remain underexplored. In this study, we investigate the dynamics of nontrivial information diffusion mediated by implicit links on Twitter, using four large-scale datasets. We define implicit-link diffusion as the reposting of content by users who are not explicitly connected to the original poster. Our analysis reveals that users located farther from the original source in the social network are more likely to engage in diffusion through implicit links, suggesting that such links often arise from sources outside direct social relationships. Moreover, while implicit links contribute less to the overall diffusion size than explicit links, they play a distinct role in disseminating content across diverse and topologically distant communities. We further identify user groups who predominantly engage in diffusion through either explicit or implicit links, and demonstrate that the choice of diffusion channel exhibits strong patterns of social homophily. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating implicit-link dynamics into models of information diffusion and social influence.</description>

      <title>A political cartography of news sharing: Capturing story, outlet and content level of news circulation on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: News sharing on digital platforms shapes the digital spaces millions of users navigate. Trace data from these platforms also enables researchers to study online news circulation. In this context, research on the types of news shared by users of differential political leaning has received considerable attention. We argue that most existing approaches (i) rely on an overly simplified measurement of political leaning, (ii) consider only the outlet level in their analyses, and/or (iii) study news circulation among partisans by making ex-ante distinctions between partisan and non-partisan news. In this methodological contribution, we introduce a research pipeline that allows a systematic mapping of news sharing both with respect to source and content. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate insights that otherwise remain unnoticed: Diversification of news sharing along the second political dimension; topic-dependent sharing of outlets; some outlets catering different items to different audiences.</description>

      <title>The Truth Becomes Clearer Through Debate! Multi-Agent Systems with Large Language Models Unmask Fake News</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's digital environment, the rapid propagation of fake news via social networks poses significant social challenges. Most existing detection methods either employ traditional classification models, which suffer from low interpretability and limited generalization capabilities, or craft specific prompts for large language models (LLMs) to produce explanations and results directly, failing to leverage LLMs' reasoning abilities fully. Inspired by the saying that "truth becomes clearer through debate," our study introduces a novel multi-agent system with LLMs named TruEDebate (TED) to enhance the interpretability and effectiveness of fake news detection. TED employs a rigorous debate process inspired by formal debate settings. Central to our approach are two innovative components: the DebateFlow Agents and the InsightFlow Agents. The DebateFlow Agents organize agents into two teams, where one supports and the other challenges the truth of the news. These agents engage in opening statements, cross-examination, rebuttal, and closing statements, simulating a rigorous debate process akin to human discourse analysis, allowing for a thorough evaluation of news content. Concurrently, the InsightFlow Agents consist of two specialized sub-agents: the Synthesis Agent and the Analysis Agent. The Synthesis Agent summarizes the debates and provides an overarching viewpoint, ensuring a coherent and comprehensive evaluation. The Analysis Agent, which includes a role-aware encoder and a debate graph, integrates role embeddings and models the interactions between debate roles and arguments using an attention mechanism, providing the final judgment.</description>

      <title>Structural-Temporal Coupling Anomaly Detection with Dynamic Graph Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting anomalous edges in dynamic graphs is an important task in many applications over evolving triple-based data, such as social networks, transaction management, and epidemiology. A major challenge with this task is the absence of structural-temporal coupling information, which decreases the ability of the representation to distinguish anomalies from normal instances. Existing methods focus on handling independent structural and temporal features with embedding models, which ignore the deep interaction between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose a structural-temporal coupling anomaly detection architecture with a dynamic graph transformer model. Specifically, we introduce structural and temporal features from two integration levels to provide anomaly-aware graph evolutionary patterns. Then, a dynamic graph transformer enhanced by two-dimensional positional encoding is implemented to capture both discrimination and contextual consistency signals. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art models. Finally, a case study illustrates the strength of our method when applied to a real-world task.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Meet Stance Detection: A Survey of Tasks, Methods, Applications, Challenges and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stance detection is essential for understanding subjective content across various platforms such as social media, news articles, and online reviews. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized stance detection by introducing novel capabilities in contextual understanding, cross-domain generalization, and multimodal analysis. Despite these progressions, existing surveys often lack comprehensive coverage of approaches that specifically leverage LLMs for stance detection. To bridge this critical gap, our review article conducts a systematic analysis of stance detection, comprehensively examining recent advancements of LLMs transforming the field, including foundational concepts, methodologies, datasets, applications, and emerging challenges. We present a novel taxonomy for LLM-based stance detection approaches, structured along three key dimensions: 1) learning methods, including supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, and zero-shot; 2) data modalities, such as unimodal, multimodal, and hybrid; and 3) target relationships, encompassing in-target, cross-target, and multi-target scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation techniques and analyze benchmark datasets and performance trends, highlighting the strengths and limitations of different architectures. Key applications in misinformation detection, political analysis, public health monitoring, and social media moderation are discussed. Finally, we identify critical challenges such as implicit stance expression, cultural biases, and computational constraints, while outlining promising future directions, including explainable stance reasoning, low-resource adaptation, and real-time deployment frameworks. Our survey highlights emerging trends, open challenges, and future directions to guide researchers and practitioners in developing next-generation stance detection systems powered by large language models.</description>

      <title>Big Data and the Computational Social Science of Entrepreneurship and Innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large-scale social data explode and machine-learning methods evolve, scholars of entrepreneurship and innovation face new research opportunities but also unique challenges. This chapter discusses the difficulties of leveraging large-scale data to identify technological and commercial novelty, document new venture origins, and forecast competition between new technologies and commercial forms. It suggests how scholars can take advantage of new text, network, image, audio, and video data in two distinct ways that advance innovation and entrepreneurship research. First, machine-learning models, combined with large-scale data, enable the construction of precision measurements that function as system-level observatories of innovation and entrepreneurship across human societies. Second, new artificial intelligence models fueled by big data generate 'digital doubles' of technology and business, forming laboratories for virtual experimentation about innovation and entrepreneurship processes and policies. The chapter argues for the advancement of theory development and testing in entrepreneurship and innovation by coupling big data with big models.</description>

      <title>Pay Attention: a Call to Regulate the Attention Market and Prevent Algorithmic Emotional Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last 70 years, we, humans, have created an economic market where attention is being captured and turned into money thanks to advertising. During the last two decades, leveraging research in psychology, sociology, neuroscience and other domains, Web platforms have brought the process of capturing attention to an unprecedented scale. With the initial commonplace goal of making targeted advertising more effective, the generalization of attention-capturing techniques and their use of cognitive biases and emotions have multiple detrimental side effects such as polarizing opinions, spreading false information and threatening public health, economies and democracies. This is clearly a case where the Web is not used for the common good and where, in fact, all its users become a vulnerable population. This paper brings together contributions from a wide range of disciplines to analyze current practices and consequences thereof. Through a set of propositions and principles that could be used do drive further works, it calls for actions against these practices competing to capture our attention on the Web, as it would be unsustainable for a civilization to allow attention to be wasted with impunity on a world-wide scale.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of Collective Creativity in Human-AI Hybrid Societies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI is shaping an increasingly hybrid society, where ideas and cultural artefacs are created both by humans and intelligent machines. Human creativity is influenced in complex, nonlinear ways by the actions of AI-driven agents within their social networks, but these influences are difficult to measure using traditional methods. This study examines how human-AI interactions shape the evolution of collective creation within large-scale social network experiments, where human and AI participants collectively create stories. Participants (either humans or AI) joined 5x5 grid-based networks in which stories were selected, modified, and shared over many iterations. Initially, AI-only networks showed greater creativity (rated by a separate group of human raters) and collective diversity of stories than human-only and human-AI networks. However, over time, hybrid human-AI networks became more diverse in their creations than AI-only networks. In part, this is because AI agents retained little from the original stories, while human-only networks preserved continuity. These findings highlight the value of experimental social networks in understanding human-AI hybrid societies.</description>

      <title>Just Another Hour on TikTok: Reverse-engineering unique identifiers to obtain a complete slice of TikTok</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TikTok is now a massive platform, and has a deep impact on global events. But for all the preliminary studies done on it, there are still issues with determining fundamental characteristics of the platform. We develop a method to extract a representative sample from a specific time range on TikTok, and use it to collect &gt;99% of posts from a full hour on the platform, alongside a dataset of &gt;99% of posts from a single minute from each hour of a day. Through this, we obtain post metadata, video media data, and comments from a close to complete slice of TikTok. Using this dataset, we report the critical statistics of the platform, notably estimating a total of 269 million posts produced on the day we looked at on TikTok, that 18% of videos on the platform feature children, and that ~176 years of videos are uploaded every day.</description>

      <title>Behavioral and Topological Heterogeneities in Network Versions of Schelling's Segregation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05623v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agent-based models of residential segregation have been of persistent interest to various research communities since their origin with James Sakoda and popularization by Thomas Schelling. Frequently, these models have sought to elucidate the extent to which the collective dynamics of individual preferences may cause segregation to emerge. This open question has sustained relevance in U.S. jurisprudence. Previous investigation of heterogeneity of behaviors (preferences) has shown reductions in segregation. Meanwhile, previous investigation of heterogeneity of social network topologies has shown no significant impact to observed segregation levels. In the present study, we examined the effects of the concurrent presence of both behavioral and topological heterogeneities in network segregation models. Simulations were conducted using both homogeneous and heterogeneous preference models on 2D lattices with varied levels of densification to create topological heterogeneities (i.e., clusters, hubs). Results show a richer variety of outcomes, including novel differences in resultant segregation levels and hub composition. Notably, with concurrent increased representations of heterogeneous preferences and heterogeneous topologies, reduced levels of segregation emerge. Simultaneously, we observe a novel dynamic of segregation between tolerance levels as highly tolerant nodes take residence in dense areas and push intolerant nodes to sparse areas mimicking the urban-rural divide.</description>
