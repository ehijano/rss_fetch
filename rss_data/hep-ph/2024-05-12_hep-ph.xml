      <title>BBN catalysis by doubly charged particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider primordial nucleosynthesis in the presence of hypothetical quasi-stable doubly charged particles. Existence of $X^{--}$ with macroscopic lifetimes will lead to the formation of its bound states with $^4$He and other light elements, significantly facilitating the subsequent formation of lithium nuclei. From observational constraints on maximum allowable amount of lithium, that we update in this work, we derive strong constraints on the abundance and lifetime of $X^{--}$. In a likely cosmological freeze-out scenario with temperatures initially exceeding the mass of $X^{--}$, the BBN constrains the lifetime of these particles to be less than about 100 seconds. For parametrically long lifetimes, lithium abundance data constrain $X^{--}$ abundance to be less than $10^{-9}$ relative to protons, regardless of whether these particles decay or remain stable. Stable particles could saturate the dark matter density only if their mass is comparable to or in excess of $10^{10}$ GeV, and most of $X^{--}$ will be found in bound states with beryllium nuclei, so that chemically they would appear as abnormally heavy helium isotopes.</description>

      <title>Hunting a charged Higgs boson pair in proton-proton collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the production and the possible detection of a charged scalar Higgs pair $H^-H^+$ decaying into a final state $\mu\nu_{\mu}cb$ in proton-proton collisions, i.e, $pp\to H^- H^+\to \mu\nu_{\mu} cb$. These charged scalars are predicted in the Two-Higgs Doublet Model of type III (2HDM-III), particularly we analyze masses of such a particle of the order of the top quark mass. The analysis is applied to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and its next step, the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). As a test and validation of the model, we identify regions of the 2HDM-III parameter space that accommodate the current excess of events at $3\sigma$ in the process $\mathcal{BR}(t\to H^{\pm}b)\times \mathcal{BR}(H^{\pm}\to cb)$ for $M_{H^{\pm}}=130$ GeV reported by ATLAS collaboration. Additional experimental constraints are also included. Based on it, we propose realistic scenarios that could be brought to experimental scrutiny at the LHC and HL-LHC. Assuming the best scenario, we predict a signal significance of $5\sigma$ for the charged scalar boson mass $M_{H^{\pm}}$ in the $120-240$ GeV interval.</description>

      <title>Searches for the BSM scenarios at the LHC using decision tree based machine learning algorithms: A comparative study and review of Random Forest, Adaboost, XGboost and LightGBM frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms are now being extensively used in our daily lives, spanning across diverse industries as well as academia. In the field of high energy physics (HEP), the most common and challenging task is separating a rare signal from a much larger background. The boosted decision tree (BDT) algorithm has been a cornerstone of the high energy physics for analyzing event triggering, particle identification, jet tagging, object reconstruction, event classification, and other related tasks for quite some time. This article presents a comprehensive overview of research conducted by both HEP experimental and phenomenological groups that utilize decision tree algorithms in the context of the Standard Model and Supersymmetry (SUSY). We also summarize the basic concept of machine learning and decision tree algorithm along with the working principle of \texttt{Random Forest}, \texttt{AdaBoost} and two gradient boosting frameworks, such as \texttt{XGBoost}, and \texttt{LightGBM}. Using a case study of electroweakino productions at the high luminosity LHC, we demonstrate how these algorithms lead to improvement in the search sensitivity compared to traditional cut-based methods in both compressed and non-compressed R-parity conserving SUSY scenarios. The effect of different hyperparameters and their optimization, feature importance study using SHapley values are also discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>First Radial Excitations of Mesons and Diquarks in a Contact Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a calculation for the masses of the first radially excited states of forty mesons and diquarks made up of $u,d,s,c$ and $b$ quarks, including states that contain one or both heavy quarks. To this end, we employ a combined analysis of the Bethe-Salpeter and Schwinger-Dyson equations within a self-consistent and symmetry preserving vector-vector contact interaction. The same set of parameters describe ground and excited states of mesons and their diquark partners. The wave-function of the first radial excitation contains a zero whose location is correlated with an additional parameter $d_F$ which is a function of dressed quark masses. Our results satisfy the equal spacing rules given by the Gell-Mann Okubo mass relations. Wherever possible, we make comparisons of our findings with known experimental observations as well as theoretical predictions of several other models and approaches including lattice quantum chromodynamics, finding a very good agreement. We report predictions for a multitude of radial excitations not yet observed in experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study thermal freeze-out in the \textit{dark axion portal} - an axion coupling to the dark photon and photon - considering the dark photon as the lightest stable particle, thereby a dark matter candidate. We pay special attention to the coscattering regime, founding viable DM scenarios fulfilling the correct relic abundance. Furthermore, we explore the prospects of having the axion as a long-lived particle, possibly to be observed at the LHC and future detectors.</description>

      <title>Leptophilic Portals to New Physics at Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observed neutrino oscillations imply that the global lepton flavor symmetry of the Standard Model must be broken. Therefore, searches for lepton flavor violation (LFV) are promising probes of new physics beyond the Standard Model. High-energy colliders provide a powerful tool to study LFV effects, which are complementary to the low-energy charged LFV searches. Here we discuss the possibility of LFV signals at colliders arising from exotic Higgs decays, and from leptophilic scalar and vector portal scenarios.</description>

      <title>Flavor dependent Critical endpoint from holographic QCD through machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QCD phase diagram in the $T - \mu$ plane and the equation of state for pure gluon, 2-flavor, 2+1-flavor systems, and 2+1+1-flavor systems have been investigated using the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) framework at finite temperature and chemical potential. By inputting lattice QCD data for the equation of state and baryon susceptibility at zero chemical potential into holographic model, all the parameters can be determined with the aid of machine learning algorithms. Our findings indicate that the deconfinement phase transition is of first order for the pure gluon system with critical temperature $T_c = 0.265 \rm GeV$ at vanishing chemical potential. The phase transition for the 2-flavor, 2+1-flavor systems, and 2+1+1-flavor systems are crossover at vanishing chemical potential and first-order at high chemical potential, and the critical endpoint(CEP) in the $T - \mu$ plane locates at ($\mu_B^c$=0.46 GeV, $T^c$=0.147 GeV), ($\mu_B^c$ = 0.74 GeV, $T^c$ = 0.094 GeV), and ($\mu_B^c$= 0.87 GeV,$T^c$ = 0.108 GeV), respectively. Additionally, the thermodynamic quantities of the system for different flavors at finite chemical potential are presented in this paper. It is observed that the difference between the 2+1 flavor and 2+1+1 flavor systems is invisible at vanishing chemical potential and low temperature. The location of CEP for 2+1+1 flavor system deviates explicitly from that of the 2+1 flavor system with the increase of chemical potential. Both 2+1 flavor and 2+1+1 flavor systems differ significantly from the 2-flavor system.</description>

      <title>Minimal Dark Matter Freeze-in with Low Reheating Temperatures and Implications for Direct Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the reheating temperature of the visible sector on the freeze-in dark matter (DM) benchmark model for direct detection experiments, where DM production is mediated by an ultralight dark photon. Here we consider a new regime for this benchmark: we take the initial temperature of the thermal Standard Model (SM) bath to be below the DM mass. The production rate from the SM bath is drastically reduced due to Boltzmann suppression, necessitating a significant increase in the portal coupling between DM and the SM to match the observed relic DM abundance. This enhancement in coupling strength increases the predicted DM-electron scattering cross section, making freeze-in DM more accessible to current direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of critical fluctuations in hadronic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical phenomena in phase transitions of strongly interacting matter, governed by quantum chromodynamics, are inherently encoded in the fluctuations of conserved charges. In this work, we study the net-baryon number density fluctuations, including the lowest-lying nucleon and the baryonic resonance $\Delta(1232)$, based on the parity doublet model in the mean-field approximation. We focus on the qualitative features of the second-order susceptibility of the net-baryon number density in dense hadronic matter and how the inclusion of $\Delta(1232)$ affects it. We demonstrate that the fluctuations of the individual baryons do not necessarily reflect the total net-baryon number fluctuations at finite density, due to the non-trivial correlations between different particle species. Our results highlight the role of baryonic correlations in the interpretation of data from heavy ion collision experiments.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Consequences of Unconstrained Gravity and Electromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the quantum description of gauge theories, we study the cosmological effects of relaxing the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints in general relativity and Gauss' law in electromagnetism. We show that the unconstrained theories have new source terms that mimic a pressureless dust and a charge density that only follows geodesics. The source terms may be the simplest explanation for dark matter and generically predict a charged component. We comment that discovery of such terms would rule out inflation and be a direct probe of the initial conditions of the universe.</description>

      <title>Probing superheavy dark matter through lunar radio observations of ultrahigh-energy neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrahigh-energy neutrinos (UHE$\nu$s) can be used as a valuable probe of superheavy dark matter above $\sim 10^9$ GeV, the latter being difficult to probe with collider and direct detection experiments due to the feebly interacting nature. Searching for radio emissions originating from the interaction of UHE$\nu$s with the lunar regolith enables us to explore energies beyond $10^{12}$ GeV, which astrophysical accelerators cannot achieve. Taking into account the interaction of UHE$\nu$s with the cosmic neutrino background and resulting standard neutrino cascades to calculate the neutrino flux on Earth, we investigate sensitivities of such lunar radio observations to very heavy dark matter. We show that the proposed ultra-long wavelength lunar radio telescope, as well as the existing low-frequency array, can provide the most stringent constraints on decaying or annihilating superheavy dark matter with masses at $\gtrsim 10^{12}$ GeV. The limits are complementary to or even stronger than those from other UHE$\nu$ detectors, such as the IceCube-Gen2 radio array and GRAND.</description>

      <title>Deconfinement and chiral restoration phase transition under rotation from holography in an anisotropic gravitational background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of rotation on deconfinement and chiral phase transitions in the framework of dynamical holographic QCD model. Instead of transforming to the rotating system by Lorentz boost, we construct an anisotropic gravitational background by incorporating the rotating boundary current. We firstly investigate the pure gluon system under rotation to extract deconfinement phase transition from the Polyakov loop then add 2-flavor probe for chiral restoration phase transition from the chiral condensate. It is observed that at low chemical potentials, the deconfinement phase transition of pure gluon system is of first order and the chiral phase transition of 2-flavor system is of crossover. Both the critical temperatures of deconfinement and chiral phase transitions decrease/increase with imaginary/real angular velocity ($\Omega_I/\Omega$) as $T/T_c\sim 1- C_2 \Omega_I^2$ and $T/T_c\sim 1+ C_2 \Omega^2$, which is consistent with lattice QCD results. In the temperature-chemical potential $T-\mu$ phase diagram, the critical end point (CEP) moves towards regions of higher temperature and chemical potential with real angular velocity.</description>

Abstract: The resonance mass spectra have been studied through a non-relativistic hypercentral Constituent Quark Model (hCQM) using a linear potential. Also, the effects of higher order correction terms (${\cal{O}}(\frac{1}{m})$, ${\cal{O}}(\frac{1}{m^{2}})$) have been studied for improvisation of the results. Other baryonic properties such as Regge trajectories, magnetic moment and decay widths have been considered.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define soft quark operators that enable construction of colour-ordered helicity amplitudes out of the non-radiative ones. We explore these operators for Higgs plus one jet production in a hadron collider and study the next-to-leading power corrections on all partonic channels involving quark(s) and/or anti-quark(s). We also investigate the effect of next-to-soft gluon radiation in these channels employing the technique illustrated in \cite{Pal:2023vec}. Analytical expressions of next-to-leading power leading logarithms thus obtained are simple and compact in nature. Further, we discuss the connection of such logarithms with that of the pseudo-scalar Higgs plus one jet production.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose new classes of inflation models based on the modular symmetry, where the modulus field $\tau$ serves as the inflaton. We establish a connection between modular inflation and modular stabilization, wherein the modulus field rolls towards a fixed point along the boundary of the fundamental domain. We find the modular symmetry strongly constrain the possible shape of the potential and identify some parameter space where the inflation predictions agree with cosmic microwave background observations. The tensor-to-scalar ratio is predicted to be smaller than $10^{-6}$ in our models, while the running of spectral index is of the the order of $10^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>Constraints on primordial lepton asymmetries with full neutrino transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial neutrino-antineutrino asymmetries can be constrained through big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) relic abundances and cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, both observables being sensitive to neutrino properties. The latter constraint, which is due to gravitational effects from all neutrino flavors, is very minute since it is at least quadratic in the asymmetries. On the contrary, the constraints from primordial abundances presently dominate, although these abundances are almost only sensitive to the electron flavor asymmetry. It is generally assumed that neutrino asymmetries are sufficiently averaged by flavor oscillations prior to BBN, which allows to constrain a common primordial neutrino asymmetry at the epoch of BBN. This simplified approach suffers two caveats that we deal with in this article, combining a neutrino evolution code and BBN calculation throughout the MeV era. First, flavor "equilibration" is not true in general, therefore an accurate dynamical evolution of asymmetries is needed to connect experimental observables to the primordial asymmetries. Second, the approximate averaging of asymmetries through flavor oscillations is associated to a reheating of the primordial plasma. It is therefore crucial to correctly describe the interplay between flavor equilibration and neutrino decoupling, as an energy redistribution prior to decoupling does not significantly alter the final effective number of neutrino species' value. Overall, we find that the space of allowed initial asymmetries is generically unbound when using currently available primordial abundances and CMB measurements. We forecast constraints using future CMB experiment capabilities, which should reverse this experimental misfortune.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for partial wave amplitudes under covariant $L$-$S$ scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the continuous accumulation of data from hadron collision experiments, efficient Partial Wave Analysis tools are indispensable for constructing a clear hadron spectrum. Currently, automated computations of scattering amplitudes primarily rely on the helicity scheme and covariant effective Lagrangian method. The automated calculations under the covariant $L$-$S$ scheme, which is one of the commonly used partial wave analysis schemes, have not been fully realized. In this work, we provide a general algorithm for computing partial wave amplitudes under the covariant $L$-$S$ scheme. This will lay the foundation for automated computation of partial wave amplitudes under the covariant $L$-$S$ scheme.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Gravitational Wave Spectral Shapes as test for Low-Scale Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study thermal and non-thermal resonant leptogenesis in a general setting where a heavy scalar $\phi$ decays to right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) whose further out-of-equilibrium decay generates the required lepton asymmetry. Domination of the energy budget of the Universe by the $\phi$ or the RHNs alters the evolution history of the primordial gravitational waves (PGW), of inflationary origin, which re-enter the horizon after inflation, modifying the spectral shape. The decays of $\phi$ and RHNs release entropy into the early Universe while nearly degenerate RHNs facilitate low and intermediate scale leptogenesis. We show that depending on the coupling $y_R$ of $\phi$ to radiation species, RHNs can achieve thermal abundance before decaying, which gives rise to thermal leptogenesis. A characteristic damping of the GW spectrum resulting in two knee-like features or one knee-like feature would provide evidence for low-scale thermal and non-thermal leptogenesis respectively. We explore the parameter space for the lightest right-handed neutrino mass $M_1\in[10^2,10^{14}]$ GeV and washout parameter $K$ that depends on the light-heavy neutrino Yukawa couplings $\lambda$, in the weak ($K &lt; 1$) and strong ($K &gt; 1$) washout regimes. The resulting novel features compatible with observed baryon asymmetry are detectable by future experiments like LISA and ET. By estimating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for upcoming GW experiments, we investigate the effect of the scalar mass $M_\phi$ and reheating temperature $T_\phi$, which depends on the $\phi-N$ Yukawa couplings $y_N$.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Asymptotic Expansions of Quantum Fermi Gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize in a novel manner the physical properties of the low temperature Fermi gas in the degenerate domain as a function of temperature and chemical potential. For the first time we obtain low temperature $T$ results in the domain where several fermions are found within a de Broglie spatial cell. In this regime, the usual high degeneracy Sommerfeld expansion fails. The other known semi-classical Boltzmann domain applies when fewer than one particle is found in the de Broglie cell. The relative errors of the three approximate methods (Boltzmann limit, Sommerfeld expansion, and the new domain of several particles in the de Broglie cell) are quantified. In order to extend the understanding of the Sommerfeld expansion, we developed a novel characterization of the Fermi distribution allowing the separation of the finite and zero temperature phenomena.</description>

      <title>Exploring Dark Forces with Multimessenger Studies of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of dark sector interactions via gravitational waves (GWs) from binary inspirals has been a subject of recent interest. We study dark forces using extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), pointing out two issues of interest. Firstly, the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the EMRI, which sets the characteristic length scale of the system and hence the dark force range to which it exhibits enhanced sensitivity, probes force mediator masses that complement those studied with supermassive black hole (SMBH) or neutron star binaries. The LISA mission (the proposed $\mu$Ares detector) will probe mediators with masses $m_V \sim 10^{-16}~{\rm eV}$ ($m_V \sim 10^{-18}~{\rm eV}$), corresponding to ISCOs of $10^6 M_\odot$ ($10^8 M_\odot$) central SMBHs. Secondly, while the sensitivity to dark couplings is typically limited by the uncertainty in the binary component masses, independent mass measurements of the central SMBH through reverberation mapping campaigns or the motion of dynamical tracers enable one to break this degeneracy. Our results, therefore, highlight the necessity for coordinated studies, loosely referred to as "multimessenger", between future $\mu{\rm Hz}-{\rm mHz}$ GW observatories and ongoing and forthcoming SMBH mass measurement campaigns, including OzDES-RM, SDSS-RM, and SDSS-V Black Hole Mapper.</description>

      <title>Global fit to $b \to c\tau\nu$ anomaly 2024 Spring breeze</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, several new experimental results of the test of lepton flavor universality (LFU) in $B\to D^{(\ast)}$ semi-leptonic decays were announced: the first result of $R_{D}$ from the LHCb Run 1 data, the first results of $R_{D}$ and $R_{D^\ast}$ from the LHCb Run 2 data, and the first result of $R_{D^\ast}$ from the Belle II collaboration. Including these new data, a global analysis still prefers the violation of the LFU between the tau and light leptons. A new world average of the data from the BaBar, LHCb, Belle, and Belle II collaborations is $R_{D} = 0.344 \pm 0.026$ and $R_{D^{\ast}} = 0.285 \pm 0.012$. Including this new data, we update a circumstance of the $b \to c \tau \overline\nu$ measurements and their implications for new physics (NP). Incorporating recent developments for the $B \to D^{(\ast)}$ form factors in the Standard Model (SM), we observe a $4.3 \sigma$ deviation from the SM prediction. Our updates also include; model-independent NP formulae for the related observables; and the global fittings of parameters for leptoquark scenarios as well as single NP operator scenarios. Furthermore, we show future potential to indirectly distinguish different NP scenarios with the use of the precise measurements of the polarization observables in $B\to D^{(\ast)}\tau \overline\nu$ at the Belle II and the high-$p_{\rm T}$ flavored-tail searches at the LHC. We also discuss an impact on the LFU violation in $\Upsilon \to l^+ l^-$.</description>

      <title>Transforming the Bootstrap: Using Transformers to Compute Scattering Amplitudes in Planar N = 4 Super Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We pursue the use of deep learning methods to improve state-of-the-art computations in theoretical high-energy physics. Planar N = 4 Super Yang-Mills theory is a close cousin to the theory that describes Higgs boson production at the Large Hadron Collider; its scattering amplitudes are large mathematical expressions containing integer coefficients. In this paper, we apply Transformers to predict these coefficients. The problem can be formulated in a language-like representation amenable to standard cross-entropy training objectives. We design two related experiments and show that the model achieves high accuracy (&gt; 98%) on both tasks. Our work shows that Transformers can be applied successfully to problems in theoretical physics that require exact solutions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of primordial magnetic fields until the recombination epoch, which is constrained by the conservation of magnetic helicity density if they are maximally helical and by the Hosking integral if they are non-helical. We combine these constraints with conditions obtained by estimating time scales of energy dissipation processes to describe the evolution of magnetic field strength and magnetic coherence length analytically. The dissipation processes depend on whether magnetic or kinetic energy is dominant, whether the decay dynamics is linear or not, and whether the dominant dissipation term is shear viscosity or drag force. We apply the description to compare constraints on primordial magnetic fields at different epochs in the early universe and argue that magnetogenesis before the electroweak symmetry breaking is not feasible.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing generalised parton distributions from the lattice off-forward Compton amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a determination of the structure functions of the off-forward Compton amplitude $\mathcal{H}_1$ and $\mathcal{E}_1$ from the Feynman-Hellmann method in lattice QCD. At leading twist, these structure functions give access to the generalised parton distributions (GPDs) $H$ and $E$, respectively. This calculation is performed for an unphysical pion mass of $m_{\pi}=412\;\text{MeV}$ and four values of the soft momentum transfer, $t\approx 0, -0.3, -0.6, -1.1\;\text{GeV}^2$, all at a hard momentum scale of $\bar{Q}^2\approx 5\;\text{GeV}^2$. Using these results, we test various methods to determine properties of the real-time scattering amplitudes and GPDs: (1) we fit their Mellin moments, and (2) we use a simple GPD ansatz to reconstruct the entire distribution. Our final results show promising agreement with phenomenology and other lattice results, and highlight specific systematics in need of control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypothesis testing in high dimensional data is a notoriously difficult problem without direct access to competing models' likelihood functions. This paper argues that statistical divergences can be used to quantify the difference between the population distributions of observed data and competing models, justifying their use as the basis of a hypothesis test. We go on to point out how modern techniques for functional optimization let us estimate many divergences, without the need for population likelihood functions, using samples from two distributions alone. We use a physics-based example to show how the proposed two-sample test can be implemented in practice, and discuss the necessary steps required to mature the ideas presented into an experimental framework.</description>

      <title>Renormalization Flow of Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the renormalization flow of generic actions that depend on the invariants of the field strength tensor of an abelian gauge field. While the Maxwell action defines a Gaussian fixed point, we search for further non-Gaussian fixed points or rather fixed functions, i.e., globally existing Lagrangians of the invariants. Using standard small-field expansion techniques for the resulting functional flow equation, a large number of fixed points is obtained, which - in analogy to recent findings for a shift-symmetric scalar field - we consider as approximation artifacts. For the construction of a globally existing fixed function, we pay attention to the use of proper initial conditions. Parametrizing the latter by the photon anomalous dimension, both the coefficients of the weak-field expansion are fully determined and those of the large-field expansion can be matched such that a global fixed function can be constructed for magnetic fields. The anomalous dimension also governs the strong-field limit. Our results provide evidence for the existence of a continuum of non-Gaussian fixed points parametrized by a small positive anomalous dimension below a critical value. We discuss the implications of this result within various scenarios with and without additional matter. For the strong-field limit of the 1PI QED effective action, where the anomalous dimension is determined by electronic fluctuations, our result suggests the existence of a singularity free strong-field limit, circumventing the standard conclusions connected to the perturbative Landau pole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the emergence of steady electric currents in QCD as a response to a non-uniform magnetic background using lattice simulations with 2 + 1 quark flavors at the physical point, as well as leading-order chiral perturbation theory. Using these currents, we develop a novel method to determine the leading-order coefficient of the equation of state in a magnetic field expansion: the magnetic susceptibility of the QCD medium. We decompose the current expectation value into valence- and sea-quark contributions and demonstrate that the dominant contribution to the electric current is captured by the valence term alone, allowing for a comparably cheap determination of the susceptibility. Our continuum extrapolated lattice results for the equation of state confirm the findings of some of the existing studies in the literature, namely that the QCD medium behaves diamagnetically at low and paramagnetically at high temperatures.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning method developed for the fast simulation of calorimeter detector response, adapting vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). Our model adopts a two-stage generation strategy: initially compressing geometry-aware calorimeter data into a discrete latent space, followed by the application of a sequence model to learn and generate the latent tokens. Extensive experimentation on the Calo-challenge dataset underscores the efficiency of our approach, showcasing a remarkable improvement in the generation speed compared with conventional method by a factor of 2000. Remarkably, our model achieves the generation of calorimeter showers within milliseconds. Furthermore, comprehensive quantitative evaluations across various metrics are performed to validate physics performance of generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of particles in dense matter using quantum computers is developed. As a demonstration, we perform classical simulations of heavy-hadrons propagating through a dense medium in the Schwinger model. Measurements of the time-dependent energy and charge density are used to identify mechanisms responsible for energy loss and hadron production (hadronization). A study of entanglement dynamics highlights the importance of quantum coherence between the particles that make up the dense medium. Throughout this work, care is taken to isolate, and remove, phenomena that arise solely from a finite lattice spacing. It is found that signatures of entanglement are more sensitive to lattice artifacts than other observables. Toward quantum simulations, we present an efficient method and the corresponding quantum circuits for preparing ground states in the presence of heavy mesons. These circuits are used to estimate the resources required to simulate in-medium energy loss and hadronization in the Schwinger model using quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.08390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the GENEVA Monte Carlo framework using the transverse momentum of a colour-singlet system as the resolution variable. This allows us to use next-to-next-to-next-to leading logarithm (N$^3$LL) resummation via the \radish formalism to obtain precise predictions for any colour-singlet production process at the fully exclusive level. Thanks to the implementation of two different resolution variables within the GENEVA framework, we are able to assess the impact of such a choice on differential observables for the first time. As a first application we present predictions for Drell-Yan lepton pair production at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD interfaced to a parton shower simulation that includes additional all-order radiative corrections. We provide fully showered and hadronised events using PYTHIA8, while retaining the NNLO QCD accuracy for observables which are inclusive over the additional radiation. We also show that it is possible to obtain a numerically good agreement between showered GENEVA predictions and the N$^3$LL resummation for the transverse momentum spectrum by choosing a more local recoil scheme. We compare our final predictions to LHC data at 13 TeV, finding good agreement across several distributions.</description>

Abstract: The Drell-Yan process at hadron colliders is a fundamental benchmark for the study of strong interactions and the extraction of electro-weak parameters. The outstanding precision of the LHC demands very accurate theoretical predictions with a full account of fiducial experimental cuts. In this letter we present a state-of-the-art calculation of the fiducial cross section and of differential distributions for this process at third order in the strict fixed-order expansion in the strong coupling, as well as including the all-order resummation of logarithmic corrections. Together with these results, we present a detailed study of the subtraction technique used to carry out the calculation for different sets of experimental cuts, as well as of the sensitivity of the fiducial cross section to infrared physics. We find that residual theory uncertainties are reduced to the percent level and that the robustness of the predictions can be improved by a suitable adjustment of fiducial cuts.</description>

      <title>One-loop corrections for WW to HH in HEFT with the electroweak chiral Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.05900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we present the computation of the one-loop electroweak radiative corrections to the scattering process $WW\to HH$ within the context of the Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT). We assume that the fermionic interactions are like in the Standard Model, whereas the Beyond Standard Model interactions in the bosonic sector are given by the Electroweak Chiral Lagrangian. The computation of the one-loop amplitude and the renormalization program is performed in terms of the involved one-particle-irreducible functions (1PI) and using $R_\xi$ covariant gauges. The renormalization of 1PI functions at arbitrary external momenta is a more ambitious program than just renormalizing the amplitude with on-shell external legs and it has the advantage that they can be used in several scattering amplitudes. In fact, we use here some of the 1PI functions already computed in our previous work (devoted to $WZ \to WZ$). We will complement them here with the computation of the new 1PI functions required for $WW \to HH$. From this renormalization procedure we will also derive the full set of renormalized coefficients of the EChL that are relevant for this scattering process. In the last part, we will present the numerical results for the EChL predictions of the one-loop level cross section, $\sigma(WW \to HH)|_{\rm 1-loop}$, as a function of the center of mass energy, showing the relative size of the one-loop radiative corrections respect to the tree level prediction in terms of the EChL coefficients. The results of the one-loop corrections to $WW \to HH$ for the SM case will be also presented, for comparison with the EChL case, following the same computational method, i.e., by means of the renormalization of 1PI functions.</description>

      <title>Friction on ALP domain walls and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the early Universe evolution of axion-like particle (ALP) domain walls taking into account the effect of friction from particles in the surrounding plasma, including the case of particles in thermal equilibrium and frozen out species. We characterize the friction force from interactions within the ALP effective theory, providing new results for the fermion contribution as well as identifying simple conditions for friction to be relevant during the domain wall life time. When friction dominates, the domain wall network departs from the standard scaling regime and the corresponding gravitational wave emission is affected. As a relevant example, we show how this can be the case for ALP domain walls emitting at the typical frequencies of Pulsar Timing Array experiments, when the ALP couples to the SM leptons. We then move to a general exploration of the gravitational wave prospects in the ALP parameter space. We finally illustrate how the gravitational wave signal from ALP domain walls is correlated with the quality of the underlying $U(1)$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Coupling Sum Rules and Oblique Corrections in Gauge-Higgs Unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16418v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In GUT inspired $SO(5) \times U(1)_X \times SU(3)_C$ gauge-Higgs unification (GHU) in the Randall-Sundrum warped spacetime, the $W$ and $Z$ couplings of all 4D fermion modes become nontrivial. The $W$ and $Z$ couplings of zero-mode quarks and leptons slightly deviate from those in the SM, and the couplings take the matrix form in the space of Kaluza-Klein (KK) states. In particular, the 4D couplings and mass spectra in the KK states depend on the Aharonov-Bohm phase $ \theta_H$ in the fifth dimension.
  Nevertheless there emerge three astonishing sum rules among those coupling matrices, which guarantees the finiteness of certain combinations of corrections to vacuum polarization tensors. We confirm by numerical evaluation that the equality in the sum rules holds with 5 to 7 digits accuracy. Based on the sum rules we propose improved oblique parameters in GHU. Oblique corrections due to fermion 1-loop diagrams are found to be small.</description>

      <title>Gluon-gluon fusion contribution to the productions of three gauge bosons at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Productions of multiple gauge bosons at the LHC are sensitive to triple or quartic gauge couplings and thus provide a sensitive test for the electroweak sector of the Standard Model and allow for a probe of new physics. In this work we calculate the gluon-gluon initiate state contribution to the productions of three gauge bosons ($Z\gamma\gamma$, $ZZ\gamma$ and $W^+W^-\gamma$) at the LHC, which is formally part of NNLO effects compared to the LO quark-antiquark channels corrections. For each process we present the ratio between the gluon-gluon channels contribution and the quark-antiquark channels contribution. We found that such a ratio for $Z\gamma\gamma$ ($ZZ\gamma$) is of the order of $10^{-3}$ ($10^{-4}$), much smaller than the corresponding ratio for the diboson production due to the decrease of gluon PDF when more particles appear in the final states. These small ratios imply that gluon-gluon fusion contribution is phenomenological negligible for the productions of $Z\gamma\gamma$ and $ZZ\gamma$. However, for $W^+W^-\gamma$ production, the ratio is about 5\%, which is of the same order of magnitude as the ratio for $W^+W^-$ production due to the big cancellation between the amplitudes of quark-antiquark channels. While such an effect can be neglected currently at the LHC, it may be accessible at the HL-LHC.</description>

      <title>F\'eeton ($B-L$ Gauge Boson) Dark Matter for the 511-keV Gamma-Ray Excess and the Prediction of Low-energy Neutrino Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The f\'eeton is the gauge boson of the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge theory. If the gauge coupling constant is extremely small, it becomes a candidate for dark matter. We show that its decay to a pair of electron and positron explains the observed Galactic 511-keV gamma-ray excess in a consistent manner. This f\'eeton dark matter decays mainly into pairs of neutrino and anti-neutrino. Future low-energy experiments with improved directional capability make it possible to capture those neutrino signals. The seesaw-motivated parameter space predicts a relatively short f\'eeton lifetime comparable to the current cosmological constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a realistic mechanism whereby black holes with significant QCD color charge could have formed during the early universe. Primordial black holes (PBHs) could make up a significant fraction of the dark matter if they formed well before the QCD confinement transition. Such PBHs would form by absorbing unconfined quarks and gluons, and hence could acquire a net color charge. We estimate the number of PBHs per Hubble volume with near-extremal color charge for various scenarios, and discuss possible phenomenological implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider subleading power corrections to event shape variables in $e^+e^-$ collisions at the first order in the QCD coupling $\alpha_s$. We start from the jettiness variable $\tau_2$ and the $y_{23}$ resolution variable for the $k_T$ jet clustering algorithm and we analytically compute the corresponding cumulative cross section. We investigate the origin of the different power suppressed contributions in the two-jet limit and trace it back to their different coverage of the phase space. We extend our analysis to the case of thrust and of the $C$-parameter, and we finally discuss a class of observables that depend on a continuous parameter giving different weight to central and forward emissions and we evaluate the corresponding subleading power corrections.</description>

Abstract: Using effective Lagrangians constrained by the heavy quark spin symmetry and chiral symmetry, for the light quarks, we analyze the $D^0 D^0\pi^+$, $\bar{D}^0D^0\pi^0$ and $D^0\bar{D}^{*0}$ invariant mass spectra. Performing a simultaneous analysis of the doubly charmed and charm-anti-charm states gives further insights into the nature of the $T^+_{cc}$ and $\chi^0_{c1}(3872)$, exotic hadrons. We find that both states lie below the respective $DD^*$/$D\bar{D}^*$ thresholds. Also, the contributions of the triangle and box diagrams are negligible.</description>

      <title>Purely leptonic decays of heavy-flavored charged mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the purely leptonic decays of heavy-flavored charged pseudoscalar (P) and vector (V) mesons ($D_{(s)}^{(*)+}$, $B_{(c)}^{(*)+}$) in the relativistic independent quark (RIQ) model based on an average flavor-independent confining potential in equally mixed scalar-vector harmonic form. We first compute the mass spectra of the ground-state-mesons and fix the model parameters necessary for the present analysis. Using the meson wave functions derivable in the RIQ model, and model parameters so fixed from hadron spectroscopy, we predict the decay constants: $f_{P(V)}$, ratios of decay constants: $f_{V}/f_{P}$, $f_{P_1}/f_{P_2}$, $f_{V_1}/f_{V_2}$, and the branching fractions (BFs): ${\cal B}(P(V)\to l^+\nu_l)$, $l=e, \mu, \tau$, which agree with the available experimental data and other Standard Model (SM) predictions. For the unmeasured decay constants especially in the purely leptonic decays of the charged vector mesons, our predictions could be tested in the upcoming Belle-II, SCTF, CEPC, FCC-ee and LHCb experiments in near future.</description>

      <title>QED corrections to the thermal neutrino interaction rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by precision computations of neutrino decoupling at MeV temperatures, we show how QED corrections to the thermal neutrino interaction rate can be related to the electron-positron spectral function as well as an effective $\bar{\nu}\nu\gamma$ vertex. The spectral function is needed both in a timelike and in a spacelike domain, and for both of its physical polarization states (transverse and longitudinal with respect to spatial momentum). Incorporating an NLO evaluation of this spectral function, an estimate of the $\bar{\nu}\nu\gamma$ vertex, and HTL resummation of scatterings mediated by soft Bose-enhanced $t$-channel photons, we compute the interaction rate as a function of the neutrino momentum and flavour. Effects on the $ -(0...2)\%$ level are found, noticeably smaller than a previous estimate of a related quantity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A reliable determination of the pole parameters and residues of nucleon resonances is notoriously challenging, given the required analytic continuation into the complex plane. We provide a comprehensive analysis of such resonance parameters accessible with Roy-Steiner equations for pion-nucleon scattering - a set of partial-wave dispersion relations that combines the constraints from analyticity, unitarity, and crossing symmetry - most prominently of the $\Delta(1232)$ resonance. Further, we study the Roper, $N(1440)$, resonance, which lies beyond the strict domain of validity, in comparison to Pad\'e approximants, comment on the role of subthreshold singularities in the $S$-wave, and determine the residues of the $f_0(500)$, $\rho(770)$, and $f_0(980)$ resonances in the $t$-channel process $\pi\pi\to\bar NN$. The latter allows us to test - for the first time fully model independently in terms of the respective residues - universality of the $\rho(770)$ couplings and the Goldberger-Treiman relation expected if the scalars behaved as dilatons, in both cases revealing large deviations from the narrow-resonance limit.</description>

      <title>Transversity generalized parton distributions in spin-3/2 particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The definitions of the quark and gluon transversity generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in spin-3/2 particles are obtained in the light-cone gauge. It is found that they contain 16 independent components for each parton. Their even or odd property is found in terms of skewness variable, and the odd transversity GPDs vanish in the forward limit. There are 16 amplitudes with helicity flip of quark or gluon. We conclude that all the amplitudes, unpolarized, polarized, and transversity amplitudes, have a common factor $F(\zeta)$ carrying all the complex part. Here, the variable $\zeta$ is the helicity difference $\zeta=(\lambda' -\lambda)-(\mu' - \mu)$ for the amplitude $\mathcal{A}_{\lambda' \mu',\lambda\mu}$. This kinematical factor is associated with the transfer of the orbital angular momentum in the quark- and gluon-spin-3/2 particle scattering amplitudes. We also derive another main physical quantity, transversity distribution, from the transversity GPDs in the forward limit for the spin-3/2 particles.</description>

      <title>Production of $X_b$ via radiative transition of $\Upsilon(10753)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied the radiative transitions between the $\Upsilon(10753)$, the $S$-$D$ mixed state of the $\Upsilon(4S)$ and $\Upsilon_1(3\,{}^3D_1)$, and the $X_b$, the heavy quark flavor symmetry counterpart of the $X(3782)$ in the bottomonium sector. The radiative transition was assumed to occur through the intermediate bottom mesons, including $P$-wave $B_1^{(\prime)}$ mesons as well as the $S$-wave $B^{(*)}$ ones. The consideration of the $B_1^{(\prime)}$ mesons leads to the couplings to be in $S$-wave, and hence enhances the contributions of the intermediate meson loops. The radiative decay width for the $\Upsilon(10753)\to\gamma X_b$ is predicted to be order of $10~\mathrm{keV}$, corresponding to a branching fraction of $10^{-4}$. Based on the theoretical results, we strongly suggest to search for the $X_b$ in the $e^+e^-\to\gamma X_b$ with $X_b\to\pi\pi\chi_{b1}$ near $\sqrt{s}=10.754~\mathrm{GeV}$, and it is hoped that the calculations here could be tested by the future Belle II experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the LHCb measurement of the hyperon decay mode $\Sigma^+\to p\mu^+\mu^-$ and prospects for improvement, we revisit the estimates for the rate and muon forward-backward asymmetry within the standard model and beyond. The standard model prediction has a fourfold ambiguity, and we suggest ways to resolve it with other measurements, including possible studies of $\Sigma^+\to p e^+e^-$ in the BESIII and LHCb experiments. We use the recent BESIII measurements of $\Sigma^+\to p \gamma$ and $\Sigma^+\to N\pi$ to reduce the uncertainty in the long-distance contribution to $\Sigma^+\to p\mu^+\mu^-$. Beyond the standard model, we consider a general effective Hamiltonian at low energy with ten operators whose Wilson coefficients parametrize the new physics. We derive expressions for the $\Sigma^+\to p\mu^+\mu^-$ rate and the associated muon forward-backward asymmetry in terms of these coefficients. Finally, we implement the existing constraints from kaon decays, pointing out the extent to which this hyperon mode can constrain the directions in parameter space to which the kaons are not sensitive.</description>

Abstract: There have been many applications of deep neural networks to detector calibrations and a growing number of studies that propose deep generative models as automated fast detector simulators. We show that these two tasks can be unified by using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) from conditional generative models for energy regression. Unlike direct regression techniques, the MLE approach is prior-independent and non-Gaussian resolutions can be determined from the shape of the likelihood near the maximum. Using an ATLAS-like calorimeter simulation, we demonstrate this concept in the context of calorimeter energy calibration.</description>

      <title>Consequences of the $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry for leptogenesis in a seesaw model with diagonal Dirac neutrino mass matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we have studied the consequences of the $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry for leptogenesis in the type-I seesaw model with diagonal Dirac neutrino mass matrix. We have first obtained the phenomenologically allowed values of the model parameters, which show that there may exist zero or equal entries in the Majorana mass matrix for the right-handed neutrinos, and then studied their predictions for three right-handed neutrino masses, which show that there may exist two nearly degenerate right-handed neutrinos. Then, we have studied the consequences of the model for leptogenesis. Due to the $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry, leptogenesis can only work in the two-flavor regime. Furthermore, leptogenesis cannot work for the particular case of $r=1$. Accordingly, for some benchmark values of $r \neq 1$, we have given the constraints of leptogenesis for relevant parameters. Furthermore, we have investigated the possibilities of leptogenesis being induced by the renormalization group evolution effects for two particular scenarios. For the particular case of $r=1$, the renormalization group evolution effects will break the orthogonality relations among different columns of $M^{}_{\rm D}$ and consequently induce leptogenesis to work. For the low-scale resonant leptogenesis scenario which is realized for nearly degenerate right-handed neutrinos, the renormalization group evolution effects can break the $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry and consequently induce leptogenesis to work.</description>

Abstract: Generalized thermodynamic relations are introduced into the framework of a relativistic perfect spin hydrodynamics. They allow for consistent treatment of spin degrees of freedom, including the use of spin tensors whose structure follows from microscopic calculations. The obtained results are important for establishing consistency between different formulations of spin hydrodynamics and form the basis for introducing dissipative corrections.</description>

      <title>Folded context condensation in Path Integral formalism for infinite context transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This short note is written for rapid communication of long context training and to share the idea of how to train it with low memory usage. In the note, we generalize the attention algorithm and neural network of Generative Pre-Trained Transformers and reinterpret it in Path integral formalism. First, the role of the transformer is understood as the time evolution of the token state and second, it is suggested that the all key-token states in the same time as the query-token can attend to the attention with the query token states. As a result of the repetitive time evolution, it is discussed that the token states in the past sequence meats the token states in the present sequence so that the attention between separated sequences becomes possible for maintaining infinite contextual information just by using low memory for limited size of sequence. For the experiment, the $12$ input token window size was taken and one GPU with $24$GB memory was used for the pre-training. It was confirmed that more than $150$ length context is preserved. The sampling result of the training, the code and the other details will be included in the revised version of this note later.</description>

      <title>Dissipative processes at the acoustic horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.13790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A transonic fluid flow generates an acoustic hole that is the hydrodynamic analogue of a gravitational black hole. Acoustic holes emit a detectable thermal radiation of phonons at a characteristic Hawking temperature. The crucial concept is that the spontaneous phonon emission at the horizon produces an irreversible heat increase at the expenses of the bulk fluid kinetic energy. We show that such process can be described in terms of \textit{effective} shear and bulk viscosities that are defined close to the horizon. We analyze this quantum friction process by resorting to a general kinetic theory approach as well as by the specific description of phonon emission as a tunneling process. The celebrated Kovtun, Son and Starinets (KSS) universal lower bound $\eta /s = 1 / 4 \pi $ of the shear viscosity coefficient to entropy density ratio, readily follows, and is extended to the longitudinal bulk viscosity at the horizon. We come to the same saturation of the KSS bound after considering the shear viscosity arising from a perturbation of the background metric at the acoustic horizon providing a -- in principle testable -- realization of the so called black hole \textit{membrane paradigm}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variety of condensed matter systems describe gapless modes that can be interpreted as Nambu-Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken Poincar\'e symmetry. In this paper we derive new soft theorems constraining the tree-level scattering of these degrees of freedom, as exhibited in solids, fluids, superfluids, and framids. These soft theorems are in one-to-one correspondence with various broken symmetries, including spacetime translations, Lorentz boosts, and, for the case of fluids, volume-preserving diffeomorphisms. We also implement a bootstrap in which the enhanced vanishing of amplitudes in the soft limit is taken as an input, thus sculpting out a subclass of exceptional solid, fluid, and framid theories.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the cosmic string origin of GW190521</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time we analyse gravitational-wave strain data using waveforms constructed from strong gravity simulations of cosmic string loops collapsing to Schwarzschild black holes; a previously unconsidered source. Since the expected signal is dominated by a black-hole ringdown, it can mimic the observed gravitational waves from high-mass binary black hole mergers. To illustrate this, we consider GW190521, a short duration gravitational-wave event observed in the third LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observing run. We show that describing this event as a collapsing cosmic string loop is favoured over previous cosmic string analyses by an approximate log Bayes factor of $22$. The binary black hole hypothesis is still preferred, mostly because the cosmic string remnant is non-spinning. It remains an open question whether a spinning remnant could form from loops with angular momentum, but if possible, it would likely bring into contention the binary black hole preference. Finally, we suggest that searches for ringdown-only waveforms would be a viable approach for identifying collapsing cosmic string events and estimating their event rate. This work opens up an important new direction for the cosmic-string and gravitational-wave communities.</description>

      <title>The merger rate of primordial black hole binaries as a probe of Hubble parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that the merger rate of primordial black hole (PBH) binaries can be a probe of Hubble parameter by constraining PBH mass function in the redshifted mass distribution of PBH binaries. In next-generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors, the GWs from PBH binaries would be detected at high redshifts, which gives their redshifted mass and luminosity distances. From a number of detected events, the redshifted mass distribution of PBH binaries can be statistically obtained, and it depends on PBH mass function and redshift distribution of detected PBH binaries. The PBH mass function can be inversely solved by applying the gradient descent method in the relation between redshifted mass distribution and redshift distribution. However, the construction of redshift distribution requires an assumed Hubble parameter in a background cosmology to extract redshift from luminosity distances, which causes solved PBH mass function also depends on assumed Hubble parameter. To determine the Hubble parameter, the merger rate of PBH binaries constrains on this Hubble parameter-dependent PBH mass function by comparing calculated merger rate distribution with observed one, and the best-fit result produces an approximate mass distribution of the physical PBH mass function and pins down the Hubble parameter.</description>

      <title>Close encounters of the primordial kind: a new observable for primordial black holes as dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) remain a viable dark matter candidate in the asteroid-mass range. We point out that in this scenario, the PBH abundance would be large enough for at least one object to cross through the inner Solar System per decade. Since Solar System ephemerides are modeled and measured to extremely high precision, such close encounters could produce detectable perturbations to orbital trajectories with characteristic features. We evaluate this possibility with a suite of simple Solar System simulations, and we argue that the abundance of asteroid-mass PBHs can plausibly be probed by existing and near-future data.</description>

      <title>Towards multiloop local renormalization within Causal Loop-Tree Duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Renormalization is a well-known technique to get rid of ultraviolet (UV) singularities. When relying on Dimensional Regularization (DREG), these become manifest as $\epsilon$-poles, allowing to define counter-terms with useful recursive properties. However, this procedure requires to work at \emph{integral-level} and poses difficulties to achieve a smooth combination with semi-numerical approaches. This article is devoted to the development of an integrand-level renormalization formalism, better suited for semi or fully numerical calculations. Starting from the Loop-Tree Duality (LTD), we keep the causal representations of the integrands of multiloop Feynman diagrams and explore their UV behaviour. Then, we propose a strategy that allows to build local counter-terms, capable of rendering the expressions integrable in the high-energy limit and in four space-time dimensions. Our procedure was tested on diagrams up to three-loops, and we found a remarkably smooth cancellation of divergences. The results of this work constitute a powerful step towards a fully local renormalization framework in QFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We estimate the neutrino flux from different kinds of galactic sources and compare it with the recently diffuse neutrino flux detected by IceCube. We find that the flux from these sources may contribute to ~ 20% of the IceCube neutrino flux. Most of the sources selected in this work populate the southern hemisphere, therefore a detector like KM3NeT could help in resolving the sources out of the observed diffused galactic neutrino flux.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Schr\"odinger equation can be derived assuming the Galilean covariance of a generic wave equation and the validity of the de Broglie's wave-particle duality hypothesis. We also obtain from this set of assumptions the transformation law for the wave function under a Galilean boost and prove that complex wave functions are unavoidable for a consistent description of a physical system. The extension to the relativistic domain of the above analysis is also provided. We show that Lorentz covariance and wave-particle duality are consistent with two different transformation laws for the wave function under a Lorentz boost. This leads to two different wave equations, namely, the Klein-Gordon equation and the Lorentz covariant Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos as possible probes for quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to explore the interplay between neutrinos and quantum gravity, illustrating some proposals about the use of these particles as probes for the supposed quantized structure of spacetime. The residual signatures of a more fundamental theory of quantum gravity can manifest themselves modifying the free particle dispersion relations and the connected velocity. In neutrino sector these supposed effects can modify the time of flight for astrophysical particles with different energies and can affect the usual neutrino oscillation pattern introducing species depending perturbations. We will highlight how perturbations caused by non-standard interactions in the solar neutrino sector can mimic the presumed quantum gravity effects. In fact, the mathematical formulation of non-standard interactions is equivalent to that of CPT-odd perturbations. We will, therefore, emphasize the need to identify the nature of different contributions in order to disentangle them in the search for quantum gravity effects. As a final point we will discuss the possibility to detect in the neutrino sector decoherence effects caused by the quantum gravity supposed perturbations. By reviewing current experimental constraints and observations, we seek to shed light on the intricate relationship between neutrinos and quantum gravity, and discuss the challenges and future directions in this fascinating field of research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we first derive the evolution equation for the general energy-momentum moment of $\delta f$, where $\delta f$ is the deviation from the local equilibrium phase space density. We then introduce a relativistic extension of regularized hydrodynamics developed in the non-relativistic case by Struchtrup and Torrilhon that combines the method of moments and Chapman-Enskog expansion. Hydrodynamic equations up to the third-order in gradients are then systematially derived within the context of a single species system and the relaxation time approximation. This is followed by a series of linear stability and causality analysis. For the system of massless particles without any charge conservation, the third-order hydrodynamics is shown to be linearly stable and causal.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we will characterize constraints on the possible IR phases of a given QFT by anomalies in the space of coupling constants. We will give conditions under which a coupling constant anomaly cannot be matched by a continuous family of symmetry preserving gapped phases, in which case the theory is either gapless, or exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking or a phase transition. We additionally demonstrate examples of theories with coupling constant anomalies which can be matched by a family of symmetry preserving gapped phases without a phase transition and comment on the interpretation of our results for the spontaneous breaking of "$(-1)$-form global symmetries."</description>

      <title>Standing wave in perturbed anti-de Sitter spacetimes with a naked singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the framework of black hole perturbation theory, this work investigates the standing wave solutions in Reissner-Nordtsr\"om (RN) anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes with a naked singularity. These solutions can be viewed as a specific class of quasinormal modes exhibiting distinct characteristics. The imaginary parts of their frequencies are numerically vanishing, allowing them to persist over an extended period. Besides, these modes are predominantly stationary in terms of the evolution of spacetime waveforms. The numerical calculations are carried out employing the finite difference method, and the quasinormal frequencies extracted by the Prony method are shown to be consistent with those obtained using the matrix method. The obtained waveforms and quasinormal frequencies are shown to be drastically different from those of an extreme RN-AdS black hole. As the quasinormal modes are primarily dissipative, the non-dissipative standing waves are attributed to the nature that the singularity can neither be a sink nor a source of the gravitational system.</description>
