      <title>Crystalline Spectral Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate crystalline-like behavior of the spectral form factor (SFF) in unitary quantum systems with extremely strong eigenvalue repulsion. Using a low-temperature Coulomb gas as a model of repulsive eigenvalues, we derive the Debye-Waller factor suppressing periodic oscillations of the SFF and estimate the order of its singularities at multiples of the Heisenberg time. We also reproduce this crystalline-like behavior using perturbed permutation circuits and random matrix ensembles associated with Lax matrices. Our results lay a foundation for future studies of quantum systems that exhibit intermediate level statistics between standard random matrix ensembles and permutation circuits.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Quantum Transport Simulations in Two-Dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit a wide range of electronic properties that make them promising candidates for next-generation nanoelectronic devices. Accurate prediction of their quantum transport behavior is therefore of both fundamental and technological importance. While density functional theory (DFT) combined with the non-equilibrium Green$'$s function (NEGF) formalism provides reliable insights, its high computational cost limits applications to large-scale or high-throughput studies. Here we present DeePTB-NEGF, a framework that combines a deep learning-based tight-binding Hamiltonians derived learned directly from first-principles calculations (DeePTB) with efficient quantum transport simulations implemented in the DPNEGF package. To validate the method, we apply it to three prototypical 2D materials: graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and MoS$_2$. The resulting band structures and transmission spectra show excellent agreement with conventional DFT-NEGF results, while achieving orders-of-magnitude improvement in efficiency. These results highlight the capability of DeePTB-NEGF to enable accurate and efficient quantum transport simulations, thereby opening avenues for large-scale exploration and device design in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Dissipation due to bulk localized low-energy modes in strongly disordered superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of the temperature $T$ and frequency $\omega$ dependence of ac dissipation in strongly disordered superconductors featuring a pseudogap $\Delta_{P}$ in the single-particle spectrum. Our theory applies to the regime $T,\,\hbar\omega\ll\Delta_{\text{typ}}\ll\Delta_{P}$, where $\Delta_{\text{typ}}$ is the typical superconducting gap. The dissipation is expressed in terms of the quality factor $Q(T,\omega)$ of microwave resonators made of these materials. We show that low-$\omega$ dissipation is dominated by a new type of bulk localized collective modes. Due to the strongly nonuniform spectral density of these modes, $Q$ decreases sharply with frequency, while its temperature dependence exhibits a two-level-system-like growth as a function of $T$ for $T\ll T_{c}$. Our theory is applicable to InO$_x$, TiN, NbN, and similar strongly disordered materials. We further argue that the experimentally observed behavior of disordered films of granular Aluminum is explained by similar physics, although this case requires a separate theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal interactions and high-dimensional chaos: comparing dynamics and statistics of equilibria in a solvable class of models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20908</link>

Abstract: We investigate a model of high-dimensional dynamical variables with all-to-all interactions that are random and non-reciprocal. We characterize its phase diagram and show that the model can exhibit chaotic dynamics. We show that the equations describing the system's dynamics exhibit a number of equilibria that is exponentially large in the dimensionality of the system, and these equilibria are all linearly unstable in the chaotic phase. Solving the effective equations governing the dynamics in the infinite-dimensional limit, we determine the typical properties (magnetization, overlap) of the configurations belonging to the attractor manifold. We show that these properties cannot be inferred from those of the equilibria, challenging the expectation that chaos can be understood purely in terms of the numerous unstable equilibria of the dynamical equations. We discuss the dependence of this scenario on the strength of non-reciprocity in the interactions. These results are obtained through a combination of analytical methods such as Dynamical Mean-Field Theory and the Kac-Rice formalism.</description>

      <title>Predicting the mechanical properties of spring networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07844v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The elastic response of mechanical, chemical, and biological systems is often modeled using a discrete arrangement of Hookean springs, either representing finite material elements or even the molecular bonds of a system. However, to date, there is no direct derivation of the relation between a general discrete spring network\blu{, with arbitrary geometry,} and it's corresponding elastic continuum. Furthermore, understanding the network's mechanical response requires simulations that may be expensive computationally. Here we report a method to derive the exact elastic continuum model of any discrete network of springs, requiring network geometry and topology only. We identify and calculate the so-called "non-affine" displacements. Explicit comparison of our calculations to simulations of different crystalline and disordered configurations, shows we successfully capture the mechanics even of auxetic materials. Our method is valid for residually stressed systems with non-trivial geometries, and is an essential step in generalizing active stresses on such discrete systems. It is easily generalizable to other discrete models, and opens the possibility of a rational design of elastic systems.</description>

      <title>Statistical physics of deep learning: Optimal learning of a multi-layer perceptron near interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For four decades statistical physics has been providing a framework to analyse neural networks. A long-standing question remained on its capacity to tackle deep learning models capturing rich feature learning effects, thus going beyond the narrow networks or kernel methods analysed until now. We positively answer through the study of the supervised learning of a multi-layer perceptron. Importantly, (i) its width scales as the input dimension, making it more prone to feature learning than ultra wide networks, and more expressive than narrow ones or ones with fixed embedding layers; and (ii) we focus on the challenging interpolation regime where the number of trainable parameters and data are comparable, which forces the model to adapt to the task. We consider the matched teacher-student setting. Therefore, we provide the fundamental limits of learning random deep neural network targets and identify the sufficient statistics describing what is learnt by an optimally trained network as the data budget increases. A rich phenomenology emerges with various learning transitions. With enough data, optimal performance is attained through the model's "specialisation" towards the target, but it can be hard to reach for training algorithms which get attracted by sub-optimal solutions predicted by the theory. Specialisation occurs inhomogeneously across layers, propagating from shallow towards deep ones, but also across neurons in each layer. Furthermore, deeper targets are harder to learn. Despite its simplicity, the Bayes-optimal setting provides insights on how the depth, non-linearity and finite (proportional) width influence neural networks in the feature learning regime that are potentially relevant in much more general settings.</description>
