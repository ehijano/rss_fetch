      <title>Searches for ultra-high energy gamma-ray at the Pierre Auger Observatory and implications on super-heavy dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first interactions of photon-induced showers are of electromagnetic nature, and the transfer of energy to the hadron/muon channel is reduced with respect to the bulk of hadron-induced showers. This results in a lower number of secondary muons. Additionally, as the development of photon showers is delayed by the typically small multiplicity of electromagnetic interactions, their maximum of shower development is deeper in the atmosphere than for showers initiated by hadrons. These salient features have enabled searches for photon showers at the Pierre Auger Observatory. They have led to stringent upper limits on ultra-high-energy gamma-ray fluxes over four orders in magnitude in energy. These limits are not only of considerable astrophysical interest, but they also allow us to constrain beyond-standard-physics scenarios. For instance, dark matter particles could be superheavy, provided their lifetime is much longer than the age of the universe. Constraints on specific extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics that meet the lifetime requirement for a superheavy particle will be presented. They include limits on instanton strength as well as on mixing angle between active and sterile neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Measuring the ICM velocity structure within the A3266 galaxy cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the velocity structure of the hot intracluster medium (ICM) within the A3266 galaxy cluster, including new observations taken between June and November 2023. Firstly, morphological structures within the galaxy cluster were examined using a Gaussian Gradient Magnitude (GGM) and adaptively smoothed GGM filter applied to the EPIC-pn X-ray image. Then, we applied a novel {\it XMM-Newton} EPIC-pn energy scale calibration, which uses instrumental Cu K$\alpha$ as reference for the line emission, to measure line-of-sight velocities of the hot gas within the system. This approach enabled us to create two-dimensional projected maps for velocity, temperature, and metallicity, showing that the hot gas displays a redshifted systemic velocity relative to the cluster redshift across all fields of view. Further analysis of the velocity distribution through non-overlapping circular regions demonstrated consistent redshifted velocities extending up to 1125 kpc from the cluster core. Additionally, the velocity distribution was assessed along regions following surface brightness discontinuities, where we observed redshifted velocities in all regions, with the largest velocities reaching $768 \pm 284$ km/s. Moreover, we computed the velocity Probability Density Function (PDF) from the velocity map. We applied a normality test, finding that the PDF adheres to an unimodal normal distribution consistent with theoretical predictions. Lastly, we computed a velocity structure function (VSF) for this system using the measured line-of-sight velocities. These insights advance our understanding of the dynamic processes within the A3266 galaxy cluster and contribute to our broader knowledge of ICM behavior in merging galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Violent White Dwarf Mergers or Collisions Produce Type Ia Supernovae in Elliptical Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I find that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with bimodal nebular emission profiles occur almost exclusively in massive ($M_\star \gtrsim 10^{11}~M_\odot$) galaxies with low star-formation rates (SFR~$\lesssim 0.5~M_\odot$/yr). The bimodal profiles are likely produced by two white dwarfs that exploded during a merger or collision, supported by a correlation between the peak-to-peak velocity separation ($v_{\rm sep}$) and the SN Ia peak luminosity ($M_V$) which arises naturally from more massive white dwarf binaries synthesizing more $^{56}$Ni during the explosion. The quiescent hosts are consistent with the long delay times required to form double white dwarf binaries. The distributions of SNe Ia with and without bimodal nebular lines differ in host mass, SFR, and specific SFR with K-S test probabilities of $3.1\%$, $0.03\%$, and $0.02\%$, respectively. Viewing angle effects can fully explain the SNe Ia in quiescent hosts without bimodal emission profiles and the dearth of merger/collision driven SNe Ia in star-forming hosts requires at least two distinct progenitor channels for normal SNe Ia. $30-40\%$ of all SNe Ia originate from mergers or collisions depending on how cleanly host environment distinguishes progenitor scenarios. The bimodal SNe Ia share some characteristics with the underluminous 91bg-like SNe Ia that also prefer older populations, but there is no unambiguous connection between the two classifications. This may suggest separate processes or multiple axes of ejecta (a)symmetry. Existing models for WD mergers and collisions broadly reproduce the $v_{\rm sep} - M_V$ correlation and future analyses may be able to infer the masses/mass-ratios of merging white dwarfs in external galaxies.</description>

      <title>On the fate of the secondary white dwarf in double-degenerate double-detonation Type Ia supernovae -- II. 3D synthetic observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A leading model for Type Ia supernovae involves the double-detonation of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf. Double-detonations arise when a surface helium shell detonation generates shockwaves that trigger a core detonation; this mechanism may be triggered via accretion or during the merger of binaries. Most previous double-detonation simulations only included the primary white dwarf; however, the fate of the secondary has significant observational consequences. Recently, hydrodynamic simulations accounted for the companion in double-degenerate double-detonation mergers. In the merger of a 1.05$\text{M}_{\odot}$ primary white dwarf and 0.7$\text{M}_{\odot}$ secondary white dwarf, the primary consistently detonates while the fate of the secondary remains uncertain. We consider two versions of this scenario, one in which the secondary survives and another in which it detonates. We present the first 3D radiative transfer calculations for these models and show that the synthetic observables for both models are similar and match properties of the peculiar 02es-like subclass of Type Ia supernovae. Our calculations show angle dependencies sensitive to the companion's fate, and we can obtain a closer spectroscopic match to normal Type Ia supernovae when the secondary detonates and the effects of helium detonation ash are minimised. The asymmetry in the width-luminosity relationship is comparable to previous double-detonation models, but the overall spread is increased with a secondary detonation. The secondary detonation has a meaningful impact on all synthetic observables; however, multidimensional nebular phase calculations are needed to support or rule out either model as a likely explanation for Type Ia supernovae.</description>

      <title>Polarized X-rays Correlated with Short--Timescale Variability of Cygnus X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the variability of polarized X-rays on a timescale of a few seconds in the low/hard state of the black hole binary Cygnus X-1. The correlation between polarization degrees and angles with X-Ray intensity was analyzed using data collected by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in June 2022. Given that X-Ray variability in the low/hard state of Cygnus X-1 is non-periodic, flux peaks were aggregated to suppress statistical fluctuations. We divided the temporal profiles of these aggregated flux peaks into seven time segments and evaluated the polarization for each segment. The results reveal that the polarization degree was 4.6\%$\pm$1.2 and 5.3\%$\pm$1.2 before and after the peak, respectively, but decreased to 3.4\%$\pm$1.1 and 2.7\%$\pm$1.1 in the segments including and immediately following the peak. Furthermore, the polarization angle exhibited a slight shift from approximately 30$^{\circ}$ to $\sim$40$^{\circ}$ before and after the peak. These findings suggest that the accretion disk contracts with increasing X-Ray luminosity, and the closer proximity of the X-Ray emitting gas to the black hole may lead to reduced polarization.</description>

      <title>Host Galaxy Properties of Gamma-ray Bursts Involving Neutron Star Binary Mergers and Its Impact on Kilonovae Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the upcoming gravitational wave (GW) observing runs, identifying host galaxies is crucial as it provides essential redshift information and enables the use of GW events as standard sirens. However, pinpointing host galaxies remains challenging due to the large localization uncertainties and the rapidly fading nature of their optical counterparts. Analyzing the host galaxies of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) offers an alternative approach to deepen our understanding of the environments where binary neutron stars (BNS) primarily merge. This study compiles archival photometric data for the host galaxies of 76 sGRBs and 4 hybrid GRBs that are long GRBs accompanied by kilonova-like signals. We use this data to evaluate their physical properties through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. To assess the characteristics of the host galaxies, we utilized a volume-limited sample ($z&lt;0.5$) from the COSMOS field as a control group. Contrary to expectations that the BNS merger rate is proportional to host stellar mass, the short and hybrid GRB population appears less massive than the mass-weighted distribution of the control sample. Instead, we propose a formulation for the expected BNS merger rate from a galaxy as $\log(n_{\mathrm{BNS}}/\mathrm{Gyr}) = 0.86 \times \log(M_*/M_{\odot}) + 0.44 \times \log(\mathrm{sSFR}/\mathrm{yr}) + 0.857$, which optimally explains the deviation between the stellar mass distributions of the GRB host galaxies and the control sample. These insights provide a strategic framework for targeted GW follow-ups and enhance our ability to identify potential host galaxies for future GW events.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the hybrid origins of the X-ray non-thermal emission from IGR J17091-3624</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study based on multi-wavelength observations from the NuSTAR, NICER, Swift, Fermi, NEOWISE, and ATCA telescopes during the 2022 outburst of the black hole X-ray binary IGR J17091-3624. Our investigation concentrates on the heartbeat-like variability in the X-ray emission, with the aim of using it as a tool to unravel the origin of the non-thermal emission during the heartbeat state. Through X-ray timing and spectral analysis, we observe that the heartbeat-like variability correlates with changes in the disk temperature, supporting the disk radiation pressure instability scenario. Moreover, in addition to a Comptonization component, our time-averaged and phase-resolved spectroscopy reveal the presence of a power-law component that varies independently from the disk component. Combined with the radio to X-ray spectral energy distribution fitting, our results suggest that the power-law component could originate from synchrotron self-Compton radiation in the jet, which requires a strong magnetic field of about $B = (0.3$-$3.5)\times10^6$ G. Additionally, assuming that IGR J17091-3624 and GRS 1915+105 share the same radio-X-ray correlation coefficient during both the hard and the heartbeat states, we obtain a distance of $13.7\pm2.3$ kpc for IGR J17091-3624.</description>

      <title>Magnetization Factors of Gamma-Ray Burst Jets Revealed by a Systematic Analysis of the Fermi Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The composition of gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets remained a mystery until recently. In practice, we usually characterize the magnetization of the GRB jets ($\sigma_0$) through the ratio between the Poynting flux and matter (baryonic) flux. With the increasing value of $\sigma_0$, magnetic energy gradually takes on a dominant role in the acceleration and energy dissipation of the jet, causing the proportion of thermal component in the prompt-emission spectrum of GRBs to gradually decrease or even be completely suppressed. In this work, we conducted an extensive analysis of the time-resolved spectrum for all \textit{Fermi} GRBs with known redshift, and we diagnose $\sigma_0$ for each time bin by contrasting the thermal and nonthermal radiation components. Our results suggest that most GRB jets should contain a significant magnetic energy component, likely with magnetization factors $\sigma_{0}\geq 10$. The value of $\sigma_{0}$ seems vary significantly within the same GRB. Future studies with more samples, especially those with lower-energy spectral information coverage, will further verify our results.</description>

      <title>Searching for Pulsars, Magnetars, and Fast Radio Bursts in the Sculptor Galaxy using MeerKAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sculptor Galaxy (NGC 253), located in the Southern Hemisphere, far off the Galactic Plane, has a relatively high star-formation rate of about 7 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and hosts a young and bright stellar population, including several super star clusters and supernova remnants. It is also the first galaxy, apart from the Milky Way Galaxy to be associated with two giant magnetar flares. As such, it is a potential host of pulsars and/or fast radio bursts in the nearby Universe. The instantaneous sensitivity and multibeam sky coverage offered by MeerKAT therefore make it a favourable target. We searched for pulsars, radio-emitting magnetars, and fast radio bursts in NGC 253 as part of the TRAPUM large survey project with MeerKAT. We did not find any pulsars during a four-hour observation, and derive a flux density limit of 4.4 $\mu$Jy at 1400 MHz, limiting the pseudo-luminosity of the brightest putative pulsar in this galaxy to 54 Jy kpc$^2$. Assuming universality of pulsar populations between galaxies, we estimate that detecting a pulsar as bright as this limit requires NGC 253 to contain a pulsar population of $\gtrsim$20 000. We also did not detect any single pulses and our single pulse search flux density limit is 62 mJy at 1284\,MHz. Our search is sensitive enough to have detected any fast radio bursts and radio emission similar to the brighter pulses seen from the magnetar SGR J1935+2154 if they had occurred during our observation.</description>

      <title>KHARMA: Flexible, Portable Performance for GRMHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: KHARMA (an acronym for "Kokkos-based High-Accuracy Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics with Adaptive mesh refinement") is a new open-source code for conducting general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations in stationary spacetimes, primarily of accretion systems. It implements among other options the High-Accuracy Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics (HARM) scheme, but is written from scratch in C++ with the Kokkos programming model in order to run efficiently on both CPUs and GPUs. In addition to being fast, KHARMA is written to be readable, modular, and extensible, separating functionality into "packages," representing, e.g., algorithmic components or physics extensions. Components of the core ideal GRMHD scheme can be swapped at runtime, and additional packages are included to simulate electron temperature evolution, viscous hydrodynamics, and for designing chained multi-scale "bridged" simulations. This chapter presents the computational environment and requirements for KHARMA, features and design which meet these requirements, and finally, validation and performance data.</description>

      <title>CXOU J005245.0-722844: Discovery of a Be Star / White Dwarf binary system in the SMC via a very fast, super-Eddington X-ray outburst event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CXOU J005245.0-722844 is an X-ray source in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) that has long been known as a Be/X-ray binary (BeXRB) star, containing an OBe main sequence star and a compact object. In this paper, we report on a new very fast X-ray outburst from CXOU J005245.0-722844. X-ray observations taken by Swift constrain the duration of the outburst to less than 16 days and find that the source reached super-Eddington X-ray luminosities during the initial phases of the eruption. The XRT spectrum of CXOU J005245.0-722844 during this outburst reveals a super-soft X-ray source, best fit by an absorbed thermal blackbody model. Optical and Ultraviolet follow-up observations from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE), Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), and Swift identify a brief ~0.5 magnitude optical burst coincident with the X-ray outburst that lasted for less than 7 days. Optical photometry additionally identifies the orbital period of the system to be 17.55 days and identifies a shortening of the period to 17.14 days in the years leading up to the outburst. Optical spectroscopy from the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) confirms that the optical companion is an early-type OBe star. We conclude from our observations that the compact object in this system is a white dwarf (WD), making this the seventh candidate Be/WD X-ray binary. The X-ray outburst is found to be the result of a very-fast, ultra-luminous nova similar to the outburst of MAXI J0158-744.</description>

      <title>Hyperons during proto-neutron star deleptonization and the emission of dark flavored particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complementary to high-energy experimental efforts, indirect astrophysical searches of particles beyond the standard model have long been pursued. The present article follows the latter approach and considers, for the first time, the self-consistent treatment of the energy losses from dark flavored particles produced in the decay of hyperons during a core-collapse supernova (CCSN). To this end, general relativistic supernova simulations in spherical symmetry are performed, featuring six-species Boltzmann neutrino transport, and covering the long-term evolution of the nascent remnant proto-neutron star (PNS) deleptonization for several tens of seconds. A well-calibrated hyperon equation of state (EOS) is therefore implemented into the supernova simulations and tested against the corresponding nucleonic model. It is found that supernova observables, such as the neutrino signal, are robustly insensitive to the appearance of hyperons for the simulation times considered in the present study. The presence of hyperons enables an additional channel for the appearance of dark sector particles, which is considered at the level of the $\Lambda$ hyperon decay. Assuming massless particles that escape the PNS after being produced, these channels expedite the deleptonizing PNS and the cooling behaviour. This, in turn, shortens the neutrino emission timescale. The present study confirms the previously estimated upper limits on the corresponding branching ratios for low and high mass PNS, by effectively reducing the neutrino emission timescale by a factor of two. This is consistent with the classical argument deduced from the neutrino detection associated with SN1987A.</description>

      <title>Dark Dwarfs: Dark Matter-Powered Sub-Stellar Objects Awaiting Discovery at the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of dark matter annihilation on objects with masses close to the sub-stellar limit, finding that the minimum mass for stable hydrogen burning is larger than the $\sim0.075 M_\odot $ value predicted in the Standard Model. Below this limit, cooling brown dwarfs evolve into stable dark matter-powered objects that we name dark dwarfs. The timescale of this transition depends on the ambient dark matter density $\rho_{\rm DM}$ and circular velocity $v_{\rm DM}$ but is independent of the dark matter mass. We predict a population of dark dwarfs close to the galactic center, where the dark matter density is expected to be $\rho_{\rm DM}\gtrsim 10^{3}$ GeV/cm$^3$. At larger galactic radii the dark matter density is too low for these objects to have yet formed within the age of the universe. Dark dwarfs retain their initial lithium-7 in mass ranges where brown/red dwarfs would destroy it, providing a method for detecting them.</description>

      <title>Impact of dark energy on the structure of neutron stars: The vacuum case</title>

Abstract: The potential role of a cosmic vacuum dark component in the properties of neutron stars is investigated. It is assumed that the static, spherically symmetric distribution of matter within neutron stars is supported by two distinct components: ordinary matter and a vacuum fluid. For normal matter we use a set of state-of-the-art nuclear matter equations of state, each grounded in nuclear physics experiments. The vacuum energy component is inhomogeneously distributed within the star and obeys the standard equation of state ($p_v = -\epsilon_v$). This is characterized by an energy density fraction $y = \epsilon_m/ (\epsilon_m + \epsilon_v)$, which we model as either a constant or radius-dependent. Our findings reveal that the inclusion of vacuum energy significantly affects the mass-radius relationships in neutron stars, influencing both the maximum achievable masses and the qualitative form of these relationships. Some constraints from current multimessenger observational data limiting the amount of vacuum energy within neutron stars are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Spacetime approach to force-free magnetospheres</title>

Abstract: Force-Free Electrodynamics (FFE) describes magnetically dominated relativistic plasma via non-linear equations for the electromagnetic field alone. Such plasma is thought to play a key role in the physics of pulsars and active black holes. Despite its simple covariant formulation, FFE has primarily been studied in 3+1 frameworks, where spacetime is split into space and time. In this article we systematically develop the theory of force-free magnetospheres taking a spacetime perspective. Using a suite of spacetime tools and techniques (notably exterior calculus) we cover 1) the basics of the theory, 2) exact solutions that demonstrate the extraction and transport of the rotational energy of a compact object (in the case of a black hole, the Blandford-Znajek mechanism), 3) the behavior of current sheets, 4) the general theory of stationary, axisymmetric magnetospheres and 5) general properties of pulsar and black hole magnetospheres. We thereby synthesize, clarify and generalize known aspects of the physics of force-free magnetospheres, while also introducing several new results.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Magnetic Horizon on the Interpretation of the Pierre Auger Observatory Spectrum and Composition Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flux of ultra-high energy cosmic rays reaching Earth above the ankle energy (5 EeV) can be described as a mixture of nuclei injected by extragalactic sources with very hard spectra and a low rigidity cutoff. Extragalactic magnetic fields existing between the Earth and the closest sources can affect the observed CR spectrum by reducing the flux of low-rigidity particles reaching Earth. We perform a combined fit of the spectrum and distributions of depth of shower maximum measured with the Pierre Auger Observatory including the effect of this magnetic horizon in the propagation of UHECRs in the intergalactic space. We find that, within a specific range of the various experimental and phenomenological systematics, the magnetic horizon effect can be relevant for turbulent magnetic field strengths in the local neighbourhood of order $B_{\rm rms}\simeq (50-100)\,{\rm nG}\,(20\rm{Mpc}/{d_{\rm s})( 100\,\rm{kpc}/L_{\rm coh}})^{1/2}$, with $d_{\rm s}$ the typical intersource separation and $L_{\rm coh}$ the magnetic field coherence length. When this is the case, the inferred slope of the source spectrum becomes softer and can be closer to the expectations of diffusive shock acceleration, i.e., $\propto E^{-2}$. An additional cosmic-ray population with higher source density and softer spectra, presumably also extragalactic and dominating the cosmic-ray flux at EeV energies, is also required to reproduce the overall spectrum and composition results for all energies down to 0.6~EeV.</description>

      <title>A gamma-ray flare from TXS 1508+572: characterizing the jet of a $z=4.31$ blazar in the early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blazars can be detected from very large distances due to their high luminosity. However, the detection of $\gamma$-ray emission of blazars beyond $z=3$ has only been confirmed for a small number of sources. Such observations probe the growth of supermassive black holes close to the peak of star formation in the history of galaxy evolution. As a result from a continuous monitoring of a sample of 80 $z&gt;3$ blazars with Fermi-LAT, we present the first detection of a $\gamma$-ray flare from the $z=4.31$ blazar TXS 1508+572. This source showed high $\gamma$-ray activity from February to August 2022, reaching a peak luminosity comparable to the most luminous flares ever detected with Fermi -LAT. We conducted a multiwavelength observing campaign involving XMM-Newton, Swift, the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope and the Very Long Baseline Array. In addition, we make use of the monitoring programs by the Zwicky Transient Facility and NEOWISE at optical and infrared wavelengths, respectively. We find that the source is particularly variable in the infrared band on daily time scales. The spectral energy distribution collected during our campaign is well described by a one-zone leptonic model, with the $\gamma$-ray flare originating from an increase of external Compton emission as a result of a fresh injection of accelerated electrons.</description>

      <title>Neutron-quark stars: Discerning viable alternatives for the higher-density part of the equation of state of compact stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By taking into account the latest observations and theoretical constraints, we investigate the merger and post-merger of binary neutron stars (NSs) with general-relativistic numerical simulations employing hadronic and hybrid equations of state (EOSs). We name our hybrid stars neutron-quark stars (NQS), because the transition from hadrons to quarks starts at a density lower than the central density of $\sim 1 M_{\odot}$ stars. We address two viable scenarios for the transition to quark matter: a crossover or a strong first-order phase transition (1PT). We find that a crossover transition is in principle observable when both the inspiral and post-merger signals are detected because the post-merger gravitational-wave (GW) main frequency $f_2$ is generally lower than that of hadronic models with the same tidal deformability ($\Lambda$). Since it is viable according to current multi-messenger constraints, we also highlight the possibility of an EOS with a strong 1PT that takes place at 1.8 times the nuclear saturation density, with a stiff quark EOS after the transition. It is the first time that mergers of binary NQSs with a deconfined quark-matter core are studied numerically in full general relativity. In this case, although ($\Lambda$, compactness) lies significantly outside the hadronic relation, ($\Lambda$, $f_2$) is close to the relation valid for hadronic EOSs. We also point out a linear correlation, valid within the observational constraints and not sensitive to the presence of a hadron-quark transition, between the emitted energy in GWs and their frequency.</description>

      <title>Imaging pulsar census of the Galactic Plane using MWA VCS data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional pulsar surveys have primarily employed time-domain periodicity searches. However, these methods are susceptible to effects like scattering, eclipses and orbital motion. At lower radio frequencies (&lt;= 300 MHz), factors such as dispersion measure and pulse broadening become more prominent, reducing the detection sensitivity. On the other hand, image domain searches for pulsars are not limited by these effects and can extend the parameter space to regions inaccessible to traditional search techniques. Therefore, we have developed a pipeline to form 1-second full Stokes images from offline correlated high time-resolution data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). This led to the development of image-based methodologies to identify new pulsar candidates. In this paper, we applied these methodologies to perform a low-frequency image-based pulsar census of the Galactic Plane ( 12 MWA observations, covering ~6000 deg^2 sky ). This work focuses on the detection of the known pulsar population which were present in the observed region of the sky using both image-based and beamformed methods. This resulted in the detection of 83 known pulsars, with 16 pulsars found only in Stokes I images but not in periodicity searches applied in beamformed data. Notably, for 14 pulsars these are the first reported low-frequency detections. This underscores the importance of image-based searches for pulsars that may be undetectable in time-series data, due to scattering and/or dispersive smearing at low frequencies. This highlights the importance of low-frequency flux density measurements in refining pulsar spectral models and investigating the spectral turnover of pulsars at low frequencies.</description>

      <title>Solar flare observations with the Radio Neutrino Observatory Greenland (RNO-G)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Radio Neutrino Observatory - Greenland (RNO-G) seeks discovery of ultra-high energy neutrinos from the cosmos through their interactions in ice. The science program extends beyond particle astrophysics to include radioglaciology and, as we show herein, solar observations, as well. Currently seven of 35 planned radio-receiver stations (24 antennas/station) are operational. These stations are sensitive to impulsive radio signals with frequencies between 80 and 700 MHz and feature a neutrino trigger threshold for recording data close to the thermal floor. RNO-G can also trigger on elevated signals from the Sun, resulting in nanosecond resolution time-domain flare data; such temporal resolution is significantly shorter than from most dedicated solar observatories. In addition to possible RNO-G solar flare polarization measurements, the Sun also represents an extremely useful above-surface calibration source.
  Using RNO-G data recorded during the summers of 2022 and 2023, we find signal excesses during solar flares reported by the solar-observing Callisto network and also in coincidence with $\sim$2/3 of the brightest excesses recorded by the SWAVES satellite. These observed flares are characterized by significant time-domain impulsivity. Using the known position of the Sun, the flare sample is used to calibrate the RNO-G absolute pointing on the radio signal arrival direction to sub-degree resolution. We thus establish the Sun as a regularly observed astronomical calibration source to provide the accurate absolute pointing required for neutrino astronomy.</description>

      <title>Black hole in a generalized Chaplygin-Jacobi dark fluid: shadow and light deflection angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a generalized Chaplygin-like gas with an anisotropic equation of state, characterizing a dark fluid within which a static spherically symmetric black hole is assumed. By solving the Einstein equations for this black hole spacetime, we explicitly derive the metric function. The spacetime is parametrized by two critical parameters, $\mathcal{B}$ and $\alpha$, which measure the deviation from the Schwarzschild black hole and the extent of the dark fluid's anisotropy, respectively. We explore the behavior of light rays in the vicinity of the black hole by calculating its shadow and comparing our results with the Event Horizon Telescope observations. This comparison constrains the parameters to $0 \leq \mathcal{B} &lt; 0.03$ and $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 0.1$. Additionally, we calculate the deflection angles to determine the extent to which light is bent by the black hole. These calculations are further utilized to formulate possible Einstein rings, estimating the angular radius of the rings to be approximately $37.6\,\mathrm{\mu as}$. Throughout this work, we present analytical solutions wherever feasible, and employ reliable approximations where necessary to provide comprehensive insights into the spacetime characteristics and their observable effects.</description>

      <title>Implications for Galactic Electron Density Structure from Pulsar Sightlines Intersecting HII Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent radio surveys have revealed pulsars with dispersion and scattering delays induced by ionized gas that are larger than the rest of the observed pulsar population, in some cases with electron column densities (or dispersion measures; DMs) larger than the maximum predictions of Galactic electron density models. By cross-matching the observed pulsar population against HII region catalogs, we show that the majority of pulsars with $\rm DM &gt; 600$ pc cm$^{-3}$ and scattering delays $\tau(1\ {\rm GHz}) &gt; 10$ ms lie behind HII regions, and that HII region intersections may be relevant to as much as a third of the observed pulsar population. The fraction of the full pulsar population with sightlines intersecting HII regions is likely larger. Accounting for HII regions resolves apparent discrepancies where Galactic electron density models place high-DM pulsars beyond the Galactic disk. By comparing emission measures (EMs) inferred from recombination line observations to pulsar DMs, we show that HII regions can contribute tens to hundreds of pc cm$^{-3}$ in electron column density along a pulsar LOS. We find that nearly all pulsars with significant excess (and deficit) scattering from the mean $\tau$-DM relation are spatially coincident with known discrete ionized gas structures, including HII regions. Accounting for HII regions is critical to the interpretation of radio dispersion and scattering measurements as electron density tracers, both in the Milky Way and in other galaxies.</description>

Abstract: Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are stars which have been ejected from the Galactic Centre (GC) at velocities of up to a few thousand km/s. They are tracers of the Galactic potential and can be used to infer properties of the GC, such as the initial-mass function and assembly history. HVSs are rare, however, with only about a dozen promising candidates discovered so far. In this work we make use of a novel, highly efficient method to identify new HVS candidates in Gaia. This method uses the nearly radial trajectories of HVSs to infer their distances and velocities based on their position and Gaia proper motion alone. Through comparison of inferred distances with Gaia parallaxes and photometry we identified 600 HVS candidates with G&lt;20 including the previously discovered S5-HVS1, out of which we obtained ground-based follow-up observations for 196 stars. As we found no new HVSs based on their radial velocity, we used detailed HVS ejection simulations to significantly improve previous HVS ejection rate constraints. In particular, the ejection rate of HVSs more massive than 1 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ cannot be higher than $10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$ at $2\sigma$ significance. Additionally, we predict that there are 5-45 unbound HVSs in the complete Gaia catalogue ($1\sigma$ interval), most of which will be main-sequence stars of a few M$_\odot$ at heliocentric distances of tens to hundreds of kpc. By comparing our results to literature HVS candidates, we find an indication of either a time-dependent ejection rate of HVSs or a non-GC origin of previously identified HVS candidates.</description>

      <title>SDSSJ0018-0939: A Clear Signature of Sub-Chandrasekhar Mass Type 1a Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04026</link>

Abstract: Very metal-poor (VMP) stars (${\rm [Fe/H]}\leq -2$) that have sub-solar values of ${\rm [X/Fe]}$ for $\alpha$ elements such as Mg, Si, and Ca, are referred to as $\alpha$-poor VMP stars. They are quite rare among VMP stars and are thought to have formed from gas enriched predominantly by a single Type Ia supernovae (SN1a) in contrast to most VMP stars which are $\alpha$-enhanced and usually associated with core-collapse supernovae. The observed abundance pattern in such stars can provide a direct way to probe the nucleosynthesis in individual SN1a. Although the abundance patterns in some $\alpha$-poor VMP stars have been shown to be consistent with SN1a ejecta, a clear nucleosynthetic signature for SN1a resulting from the explosion of a near Chandrasekhar mass (near-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) or a sub-Chandrasekhar mass (sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) white dwarf, has not been unambiguously detected. We perform a detailed analysis of various formation channels of VMP stars and find that the $\alpha$-poor VMP star SDSSJ0018-0939, which was earlier reported as a star with potential pair-instability supernova origin, provides almost a smoking-gun signature of a sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN1a resulting from He detonation. We find that compared to other $\alpha$-poor VMP stars that were previously identified with SN1a, SDSSJ0018-0939 is the only star that has a clear and unambiguous signature of SN1a. Interestingly, our results are consistent with constraints on SN1a from recent galactic chemical evolution studies that indicate that sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN1a account for $\sim 50\hbox{--}75\,\%$ of all SN1a and are possibly the dominant channel in the early Galaxy.</description>
