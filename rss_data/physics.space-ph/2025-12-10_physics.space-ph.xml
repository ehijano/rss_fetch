      <title>Solar neutron and muon detection on November 11, 2025: First simultaneous recovery of energy spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground Level Enhancement (GLE) events provide rare opportunities to study high-energy solar particle acceleration through direct detection of secondary radiation at ground level. On November 11, 2025, the Aragats Solar Neutron Telescope (ASNT) recorded a statistically significant increase in high-energy neutron and muon fluxes associated with an X5.1 flare and the subsequent Solar Energetic Proton (SEP) event. The event displayed a unique dual-peak profile: an initial hard component at 10 28 UT, followed by a softer yet still energetic peak at 10 45 UT. For the first time, we report simultaneous energy spectra of atmospheric neutrons and muons measured in the 10 600 MeV range at Aragats. Broken-power-law fits reveal a clear temporal evolution of acceleration conditions, evidenced by spectral indices declining with energy. These findings highlight the unique capabilities of the ASNT as an instrument for studying extreme solar particle acceleration.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Alfv\'en waves in the temperature anisotropic space plasma with a kappa-Maxwellian distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07893v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersion and damping rate of kinetic Alfv\'en waves are studied in temperature anisotropic space plasma with kappa-Maxwellian distribution. Employing a kinetic approach, the wave frequency and damping rate of kinetic Alfv\'en waves and the modified ion acoustic waves are derived in a low \b{eta} plasma, which both depend on the parameters \k{appa} and . The numerical analyses show that the wave frequency of kinetic Alfv\'en waves is larger in kappa-Maxwellian plasma than that in Maxwellian case. The wave frequency of the modified ion acoustic waves in kappa-Maxwellian plasma is larger in the short-wave region but smaller in the long-wave region than that in Maxwellian case. Again, we found that the damping rate of kinetic Alfv\'en waves in kappa-Maxwellian plasma is stronger than that in Maxwellian case. The damping rate of modified ion acoustic waves in kappa-Maxwellian plasma is stronger in the short-wave region but weaker in the long-wave region than that in Maxwellian case. The impact of the parameter on the two modes is relatively small because we consider the low \b{eta} case. These results are helpful for us to understand better the characteristics of kinetic Alfv\'en waves in space plasma.</description>

      <title>Firehose instability in the space plasma with anisotropic Cairns-distribution electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07894v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the electron firehose mode propagating parallel to the ambient magnetic field in the space plasma with anisotropic Cairns-distribution electrons. The dispersion relation, the wave frequency and the growth rate of electron firehose mode are derived, and the condition for onset of the firehose instability is obtained. We show that the wave frequency and the growth rate both depend significantly on the parameters, such as the parallel electron beta , the nonthermal parameter {\Lambda} and the electron temperature anisotropy Ae , and the anisotropic Cairns-distribution electrons change the instability condition. The numerical analyses show that the wave frequency and the growth rate of the electron firehose mode increase with increase of the parameters. The results may be helpful for understanding the firehose instability in space plasma environments.</description>

      <title>Ion-acoustic shock and solitary waves in magnetized plasma with Cairns-Gurevich distribution electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07895v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propagation properties of ion-acoustic solitary and shock waves in the magnetized viscous plasma with nonthermal trapped electrons are investigated. The Cairns-Gurevich distribution as the electron distribution is considered to describe the plasma nonthermality and particle trapping. By adopting the reductive perturbation technique, we derived the nonlinear Schamel-Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers (SKdVB) equation, and then obtained the ion-acoustic shock and solitary wave solutions of the SKdVB equation for different limiting cases. It is found that the impact of nonthermal parameter {\alpha}, external magnetic field {\Omega}, obliqueness lz, wave speed U0, and the ion kinematic viscosity {\eta}0 can significantly change the characteristics of the shock and solitary waves. These results may be useful for better understanding the propagation of nonlinear structures in space (i.e. Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere, auroral regions) and laboratory plasma with nonthermal trapped electrons.</description>

      <title>Photon Dynamics and Collision Risks in Relativistic Spaceflight: A Comparative Study of Methods and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This dissertation explores the dynamics of relativistic spaceflight, focusing on the risks associated with collisions and photon interactions as a spacecraft approaches velocities near the speed of light. The study emphasizes two primary collision types: (1) collisions with interstellar dust and particles, and (2) interactions with cosmic molecules, specifically hydrogen. Using principles of energy conservation and relativistic mechanics, the energy transfer from these collisions is calculated, showing that even small particles can impart massive energy at relativistic speeds. The dissertation also examines the impact of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, particularly its blue-shifting effect at high velocities, which influences photon interactions with the spacecraft. Additionally, the Schwinger limit, which sets an upper bound on the electromagnetic field strength for sustained relativistic travel, is discussed in the context of photon-induced pair production. Lastly, advanced photon interactions, such as Compton scattering, are analyzed for their role in thermal management and spacecraft design. The findings highlight the importance of shielding, thermal regulation, and collision avoidance strategies in the design of spacecraft for interstellar travel, offering insights into the potential challenges and solutions for achieving relativistic spaceflight.</description>
