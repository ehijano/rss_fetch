      <title>Electrical Transport in the Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in models with the Hatsugai-Kohmoto type of interaction that is local in momentum space thus infinite-range in real space, Kubo formulas neither reproduce the correct thermodynamic susceptibilities, nor yield sensible transport coefficients. Using Kohn's trick to differentiate between metals and insulators by threading a flux in a torus geometry, we uncover the striking property that Hatsugai-Kohmoto models with an interaction-induced gap in the spectrum sustain a current that grows as the linear size at any non-zero flux and which can be either diamagnetic or paramagnetic.</description>

      <title>Probing Random-Bond Disorder Effects on Ferromagnetic Skyrmion Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we examined the impact of disorder in a ferromagnetic skyrmion lattice by introducing random-bond disorder based on two different models for both exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions: Model I, where both interactions present the same disorder distribution and thus the same local distortion, and Model II, where both interactions have different disorder distributions. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we explored the effect of bond disorder on the emergent phases induced by an external magnetic field at different temperatures, varying the disorder amplitude across a range from weak (10%) to strong (200%) regimes. Our study shows that for both models, moderate disorder at low magnetic fields breaks the helical order and induces a topologically non-trivial bimeron phase. We also found that the skyrmion lattice phase loses its periodicity, but surprisingly, the resulting phases retain topological characteristics up to high disorder amplitudes. Moreover, a significant difference between both disorder models is found at large magnetic fields: while in the first model, the high-field skyrmion phase is suppressed by disorder, in the second model, this phase is enhanced and expanded in temperature and magnetic field. Furthermore, for the second model, intermediate values of disorder induce a diluted skyrmion phase and chiral textures emerging from the ferromagnetic phase at low temperatures. Our results are relevant for layered magnets and provide valuable insights into the intricate behavior of skyrmion systems under varying disorder conditions.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and characterization of the novel breathing pyrochlore compound Ba3Tm2Zn5O11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, a novel material from the rare-earth based breathing pyrochlore family, Ba3Tm2Zn5O11, was successfully synthesized. Powder X-ray diffraction and high-resolution powder neutron diffraction confirmed phase purity and crystal structure, while thermogravimetric analysis revealed incongruent melting behavior compared to its counterpart, Ba3Yb2Zn5O11. High-quality single crystals of Ba3Tm2Zn5O11 were grown using the traveling solvent floating zone technique and assessed using Laue diffractometer and single crystal X-ray diffraction. Thermodynamic characterization indicated paramagnetic behavior down to 0.05 K, and inelastic neutron scattering measurements identified distinct crystal electric field bands. Additional low-energy excitation studies on single crystals revealed dispersionless bands at 0.8 and 1 meV. Computed phonon dispersions from first principles calculations ruled out phonons as the source of these modes, further illustrating the puzzling and unique properties of Ba3Tm2Zn5O11.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Surface and Bulk Electromagnetism via Their Dynamics in an Intrinsic Magnetic Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The indirect exchange interaction between local magnetic moments via surface electrons has been long predicted to bolster the surface ferromagnetism in magnetic topological insulators (MTIs), which facilitates the quantum anomalous Hall effect. This unconventional effect is critical to determining the operating temperatures of future topotronic devices. However, the experimental confirmation of this mechanism remains elusive, especially in intrinsic MTIs. Here we combine time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements to elucidate the unique electromagnetism at the surface of an intrinsic MTI MnBi2Te4. Theoretical modeling based on 2D Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions captures the initial quenching of a surface-rooted exchange gap within a factor of two but over-estimates the bulk demagnetization by one order of magnitude. This mechanism directly explains the sizable gap in the quasi-2D electronic state and the nonzero residual magnetization in even-layer MnBi2Te4. Furthermore, it leads to efficient light-induced demagnetization comparable to state-of-the-art magnetophotonic crystals, promising an effective manipulation of magnetism and topological orders for future topotronics.</description>

      <title>Electronic Correlations and Hund's Rule Coupling in Trilayer Nickelate La4Ni3O10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trilayer Ruddlesden-Popper phase La4Ni3O10 has been observed with Tc over 30 K at high pressure in recent experiment, which further expanded the nickelate superconductors family. In this study, we explored the effects of electronic correlations in La4Ni3O10 using density function theory plus dynamical mean-field theory at ambient pressure and high pressure. Our derived spectral functions and Fermi surface of ambient phase are nicely consistent with the experimental results of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, which emphasized the importance of electronic correlations in La4Ni3O10. We also found the electronic correlations in pressured La4Ni3O10 are both orbital-dependent and layer-dependent due to the presence of Hund's rule coupling. There is a competition between Hund's rule coupling and crystal-field splitting, where the Ni-O layers with weaker crystal field splitting energy would have stronger electronic correlations.</description>

      <title>Multinode quantum spin liquids in extended Kitaev honeycomb models: the view from variational Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the discovery by variational Monte Carlo (VMC) methods of a series of multinode quantum spin liquids (QSLs) in extended Kitaev models on the honeycomb lattice. Like the gapless Kitaev spin liquid with its two nodes at K and K$^\prime$, these multinode QSLs are characterized by an emergent Z$_2$ gauge structure and a discrete number of symmetry-protected Majorana cones in their low-energy excitation spectrum. Because the cones are gapped by weak magnetic fields, nonzero Chern numbers are obtained and the ground state becomes one of many possible Abelian or non-Abelian chiral spin liquids. Here we focus on the projective symmetry group (PSG)-guided VMC approach to the Kitaev model with various symmetry-allowed extended interactions. Based on the VMC phase diagrams of these models, we propose a framework for the classification of nodal QSLs that includes the PSG, the chiralities of the cones, and the way in which the cones are symmetry-related. At present, the known candidate Kitaev materials seem to lie outside the parameter regimes of the multinode QSL phases. However, with more than 100 Z$_2$ PSGs for spin-orbit-coupled states on the honeycomb lattice, we anticipate that more than one multinode QSL will be realized experimentally in future work.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall Effect of Magnons from Many-Body Skew Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory of magnonic thermal Hall transport driven by many-body skew scattering. In field-polarized chiral magnets, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction induces three-magnon interactions that violate time-reversal symmetry and interfere with the four-magnon scattering, thereby breaking microscopic detailed balance and causing thermal Hall currents. This mechanism operates without disorder or Berry curvature and is intrinsic to interacting spin systems. We argue that it can be as significant as the band-geometric anomalous velocity, highlighting the importance of magnon correlations in thermal Hall physics.</description>

      <title>Exchange enhanced switching by alternating fields in quantum antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information can be stored magnetically in antiferromagnets ultrafast since their characteristic times are on the picosecond scale. Various spin torques have proven to be important for efficient and high-speed magnetic memories. So far, this has been understood on the classical level by solving the equations of motion for macrospins describing the collective motion of the sublattice magnetizations. Since spins and hence magnetizations are deeply rooted in quantum mechanics, we show that the exchange enhanced manipulation of sublattice magnetizations extends to quantum antiferromagnets as well. To this end, we solve the time-dependent mean-field equations for Schwinger boson theory under external alternating magnetic fields. Exchange enhancement persists on the quantum level which includes dephasing effects. Significantly lower fields are sufficient to control the sublattice magnetization than for uniform fields which holds great promises for the realization of ultrafast magnetic storage devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillation study of the large magnetoresistance in Mo substituted WTe$_2$ single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The list of interesting electrical properties exhibited by transition metal dichalcogenides has grown with the discovery of extremely large magnetoresistance (MR) and type-II Weyl semimetal behaviour in WTe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$. The extremely large MR in WTe$_2$ is still not adequately understood. Here, we systematically study the effect of Mo substitution on the quantum oscillations in the MR in WTe$_2$. The MR decreases with Mo substitution, however, the carrier concentrations extracted from the quantum oscillations show that the charge compensation improves. We believe that earlier interpretations based on the two-band theory, which attribute the decrease in MR to charge imbalance, could be incorrect due to over-parametrization. We attribute the decrease in MR in the presence of charge compensation to a fall in transport mobility, which is evident from the residual resistivity ratio data. The quantum scattering time and the effective masses do not change within experimental errors upon substitution.</description>

      <title>Distinct charge and spin recovery dynamics in a photo-excited Mott insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pump-probe response of the spin-orbit coupled Mott insulator Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ reveals a rapid creation of low energy optical weight and suppression of three dimensional magnetic order on laser pumping. Post pump there is a quick reduction of the optical weight but a very slow recovery of the magnetic order - the difference is attributed to weak inter-layer exchange in Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ delaying the recovery of three dimensional magnetic order. We demonstrate that the effect has a very different and more fundamental origin. Combining spatio-temporal mean field dynamics and Langevin dynamics on the photoexcited Mott-Hubbard insulator we show that the timescale difference is not a dimensional effect but is intrinsic to charge dynamics versus order reconstruction in a correlated system. In two dimensions itself we obtain a short, almost pump fluence independent, timescale for charge dynamics while recovery time of magnetic order involves domain growth and increases rapidly with fluence. Apart from resolving the iridate Mott problem our approach can be used to analyse phase competition and spatial ordering in superconductors and charge ordered systems out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>A review on magnetic field induced spin crossover in LaCoO$_{3}$ up to 600 T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \lco{} is known for its two-step spin crossover as a function of temperature. Despite efforts spanning over half a century, the origin of this phenomenon is still debated, particularly regarding how the microscopic spin states are involved in the observed macroscopic two-step spin crossover. High magnetic field studies on LaCoO$_{3}$ are performed because the magnetic field-induced spin crossover is induced, where the magnetic excited states become more stable in high magnetic fields than the non-magnetic ground states. This review focuses on the findings in LaCoO$_{3}$ at high magnetic fields over the last decade. A complex phase diagram has been revealed at high magnetic fields instead of solving the conventional problem of LaCoO$_{3}$. It suggests that appreciable spin state correlations are in play in LaCoO$_{3}$. The possibility of exciton condensation is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-phonon coupling underlies a number of diverse range of phenomena of recent interest, particularly in transition metal insulators with strong spin-orbit effects, where it may give rise to hybrid magnetoelastic excitations, and the controversial phonon thermal Hall effect. In this work, we describe a general approach to the first principles estimation of generic spin-orbit-phonon couplings suitable for investigating these diverse effects. The method is demonstrated by application to study the temperature-dependent optical phonon lineshapes in MnPSe$_3$, for which we find quantitative agreement with recent experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a recently developed first-principles based approach for treating generic spin-phonon couplings in materials with strong spin-orbit coupling to study $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Of particular focus is the potential for this material to exhibit a phonon thermal Hall effect induced by spin-phonon interactions. We find that spin-orbit coupling significantly enriches the form of these interactions, and imbues them with chirality that is conducive to generating finite phonon Berry curvatures. We show that this leads to a phonon thermal Hall effect that qualitatively reproduces the measured field dependence of $\kappa_{xy}$ without requiring a field-induced spin liquid.</description>

      <title>A novel reentrant susceptibility due to vortex and magnetic dipole interaction in a La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 and Gd2O3 composite system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reentrant behavior of temperature dependent magnetic ac-susceptibility (or excess susceptibility(ES)) at lower temperature is observed in a composite made of superconductor $La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_4$ (LCu) and an insulating paramagnetic salt $Gd_2O_3$ (GdO). The ES exhibits an exponential characteristic that varies with temperature ($\exp,[\frac{T_0}{T}]$), T0 is characteristics temperature. The characteristics temperature,T$_0$, decreases as the effective interface diminishes and the amplitude of the dc magnetic field increases. The creation of ferromagnetic dimers between Gd$^{+3}$ ions in GdO is observed as a result of vortex-dipole interaction, which causes the observation of this unusual ES at temperatures much lower than the superconducting onset temperature T$_{S}^{onset}$. This type of ferromagnetic dimer formation much below superconducting transition temperature is found comparable with the formation of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) state and interaction between these YSR state.</description>

      <title>Core-level signature of long-range charge-density-wave order and short-range excitonic correlations probed by attosecond broadband spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly-correlated quantum materials are characterized by a multitude of time- and energy-scales that govern quasiparticle interactions and excitations, and a precise understanding of their ground state properties necessitate an access to experimental observables that are both sensitive to the establishment of long-range order and short-range correlations. Advances in attosecond core-level spectroscopes have successfully unlocked the fastest process involving carrier dynamics in these systems, yet they are not traditionally regarded as an appropriate probe for long-range order due to their local charge sensitivity or for the low-energy physics that governs the ground-state properties of strongly-correlated materials. Here, employing a unique cryogenic attosecond broadband extreme-ultraviolet beamline, we identified clear core-level signatures of long-range charge-density-wave (CDW) formation in an excitonic insulator candidate, titanium diselenide in its 1T phase, although equilibrium measurements of the same core levels in either photoemission or absorption spectroscopy showed no observable signals about the phase transition. Leveraging intrinsic sensitivity to short-range charge excitations in core-level absorption spectra, we observed direct time-domain evidence for incoherent excitonic correlations in the normal-state of the material, whose presence has been subjected to a long-standing debate in equilibrium experiments due to the existence of CDW phonon fluctuations in a similar part of the phase space. Our results demonstrated the importance of simultaneous accesses to long- and short-range ordering with underlying dynamical processes spanning decades of time- and energy-scales, making attosecond broadband spectroscopy an indispensable tool for both understanding the equilibrium phase diagram and for discovering novel, nonequilibrium states in correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Contrasting magnetothermal conductivity in sibling Co-based honeycomb-lattice antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Honeycomb-lattice antiferromagnets have attracted wide attention for exploration of exotic heat transport and their interplay with magnetic excitations. In this work, we have revealed a contrasting behavior in the magneto-thermal conductivity (MTC) between two Co-based honeycomb-lattice magnets Co4M2O9 (M = Nb, Ta), despite their identical lattice structures and quite similar magnetism. Co4Ta2O9 exhibits enhanced MTC of about 550% at 9 T of an in-plane magnetic field, comparable to other honeycomb-magnets, while MTC for Co4Nb2O9 reaches only ~30%. This marked difference is ascribed to distinct features in the field-induced evolution of magnetic excitations that resonantly scatter phonons. This finding sheds light on implicit impacts of non-magnetic ions on thermal transport, and hints at the potential for broad heat-transport tunability while preserving magnetism and lattice structures.</description>

      <title>Orbital origin of magnetic moment enhancement induced by charge density wave in kagome FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions among various electronic states such as CDW, magnetism, and superconductivity are of high significance in strongly correlated systems. While significant progress has been made in understanding the relationship between CDW and superconductivity, the interplay between CDW and magnetic order remains largely elusive. Kagome lattices, which intertwine nontrivial topology, charge order, and magnetism, offer an ideal platform for such studies. The kagome magnet FeGe, hosting the unique coupling between CDW and magnetism, has recently garnered considerable attention in that respect. Here we reveal the significant role of the orbital coupling effect during the CDW phase transition, highlighting the orbital origin of the magnetic moment enhancement in FeGe. Our X ray absorption experiments and first principles calculations illuminate the temperature dependent behavior of Fe3d_Ge4p orbital hybridization and corroborate its pivotal impact on the magnetic properties of FeGe. These findings introduce an orbital dimension to the correlation between charge and magnetic degrees of freedom, advancing our understanding of the intriguing quantum phases resulting from this interplay.</description>

      <title>Exploring topological spin order by inverse Hamiltonian design: A new stabilization mechanism for square skyrmion crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework to construct a real-space spin model based on the inverse Hamiltonian design. The method provides an efficient way of realizing unconventional topological spin textures by optimizing the interaction parameters. In order to demonstrate its usefulness, we show that the tuning of the long-range exchange interactions can give rise to a square skyrmion crystal even without factors that have been previously identified as prerequisites for its stabilization, such as Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, multi-spin interaction, and bond-dependent magnetic anisotropy. Moreover, we elucidate the essence for the emergence of the square skyrmion crystal by classifying the parameter sets we get by the method. Since the present framework by adopting machine learning techniques can be universally applied to any magnetic system irrespective of lattice structures, it serves as the efficient construction of an effective spin model and the understanding of the stabilization mechanisms for unconventional topological spin orders.</description>

      <title>Universal properties of residual moments in heavy-fermion metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify common features, seen across a wide range of actinide and lanthanide based heavy-fermion metals, that we associate with the universal properties of the residual moments generated by Kondo hybridisation. The features include the opposing anisotropies of the effective moments and Curie-Weiss constants, the reorientation of the magnetic easy axis, the hard-axis susceptibility maximum and the hard-axis metamagnetic transition. The extension of large-$N$ Read-Newns theory to the underscreened Kondo lattice allows us to study large magnetic fluctuations of residual local moments in the presence of strong $f$-$d$ hybridisation. We derive an effective Hamiltonian for the residual moments and show that competing single-ion and exchange anisotropies are responsible for the easy-axis reorientation. We identify a strong-coupling regime, where the temperature of the easy-axis reorientation is {\it directly proportional} to the coherence temperature and find good agreement across several Eu and U based heavy-fermion families, as well as a weak-coupling regime, where the easy axis flips just before the onset of magnetic order, as is seen in many Ce and Yb heavy-fermion compounds. We show that the exchange anisotropy of the residual moments can also generate a maximum in the hard-axis susceptibility, and find good agreement with UTe$_2$ at low pressures, suggesting that this material is particularly well described by the single-channel $S=1$ model. Finally, we speculate on the possible pairing interactions generated by the fluctuations of the residual moments.</description>

      <title>Pairing by disorder of dopants in a magnetic spin ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I demonstrate a pairing mechanism of dopants in a magnetic lattice, emerging from the underlying \emph{high-temperature disorder} of the spins. The effect is demonstrated in a mixed-dimensional model, where dopants travel along a two-leg ladder, while the spins feature Ising interactions along the rungs and the legs of the ladder. The dynamics following the sudden immersion of two nearest neighbor dopants in an infinite temperature spin lattice shows that thermal spin disorder frustrates the relative motion of the dopants and enforces them to co-propagate. The predictions are shown to be realistically testable in quantum simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>From domain walls and the stripe phase to full suppression of charge density wave in the superconducting 1T-Ti$_{1-\text{x}}$Ta$_\text{x}$Se$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 1T-TiSe$_2$ hosts a $2 \times 2 \times 2$ charge density wave (CDW) that is known to form the state with localized domains separated by the domain walls upon Cu intercalation. The CDW state with the domain wall network has attracted significant interest due to its coexistence with superconductivity. Here we present a scanning tunneling microscopy, transport and magnetic susceptibility study of 1T-Ti$_{1-\text{x}}$Ta$_\text{x}$Se$_2$. Ta substitution for Ti atoms allows us to perform experiments over the wide range of doping ($ 0 \leqslant \text{x} \leqslant 0.2$), providing access to a significantly broader phase diagram than Cu intercalation experiments. At x = 0.02, we observe a complex network of domains and domain walls. We identify two distinct types of domain walls and show their structure with atomic resolution. Additionally, an elusive symmetry-breaking stripe CDW is found at the light substitution of x = 0.02. We also measure highly substituted x = 0.2 crystals that are superconducting despite the full collapse of the CDW order. Our results uncover rich CDW physics in Ta-substituted 1T-TiSe2 crystals and illuminate the interplay between the CDW and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Structural and Magnetic properties of Ge0.5Mn0.5Co2O4 using neutron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural and magnetic properties of Ge0.5Mn0.5Co2O4 (GMCO) have been investigated in detail utilizing neutron powder diffraction (NPD), x-ray diffraction (XRD), DC magnetometry, and heat capacity analysis and compared with GeCo2O4. Despite both compounds exhibiting a cubic structure at room temperature, a substantial difference on low temperature structural properties have been observed for GMCO, indicating the effect of Mn substitution on crystal structure. The magnetic and heat capacity data reveal a ferrimagnetic ordering around 108 K in GMCO. A minor secondary phase is confirmed which undergoes long range AFM ordering at further lower temperatures. This secondary phase remains undetected in XRD due to identical lattice parameters. Furthermore, the analysis of heat capacity data indicates a broadening of the high-temperature transition, attributing to the short-range correlation persisting up to higher temperatures. The estimated magnetic entropy amounts is 63% of the value expected for GMCO. The missing entropy is likely linked with the short-range magnetic correlations persisting well above the transition temperature. Cation distribution at the A and B sites has been estimated in GMCO using NPD. Magnetic structures are also confirmed in the main phase as well as in the secondary phase using NPD analysis. The high-temperature transition corresponds to the ferrimagnetic ordering of A and B site cations in the main phase. A collinear ferrimagnetic arrangement of A and B site spins aligned parallel to c axis is observed. The average values of A and B site moments in the ferrimagnetic phase at 5 K are 2.31(3) and 1.82(3)mB, respectively, with the temperature dependence of moments following the expected power law behavior. The low-temperature ordering is attributed to the antiferromagnetic ordering of B site ions associated with the secondary phase, something similar to GeCo2O4.</description>

      <title>Feynman diagrammatics based on discrete pole representations: A path to renormalized perturbation theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By merging algorithmic Matsubara integration with discrete pole representations we present a procedure to generate fully analytic closed form results for impurity problems at fixed perturbation order. To demonstrate the utility of this approach we study the Bethe lattice and evaluate the second order self-energy for which reliable benchmarks exist. We show that, when evaluating diagrams on the Matsubara axis, the analytic sums of pole representations are extremely precise. We point out the absence of a numerical sign problem in the evaluation, and explore the application of the same procedure for real-frequency evaluation of diagrams. We find that real-frequency results are subject to noise that is controlled at low temperatures and can be mitigated at additional computational expense. We further demonstrate the utility of this approach by evaluating dynamical mean-field and bold diagrammatic self-consistency schemes at both second and fourth order and compare to benchmarks where available.</description>

      <title>Crystalline-Symmetry-Protected Majorana Modes in Coupled Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a minimalist architecture for achieving various crystalline-symmetry-protected Majorana modes in an array of coupled quantum dots. Our framework is motivated by the recent experimental demonstrations of two-site and three-site artificial Kitaev chains in a similar setup. We find that introducing a $\pi$-phase domain wall in the Kitaev chain leads to a pair of mirror-protected Majorana zero modes located at or near the junction. Joining two $\pi$-junctions into a closed loop, we can simulate two distinct classes of two-dimensional higher-order topological superconducting phases, both carrying symmetry-protected Majorana modes around the sample corners. As an extension of the $\pi$-junction, we further consider a general vertex structure where $n$ Kitaev chains meet, i.e., a Kitaev $n$-vertex. We prove that such an $n$-vertex, if respecting a dihedral symmetry group $D_n$, necessarily carries $n$ vertex-bound Majorana modes protected by the $D_n$ symmetry. Resilience of the junction and vertex Majorana bound states against disorder and correlation effects is also discussed. Our architecture paves the way for designing, constructing, and exploring a wide variety of artificial topological crystalline phases in experiments.</description>

      <title>Pressure Tuning the Mixture of Eu$^{2+}$ and Eu$^{3+}$ in Eu$_4$Bi$_6$Se$_{13}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The investigation of crystallographic, electronic, and magnetic characteristics, especially the mixed valences of Eu$^{2+}$ and Eu$^{3+}$ under pressure of a novel europium-based bismuth selenide compound, Eu$_4$Bi$_6$Se$_{13}$, presented. This new compound adopts a monoclinic crystal structure classified under the P$2_1$/m space group (#11). It exhibits distinctive structural features, including substantial Eu-Se coordination numbers, Bi-Se ladders, and linear chains of Eu atoms that propagate along the b-axis. Electronic resistivity assessments indicate that Eu$_{4}$Bi$_{6}$Se$_{13}$ exhibits weak metallic behaviors. Magnetic characterization reveals uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, with a notable spin transition at approximately 1.2 T when the magnetic field is oriented along the b-axis. This behavior, coupled with the specific Eu-Eu interatomic distances and the magnetic saturation observed at low fields, supports the identification of metamagnetic properties attributable to the flipping of europium spins. The Curie-Weiss analysis of the magnetic susceptibility measured both perpendicular and parallel to the b-axis and high-pressure partial fluorescence yield (PFY) results detected by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveal the tendency of the material to enter a mixed valent state where the trivalent state becomes more prominent with the pressure increase or temperature decrease.</description>

      <title>Novel Skyrmion and spin wave solutions in superconducting ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coexistence of Ferromagnetism and superconductivity in so called ferromagnetic superconductors is an intriguing phenomenon which may lead to novel physical effects as well as applications. Here in this work we have explored the interplay of topological excitations, namely vortices and skyrmions, in ferromagnetic superconductors using a field theoretic description of such systems. In particular, numerical solutions for the continuous spin field compatible to a given vortex profile are determined in absence and presence of a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) term. The solutions show that the spin configuration is like a skyrmion but intertwined with the vortex structure -- the radius of the the skyrmion-like solution depends on the penetration depth and also the polarity of the skyrmion depends on the sign of the winding number. Thus our solution describes a novel topological structure -- namely a skyrmion-vortex composite. We have also determined the spin wave solutions in such systems in presence and absence of a vortex. In absence of vortex frequency and wave vector satisfy a cubic equation which leads to various interesting features. In particular, we have shown that in the low frequency regime the minimum in dispersion relation shifts from $k=0$ to a non zero $k$ value depending on the parameters. We also discuss the nature of spin wave dispersion in the $\omega \sim \Tilde{m}$ regime which shows a similar pattern in the dispersion curve. The group velocity of the spin wave would change it's sign across such a minimum which is unique to FMSC. Also, the spin wave modes around the local minimum looks like roton mode in superfluid and hence called a magnetic roton. In presence of a vortex, the spin wave amplitude is shown to vary spatially such that the profile looks like that of a N\'eel Skyrmion. Possible experimental signature of both solutions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Electronic Correlations in Multiferroic van der Waals CuCrP$_2$S6: Insights From X-Ray Spectroscopy and DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic structure of high-quality van der Waals multiferroic CuCrP$_2$S6 crystals was investigated applying photoelectron spectroscopy methods in combination with DFT analysis. Using X-ray photoelectron and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy at the Cu L2,3 and Cr L2,3 absorption edges we determine the charge states of ions in the studied compound. Analyzing the systematic NEXAFS and resonant photoelectron spectroscopy data at the Cu/Cr L2,3 absorption edges allowed us to assign the CuCrP$_2$S6 material to a Mott-Hubbard type insulator and identify different Auger-decay channels (participator vs. spectator) during absorption and autoionization processes. Spectroscopic and theoretical data obtained for CuCrP$_2$S6 are very important for the detailed understanding of the electronic structure and electron-correlations phenomena in different layered materials, that will drive their further applications in different areas, like electronics, spintronics, sensing, and catalysis.</description>

Abstract: We study the micorscopic origin of the multiple superconducting and magnetic phases observed in CeRh$_2$As$_2$. We exploit the existence of a van Hove singularity enforced by the nonsymmorphic symmetry to conduct a renormalization group analysis. When Fermi-surface nesting is strong, we find two closely-competing superconducting states with opposite parities, as well as an instability towards specific spin-density wave states, consistent with key features of the phase diagram of CeRh$_2$As$_2$.</description>

      <title>MnRhBi3: A Cleavable Antiferromagnetic Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cleavable metallic antiferromagnets may be of use for low-dissipation spintronic devices; however, few are currently known. Here we present orthorhombic MnRhBi3 as one such compound and present a thorough study of its physical properties. Exfoliation is demonstrated experimentally, and the cleavage energy and electronic structure are examined by density functional theory calculations. It is concluded that MnRhBi3 is a van der Waals layered material that cleaves easily between neighboring Bi layers, and that the Bi atoms have lone pairs extending into the van der Waals gaps. A series of four phase transitions are observed below room temperature, and neutron diffraction shows that at least two of the transitions involve the formation of antiferromagnetic order. Anomalous thermal expansion points to a crystallographic phase transition and/or strong magnetoelastic coupling. This work reveals a complex phase evolution in MnRhBi3 and establishes this cleavable antiferromagnetic metal as an interesting material for studying the interplay of structure, magnetism, and transport in the bulk and ultrathin limits as well as the role of lone pair electrons in interface chemistry and proximity effects in van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has deeply changed the paradigms of many research fields. At the heart of chemical and physical sciences is the accurate ab initio calculation of many-body wavefunction, which has become one of the most notable examples to demonstrate the power of deep learning in science. In particular, the introduction of deep learning into quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) has significantly advanced the frontier of ab initio calculation, offering a universal tool to solve the electronic structure of materials and molecules. Deep learning QMC architectures were initial designed and tested on small molecules, focusing on comparisons with other state-of-the-art ab initio methods. Methodological developments, including extensions to real solids and periodic models, have been rapidly progressing and reported applications are fast expanding. This review covers the theoretical foundation of deep learning QMC for solids, the neural network wavefunction ansatz, and various of other methodological developments. Applications on computing energy, electron density, electric polarization, force and stress of real solids are also reviewed. The methods have also been extended to other periodic systems and finite temperature calculations. The review highlights the potentials and existing challenges of deep learning QMC in materials chemistry and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Adaptive variational quantum computing approaches for Green's functions and nonlinear susceptibilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present and benchmark quantum computing approaches for calculating real-time single-particle Green's functions and nonlinear susceptibilities of Hamiltonian systems. The approaches leverage adaptive variational quantum algorithms for state preparation and propagation. Using automatically generated compact circuits, the dynamical evolution is performed over sufficiently long times to achieve adequate frequency resolution of the response functions. We showcase accurate Green's function calculations using a statevector simulator for Fermi-Hubbard chains of 4 and 6 sites, with maximal circuit depth of 65 and 424 layers, respectively. Additionally, we consider an antiferromagnetic quantum spin-1 model that incorporates the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction to illustrate calculations of the third-order nonlinear susceptibilities, which can be measured in two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy experiments. These results demonstrate that real-time approaches using adaptive parameterized circuits to evaluate linear and nonlinear response functions can be feasible with near-term quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Representing Arbitrary Ground States of Toric Code by Restricted Boltzmann Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically analyze the representability of toric code ground states by Restricted Boltzmann Machine with only local connections between hidden and visible neurons. This analysis is pivotal for evaluating the model's capability to represent diverse ground states, thus enhancing our understanding of its strengths and weaknesses. Subsequently, we modify the Restricted Boltzmann Machine to accommodate arbitrary ground states by introducing essential non-local connections efficiently. The new model is not only analytically solvable but also demonstrates efficient and accurate performance when solved using machine learning techniques. Then we generalize our the model from $Z_2$ to $Z_n$ toric code and discuss future directions.</description>

      <title>Pair Density Waves and Supercurrent Diode Effect in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metallic altermagnets are unusual collinear magnets that feature zero net magnetization with momentum-dependent spin splitting. Here, we show that this spin splitting can induce pair density wave states even in the absence of external magnetic fields. Focusing on BCS-type attractive interactions, we find the stabilization of symmetrically distinct pair density wave states depending on the chemical potential. These states include Fulde-Ferrell and Fulde-Ferrell* states, both of which break inversion symmetry. We investigate the supercurrent properties and discover non-reciprocal supercurrents for both the Fulde-Ferrell and Fulde-Ferrell* states with distinct spatial dependencies. We propose that the supercurrent diode effect can serve as an experimental tool for distinguishing between different pair density waves in metallic altermagnets and discuss the relation to material candidates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum systems with geometrical frustration remain an outstanding challenge for numerical simulations due to the infamous numerical sign problem. Here, we overcome this obstruction via complex path integration in a geometrically frustrated ladder of interacting bosons at finite density. This enables studies of the many-body ground state properties, otherwise inaccessible with standard quantum Monte Carlo methods. Specifically, we study a chemical potential tuned quantum phase transition, along which we track the emergence of quasi-long-range order and critical softening of the single particle gap. We chart future methodological improvements and applications in generalized geometrically frustrated lattice models.</description>

      <title>Low temperature spin Seebeck effect in non-magnetic vanadium dioxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) is sensitive to thermally driven magnetic excitations in magnetic insulators. Vanadium dioxide in its insulating low temperature phase is expected to lack magnetic degrees of freedom, as vanadium atoms are thought to form singlets upon dimerization of the vanadium chains. Instead, we find a paramagnetic SSE response in VO2 films that grows as the temperature decreases below 50 K. The field and temperature dependent SSE voltage is qualitatively consistent with a general model of paramagnetic SSE response and inconsistent with triplet spin transport. Quantitative estimates find a spin Seebeck coefficient comparable in magnitude to that observed in strongly magnetic materials. The microscopic nature of the magnetic excitations in VO2 requires further examination.</description>

      <title>Looking at the magnetic properties of half metal from the paramagnetic phase: DFT+DMFT study of exchange interactions in CrO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06892v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study magnetic properties of CrO$_2$ within the density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) approach in the paramagnetic phase. We consider the 3-orbital (per Cr site) model, containing only $t_{2g}$ states, the $5$-orbital model, including all $d$-states, as well as the model including also the oxygen $p$-states. Using the recently proposed approach of calculation of exchange interactions in paramagnetic phase, we extract exchange interaction parameters and magnon dispersions for these models. While the magnon dispersion in the 3-orbital model possesses negative branches in accordance with previous studies in ferromagnetic phase, this drawback is removed in the $5$-orbital model. The model including oxygen states (with purely local interaction at chromium sites) overestimates the exchange interactions and spin wave stiffness. While this overestimate is partly corrected by including non-local interaction between chromium and oxygen states within mean-field approximation, the $5$-orbital model appears as most adequate for describing magnetic properties of CrO$_2$ with local Coulomb interaction. The possibility of describing magnetic properties of this material starting from paramagnetic phase points to the correspondence of magnetic properties in this phase and ferromagnetic phase and possible important contributions of double exchange in paramagnetic phase of CrO$_2$.</description>

Abstract: We propose the representation principle to study physical systems with a given symmetry. In the context of symmetry enriched topological orders, we give the appropriate representation category, the category of SET orders. For fusion n-category symmetries, we show that the category of SET orders encodes almost all information about the interplay between symmetry and topological orders, in a natural and canonical way. These information include defects and boundaries of SET orders, symmetry charges, explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking, stacking of SET orders, gauging of generalized symmetry, as well as quantum currents (SymTFT or symmetry TO). We also provide a detailed categorical algorithm to compute the generalized gauging. In particular, we proved that gauging is always reversible, as a special type of Morita-equivalence. The explicit data for ungauging, the inverse to gauging, is given.</description>

      <title>Rise and Fall of Anderson Localization by Lattice Vibrations: A Time-Dependent Machine Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intricate relationship between electrons and the crystal lattice is a linchpin in condensed matter, traditionally described by the Fr\"ohlich model encompassing the lowest-order lattice-electron coupling. Recently developed quantum acoustics, emphasizing the wave nature of lattice vibrations, has enabled the exploration of previously uncharted territories of electron-lattice interaction not accessible with conventional tools such as perturbation theory. In this context, our agenda here is two-fold. First, we showcase the application of machine learning methods to categorize various interaction regimes within the subtle interplay of electrons and the dynamical lattice landscape. Second, we shed light on a nebulous region of electron dynamics identified by the machine learning approach and then attribute it to transient localization, where strong lattice vibrations result in a momentary Anderson prison for electronic wavepackets, which are later released by the evolution of the lattice. Overall, our research illuminates the spectrum of dynamics within the Fr\"ohlich model, such as transient localization, which has been suggested as a pivotal factor contributing to the mysteries surrounding strange metals. Furthermore, this paves the way for utilizing time-dependent perspectives in machine learning techniques for designing materials with tailored electron-lattice properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum dynamics of the intrinsic metric profoundly influence the neutral excitations in the fractional quantum Hall system, as established by Haldane in 2011 \cite{Haldane2011}, and further evidenced by a recent two-photon experiment \cite{Liang2024}. Despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic properties of these excitations, especially at long wavelengths, continues to elude interest. In this study, we employ tensor-network methods to investigate the neutral excitations of the Laughlin and Moore-Read states on an infinite cylinder. This investigation deepens our understanding of the excitation spectrum in regions where traditional methods do not work effectively. The spectral functions for both states reveal the presence of $S=-2$ geometric excitations. For the first time, we unveil the complex spectra of both neutral fermion and bosonic Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman modes within the excitation continuum by calculating the three-particle density response function for the Moore-Read state. Our findings support the hypothesis of emergent supersymmetry and highlight the potential for detecting neutral fermions in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Gauging modulated symmetries: Kramers-Wannier dualities and non-invertible reflections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modulated symmetries are internal symmetries that act in a non-uniform, spatially modulated way and are generalizations of, for example, dipole symmetries. In this paper, we systematically study the gauging of finite Abelian modulated symmetries in ${1+1}$ dimensions. Working with local Hamiltonians of spin chains, we explore the dual symmetries after gauging and their potential new spatial modulations. We establish sufficient conditions for the existence of an isomorphism between the modulated symmetries and their dual, naturally implemented by lattice reflections. For instance, in systems of prime qudits, translation invariance guarantees this isomorphism. For non-prime qudits, we show using techniques from ring theory that this isomorphism can also exist, although it is not guaranteed by lattice translation symmetry alone. From this isomorphism, we identify new Kramers-Wannier dualities and construct related non-invertible reflection symmetry operators using sequential quantum circuits. Notably, this non-invertible reflection symmetry exists even when the system lacks ordinary reflection symmetry. Throughout the paper, we illustrate these results using various simple toy models.</description>

Abstract: The unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz is a promising tool for achieving high-precision results using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm in the NISQ era. However, results on quantum hardware are thus far very limited and simulations have only accessed small system sizes. We advance the state of the art of UCC simulations by utilizing an efficient sparse wavefunction circuit solver and studying systems up to 64 qubits. Here we report results obtained using this solver that demonstrate the power of the UCC ansatz and address pressing questions about optimal initial parameterizations and circuit construction, among others. Our approach enables meaningful benchmarking of the UCC ansatz, a crucial step in assessing the utility of VQE for achieving quantum advantage.</description>

Abstract: We provide a simple algorithm for constructing Hamiltonian graph cycles (visiting every vertex exactly once) on a set of arbitrarily large finite subgraphs of aperiodic two-dimensional Ammann-Beenker (AB) tilings. Using this result, and the discrete scale symmetry of AB tilings, we find exact solutions to a range of other problems which lie in the complexity class NP-complete for general graphs. These include the equal-weight traveling salesperson problem, providing, for example, the most efficient route a scanning tunneling microscope tip could take to image the atoms of physical quasicrystals with AB symmetries; the longest path problem, whose solution demonstrates that collections of flexible molecules of any length can adsorb onto AB quasicrystal surfaces at density one, with possible applications to catalysis; and the three-coloring problem, giving ground states for the $q$-state Potts model ($q \ge 3$) of magnetic interactions defined on the planar dual to AB, which may provide useful models for protein folding.</description>

      <title>Structure and scaling of Kitaev chain across a quantum critical point in real space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spatial Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) is applied to the Kitaev chain with inhomogeneous pairing interactions that vanish in half of the lattice and result in a quantum critical point separating the superfluid and normal-gas phases in real space. The weakly-interacting BCS theory predicts scaling behavior of the penetration of the pair wavefunction into the normal-gas region different from conventional power-law results due to the non-analytic dependence of the BCS order parameter on the interaction. The Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equation produces numerical results confirming the scaling behavior and hints complications in the strong-interaction regime. The limiting case of the step-function quench shows the dominance of the BCS coherence length in absence of additional length scale. Furthermore, the energy spectrum and wavefunctions from the BdG equation show abundant in-gap states from the normal-gas region in addition to the topological edge states.</description>

Abstract: Boundary effects play an interesting role in finite-size physical systems. In this work, we study the boundary-induced properties of 1+1-dimensional critical systems driven by inhomogeneous M\"obius-like quenches. We focus on the entanglement entropy in BCFTs with a large central charge and a sparse spectrum of low-dimensional operators. We find that the choice of boundary conditions leads to different scenarios of dynamical phase transitions. We also derive these results in a holographic description in terms of intersecting branes in AdS$_3$, and find a precise match.</description>

      <title>Learning topological states from randomized measurements using variational tensor network tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning faithful representations of quantum states is crucial to fully characterizing the variety of many-body states created on quantum processors. While various tomographic methods such as classical shadow and MPS tomography have shown promise in characterizing a wide class of quantum states, they face unique limitations in detecting topologically ordered two-dimensional states. To address this problem, we implement and study a heuristic tomographic method that combines variational optimization on tensor networks with randomized measurement techniques. Using this approach, we demonstrate its ability to learn the ground state of the surface code Hamiltonian as well as an experimentally realizable quantum spin liquid state. In particular, we perform numerical experiments using MPS ans\"atze and systematically investigate the sample complexity required to achieve high fidelities for systems of sizes up to $48$ qubits. In addition, we provide theoretical insights into the scaling of our learning algorithm by analyzing the statistical properties of maximum likelihood estimation. Notably, our method is sample-efficient and experimentally friendly, only requiring snapshots of the quantum state measured randomly in the $X$ or $Z$ bases. Using this subset of measurements, our approach can effectively learn any real pure states represented by tensor networks, and we rigorously prove that random-$XZ$ measurements are tomographically complete for such states.</description>

      <title>A study of three butterflies: entanglement wedge method, OTOC and pole-skipping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate two salient chaotic features, namely Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, in the context of an asymptotically Lifshitz black hole background with an arbitrary critical exponent. These features are computed using three methods: entanglement wedge method, out-of-time-ordered correlator computation and pole-skipping. We present a comparative study of the aforementioned features where all of these methods yield exactly similar results for the butterfly velocity and Lyapunov exponent. This establishes an equivalence between all three methods for probing chaos in the chosen gravity background. Furthermore, we evaluate the chaos at the classical level by computing the eikonal phase and Lyapunov exponent from the bulk gravity. These quantities emerge as nontrivial functions of the anisotropy index. By examining the classical eikonal phase, we uncover different scattering scenarios in the near-horizon and near-boundary regimes. We also discuss potential limitations regarding the choice of the turning point of the null geodesic in our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exactly solvable spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg distorted diamond chain in the presence of the external magnetic field is investigated for the case of antiferromagnetic Ising and ferromagnetic XXZ Heisenberg interactions. The influence of quantum fluctuations and the distortion on the ground state, magnetic and thermal properties of the model are studied in detail. In particular, it is established that the zero-temperature magnetization curve may involve intermediate plateaus just at zero and 1/3 of the saturation magnetization. It is demonstrated that the temperature dependence of the specific heat reveals up to four distinct peaks at zero magnetic field and up to five distinct peaks at a weak magnetic field. The physical origin of all observed additional peaks of the specific heat has been clarified on the grounds of dominating thermal excitations. We have shown that the quantum fluctuations give rise to an effective geometrical frustration in this chain.</description>
