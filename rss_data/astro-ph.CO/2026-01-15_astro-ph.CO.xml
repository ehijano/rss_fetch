      <title>Note on pulsar timing array correlation functions induced by peculiar velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several papers have recently calculated the contribution to pulsar timing array overlap reduction functions (ORFs) induced by our peculiar velocity with respect to the rest frame of the stochastic gravitational-wave background. Here we show that a harmonic-space calculation confirms the most recent result. We note that, with the harmonic-space calculation, the ORFs for spin-1 GWs and the correlations with astrometry measurements are also easily obtained.</description>

      <title>A comparative test of different pressure profile models in clusters of galaxies using recent ACT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The electron pressure profile is a convenient tool to characterize the thermodynamical state of a galaxy cluster, with several studies adopting a "universal" functional form.
  Aims. This study aims at using Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) data to test four different functional forms for the cluster pressure profile: generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (gNFW), $\beta$-model, polytropic, and exponential. The goal is to assess to what level they are universal over a population-level cluster sample.
  Methods. A set of 3496 ACT-DR4 galaxy clusters, spanning the mass range $[10^{14},10^{15.1}]\,\text{M}_{\odot}$ and the redshift range $[0,2]$, is stacked on the ACT-DR6 Compton parameter $y$ map over $\sim13,000\,\text{deg}^2$. An angular Compton profile is then extracted and modeled using the theoretical pressure recipes, whose free parameters are constrained against the measurement via a multi-stage MCMC approach. The analysis is repeated over cluster subsamples spanning smaller mass and redshift ranges.
  Results. All functional forms are effective in reproducing the measured $y$ profiles within their error bars, without a clearly favored model. While best-fit estimates are in broad agreement with previous findings, hints of residual subsample dependency are detected favoring higher amplitudes and steeper profiles in high-mass, low-redshift clusters.
  Conclusions. Population-level cluster studies based on SZ data alone are likely unable to accurately constrain different pressure profile models. Residual trends at population level and scatter at individual cluster level undermine the universal pressure model assumption whenever high precision is required. Finally, functional forms different from the gNFW prove equally effective while being more physically motivated.</description>

      <title>A possible pathway to UHZ1-type systems at z~10 by heterogeneous mass primordial black holes as dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent space-based observations discovered several unusual objects, exhibiting similar properties, at redshifts $z\gtrsim 10$. Among them is the UHZ1 system at $z=10.1$, containing $\sim 10^8M_\odot$ in stars, with a similarly massive central black hole of $\sim 10^{7-8}M_\odot$. Here we propose a possible mechanism for forming such systems which hinges on the presence of primordial black holes (PBHs) covering a range of masses while contributing a significant fraction of the dark matter (DM). We evaluate the accurate expression for the small-scale power responsible for the collapse of the first halos in the presence of the PBH population. The extra power in the matter density field, produced by the granulation term, will cause an earlier collapse of DM halos, populated by PBHs of different masses. In these collapsed and virialized systems the PBHs will undergo 2-body relaxation, driving the more massive PBHs to the halo center under dynamical friction. We quantify this evolution for a distribution of PBH orbital parameters and halo properties. The analysis shows that PBHs can have appropriate mass functions capable of producing systems with parameters similar to what is observed for UHZ1. We suggest that the proposed mechanism could account for a subset of other systems newly discovered with the JWST at high redshifts, including the Little Red Dots.</description>

      <title>Bound Dark Energy: Particle Physics model in alignment with recent DESI cosmological measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observational constraints on the Bound Dark Energy Cold Dark Matter (BDE-CDM) model using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements combined with Planck CMB data and Type Ia supernovae compilations (PantheonPlus, Union3, DESY5). In BDE-CDM, dark energy originates from the lightest meson field within a supersymmetric SU(3) dark gauge group with $N_f = 6$ flavors, governed by an inverse power-law potential $V(\phi) = \Lambda_{c}^{4+2/3} \phi^{-2/3}$. Unlike $\Lambda$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM, the dark energy sector contains no free parameters -- the condensation scale $\Lambda_c$ and transition epoch $a_c$ are determined by gauge coupling unification constraints. The equation of state evolves from relativistic behavior ($w = 1/3$) before condensation through a kinetic-dominated stiff phase ($w \simeq 1$), approaching $w_0 = -0.9298 \pm 0.0003$ at present, with $w &gt; -1$ maintained throughout cosmic history, avoiding phantom-regime instabilities. We obtain $\Lambda_{c} = 43.93 \pm 0.13$~eV and $a_c = (2.489 \pm 0.007) \times 10^{-6}$, consistent with theoretical predictions. The $w_0$-$w_a$ confidence contours are approximately 10,000 times smaller than those of $w_0w_a$CDM while achieving comparable fits, and remain stable across different supernova datasets. Statistical analysis yields $\Delta\mathrm{DIC} = -6.77$ and $\Delta\mathrm{AIC} = -8.97$ relative to $\Lambda$CDM for BAO+DESY5, constituting strong evidence favoring BDE-CDM model. The model predicts distinctive signatures including 25\% enhancement in the matter power spectrum at $k \approx 4.3\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. These results establish BDE-CDM as a theoretically motivated framework that successfully addresses the DESI-observed preference for dynamical dark energy while connecting particle physics with cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Tidal alignment and tidal torquing modeling for the cosmic shear three-point correlation function and mass aperture skewness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model for the intrinsic alignment contamination of the shear three-point correlation function and skewness of the mass aperture statistic using the tidal alignment and tidal torquing (TATT) formalism. We compute the intrinsic alignment bispectra components in terms of the TATT model parameters. We consider two effective field theory approaches in the literature, relate them to the TATT model parameters and an extension to TATT that includes the velocity-shear (VS) parameter. We compare the impact of changing between NLA, TATT, and TATT+VS on the theoretical computation of the 3PCF using the best fit parameters and tomographic redshift distributions from Dark Energy Survey Year 3. We find that the TATT model significantly impacts the skewed triangle configurations of the 3PCF. Additionally, including the higher-order effects from TATT can introduce opposite effects on the two-point function and on the mass aperture skewness, damping the signal of the former while boosting the signal of the latter. We argue that a joint 2PCF+3PCF analysis with the TATT model can help break the degeneracy between its model parameters and provide more robust constraints on both cosmology and intrinsic alignment amplitude parameters. We show that typical values of order unity for the intrinsic alignment parameters introduce differences of around $10\%$ between NLA and TATT predictions.</description>

      <title>Owl-z: a Bayesian tool to select z \geq 7 quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Owl-z, a Bayesian code aiming at identifying z \geq 7 quasars in wide field optical and near-infrared surveys. By construction,the code can also be used to select objects that contaminate the high-z quasar population, i.e. brown dwarfs and early-type galaxies at intermediate redshifts. The code can be adapted for the selection of high-z galaxies, and although it has been tuned to the Euclid Wide Survey, it can be easily adapted to other photometric surveys. The code input data are the object's photometric data and its galactic longitude and latitude, and the code output data are the probabilities of the modelled populations of high-z quasars, brown dwarfs and early-type galaxies at intermediate redshift. As part of the validation, Owl-z could re-identify all spectroscopically confirmed quasars at z \geq 7, demonstrating the code's versatility in applying to different photometric catalogues. The performance of Owl-z, based on a metric combining completeness and purity called F-measure, is analysed in the case of Euclid using simulated data in a wide range of redshifts (7 \leq z \leq 12) and H-band Euclid magnitudes (18 \leq H_E \leq 24.5). The results show that Owl-z reaches full performance for bright sources (H_E \lesssim 22), independently of the redshift. We show that the probability threshold used to select promising quasar candidates can be adjusted after processing to fine-tune the F-measure value of candidates depending on their magnitude and redshift estimates. We show that for objects brighter than about two magnitudes above the survey detection limit, Owl-z provides a classification that will facilitate the optimisation of photometric and spectroscopic confirmation campaigns. In conclusion, Owl-z is a powerful public tool to help select high-z quasars, brown dwarfs or early-type galaxies at intermediate redshifts in Euclid or other wide-field surveys.</description>

      <title>Time delay measurements with Broken Power Law model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key challenges in strong gravitational lensing cosmography is the accurate measurement of time delays between multiple lensed images, which are essential for constraining the Hubble constant ($H_0$). We investigate how lens mass-profile assumptions affect time delays. Specifically, we implement a Broken Power Law (BPL) mass model within the Lenstronomy framework (Birrer &amp; Amara 2018), which introduces additional flexibility in the radial mass distribution and can phenomenologically capture deviations from a single power-law profile. This model is combined with a numerical approach to compute time delays at the image positions. We validate the BPL implementation using simulated lenses and compare the results with those obtained from the elliptical power-law (EPL) model. We then apply both model families to the quadruply imaged quasar WGD~2038-4008. Both models fit the imaging and kinematic data comparably well, yet the greater radial freedom in the BPL model shifts the inferred time-delay distance -- and thus $H_0$ -- by an amount comparable to the current discrepancy between early- and late-universe $H_0$ estimates. In a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, the $H_0$ inferred using the BPL lens model is $75^{+23.1}_{-16.3} \ \mathrm{km \ s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}},$ while the EPL model gives $H_0 = 61^{+19.2}_{-13.2} \ \mathrm{km \ s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}}.$ This difference is largely due to uncertainties in the inner mass profile ($\theta&lt;0.2''$), a region where point spread function (PSF) reconstruction is a critical factor -- a finding consistent with results reported in Shajib et al. (2022). This highlights how time-delay cosmography remains sensitive to assumptions about the lens mass profile. With current precision, this difference does not favor one cosmological scenario over another, but rather underscores the importance of flexible mass modeling and PSF modeling.</description>

      <title>Collapse versus Disruption: The Fate of Compact Stellar Systems in Ultralight Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interference of the ultralight dark matter (ULDM) field generates time-varying gravitational potential fluctuations, which stochastically heat stellar systems embedded in ULDM halos. Small-sized stellar systems are therefore often used to set stringent constraints on ULDM. However, the evolution of systems with sizes well below the ULDM de Broglie wavelength remains poorly explored. Using numerical simulations, we show that the evolution of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos is governed by the interplay between internal stellar relaxation and ULDM-induced heating. We find the following main results. First, in sufficiently compact systems, relaxation-driven core collapse dominates, allowing the system to remain bound and dense, while ULDM-induced stripping of outer stars further accelerates the collapse. Second, in more extended systems, ULDM heating dominates and ultimately disrupts the system. Near the disruption threshold, we identify systems resembling ultra-faint dwarfs like Segue 1. Third, we further introduce a dimensionless parameter to quantify the relative importance of heating and relaxation and finally lead to an evolutionary phase diagram. Our results reveal the rich and nontrivial dynamics of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos, indicating that precise system modeling is essential for robust ULDM constraints.</description>

      <title>Resolving Hubble tension and locating missing baryons: Synergies between fast radio bursts and emerging cosmological probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two of the most pressing challenges in cosmology are the persistent discrepancy in measurements of the Hubble constant, referred to as the Hubble tension, and the deficit of baryons in the local Universe, known as the missing baryon problem. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) encode the integrated electron column density along their lines of sight, offering a unique probe of both the cosmic expansion rate ($H_0$) and the baryon density ($\Omega_{\rm b}$). However, constraints from FRBs alone suffer from a severe $H_0$-$\Omega_{\rm b}$ degeneracy that prevents them from resolving either problem independently. We show that this degeneracy can be broken by combining FRBs with other emerging probes whose degeneracy directions differ in the $H_0$-$\Omega_{\rm b}$ plane. Specifically, we quantify three multi-messenger approaches: FRBs paired with gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens, strong gravitational lensing (SGL) time delays, and 21 cm intensity mapping (IM). The combinations FRB+GW, FRB+SGL, and FRB+21 cm IM each deliver simultaneous constraints on $H_0$ and $\Omega_{\rm b}$ better than ($1\%$, $1\%$) in the $\Lambda$CDM model, ($1.5\%$, $2\%$) in the $w$CDM model, and ($2\%$, $3.5\%$) in the CPL model. Moreover, in a model-independent framework, both FRB+GW and FRB+SGL constrain $H_0$ and $\Omega_{\rm b}$ to better than ($1\%$, $2\%$) precision. These results demonstrate that the synergy between FRBs and other emerging probes holds great promise for resolving the Hubble tension and locating the missing baryons.</description>

      <title>A New Constraint on the Optical Depth from the Reionization History Independent of CMB Large-Scale E-Mode Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies report a mild discrepancy between baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements within the $\Lambda$CDM framework. This discrepancy could be explained if the optical depth $\tau$ inferred from the CMB large-scale E-mode polarization is underestimated, which may be biased by foreground-subtraction or instrumental systematics. In this work, we present a determination of $\tau$ independent of the large-scale E-mode polarization, using the latest measurements of the redshift evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction $x_\mathrm{HI}(z)$, which is constrained by Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and damping-wing absorption measurements at $z\sim5$-$14$, based on ground-based optical and JWST observations. Combining $x_\mathrm{HI}(z)$ with the Planck CMB power spectra excluding the large-scale E-mode polarization, we obtain $\tau=0.0552^{+0.0019}_{-0.0026}$, a stringent constraint consistent with the previous CMB results including the large-scale E-mode. We also evaluate a potential systematic error in our method associated with absorption modeling, obtaining $\tau=0.0552^{+0.0075}_{-0.0049}$. Using this constraint on $\tau$, we resolve the degeneracy in the $\tau$-$\Omega_m$ plane and find a $2.4\sigma$ tension with the DESI DR2 BAO results, thereby confirming the claimed mild discrepancy suggestive of physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, we derive an upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses, $\Sigma m_\nu&lt;0.0550\,(0.0717)$ eV at the 95% (99%) confidence level. This limit favors the normal mass ordering and, when combined with the lower limits from neutrino oscillation experiments, yields a further constraint, $\Sigma m_\nu=0.0594_{-0.0007}^{+0.0113}$ eV. However, the cosmological upper limit and the oscillation-based lower limit show a mild $2.2\sigma$ tension, providing an independent indication of possible physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Chiellini-Integrable Cosmologies with Phantom Divide Crossing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate exact cosmological solutions with a massive scalar field minimally coupled to the Einstein-Hilbert action in General Relativity. For an extended Higgs-like scalar self-interaction, we find that the resulting field equations belong to the damped Ermakov-Painlev\'e II class and construct novel analytical solutions within the framework of the Chiellini integrability condition. We analyze whether the expanding branch of the solutions can describe a late-time cosmic acceleration, using a combined statistical analysis of BAO, CMB, cosmic chronometer and Pantheon+SHOES supernova datasets. A crucial outcome of this exercise is the analytical emergence of a smooth phantom divide crossing in the dark energy equation of state, achieved without introducing any pathological instabilities. The reconstruction yields a present-day Hubble parameter $H_0 \gtrsim 70 \,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, with a reduced tension relative to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The results indicate that Chiellini-integrable scalar cosmologies are capable of providing a robust and analytically controlled framework for modeling late-time cosmic acceleration and phantom divide crossing, offering a viable alternative to phenomenological dark-energy parametrizations.</description>

      <title>Sub-Leading Logarithms for Scalar Potential Models on de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continual production of long wavelength scalars and gravitons during inflation injects secular growth into loop corrections which would be constant in flat space. One typically finds that each additional factor of the loop counting parameter can induce up to a certain number of logarithms of the scale factor. Loop corrections that attain this number are known as ``leading logarithms''; those with fewer are sub-leading. Starobinsky's stochastic formalism has long been known to reproduce the leading logarithms of scalar potential models. We show that the first sub-leading logarithm is captured by applying the stochastic formalism to a certain part of the 1-loop effective potential. This is checked at 2-loops for a massless, minimally coupled scalar with a quartic self-interaction on de Sitter background.</description>

      <title>The Second CHIME/FRB Catalog of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 4539 fast radio bursts (FRBs) observed with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope between 25 July 2018 and 15 September 2023. These bursts originate from 3641 unique sources, including 981 bursts from 83 known repeating sources. For each FRB, the catalog provides a $O(10')$ estimate of sky location along with corresponding measurements of cumulative exposure time and survey sensitivity over the observing period. It includes a total-intensity dynamic spectrum between 400 and 800 MHz at 0.983 ms resolution. From this spectrum, we constrain a model of the burst morphology and measure key parameters such as arrival time, intrinsic temporal width, dispersion measure, scattering time, and flux density. This second catalog includes all FRBs from the first catalog, with every event reprocessed using a uniform and improved analysis framework. We show that previously published inferences remain valid under the updated measurements. We assess consistency of the detection rate across observational parameters, present initial distributions of burst properties, and outline ongoing and future studies that will use this catalog to investigate the nature of FRBs and their utility as astrophysical and cosmological probes.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Piecewise Power-Law Reconstruction of the Gravitational-Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The NANOGrav 15-year (NG15) data set provides evidence for a gravitational-wave background (GWB) signal at nanohertz frequencies, which is expected to originate either from a cosmic population of inspiraling supermassive black-hole binaries or new particle physics in the early Universe. A firm identification of the source of the NG15 signal requires an accurate reconstruction of its frequency spectrum. In this paper, we provide such a spectral characterization of the NG15 signal based on a piecewise power-law (PPL) ansatz that strikes a balance between existing alternatives in the literature. Our PPL reconstruction is more flexible than the standard constant-power-law model, which describes the GWB spectrum in terms of only two parameters: an amplitude A and a spectral index gamma. Concurrently, it better approximates physically realistic GWB spectra -- especially those of cosmological origin -- than the free spectral model, since the latter allows for arbitrary variations in the GWB amplitude from one frequency bin to the next. Our PPL reconstruction of the NG15 signal relies on individual PPL models with a fixed number of internal nodes (i.e., constant power law, broken power law, doubly broken power law, etc.) that are ultimately combined in a Bayesian model average. The data products resulting from our analysis provide the basis for fast refits of spectral GWB models.</description>

      <title>Constant-roll $\beta$-exponential inflation: Palatini formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the inflationary dynamics of the $\beta$-exponential potential model, where a scalar field couples to quadratic $(R + R^2)$ gravity. In this model, the inflaton is the field that determines the size of the extra dimension. We employ the Palatini formalism to derive the resulting Einstein-frame generalized $k$-inflation effective theory, which we analyze under the assumption that the constant-roll condition is satisfied.
  We scan the parameter space for inflationary predictions, specifically the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, ensuring consistency with the results from ACT DR6. The compliant regions are depicted accordingly. For a suitable range of the model parameters, the values obtained for the inflationary observables align with the most recent observations by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration and/or the Planck mission.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Constraints on Non-Thermal Light Massive Relics from Future CMB Experiments (CMB-S4/Simons Observatory)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we present Fisher forecasts on \textit{non-thermal LiMR} models for a CMB Stage IV-like experiment and the Simons Observatory -- particularly focusing on a model of inflaton/moduli decay giving rise to non-thermally distributed dark sector particles, and also comparing our results with those for sterile particles following the Dodelson-Widrow distribution. Two independent parameters, $\Delta N_\mathrm{eff}$ and $M_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{eff}$, influence linear cosmological observables. We find $\Delta N_\mathrm{eff}$ to be more tightly constrained (by a factor of $10$) for a less abundant, heavier LiMR which becomes fully non-relativistic around matter-radiation equality than a more abundant, lighter LiMR which becomes fully non-relativistic just after recombination. The uncertainties on $M_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{eff}$ differ by a factor of $\sim3$ between the two cases. Our analysis also reveals distinct parameter correlations: the phenomenological parameters $\{\Delta N_\mathrm{eff},M_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{eff}\}$ are found to be negatively correlated for the former case and positively correlated for the latter. We obtain similar projected uncertainties on the cosmological parameters (in either case) for both the inflaton/moduli decay and the Dodelson-Widrow models when the first two moments of the LiMR distribution function, related to the phenomenological parameters, are matched. Finally, by constructing a modified distribution that matches the first two moments of the Dodelson-Widrow but deviates maximally in the third moment, we demonstrate that CMB Stage IV data is not expected to be sensitive to higher moments of the distribution.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Cosmic Distance Duality with Megamasers and DESI DR2 Observations: Model Independent Constraints on Early-Late Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cosmic Distance Duality Relation (CDDR) connects the angular diameter distance ($d_A$) and the luminosity distance ($d_L$) at a given redshift. This fundamental relation holds in any metric theory of gravity, provided that photon number is conserved and light propagates along null geodesics. A deviation from this relation could indicate new physics beyond the standard cosmological model. In this work, we test the validity of the CDDR at very low redshifts ($z &lt; 0.04$) by combining $d_A$ from the Megamaser Cosmology Project with $d_L$ from the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa). We further incorporate high-redshift Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO)-based $d_A$ measurements from DESI DR2 in combination with SNIa data, highlighting the critical role of the $r_d-M_b$ (early-late) calibration in testing the CDDR using these two probes. Assuming CDDR holds, we perform a Bayesian analysis to derive model-independent constraints on the calibration parameters. Using only BAO and SNIa data, we observe a strong degeneracy between $r_d$ and $M_b$. However, the inclusion of calibration-free Megamaser measurements breaks this degeneracy, enabling independent constraints without relying on a specific cosmological model or distance-ladder techniques. Additionally, we present a forecast incorporating the expected precision from future Megamaser and SNIa observations, demonstrating their potential to significantly tighten constraints on early-late calibration parameters, under the assumption of validity of CDDR.</description>

      <title>Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 1. $\Lambda$CDM Constraints from the Power Spectrum and Bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first independent re-analysis of the galaxy clustering data from DESI Data Release 1, utilizing an effective field theory full-shape model. We analyze the power spectra and bispectra of the public catalogs using a custom-built pipeline based on window-deconvolved quasi-optimal estimators, accounting for a number of systematic effects. Compared to the official collaboration analysis, we add the galaxy power spectrum hexadecapole and the bispectrum monopole, and also introduce a novel stochastic estimator for fiber collisions, which facilitates robust bispectrum analyses. As a first application, we perform a full-shape analysis of the DESI power spectra and bispectra in the context of the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Using external priors on the physical baryon density and the primordial power spectrum tilt, we constrain the matter density fraction to $\Omega_m=0.284\pm 0.011$, the Hubble constant to $H_0=70.7\pm 1.1$ km/s/Mpc, and the mass fluctuation amplitude to $\sigma_8=0.811\pm 0.030$. The bispectrum sharpens constraints on $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ by $\approx 10\%$ and shifts $\Omega_m$ by $\approx 1\sigma$ towards the \textit{Planck} $\Lambda$CDM value. Combining our full-shape likelihood with the official DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmological parameters shift further towards the \textit{Planck} values, with $\Omega_m=0.296\pm 0.007$, $H_0=68.8\pm 0.6$ km/s/Mpc, $\sigma_8=0.818\pm 0.029$ (with tighter constraints obtained in joint analyses). Similar results are obtained in a joint analysis with DR1 BAO, accounting for the cross-covariance. Finally, the bispectrum data improves measurements of quadratic bias parameters, which are consistent with predictions from halo occupation distribution models. Our work highlights the importance of higher-order statistics and sets the stage for upcoming full-shape analyses of non-minimal cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Higher order methods for Radiative Transfer in Astrophysical simulations: Pn vs M1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In current cosmological simulations, the radiative transfer modules generally rely on the M1 approximation, which has some glaring flaws related to its fluid-like behaviour, such as spurious pseudo-sources and loss of directionality when radiation fronts from different directions collide. Pn, another moment-based model used in other fields of physics, may correct these issues. We aim at testing out Pn in an astrophysical setting and compare it to M1, in order to see if it can indeed correct M1's flaws. Also, we want to use Pn's solutions to better pinpoint M1 errors. We implement a Pn radiation transport method and couple it to a photo-thermo-chemistry module to account for the interaction of ionising radiation with the Hydrogen gas, and benchmark it using tests for radiative transfer models comparison in astrophysics as defined in arXiv:astro-ph/0603199. We find that high order P_n (e.g. P9) indeed correct M1's flaws, while faring as well or even better in some aspects in the tests, in particular when directionality is important or colliding radiation fronts occur. By comparing P9 and M1 radiation fields in an idealised and cosmological test case, we highlight a new, thus far unreported artefact of M_1, the 'dark sombrero'. A dark sombrero appears as a spherical photon-deficit shell around the source. The photon density in dark sombreros can be underestimated by a factor up to 2-3. They occur in regions where a source's radiation field connects with that of another source or group of sources. These basic properties (position and amplitude) of the dark sombreros may depend on the sources' relative intensities, positions, spatial resolution, although we have not been able to test this in detail in this study.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Signatures of Axion Dark Matter via Parity-Violating Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate axion-like particles coupled to gravity through a parity-violating Chern-Simons (CS) interaction. In this framework, axion dark matter (DM) can decay into pairs of circularly polarized gravitons, producing a persistent, nearly monochromatic GW signal. We compute the expected signal at Earth assuming a Navarro-Frenk-White Galactic halo model with the corresponding velocity distribution, and compare it with the narrowband sensitivities of the LIGO O4 run and the projected reach of the Einstein Telescope. The resulting bounds on the axion-graviton coupling $\alpha$ improve upon the cosmological stability requirement for axion masses $m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-11}$ eV, excluding values up to four orders of magnitude below the stability limit. This constitutes a robust direct terrestrial constraint on the axion-gravity CS coupling. We also discuss distinctive observational signatures, such as circular polarization asymmetries, annual modulation, and potential enhancements from DM substructures, which could serve as smoking-gun evidence for parity-violating gravitational interactions.</description>

      <title>Universal numerical convergence criteria for subhalo tidal evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter subhalos and satellite galaxies in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations still suffer from the ``overmerging'' problem, where inadequate force and/or mass resolution cause artificially enhanced tidal mass loss and premature disruption. Previous idealized simulations addressing this issue have been restricted to a small subset of the subhalo orbital parameter space, and all assumed subhalos to be isotropic. Here, we present the first extensive simulation suite that quantifies numerical convergence in the tidal evolution of anisotropic subhalos under varying numerical resolutions and orbits. We report a universal force resolution criterion: the subhalo's instantaneous tidal radius must always be resolved by at least 20 cells in adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)-based simulations, or by 20 softening lengths (Plummer equivalent) in tree-based simulations, regardless of refinement details or subhalo physical properties such as concentration or velocity anisotropy. We also report a universal expression for the discreteness-noise-driven scatter in the bound-mass fraction of subhalos that depends only on the subhalo mass resolution at infall and the instantaneous bound mass fraction, agnostic of any further subhalo properties. Such stochastic discreteness noise causes both premature disruption and, notably, spurious survival of poorly mass-resolved subhalos. We demonstrate that as many as 50 percent of all subhalos in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations are likely to be either force and/or mass unresolved. Our findings advocate for adaptive softening or grid refinement based on the instantaneous tidal radius of the subhalo.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves from Scalar Backreaction in Axion-SU(2) Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we perform the first numerical study of strong scalar backreaction in spectator chromo-natural inflation (SCNI) in the case where the spectator sector decays during inflation. The tachyonic instability in scalar fluctuations, activated as the system crosses the $m_Q = \sqrt{2}$ threshold, amplifies perturbations and may significantly alter the background dynamics. The strong scalar backreaction regime introduces an effective quartic term in the potential for the gauge field background that rapidly drives it to zero, accelerating the axion-gauge system decay. We describe the dynamics of such decay and derive the gravitational wave spectrum for a set of benchmark parameters. Interestingly, the signal may peak at interferometer scales and lie within LISA's projected sensitivity.</description>

Abstract: We study a massive-photon electrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in the curved spacetime of Einstein's gravity. We consider a Proca-type photon mass and present equations in terms of electric and magnetic (EM) fields and the vector potential. We present the electrodynamics and MHD in the covariant and ADM formulations valid in general spacetime and in linearly perturbed cosmological spacetime. We present wave equations assuming the metric variations are negligible compared with the field variations. Equations are derived without fixing the temporal gauge condition and the gauge transformation properties of the EM fields and the vector potential are presented. Using the post-Newtonian approximation we show the dark Proca field behaves as dust in the non-relativistic limit under the Klein transformation.</description>

Abstract: Neural simulation-based inference (SBI) is a popular set of methods for Bayesian inference when models are only available in the form of a simulator. These methods are widely used in the sciences and engineering, where writing down a likelihood can be significantly more challenging than constructing a simulator. However, the performance of neural SBI can suffer when simulators are computationally expensive, thereby limiting the number of simulations that can be performed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to neural SBI which leverages multilevel Monte Carlo techniques for settings where several simulators of varying cost and fidelity are available. We demonstrate through both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments that our method can significantly enhance the accuracy of SBI methods given a fixed computational budget.</description>

      <title>Charged Loops at the Cosmological Collider with Chemical Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological collider physics allows the detection of heavy particles at inflationary scales through their imprints on primordial non-Gaussianities. We study the chemical potential mechanism applied to a pair of charged scalars. We analytically evaluate the resulting one-loop contribution to the bispectrum, using the spectral decomposition. In this way we are able to determine the parametric dependences for both the signal and the background. We show that a signal strength $f_{\mathrm{NL}}\sim O(0.01)$ can be obtained within theoretical control, potentially reachable by 21cm tomography. As an application we consider the colored Higgs bosons in $\mathrm{SU}(5)$ supersymmetric orbifold grand unification with masses $M\lesssim10^{15}\:\mathrm{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Targeted Searches for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first targeted searches for continuous gravitational waves (CWs) from 114 active galactic nuclei (AGN) that may host supermassive black hole binaries, using the NANOGrav 15 yr data set. By incorporating electromagnetic priors on sky location, distance, redshift, and CW frequency, our strain and chirp mass upper limits are typically improved by a factor of $\sim 2$ (median 2.2) relative to all-sky limits at the same frequency. Bayesian comparisons against a model including only a Hellings-Downs correlated background disfavors a CW signal for all targets, with a mean Bayes factor of $0.73 \pm 0.32$. Two targets have Bayes factors slightly above unity, but coherence tests, random targeting experiments, and a conservative accounting of the 114-target trials factor all indicate that they are consistent with noise. We use these two candidates as worked examples to illustrate an end-to-end targeted CW search analysis and a suite of follow up tests that future promising candidates would need to pass. We find that the electromagnetic interpretations of both candidates are ambiguous, and we update the constraints on a putative binary in 3C 66B, ruling out part of its previously allowed parameter space. Ultimately, our results demonstrate the current sensitivity of targeted pulsar timing array searches for CWs and define a roadmap for future multimessenger CW detections.</description>

      <title>Overlapping of photon rings in black hole imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22804v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the overlapping of photon rings - higher-order images of a black hole's luminous environment, concentrated near the shadow boundary and expected to be resolved in future observations. We consider a broad class of static spherically symmetric spacetimes and geometrically thin equatorial accretion disk with a prescribed inner radius and infinite outer extent, viewed by a polar observer. Depending on the inner radius of the disk, the thickness of each photon ring varies, and the rings may or may not overlap. By overlapping, we mean that portions of images appear at the same angular position on the observer's sky. To characterize the overlapping, we introduce the radius of merging - the value of the disk's inner radius at which two photon rings of given orders begin to overlap. Since each radius of merging is labeled by two indices corresponding to the image orders, it becomes possible to arrange these radii in the form of an infinite-dimensional matrix where only the upper right-hand corner is filled. This matrix, which we call the "matrix of merging", is a signature of spacetime only, and, once known, it provides a qualitative understanding of the overlapping pattern for any chosen value of the inner radius of the disk. Remarkably, the matrix of merging exhibits several universal properties that hold for all spherically symmetric metrics and can be established even without explicit calculation of light trajectories. Based on these properties, we demonstrate that certain overlapping patterns are universally forbidden across all such spacetimes and for any inner radius of the disk. Examples for the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes are provided. The main application of our study is constraining the spacetime metric and the accretion model using observed photon ring overlaps.</description>
