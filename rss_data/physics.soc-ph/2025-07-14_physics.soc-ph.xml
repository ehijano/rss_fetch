      <title>Access graph: a novel graph representation of public transport networks for accessibility analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accessibility, defined as travel impedance between spatially dispersed opportunities for activity, is one of the main determinants of public transport (PT) use. In-depth understanding of its properties is crucial for optimal public transport systems planning and design. Although the concept has been around for decades and there is a large body of literature on accessibility operationalisation and measurement, a unified approach is lacking. To this end, we introduce a novel graph representation of public transport networks, termed the access graph, based on the shortest paths between nodes. Shortest paths are calculated using the in-vehicle time-weighted L- and frequency-weighted P-space representations to determine generalised travel times. Then there is an edge between two nodes in the access graph if the travel time between them is below a certain threshold time budget. In this representation, node degree directly measures the number of nodes reachable within a predetermined time. We study the threshold-dependent evolution of the access graph, focusing on average degree and degree distributions. Based on the topological properties of the access graph, we define a set of accessibility indicators. In addition, we propose indicators of access equity. We apply the methodology to a dataset of 51 metro networks worldwide. In all cases, a logistic-like growth of average degree with time budget is observed, indicating universal behaviour of accessibility and exhibiting the value of the proposed representation for unified accessibility studies and its potential for comparative analyses. We see a great potential for the access graph to drive in-depth studies of accessibility.</description>

      <title>The State of Computational Science in Fission and Fusion Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tools used to engineer something are just as important as the thing that is actually being engineered. In fact, in many cases, the tools can indeed determine what is engineerable. In fusion and fission1 energy engineering, software has become the dominant tool for design. For that reason, in 2024, for the first time ever, we asked 103 computational scientists developing the codes used in fusion and fission energy about the problems they are attempting to solve with their codes, the tools available to them to solve them, and their end to end developer experience with said tools.
  The results revealed a changing tide in software tools in fusion and fission, with more and more computational scientists preferring modern programming languages, open-source codes, and modular software. These trends represent a peek into what will happen 5 to 10 years in the future of nuclear engineering. Since the majority of our respondents belonged to US national labs and universities, these results hint at the most cutting-edge trends in the industry. The insights included in the State of Computational Science in Fission and Fusion Energy indicate a dramatic shift toward multiphysics codes, a drop-off in the use of FORTRAN in favor of more modern languages like Python and C++, and ever-rising budgets for code development, at times reaching $50M in a single organization.
  Our survey paints a future of nuclear engineering codes that is modular in nature, small in terms of compute, and increasingly prioritized by organizations. Access to our results in web form are available online.</description>

      <title>Model-based reconstruction of real-world fractal complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a versatile model for generating fractal complex networks that closely mirror the properties of real-world systems. By combining features of reverse renormalization and evolving network models, the proposed approach introduces several tunable parameters, offering exceptional flexibility in capturing the diverse topologies and scaling behaviors found in both natural and man-made networks. The model effectively replicates their key characteristics such as fractal dimensions, power-law degree distributions, and scale-invariant properties of hierarchically nested boxes. Unlike traditional deterministic models, it incorporates stochasticity into the network growth process, overcoming limitations like discontinuities in degree distributions and rigid size constraints. The model's applicability is demonstrated through its ability to reproduce the structural features of real-world fractal networks, including the Internet, the World Wide Web, and co-authorship networks.</description>

      <title>Universality classes in the time evolution of epidemic outbreaks on complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the full temporal evolution of epidemic outbreaks in complex networks, focusing on the susceptible-infected (SI) model of disease transmission. Combining theoretical analysis with large-scale numerical simulations, we uncover two universal patterns of epidemic growth, determined by the structure of the underlying network. In small-world networks, the prevalence follows a Gompertz-like curve, while in fractal networks it evolves according to Avrami-type dynamics, which is typical of spatially constrained systems. These regimes define distinct universality classes that remain robust across arbitrary transmission rates. Notably, our approach provides explicit analytical formulas for the global epidemic prevalence and class-specific scaling relations capturing its dependence on the transmission rate. We show that the commonly assumed early exponential growth occurs only in small-world networks, where it corresponds to the short-time approximation of the Gompertz function. In contrast, this exponential phase is entirely absent in fractal networks, where spreading is markedly slower and governed by different mechanisms. Our approach clarifies the structural origins of these contrasting behaviors and offer a unified framework for understanding epidemic dynamics across diverse network topologies.</description>

      <title>Swap distance minimization beyond entropy minimization in word order variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14192v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a linguistic structure formed by $n$ elements, for instance, subject, direct object and verb ($n=3$) or subject, direct object, indirect object and verb ($n=4$). We investigate whether the frequency of the $n!$ possible orders is constrained by two principles. First, entropy minimization, a principle that has been suggested to shape natural communication systems at distinct levels of organization. Second, swap distance minimization, namely a preference for word orders that require fewer swaps of adjacent elements to be produced from a source order. We present average swap distance, a novel score for research on swap distance minimization. We find strong evidence of pressure for entropy minimization and swap distance minimization with respect to a die rolling experiment in distinct linguistic structures with $n=3$ or $n=4$. Evidence with respect to a Polya urn process is strong for $n=4$ but weaker for $n=3$. We still find evidence consistent with the action of swap distance minimization when word order frequencies are shuffled, indicating that swap distance minimization effects are beyond pressure to reduce word order entropy.</description>

      <title>Incivility and Contentiousness Spillover in Public Engagement with Public Health and Climate Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Affective polarization and political sorting drive public antagonism around issues at the science-policy nexus. Looking at the COVID-19 period, we study cross-domain spillover of incivility and contentiousness in public engagements with climate change and public health on Twitter and Reddit. We find strong evidence of the signatures of affective polarization surrounding COVID-19 spilling into the climate change domain. Across different social media systems, COVID-19 content is associated with incivility and contentiousness in climate discussions. These patterns of increased antagonism were responsive to pandemic events that made the link between science and public policy more salient. The observed spillover activated along pre-pandemic political cleavages, specifically anti-internationalist populist beliefs, that linked climate policy opposition to vaccine hesitancy. Our findings show how affective polarization in public engagement with science becomes entrenched across science policy domains.</description>

      <title>How stable are the impact factors of major astrophysics journals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the long-term trends in impact factor over the past decade (2015-2014) for seven flagship journals widely used in Astrophysics: ApJ, AJ, ApJL, ApJS,A &amp;A, JCAP, and MNRAS. We check the variation of both the traditional impact factor as well as the median-based impact factor, which we had studied in a previous work. We find that ApJS exhibits the largest drop in impact factor from 14.9 to 9.0, while ApJ and MNRAS show a steady decline from 6.7 to 5.2 and 5.6 to 5.0, respectively. However, the impact factors for AJ and ApJL have shown a steady increase from 4.55 to 5.35 and 6.4 to 9.7, respectively. The median-based impact factors are much more stable showing variations of at most $\pm 1$ within the last decade.</description>
