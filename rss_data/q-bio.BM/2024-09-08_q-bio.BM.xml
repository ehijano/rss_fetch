      <title>CoPRA: Bridging Cross-domain Pretrained Sequence Models with Complex Structures for Protein-RNA Binding Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately measuring protein-RNA binding affinity is crucial in many biological processes and drug design. Previous computational methods for protein-RNA binding affinity prediction rely on either sequence or structure features, unable to capture the binding mechanisms comprehensively. The recent emerging pre-trained language models trained on massive unsupervised sequences of protein and RNA have shown strong representation ability for various in-domain downstream tasks, including binding site prediction. However, applying different-domain language models collaboratively for complex-level tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose CoPRA to bridge pre-trained language models from different biological domains via Complex structure for Protein-RNA binding Affinity prediction. We demonstrate for the first time that cross-biological modal language models can collaborate to improve binding affinity prediction. We propose a Co-Former to combine the cross-modal sequence and structure information and a bi-scope pre-training strategy for improving Co-Former's interaction understanding. Meanwhile, we build the largest protein-RNA binding affinity dataset PRA310 for performance evaluation. We also test our model on a public dataset for mutation effect prediction. CoPRA reaches state-of-the-art performance on all the datasets. We provide extensive analyses and verify that CoPRA can (1) accurately predict the protein-RNA binding affinity; (2) understand the binding affinity change caused by mutations; and (3) benefit from scaling data and model size.</description>

      <title>Specific Nucleic Acid Detection Using a Nanoparticle Hybridization Assay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simple methods to detect biomolecules including specific nucleic acid sequences have received renewed attention since the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus pandemic. Notably, biomolecule detection that uses some form of signal amplification will have some form of amplification-related error, which in the polymerase chain reaction involves mispriming and subsequent signal amplification in the no template control, ultimately providing a limit of detection. To demonstrate the feasibility of the detection of a DNA target sequence without molecular or chemical signal amplification that avoids amplification errors, a gold nanoparticle aggregation assay was developed and tested. Two primers bracketing a 94 base pair target sequence from SARS-CoV-2 were conjugated to 10 nm diameter gold nanoparticles by the salt aging method, with conjugation and primer-target hybridization confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and nanospectrophotometry. Upon mixing of both conjugated nanoparticles with target, a surface plasmon resonance shift of 6 nm was observed, and lower electrophoretic mobility of a band containing both DNA fluorescence and gold absorption signals. This did not occur in the presence of a control DNA molecule of the same size and composition as the target but with a randomly scrambled base position. Nanoparticle tracking at 30 frames per second using a sensitive darkfield microscope revealed a lower measured diffusion coefficient of scattering objects in the target mixture than in the control mixture or with bare gold nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Molecular Design: Integrating Latent Variable and Auto-Regressive Models for Goal Directed Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: De novo molecule design has become a highly active research area, advanced significantly through the use of state-of-the-art generative models. Despite these advances, several fundamental questions remain unanswered as the field increasingly focuses on more complex generative models and sophisticated molecular representations as an answer to the challenges of drug design. In this paper, we return to the simplest representation of molecules, and investigate overlooked limitations of classical generative approaches, particularly Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and auto-regressive models. We propose a hybrid model in the form of a novel regularizer that leverages the strengths of both to improve validity, conditional generation, and style transfer of molecular sequences. Additionally, we provide an in depth discussion of overlooked assumptions of these models' behaviour.</description>
