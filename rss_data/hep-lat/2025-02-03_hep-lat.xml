      <title>First-order phase transitions in the heavy quark region of lattice QCD at high temperatures and high densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If there is a first-order phase transition in the light quark region of 2+1-flavor finite temperature and density QCD and if the region of the first-order phase transition expands with increasing density as suggested by several studies, then, at very high densities, we may expect that the first-order phase transition region expands into the heavy quark region of QCD, where we can perform efficient large scale simulations by adopting an effective theory of heavy quark QCD based on the hopping parameter expansion. In the heavy quark region of QCD, we have another first-order phase transition region around the heavy quark limit at zero density. By numerical simulations of effective heavy quark QCD, we found that, the first-order transition at zero density turns into a crossover as the chemical potential is increased, but, when we increase the chemical potential further, the change in the plaquette value near the crossover point becomes much steeper. This may be suggesting reappearance of the first-order phase transition. In this talk, we first show the nature of the phase transition of phase-quenched finite density QCD in the heavy quark region and then study the effect of the complex phase to discuss whether the QCD phase transition changes again to a first-order phase transition at very high densities.</description>

      <title>Finite-size scaling of Lee-Yang zeros and its application to the 3-state Potts model and heavy-quark QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new general method to study critical points (CP) using the finite-size scaling of Lee-Yang zeros (LYZ). We first study the LYZ in the three-dimensional Ising model on finite lattices. We show that the ratios of multiple LYZ (Lee-Yang-zero ratios: LYZR) have useful scaling properties similar to the Binder cumulants, providing us with a novel method to study CP. In numerical simulations of the Ising model, we confirm that this method works well. We then apply the method to analyze the CP in the three-dimensional three-state Potts model and finite-temperature QCD in heavy-quark region, which are believed to belong to the same universality class as the Ising model. In these models, the partition function at complex parameters can be evaluated by the reweighting method, which allows us to determine the LYZ by varying coupling parameters continuously around the CP. We demonstrate that the LYZR method is powerful in determining the location of the CP in these models.</description>

      <title>Two-color lattice QCD in $(1+1)$ dimensions with Grassmann tensor renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $(1+1)$-dimensional two-color lattice QCD is studied with the Grassmann tensor renormalization group. We construct tensor network representations of theories with the staggered fermion and the Wilson fermion and show that Grassmann tensor networks can describe both cases with the same bond dimension. We also propose an efficient initial tensor compression scheme to gauge degrees of freedom. We compute the number density, chiral condensate, and diquark condensate at finite density, employing the staggered fermions. For the theory with Wilson fermion, a critical point in the negative mass region is identified by inspecting the pseudoscalar condensate and the conformal field theory data.</description>

      <title>Novel Lattice Formulation of 2D Chiral Gauge Theory via Bosonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, lattice formulations of 2D Abelian chiral gauge theory have been constructed based on Abelian bosonization. It is remarkable about these 2D lattice formulations that they reproduce the same gauge anomaly structure as the continuum theory, even at a finite lattice spacing. In this talk, we propose yet another lattice formulation based on the ``excision method'' introduced recently in Ref.~\cite{Abe:2023uan}. This approach respects the admissibility condition, which is a constraint on the smoothness of lattice field configurations; it usually prohibits magnetically charged objects, that is, vector-charged objects in fermion theories. We show that such objects can be defined in the excision method as a lattice defect called a ``hole,'' and discuss the selection rules for charged objects.</description>

      <title>Computing theta-dependent mass spectrum of the 2-flavor Schwinger model in the Hamiltonian formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the $\theta$-dependent mass spectrum of the 2-flavor Schwingr model using the tensor network (DMRG) in the Hamiltonian formalism. The pion and the sigma meson are identified as stable particles of the model for nonzero $\theta$ whereas the eta meson becomes unstable. The meson masses are obtained from the one-point functions, using the meson operators defined by diagonalizing the correlation matrix to deal with the operator mixing. We also compute the dispersion relation directly by measuring the energy and momentum of the excited states, where the mesons are distinguished by the isospin quantum number. We confirmed that the meson masses computed by these methods agree with each other and are consistent with the calculation by the bosonized model. Our methods are free from the sign problem and show a significant improvement in accuracy compared to the conventional Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, at the critical point $\theta = \pi$, the mesons become almost massless, and the one-point functions reproduce the expected CFT-like behavior.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an update on the analysis of semileptonic $B\rightarrow D^{(*)}$ decays at non-zero recoil. Our computation employs $2 + 1 + 1$ FNAL-MILC ensembles with highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action for sea and light valence quarks, while the bottom quark is treated using the clover action in the Fermilab interpretation. Simulations are performed across several lattice spacings, ranging approximately from $\sim 0.15$ fm to $\sim 0.06$ fm, and for various quark masses. We will present an overview of the analysis and show some preliminary results for the form factors.</description>

Abstract: For the exploration of the phase diagram of QCD, effective Polyakov loop theories derived from lattice QCD provide a valuable tool in the heavy quark mass regime. Using mean field approximations these theories are evaluated in the high and low temperature regimes at finite baryon chemical potential. The resulting phase diagram is discussed.</description>

      <title>Results on meson-meson scattering at large $N_\text{c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results on the large $N_\text{c}$ scaling of meson-meson scattering amplitudes. We work in a theory with $N_\text{f}=4$ degenerate quark flavors and run lattice simulations with $N_\text{c}=3-6$ and pion mass $M_\pi\approx 590$ MeV. We focus on three different scattering channels, two of which have the same quantum numbers as some tetraquark candidates recently found at LHCb. Finite-volume energies are extracted using a large set of operators, containing two-particle operators corresponding to two pions or two vector mesons, and local tetraquark operators. Using L\"uscher's quantization condition, we constrain the infinite-volume scattering amplitudes and investigate subleading $N_\text{c}$ corrections to the large $N_\text{c}$ limit. For one of the channels, we find indications of a virtual bound state at $N_\text{c}=3$, which may be related to one of the aforementioned exotic states.</description>

      <title>The Physicist's Guide to the HMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is arguably the most efficient sampling method for general probability distributions of continuous variables. Together with exact Fourier acceleration (EFA) the HMC becomes equivalent to direct sampling for quadratic actions $S(x)=\frac12 x^\mathsf{T} M x$ (i.e. normal distributions $x\sim \mathrm{e}^{-S(x)}$), only perturbatively worse for perturbative deviations of the action from the quadratic case, and it remains viable for arbitrary actions. In this work the most recent improvements of the HMC including EFA and radial updates are collected into a numerical recipe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The applicability of Symanzik Effective Field Theory (SymEFT) for the description of lattice artifacts assumes a local formulation of the lattice theory. We discuss the symmetries realised by tastes local in spacetime of unrooted staggered quarks, approaching mass-degenerate 4-flavour QCD in the continuum limit. An outlook on some implications for the asymptotic lattice-spacing dependence is given for spectral quantities as well as local composite fields.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the vector meson propagator using a generalized eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For long distances in the euclidean time the vector-vector correlator ($\rho$) has an exponentially decreasing signal-to-noise ratio. However, the vector correlator not only consists of the vector meson but also receives contributions from a two-pion system with the same quantum numbers. We measure all two-pion propagators with an energy lower than the mass of the resting vector meson and employ a generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) to resolve the different contributing energy states. Using those we can reconstruct the propagator with a much smaller noise at large euclidean time distances. In this work we present an efficient way to measure two-pion propagators and our results on reconstruction of the vector meson propagator with staggered fermions in a $(6^3\times 8.5)\,\textrm{fm}^4$ box.</description>

      <title>Grassmann tensor approach for two-dimensional QCD in the strong-coupling expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a tensor-network approach for the strong-coupling expansion of two-dimensional QCD with staggered quarks at non-zero chemical potential. After expanding the Boltzmann factor in the gauge and fermion actions, all gauge fields can be integrated out exactly and the partition function can be evaluated using the Grassmann higher-order tensor renormalization group approach. The method is modified to compute the $\mu$ dependence of the quark number density and the chiral condensate up to order $\beta^3$ with complete absence of higher-order terms infiltrating the result. Although the expansion itself is only a good approximation to the full theory at small $\beta&lt;0.1$, the range can be extended, by using judiciously chosen fits. Moreover, these fits also yield a valuable expansion in $\beta$ for the critical chemical potential.</description>

      <title>The observable spectrum for GUT-like theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectrum of nonabelian gauge theories cannot be described in terms of elementary particles, and so must be constructed from gauge-invariant composite operators, even in the presence of a Brout--Englert--Higgs effect. This leads to qualitative discrepancies in the prediction of the spectrum between perturbation theory and a full non-perturbative treatment in many theories. This is especially noticeable for GUTs. We present results corroborating this general statement using lattice simulations for a ''GUT-like'' toy theory, $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ Yang--Mills theory coupled to a Higgs field in the fundamental representation. Despite the apparent simplicity of the model, we find a rich spectrum with some previously unseen features. We also outline the next steps required to generate a large operator basis to extend this investigation to more realistic GUTs.</description>

      <title>The order of the chiral phase transition in massless many-flavour lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the QCD phase transition in the chiral limit presents a challenging problem for lattice QCD. However, its study provides constraints on the phase diagram at the physical point. In this work, we investigate how the order of the chiral phase transition depends on the number of light quark flavours. To approach the lattice chiral limit, we map out and extrapolate the chiral critical surface that separates the first-order region from the crossover region in an extended parameter space, which includes the gauge coupling, the number of quark flavours, their masses, and the lattice spacing. Lattice simulations with standard staggered quarks reveal that for each $N_f &lt; 8$, there exists a tricritical lattice spacing $a^\text{tric}(N_f)$, at which the chiral transition changes from first order ($a&gt;a^\text{tric}$) to second order ($a&lt;a^\text{tric}$). Thus, the first-order region is merely a lattice artifact and not connected to the continuum. By determining the associated temperatures $T(N_f^\text{tric},a ^\text{tric})$ at these tricritical points, we confirm the expected decrease in the critical temperature as the number of flavours increases. The obtained temperatures define a tricritical line which is connected to the continuum and terminates at a physical $ N_f^\text{tric}(a=0) $. Our data is compatible with a vanishing temperature at that point, $T(N_f^\text{tric}(a=0))=0 $.</description>

      <title>Study on the $P$-wave form factors contributing to $ B_s $ to $D_s$ inclusive semileptonic decays from lattice simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a pilot study on extracting the form factors of the semileptonic decay of a $ B_s $ meson to the $P$-wave $ D_s^{**} $ states from $B_s$ four-point correlators. With their inclusive nature, four-point correlators include contributions from all possible final states. From the extracted $ P $-wave form factors, we obtain numerical results for the corresponding Isgur-Wise form factors. The results suggest significant contributions from radial excitations to the Uraltsev sum rule at zero-recoil. In this pilot study, a coarse lattice of $ 24^3\times 64 $ with lattice spacing of $0.11\,\mathrm{fm}$ is used for the analysis.</description>

      <title>Condensation of lighter-than-physical pions in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the results of the 2+1 flavour QCD simulations at nonzero isospin chemical potential performed at half the physical light quark mass. At low temperatures and large isospin chemical potential Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) occurs, creating a pion condensed phase, separated from the hadronic and quark-gluon plasma phases by the BEC transition line. For physical quark masses, the section of this line between the hadronic and BEC phases was found to be almost perfectly vertical, i.e. aligned with the temperature axis. We show that for lighter than physical pions, this section remains vertical, and approaches the axis of vanishing chemical potential linearly with the pion mass, giving a prediction of the phase diagram in the chiral limit.</description>

      <title>From scattering towards multi-hadron weak decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article I provide an overview of the current state of scattering within lattice QCD, along with ongoing projects that examine weak decays involving scattering states as either final or intermediate states. Significant progress has been made in the study of multi-hadron weak decays, opening the door for scattering calculations to make meaningful contributions to flavour physics and further establishing lattice QCD as the key non-perturbative tool for QCD predictions. In addition to discussing new calculations, I also highlight recent advancements in finite-volume formalisms, which enable the exploration of previously inaccessible channels.</description>

      <title>Test of a two-level algorithm for the glueball spectrum in $SU(N_c)$ Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present preliminary results obtained using a new code for $SU (N_c)$ Yang-Mills theory which performs a 2-level sampling of glueball correlators obtained from a suitably chosen basis of (APE) smeared and unsmeared operators. The code builds loop operators of any shape and length and classifies them according to the irreducible representations of the cubic group. We report on the performances of the algorithm and on the computation of the first low-lying glueball states choosing $N_c = 3$ as a reference to compare our results with the literature.</description>

      <title>Topological Data Analysis of Abelian Magnetic Monopoles in Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent literature on the possible existence of a second higher-temperature phase transition in Quantum Chromodynamics, we revisit the proposal that colour confinement is related to the dynamics of magnetic monopoles using methods of Topological Data Analysis, which provides a mathematically rigorous characterisation of topological properties of quantities defined on a lattice. After introducing persistent homology, one of the main tools in Topological Data Analysis, we shall discuss how this concept can be used to quantitatively analyse the behaviour of monopoles across the deconfinement phase transition. Our approach is first demonstrated for Compact $U(1)$ Lattice Gauge Theory, which is known to have a zero-temperature deconfinement phase transition driven by the restoration of the symmetry associated with the conservation of the magnetic charge. For this system, we perform a finite-size scaling analysis of observables capturing the homology of magnetic current loops, showing that the expected value of the deconfinement critical coupling is reproduced by our analysis. We then extend our method to $SU(3)$ gauge theory, in which Abelian magnetic monopoles are identified after projection in the Maximal Abelian Gauge. A finite-size scaling of our homological observables of Abelian magnetic current loops at temporal size $N_t = 4$ provides the expected value of the critical coupling with an accuracy that is generally higher than that obtained with conventional thermodynamic approaches at comparable statistics, hinting towards the relevance of topological properties of monopole currents for confinement.</description>

      <title>The QCD phase diagram, universal scaling, and Lee-Yang zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will report on current progress in the understanding of the QCD phase diagram, including universal scaling in the chiral limit and the vicinity of the QCD critical point. In the latter case we will discuss the universal scaling of Lee-Yang zeros and their determination from multi-point Pad\'e approximations to the baryon number density at imaginary chemical potentials. In particular, reported results include the critical phase transition temperature, the curvature of the critical and pseudo-critical transition temperature with respect to the chemical potential and the location of the QCD critical point.</description>

      <title>Valence leading isospin breaking contributions to $a_{\mu}^{\mathrm{HVP-LO}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By employing the RM123 approach to QCD+QED, we computed the valence quark-connected isospin-breaking corrections to the light, strange and charm contributions at leading order in $\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}$ and $\left(\mu_d-\mu_u\right) / \Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}$. Here we report the preliminary results on two different volumes ($L \sim 3.8$ fm and $L \sim 5.1$ fm) and a fixed lattice spacing (corresponding to $a_{\text {isoQCD }} \sim 0.07951(4)$ fm), obtained in the framework of the ongoing computation by ETMC of the leading-order hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $a_\mu^{\mathrm{HVP}}$ in QCD+QED.</description>

      <title>Resummation for Lattice QCD Calculation of Generalized Parton Distributions at Nonzero Skewness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) provides an approach to directly calculate the $x$-dependence of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) on a Euclidean lattice through power expansion and a perturbative matching. When a parton's momentum becomes soft, the corresponding logarithms in the matching kernel become non-negligible at higher orders of perturbation theory, which requires a resummation. But the resummation for the off-forward matrix elements at nonzero skewness $\xi$ is difficult due to their multi-scale nature. In this work, we demonstrate that these logarithms are important only in the threshold limit, and derive the threshold factorization formula for the quasi-GPDs in LaMET. We then propose an approach to resum all the large logarithms based on the threshold factorization, which is implemented on a GPD model. We demonstrate that the LaMET prediction is reliable for $[-1+x_0,-\xi-x_0]\cup[-\xi+x_0,\xi-x_0]\cup[\xi+x_0,1-x_0]$, where $x_0$ is a cutoff depending on hard parton momenta. Through our numerical tests with the GPD model, we demonstrate that our method is self-consistent and that the inverse matching does not spread the nonperturbative effects or power corrections to the perturbatively calculable regions.</description>

      <title>Dense $\textrm{QCD}_2$ with matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study one-flavor $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice QCD in ($1+1$) dimensions at zero temperature and finite density using matrix product states and the density matrix renormalization group. We compute physical observables such as the equation of state, chiral condensate, and quark distribution function as functions of the baryon number density. As a physical implication, we discuss the inhomogeneous phase at nonzero baryon density, where the chiral condensate is inhomogeneous, and baryons form a crystal. We also discuss how the dynamical degrees of freedom change from hadrons to quarks through the formation of quark Fermi seas.</description>

      <title>Tensor-network Toolbox for probing dynamics of non-Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor-network methods are valuable Hamiltonian-simulation methods which enable probing dynamics of strongly-interacting quantum-many-body systems, including gauge theories, without encountering sign problems. They also have the potential to inform efficient quantum-simulation algorithms of the same theories. We develop and benchmark a matrix-product-state (MPS) ansatz for the SU(2) lattice gauge theory using the loop-string-hadron (LSH) framework. The LSH framework has been demonstrated to be advantageous in Hamiltonian simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories. It is applicable to varying gauge groups [SU(2) and SU(3)], boundary conditions, and in higher dimensions. In this work, we report on progress in achieving the continuum limit of the static observables in a SU(2) gauge theory in (1+1) D and pushing the boundary of dynamical studies. The current toolbox can be applied to studying scattering processes in this model. It can also be straightforwardly generalized to (2+1)D given the simplified constraints in an LSH framework.</description>
