      <title>Inferring Exocytosis Profiles from Cell Shapes Using a Dual-Configuration Model of Walled Cell Tip Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tip growth in filamentous cells, such as root hairs, moss protonemata, and fungal hyphae, depends on coordinated cell wall extension driven by turgor pressure, wall mechanics, and exocytosis. We introduce a dual-configuration model that incorporates both turgid and unturgid states to describe cell wall growth as the combined effect of elastic deformation and irreversible extension. This framework infers exocytosis profiles directly from cell morphology and elastic stretches, formulated as an initial value problem based on the self-similarity condition. Applying the model to Medicago truncatula root hairs, moss Physcomitrium patens protonemata, and hyphoid-like shapes, we find that exocytosis peaks at the tip in tapered cells but shifts to an annular region away from the apex in flatter-tip cells beyond a threshold. The model generalizes previous fluid models and provides a mechanistic link between exocytosis distribution and cell shape, explaining observed variations in tip-growing cells across species.</description>

      <title>Multilevel classification framework for breast cancer cell selection and its integration with advanced disease models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Breast cancer cell lines are indispensable tools for unraveling disease mechanisms, enabling drug discovery, and developing personalized treatments, yet their heterogeneity and inconsistent classification pose significant challenges in model selection and data reproducibility. This review aims at providing a comprehensive and user-friendly framework for broadly mapping the features of breast cancer types and commercially available human breast cancer cell lines, defining absolute criteria, i.e. objective features such as origin (e.g., MDA-MB, MCF), histological subtype (ductal, lobular), hormone receptor status (ER/PR/HER2), and genetic mutations (BRCA1, TP53), and relative criteria, which contextualize functional behaviors like metastatic potential, drug sensitivity, and genomic instability. It then examines how the proposed framework could be applied to cell line screening in advanced and emerging disease models. By supporting better informed choices, this work aims to improve experimental design and strengthen the connection between in vitro breast cancer studies and their clinical translation.</description>
