      <title>L'application du chat quantique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we deal with the quantum dynamics of hyperbolic linear automorphisms of the torus, such as "Arnold's cat map", and study its behavior after Ehrenfest time. We show that, in the basis of wave packets, the associated propagator is well approximed by Birkhoff sums of nilrotations on the torus.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lagrangian Coherent Structures in Finsler Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel theoretical framework for identifying Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) in manifolds with non-constant curvature, extending the theory to Finsler manifolds. By leveraging Riemannian and Finsler geometry, we generalize the deformation tensor to account for geodesic stretching in these complex spaces. The main result demonstrates the existence of invariant surfaces acting as LCS, characterized by dominant eigenvalues of the generalized deformation tensor. We discuss potential applications in astrophysics, relativistic fluid dynamics, and planetary science. This work paves the way for exploring LCS in intricate geometrical settings, offering new tools for dynamical system analysis.</description>

      <title>Voronovskaya-Type Asymptotic Expansions and Convergence Analysis for Neural Network Operators in Complex Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the classical theory of Voronovskaya-type asymptotic expansions to generalized neural network operators defined on non-Euclidean and fractal domains. We introduce and analyze smooth operators activated by modified and generalized hyperbolic tangent functions, extending their applicability to manifold and fractal geometries. Key theoretical results include the preservation of density properties, detailed convergence rates, and asymptotic expansions. Additionally, we explore the role of fractional derivatives in defining neural network operators, which capture non-local behavior and are particularly useful for modeling systems with long-range dependencies or fractal-like structures. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of neural network operators in complex, structured spaces, offering robust mathematical tools for applications in signal processing on manifolds and solving partial differential equations on fractals.</description>

      <title>$\,_{3}F_{4}$ hypergeometric functions as a sum of a product of $\,_{2}F_{3}$ functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows that certain $\,_{3}F_{4}$ hypergeometric functions can be expanded in sums of pair products of $\,_{1}F_{2}$ functions. In special cases, the $\,_{3}F_{4}$ hypergeometric functions reduce to $\,_{2}F_{3}$ functions. Further special cases allow one to reduce the $\,_{2}F_{3}$ functions to $\,_{1}F_{2}$ functions, and the sums to products of $\,_{0}F_{1}$ (Bessel) and $\,_{1}F_{2}$ functions. This expands the class of hypergeometric functions having summation theorems beyond those expressible as pair-products of generalized Whittaker functions, $\,_{2}F_{1}$ functions, and $\,_{3}F_{2}$ functions into the realm of $\,_{p}F_{q}$ functions where $p&lt;q$ for both the summand and terms in the series.</description>

      <title>Notes on the Golden Ratio: The Golden Rule of Vector Similarities in Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02494v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we have abstractly generalized the similarity law for multidimensional vectors. Initially, the law of similarity was derived for one-dimensional vectors. Although it operated with such values of the ratio of parts of the whole, it meant linear dimensions (a line is one-dimensionality). The concept of the general golden ratio (GGR) for the vectors in the multidimensional space is presented and described in detail with equations and solutions. It shown that the GGR depends on the angles. Main properties of the GGR are given with illustrative examples. We introduce and discuss the concept of the similar vectors and the set of similarities for a given vector. Also, we present our vision on the theory of the golden ratio for triangles and describe the similar triangles with examples.</description>

      <title>On necessary conditions for a friend of 20</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Does $20$ have a friend? Or is it a solitary number? A folklore conjecture asserts that $20$ has no friends i.e. it is a solitary number. In this article, we prove that, a friend $N$ of $20$ is of the form $N=2\cdot5^{2a}\cdot m^2$, with $(3,m)=(7,m)=1$ and it has at least six distinct prime divisors. Also, we prove that $N$ must be greater than $2\cdot 10^{12}$. Furthermore, we show that $\Omega(N)\geq 2\omega(N)+6a-5$ and if $\Omega(m)\leq K$ then $N&lt; 10\cdot 6^{(2^{K-2a+3}-1)^2}$, where $\Omega(n)$ and $\omega(n)$ denote the total number of prime divisors and the number of distinct prime divisors of the integer $n$ respectively. In addition, we deduce that, not all exponents of odd prime divisors of friend $N$ of $20$ are congruent to $-1$ modulo $f$, where $f$ is the order of $5$ in $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^\times$ such that $3\mid f$ and $p$ is a prime congruent to $1$ modulo $6$. Also, we propose necessary upper bounds for all prime divisors of friends of 20.</description>
