      <title>Dynamics of Supersolid state: normal fluid, superfluid, and supersolid velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landau's excitation-based argument for superfluids -- that at temperature $T=0$ the normal fluid density $\rho_{n}$ is zero -- should also apply to supersolids. Further, for a total mass density $\rho$, Leggett argues that the superfluid fraction $\rho_{s}/\rho&lt;1$. These arguments imply that there is a missing mass. We attribute this to a supersolid density $\rho_{L}$, with $\rho_{L}\equiv \rho-\rho_{s}-\rho_{n}$, and a momentum-bearing supersolid velocity $v_{Li}$. Using Onsager's irreversible thermodynamics we derive the macroscopic dynamical equations for this system. We find that $v_{Li}$ is subject to the force of elasticity, to the negative gradient of the chemical potential per mass $\mu$ (as for the superfluid velocity $v_{si}$), and to drag against the normal fluid (leading to the interpretation of $L$ as lattice). Thus both the superfluid and supersolid components are associated with the ground state. The normal modes for such a system have a crossover in frequency, above which the normal fluid velocity $v_{ni}$ is an independent variable and below which it is locked to $v_{Li}$. For an isotropic lattice we study both the transverse response and longitudinal response. The ring geometry for atomic gas supersolid states may provide a geometry for testing these predictions.</description>

      <title>Chiral supersolid and dissipative time crystal in Rydberg-dressed Bose-Einstein condensates with Raman-induced spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is one of the key factors that affect the chiral symmetry of matter by causing the spatial symmetry breaking of the system. We find that Raman-induced SOC can induce a chiral supersolid phase with a helical antiskyrmion lattice in balanced Rydberg-dressed two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a harmonic trap by modulating the Raman coupling strength, strong contrast with the mirror symmetric supersolid phase containing skyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice pair for the case of Rashba SOC. Two ground-state phase diagrams are presented as a function of the Rydberg interaction strength and the SOC strength, as well as that of the Rydberg interaction strength and the Raman coupling strength, respectively. It is shown that the interplay among Raman-induced SOC, soft-core long-range Rydberg interactions, and contact interactions favors rich ground-state structures including half-quantum vortex phase, stripe supersolid phase, toroidal stripe phase with a central Anderson-Toulouse coreless vortex, checkerboard supersolid phase, mirror symmetric supersolid phase, chiral supersolid phase and standing-wave supersolid phase. In addition, the effects of rotation and in-plane quadrupole magnetic field on the ground state of the system are analyzed. In these two cases, the chiral supersolid phase is broken and the ground state tends to form a miscible phase. Furthermore, the stability and superfluid properties of the two-component BECs with Raman-induced SOC and Rydberg interactions in free space are revealed by solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation. Finally, we demonstrate that when the initial state is a chiral supersolid phase the rotating harmonic trapped system sustains dissipative continuous time crystal by studying the rotational dynamic behaviors of the system.</description>

      <title>Simulating spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates: a concise overview for non-experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold ensembles of bosons are a useful platform for studying many-body quantum states present in quantum technologies, and simulations of these systems are convenient for streamlining design of such technologies. This paper provides an overview of spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (SOC BECs), along with an overview of simulation methods and a case study on a novel "microemulsion" phase. These SOC-BECs are further described in the context of coherent states quantum field theory, utilizing the complex Langevin sampling scheme as a numerical algorithm. This approach for studying SOC BECs is a versatile and powerful alternative to particle-based methods and has promise for simulating other bosonic quantum states.</description>

      <title>Feedback cooling of fermionic atoms in optical lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the preparation of topological insulator states with fermionic ultracold atoms in optical lattices by means of measurement-based Markovian feedback control. The designed measurement and feedback operators induce an effective dissipative channel that stabilizes the desired insulator state, either in an exact way or approximately in the case where additional experimental constraints are assumed. %taken into account. Successful state preparation is demonstrated in one-dimensional insulators as well as for Haldane's Chern insulator, by calculating the fidelity between the target ground state and the steady state of the feedback-modified master equation. The fidelity is obtained via time evolution of the system with moderate sizes. For larger 2D systems, we compare the mean occupation of the single-particle eigenstates for the ground and steady state computed through mean-field kinetic equations.</description>

      <title>Engineering single-atom angular momentum eigenstates in an optical tweezer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We engineer angular momentum eigenstates of a single atom by using a novel all-optical approach based on the interference of Laguerre-Gaussian beams. We confirm the imprint of angular momentum by measuring the two-dimensional density distribution and by performing Ramsey spectroscopy in a slightly anisotropic trap, which additionally reveals the sense of rotation. This article provides the experimental details on the quantum state control of angular momentum eigenstates reported in P. Lunt et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 253401 (2024).</description>

      <title>Exact density profile in a tight-binding chain with dephasing noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the many-body dynamics of a tight-binding chain with dephasing noise on the infinite interval. We obtain the exact solution of an average particle-density profile for the domain wall and the alternating initial conditions via the Bethe ansatz, analytically deriving the asymptotic expressions for the long time dynamics. For the domain wall initial condition, we obtain the scaling form of the average density, elucidating that the diffusive transport always emerges in the long time dynamics if the strength of the dephasing, no matter how small, is positive. For the alternating initial condition, our exact solution leads to the fact that the average density displays oscillatory decay or over-damped decay depending on the strength of the dissipation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the asymptotic forms approach those of the symmetric simple exclusion process, identifying corrections from it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.01887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A one-dimensional bosonic gas with strong contact repulsion and attractive non-local interactions may form a quantum droplet with a flat-top density profile. We focus on a system in the Tonks-Girardeau limit of infinitely strong contact repulsion. We show that the main system features are the same for a broad class of non-local interaction potentials. Then, we focus on a limiting case, the one of slowly varying density profiles, to find approximate formulas for the surface and bulk energies of a droplet. We further characterise the system by numerically finding the excitation spectrum. It consists of two families: phononic-like excitations inside droplets and scattering modes. Analysis within the linearised regime is supplemented with the full, nonlinear dynamics of small perturbations.</description>

Abstract: We realize a Laughlin state of two rapidly rotating fermionic atoms in an optical tweezer. By utilizing a single atom and spin resolved imaging technique, we sample the Laughlin wavefunction, thereby revealing its distinctive features, including a vortex distribution in the relative motion, correlations in the particles' relative angle, and suppression of the inter-particle interactions. Our work lays the foundation for atom-by-atom assembly of fractional quantum Hall states in rotating atomic gases.</description>

      <title>Driven-Dissipative Dynamics of Ultracold Atoms Trapped in an Array of Harmonic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a gas of ultracold atoms that are trapped in an array of harmonic potentials and that interacts with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) that acts as a reservoir of Bogoliubov excitations. The ground and excited energy levels of these trapped ultracold atoms are coupled to each other via detuned Raman lasers with corresponding Rabi frequencies. Once excited via the Raman lasers, these trapped ultracold atoms then return to their ground energy levels, but not necessarily to their original trap locations, by emitting Bogoliubov excitations into the BEC. This combination of driving via Raman lasers to excited energy levels and dissipation via interaction with the BEC resulting in emission of Bogoliubov excitations into it will result in the trapped ultracold atoms approaching a steady state, whereby the expectation value of the number of trapped ultracold atoms in each harmonic trap of the array will attain a constant value over time. One can then use this system to prepare states that require a definite number of atoms in a particular energy level, such as BECs and atom lasers used for atom interferometry and for tests of the foundations of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Supersolidity of polariton condensates in photonic crystal waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Condensation of exciton-polaritons has been recently observed in one-dimensional photonic crystal waveguides, exploiting the interplay of long-lived gap confined eigenmodes and negative mass polariton branches. Here we focus on the theoretical emergence of a second emission threshold, in addition to the one associated with condensation at zero-momentum, due to the nonlinear polariton scattering from the condensate into finite momentum eigenmodes. The physics of this spatially modulated condensate is related to a spontaneous breaking of both phase and translational symmetries simultaneously, bearing strong similarities with the highly sought supersolid phase in Helium and ultracold atomic gases but with a novel mechanism typical of the driven-dissipative scenario. We then propose clear-cut and unequivocal experimental signatures that would allow to identify supersolidity phenomena in polariton condensates</description>

      <title>Corner Charge Fluctuation as an Observable for Quantum Geometry and Entanglement in Two-dimensional Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17023v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring bipartite fluctuations of a conserved charge, such as the particle number, is a powerful approach to understanding quantum systems. When the measured region has sharp corners, the bipartite fluctuation receives an additional contribution known to exhibit a universal angle-dependence in 2D isotropic and uniform systems. Here we establish that, for generic lattice systems of interacting particles, the corner charge fluctuation is directly related to quantum geometry. We first provide a practical scheme to isolate the corner contribution on lattices, and analytically prove that its angle-dependence in the small-angle limit measures exclusively the integrated quantum metric. A model of a compact obstructed atomic insulator is introduced to illustrate this effect analytically, while numerical verification for various Chern insulator models further demonstrate the experimental relevance of the corner charge fluctuation in a finite-size quantum simulator as a probe of quantum geometry. Last but not least, for free fermions, we unveil an intimate connection between quantum geometry and quantum information through the lens of corner entanglement entropies.</description>

      <title>Many-body localization crossover is sharper in quasiperiodic spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to a phenomenon of many-body localization (MBL), the strong disorder may significantly slow down or even completely hinder the thermalization of quantum many-body systems. A sufficiently deep quasiperiodic potential may also inhibit thermalization. In this work, we numerically demonstrate direct differences in the behavior of standard ergodicity-breaking indicators at the MBL crossover in random and quasiperiodic systems. Our key finding is the exponential increase in the sharpness of the MBL crossover with system size for quasiperiodic systems, a trend that is only linear in disordered systems. The strong tendency towards a non-analytic behavior in quasiperiodic systems is consistent with the existence of dynamical regimes with sharply defined boundaries or an MBL phase transition. It highlights the importance of quasiperiodic systems for our understanding of many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard Model in High Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bose-Hubbard model effectively describes bosons on a lattice with on-site interactions and nearest-neighbour hopping, serving as a foundational framework for understanding strong particle interactions and the superfluid to Mott insulator transition. This paper aims to rigorously establish the validity of a mean-field approximation for the dynamics of quantum systems in high dimension, using the Bose--Hubbard model on a square lattice as a case study. We prove a trace norm estimate between the one-lattice-site reduced density of the Schr\"odinger dynamics and the mean-field dynamics in the limit of large dimension. Here, the mean-field approximation is in the hopping amplitude and not in the interaction, leading to a very rich and non-trivial mean-field equation. This mean-field equation does not only describe the condensate, as is the case when the mean-field description comes from a large particle number limit averaging out the interaction, but it allows for a phase transition to a Mott insulator since it contains the full non-trivial interaction. Our work is a rigorous justification of a simple case of the highly successful dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) for bosons, which somewhat surprisingly yields many qualitatively correct results in three dimensions.</description>
