      <title>Near-Optimal Cell-Free Beamforming for Physical Layer Multigroup Multicasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical layer multicasting is an efficient transmission technique that exploits the beamforming potential at the transmitting nodes and the broadcast nature of the wireless channel, together with the demand for the same content from several UEs. This paper addresses the max-min fair multigroup multicast beamforming optimization, which is an NP-hard problem. We propose a novel iterative elimination procedure coupled with semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to find the near-global optimum rank-1 beamforming vectors in a cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) network setup. The proposed optimization procedure shows significant improvements in computational complexity and spectral efficiency performance compared to the SDR followed by the commonly used randomization procedure and the state-of-the-art difference-of-convex approximation algorithm. The significance of the proposed procedure is that it can be utilized as a rank reduction method for any problem in conjunction with SDR.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Awareness in Wireless Communications, Sensing, and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless communications and sensing (WCS) establish the backbone of modern information exchange and environment perception. Typical applications range from mobile networks and the Internet of Things to radar and sensor grids. The incorporation of machine learning further expands WCS's boundaries, unlocking automated and high-quality data analytics, together with advisable and efficient decision-making. Despite transformative capabilities, wireless systems often face numerous uncertainties in design and operation, such as modeling errors due to incomplete physical knowledge, statistical errors arising from data scarcity, measurement errors caused by sensor imperfections, computational errors owing to resource limitation, and unpredictability of environmental evolution. Once ignored, these uncertainties can lead to severe outcomes, e.g., performance degradation, system untrustworthiness, inefficient resource utilization, and security vulnerabilities. As such, this article reviews mature and emerging architectural, computational, and operational countermeasures, encompassing uncertainty-aware designs of signals and systems (e.g., diversity, adaptivity, modularity), as well as uncertainty-aware modeling and computational frameworks (e.g., risk-informed optimization, robust signal processing, and trustworthy machine learning). Trade-offs to employ these methods, e.g., robustness vs optimality, are also highlighted.</description>

      <title>Heartbeat Detection from Ballistocardiogram using Transformer Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Longitudinal monitoring of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) can aid in tracking cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), sleep quality, sleep disorders, and reflect autonomic nervous system activity, stress levels, and overall well-being. These metrics are valuable in both clinical and everyday settings. In this paper, we present a transformer network aimed primarily at detecting the precise timing of heart beats from predicted electrocardiogram (ECG), derived from input Ballistocardiogram (BCG). We compared the performance of segment and subject models across three datasets: a lab dataset with 46 young subjects, an elder dataset with 28 elderly adults, and a combined dataset. The segment model demonstrated superior performance, with correlation coefficients of 0.97 for HR and mean heart beat interval (MHBI) when compared to ground truth. This non-invasive method offers significant potential for long-term, in-home HR and HRV monitoring, aiding in the early indication and prevention of cardiovascular issues.</description>

      <title>Estimation in the Gaussian Multiplex Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An abstraction for multisensor communication termed the Gaussian Multiplex Channel is presented and analyzed. In this model, the sensor outputs can be added together in any combination through a network of switches, and the combinations can be changed arbitrarily during the observation interval. The sensor output sums are observed in additive Gaussian noise. Using a mean square error cost function and a constraint on the total observation time, an optimal set of combinations (switch positions) and observation times is determined. The solution exhibits high complexity (number of different combinations) even for moderate numbers of sensors. It is then shown that there exists an alternative solution based on Hadamard designs, which achieves the same minimizing MSE cost function and only requires a number of combinations equal to the number of sensors.</description>

      <title>An Age of Information Characterization of SPS for V2X Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a closed-form approximation of the stationary distribution of the Age of Information (AoI) of the semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) protocol which is a core part of NR-V2X, an important standard for vehicular communications. While prior works have studied the average AoI under similar assumptions, in this work we provide a full statistical characterization of the AoI by deriving an approximation of its probability mass function. As result, besides the average AoI, we are able to evaluate the age-violation probability, which is of particular relevance for safety-critical applications in vehicular domains, where the priority is to ensure that the AoI does not exceed a predefined threshold during system operation. The study reveals complementary behavior of the age-violation probability compared to the average AoI and highlights the role of the duration of the reservation as a key parameter in the SPS protocol. We use this to demonstrate how this crucial parameter should be tuned according to the performance requirements of the application.</description>

      <title>Generative CKM Construction using Partially Observed Data with Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) is a promising technique that enables environment-aware wireless networks by utilizing location-specific channel prior information to improve communication and sensing performance. A fundamental problem for CKM construction is how to utilize partially observed channel knowledge data to reconstruct a complete CKM for all possible locations of interest. This problem resembles the long-standing ill-posed inverse problem, which tries to infer from a set of limited observations the cause factors that produced them. By utilizing the recent advances of solving inverse problems with generative artificial intelligence (AI), in this paper, we propose generative CKM construction method using partially observed data by solving inverse problems with diffusion models. Simulation results show that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of CKM construction compared with benchmarking schemes.</description>

      <title>ElectraSight: Smart Glasses with Fully Onboard Non-Invasive Eye Tracking Using Hybrid Contact and Contactless EOG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart glasses with integrated eye tracking technology are revolutionizing diverse fields, from immersive augmented reality experiences to cutting-edge health monitoring solutions. However, traditional eye tracking systems rely heavily on cameras and significant computational power, leading to high-energy demand and privacy issues. Alternatively, systems based on electrooculography (EOG) provide superior battery life but are less accurate and primarily effective for detecting blinks, while being highly invasive. The paper introduces ElectraSight, a non-invasive plug-and-play low-power eye tracking system for smart glasses. The hardware-software co-design of the system is detailed, along with the integration of a hybrid EOG (hEOG) solution that incorporates both contact and contactless electrodes. Within 79 kB of memory, the proposed tinyML model performs real-time eye movement classification with 81% accuracy for 10 classes and 92% for 6 classes, not requiring any calibration or user-specific fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that ElectraSight delivers high accuracy in eye movement and blink classification, with minimal overall movement detection latency (90% within 60 ms) and an ultra-low computing time (301 {\mu}s). The power consumption settles down to 7.75 mW for continuous data acquisition and 46 mJ for the tinyML inference. This efficiency enables continuous operation for over 3 days on a compact 175 mAh battery. This work opens new possibilities for eye tracking in commercial applications, offering an unobtrusive solution that enables advancements in user interfaces, health diagnostics, and hands-free control systems.</description>

      <title>Cram\'er-Rao Bound Optimization for Near-Field Sensing with Continuous-Aperture Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) optimization framework for near-field sensing (NISE) with continuous-aperture arrays (CAPAs) is proposed. In contrast to conventional spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs), CAPAs emit electromagnetic (EM) probing signals through continuous source currents for target sensing, thereby exploiting the full spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method for estimating target locations in the near-field region is developed. To evaluate the NISE performance with CAPAs, the CRB for estimating target locations is derived based on continuous transmit and receive array responses of CAPAs. Subsequently, a CRB minimization problem is formulated to optimize the continuous source current of CAPAs. This results in a non-convex, integral-based functional optimization problem. To address this challenge, the optimal structure of the source current is derived and proven to be spanned by a series of basis functions determined by the system geometry. To solve the CRB minimization problem, a low-complexity subspace manifold gradient descent (SMGD) method is proposed, leveraging the derived optimal structure of the source current. Our simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed SMGD method and further demonstrate that i)~the proposed SMGD method can effectively solve the CRB minimization problem with reduced computational complexity, and ii)~CAPA achieves a tenfold improvement in sensing performance compared to its SPDA counterpart, due to full exploitation of spatial DoFs.</description>

      <title>Exploiting sparse structures and synergy designs to advance situational awareness of electrical power grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing threats of uncertainties, anomalies, and cyberattacks on power grids are driving a critical need to advance situational awareness which allows system operators to form a complete and accurate picture of the present and future state. Simulation and estimation are foundational tools in this process. However, existing tools lack the robustness and efficiency required to achieve the level of situational awareness needed for the ever-evolving threat landscape. Industry-standard (steady-state) simulators are not robust to blackouts, often leading to non-converging or non-actionable results. Estimation tools lack robustness to anomalous data, returning erroneous system states. Efficiency is the other major concern as nonlinearities and scalability issues make large systems slow to converge.
  This thesis addresses robustness and efficiency gaps through a dual-fold contribution. We first address the inherent limitations in the existing physics-based and data-driven worlds; and then transcend the boundaries of conventional algorithmic design in the direction of a new paradigm -- Physics-ML Synergy -- which integrates the strengths of the two worlds. Our approaches are built on circuit formulation which provides a unified framework that applies to both transmission and distribution. Sparse optimization acts as the key enabler to make these tools intrinsically robust and immune to random threats, pinpointing dominant sources of (random) blackouts and data errors. Further, we explore sparsity-exploiting optimizations to develop lightweight ML models whose prediction and detection capabilities are a complement to physics-based tools; and whose lightweight designs advance generalization and scalability. Finally, Physics-ML Synergy brings robustness and efficiency further against targeted cyberthreats, by interconnecting our physics-based tools with lightweight ML.</description>

      <title>Blind Deconvolution of Graph Signals: Robustness to Graph Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study blind deconvolution of signals defined on the nodes of an undirected graph. Although observations are bilinear functions of both unknowns, namely the forward convolutional filter coefficients and the graph signal input, a filter invertibility requirement along with input sparsity allow for an efficient linear programming reformulation. Unlike prior art that relied on perfect knowledge of the graph eigenbasis, here we derive stable recovery conditions in the presence of small graph perturbations. We also contribute a provably convergent robust algorithm, which alternates between blind deconvolution of graph signals and eigenbasis denoising in the Stiefel manifold. Reproducible numerical tests showcase the algorithm's robustness under several graph eigenbasis perturbation models.</description>

      <title>Surface-Based Authentication System for Integrated Circuit Chips</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of the semiconductor industry and the ubiquity of electronic devices have led to a significant increase in the counterfeiting of integrated circuits (ICs). This poses a major threat to public health, the banking industry, and military defense sectors that are heavily reliant on electronic systems. The electronic physically unclonable functions (PUFs) are widely used to authenticate IC chips at the unit level. However, electronic PUFs are limited by their requirement for IC chips to be in working status for measurements and their sensitivity to environmental variations. This paper proposes using optical PUFs for IC chip authentication by leveraging the unique microscopic structures of the packaging surface of individual IC chips. The proposed method relies on color images of IC chip surfaces acquired using a flatbed scanner or mobile camera. Our initial study reveals that these consumer-grade imaging devices can capture meaningful physical features from IC chip surfaces. We then propose an efficient, lightweight verification scheme leveraging specular-reflection-based features extracted from videos, achieving an equal error rate (EER) of 0.0008. We conducted factor, sensitivity, and ablation studies to understand the detailed characteristics of the proposed lightweight verification scheme. This work is the first to apply the optical PUF principle for the authentication of IC chips and has the potential to significantly enhance the security of the semiconductor supply chain.</description>

      <title>ECG-Byte: A Tokenizer for End-to-End Generative Electrocardiogram Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable adaptability across domains beyond text, specifically electrocardiograms (ECGs). More specifically, there is a growing body of work exploring the task of generating text from a multi-channeled ECG and corresponding textual prompt. Current approaches typically involve pretraining an ECG-specific encoder with a self-supervised learning (SSL) objective and using the features output by the pretrained encoder to finetune a LLM for natural language generation (NLG). However, these methods are limited by 1) inefficiency from two-stage training and 2) interpretability challenges with encoder-generated features. To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-Byte, an adapted byte pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer pipeline for autoregressive language modeling of ECGs. This approach compresses and encodes ECG signals into tokens, enabling end-to-end LLM training by combining ECG and text tokens directly, while being much more interpretable since the ECG tokens can be directly mapped back to the original signal. Using ECG-Byte, we achieve competitive performance in NLG tasks in only half the time and ~48% of the data required by two-stage approaches.</description>

      <title>CAE-T: A Channelwise AutoEncoder with Transformer for EEG Abnormality Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are critical for detecting abnormal brain activity, but their high dimensionality and complexity pose significant challenges for effective analysis. In this paper, we propose CAE-T, a novel framework that combines a channelwise CNN-based autoencoder with a single-head transformer classifier for efficient EEG abnormality detection. The channelwise autoencoder compresses raw EEG signals while preserving channel independence, reducing computational costs and retaining biologically meaningful features. The compressed representations are then fed into the transformer-based classifier, which efficiently models long-term dependencies to distinguish between normal and abnormal signals. Evaluated on the TUH Abnormal EEG Corpus, the proposed model achieves 85.0% accuracy, 76.2% sensitivity, and 91.2% specificity at the per-case level, outperforming baseline models such as EEGNet, Deep4Conv, and FusionCNN. Furthermore, CAE-T requires only 202M FLOPs and 2.9M parameters, making it significantly more efficient than transformer-based alternatives. The framework retains interpretability through its channelwise design, demonstrating great potential for future applications in neuroscience research and clinical practice.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for seamless connectivity and intelligent communication, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and communication for sixth-generation (6G) network is emerging as a revolutionary architecture. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of AI and communication for 6G networks, emphasizing their foundational principles, inherent challenges, and future research opportunities. We commence with a retrospective analysis of AI and the evolution of large-scale AI models, underscoring their pivotal roles in shaping contemporary communication technologies. The discourse then transitions to a detailed exposition of the envisioned integration of AI within 6G networks, delineated across three progressive developmental stages. The initial stage, AI for Network, focuses on employing AI to augment network performance, optimize efficiency, and enhance user service experiences. The subsequent stage, Network for AI, highlights the role of the network in facilitating and buttressing AI operations and presents key enabling technologies, including digital twins for AI and semantic communication. In the final stage, AI as a Service, it is anticipated that future 6G networks will innately provide AI functions as services and support application scenarios like immersive communication and intelligent industrial robots. Specifically, we have defined the quality of AI service, which refers to the measurement framework system of AI services within the network. In addition to these developmental stages, we thoroughly examine the standardization processes pertinent to AI in network contexts, highlighting key milestones and ongoing efforts. Finally, we outline promising future research opportunities that could drive the evolution and refinement of AI and communication for 6G, positioning them as a cornerstone of next-generation communication infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Directivity-Aware Degrees of Freedom Analysis for Extremely Large-Scale MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) communications, enabled by numerous antenna elements integrated into large antenna surfaces, can provide increased effective degree of freedom (EDoF) to achieve high diversity gain. However, it remains an open problem that how the EDoF is influenced by the directional radiation pattern of antenna elements. In this work, empowered by the wavenumber-domain channel representation, we analyze the EDoF in a general case where the directivity of antennas, determined by the antenna structure and element spacing, is considered. Specifically, we first reveal the uneven distribution of directivity-aware wavenumber-domain coupling coefficients, i.e., channel gain towards different directions, in the isotropic Rayleigh fading channel. EDoF is then calculated based on such distribution of coupling coefficients. A numerical method is also provided to obtain coupling coefficients via electromagnetic full-wave simulations. Due to the influence of antenna directivity, how EDoF and ergodic channel capacity vary with the element spacing are explored via simulations for different antenna types.</description>

      <title>Model-Based End-to-End Learning for Multi-Target Integrated Sensing and Communication under Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study model-based end-to-end learning in the context of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) under hardware impairments. Hardware impairments are usually addressed by means of array calibration with a focus on communication performance. However, residual impairments may exist that affect sensing performance. This paper proposes a data-driven framework for mitigating such impairments. A monostatic orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) sensing and multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication scenario is considered, incorporating hardware imperfections at the ISAC transceiver antenna array. We propose a novel differentiable version of the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm that is suitable for multi-target sensing and allows for efficient end-to-end learning of the hardware impairments. Based on the differentiable OMP, we devise two model-based parameterization strategies of the ISAC beamformer and sensing receiver to account for hardware impairments: (i) learning a dictionary of steering vectors for different angles and (ii) learning the parameterized hardware impairments. We carry out a comprehensive performance analysis of the proposed model-based learning approaches and a strong baseline consisting of least-squares beamforming, conventional OMP, and maximum-likelihood symbol detection for communication. Results show that by parameterizing the hardware impairments, learning approaches offer gains in terms of higher detection probability, position estimation accuracy, and lower symbol error rate (SER) compared to the baseline. We demonstrate that learning the parameterized hardware impairments outperforms learning a dictionary of steering vectors, also exhibiting the lowest complexity.</description>

      <title>From Analog to Digital: Multi-Order Digital Joint Coding-Modulation for Semantic Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies in joint source-channel coding (JSCC) have fostered a fresh paradigm in end-to-end semantic communication. Despite notable performance achievements, present initiatives in building semantic communication systems primarily hinge on the transmission of continuous channel symbols, thus presenting challenges in compatibility with established digital systems. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to address this challenge by developing a multi-order digital joint coding-modulation (MDJCM) scheme for semantic communications. Initially, we construct a digital semantic communication system by integrating a multi-order modulation/demodulation module into a nonlinear transform source-channel coding (NTSCC) framework. Recognizing the non-differentiable nature of modulation/demodulation, we propose a novel substitution training strategy. Herein, we treat modulation/demodulation as a constrained quantization process and introduce scaling operations alongside manually crafted noise to approximate this process. As a result, employing this approximation in training semantic communication systems can be deployed in practical modulation/demodulation scenarios with superior performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the equivalence by analyzing the involved probability distribution. Moreover, to further upgrade the performance, we develop a hierarchical dimension-reduction strategy to provide a gradual information extraction process. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over existing digital and non-digital JSCC techniques.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Mobility Management for High-Speed Railway Communications: Compressed Measurements and Proactive Handover</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-speed railway (HSR) communications are pivotal for ensuring rail safety, operations, maintenance, and delivering passenger information services. The high speed of trains creates rapidly time-varying wireless channels, increases the signaling overhead, and reduces the system throughput, making it difficult to meet the growing and stringent needs of HSR applications. In this article, we explore artificial intelligence (AI)-based beam-level and cell-level mobility management suitable for HSR communications. Particularly, we propose a compressed spatial multi-beam measurements scheme via compressive sensing for beam-level mobility management in HSR communications. In comparison to traditional down-sampling spatial beam measurements, this method leads to improved spatial-temporal beam prediction accuracy with the same measurement overhead. Moreover, we propose a novel AI-based proactive handover scheme to predict handover events and reduce radio link failure (RLF) rates in HSR communications. Compared with the traditional event A3-based handover mechanism, the proposed approach significantly reduces the RLF rates which saves 50% beam measurement overhead.</description>

      <title>Rate-Adaptive Generative Semantic Communication Using Conditional Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) have shown promise for end-to-end semantic image transmission. However, most existing schemes primarily focus on optimizing pixel-wise metrics, which often fail to align with human perception, leading to lower perceptual quality. In this letter, we propose a novel generative DJSCC approach using conditional diffusion models to enhance the perceptual quality of transmitted images. Specifically, by utilizing entropy models, we effectively manage transmission bandwidth based on the estimated entropy of transmitted sym-bols. These symbols are then used at the receiver as conditional information to guide a conditional diffusion decoder in image reconstruction. Our model is built upon the emerging advanced mamba-like linear attention (MLLA) skeleton, which excels in image processing tasks while also offering fast inference speed. Besides, we introduce a multi-stage training strategy to ensure the stability and improve the overall performance of the model. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of perceptual quality.</description>

      <title>Radiance Field Delta Video Compression in Edge-Enabled Vehicular Metaverse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offload computationally intensive tasks to multi-access edge computing (MEC) servers via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, enabling applications within the vehicular metaverse, which transforms physical environment into the digital space enabling advanced analysis or predictive modeling. A core challenge is physical-to-virtual (P2V) synchronization through digital twins (DTs), reliant on MEC networks and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). To address this, we introduce radiance field (RF) delta video compression (RFDVC), which uses RF-encoder and RF-decoder architecture using distributed RFs as DTs storing photorealistic 3D urban scenes in compressed form. This method extracts differences between CAV-frame capturing actual traffic and RF-frame capturing empty scene from the same camera pose in batches encoded and transmitted over the MEC network. Experiments show data savings up to 71% against H.264 codec and 44% against H.265 codec under different conditions as lighting changes, and rain. RFDVC also demonstrates resilience to transmission errors, achieving up to +0.29 structural similarity index measure (SSIM) improvement at block error rate (BLER) = 0.35 in non-rainy and +0.25 at BLER = 0.2 in rainy conditions, ensuring superior visual quality compared to standard video coding (VC) methods across various conditions.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Information Theory-Based Statistical Channel Model for Improved Channel Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12446v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic information theory (EIT) is an emerging interdisciplinary subject that integrates classical Maxwell electromagnetics and Shannon information theory. The goal of EIT is to uncover the information transmission mechanisms from an electromagnetic (EM) perspective in wireless systems. Existing works on EIT are mainly focused on the analysis of EM channel characteristics, degrees-of-freedom, and system capacity. However, these works do not clarify how to integrate EIT knowledge into the design and optimization of wireless systems. To fill in this gap, in this paper, we propose an EIT-based statistical channel model with simplified parameterization. Thanks to the simplified closed-form expression of the EMCF, it can be readily applied to various channel modeling and inference tasks. Specifically, by averaging the solutions of Maxwell's equations over a tunable von Mises distribution, we obtain a spatio-temporal correlation function (STCF) model of the EM channel, which we name as the EMCF. Furthermore, by tuning the parameters of the EMCF, we propose an EIT-based covariance estimator (EIT-Cov) to accurately capture the channel covariance. Since classical MMSE estimators can exploit prior information contained in the channel covariance matrix, we further propose the EIT-MMSE channel estimator by substituting EMCF for the covariance matrix. Simulation results show that both the proposed EIT-Cov covariance estimator and the EIT-MMSE channel estimator outperform their baseline algorithms, thus proving that EIT is beneficial to wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Wideband Beamforming for RIS Assisted Near-Field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A near-field wideband beamforming scheme is investigated for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, in which a deep learning-based end-to-end (E2E) optimization framework is proposed to maximize the system spectral efficiency. To deal with the near-field double beam split effect, the base station is equipped with frequency-dependent hybrid precoding architecture by introducing sub-connected true time delay (TTD) units, while two specific RIS architectures, namely true time delay-based RIS (TTD-RIS) and virtual subarray-based RIS (SA-RIS), are exploited to realize the frequency-dependent passive beamforming at the RIS. Furthermore, the efficient E2E beamforming models without explicit channel state information are proposed, which jointly exploits the uplink channel training module and the downlink wideband beamforming module. In the proposed network architecture of the E2E models, the classical communication signal processing methods, i.e., polarized filtering and sparsity transform, are leveraged to develop a signal-guided beamforming network. Numerical results show that the proposed E2E models have superior beamforming performance and robustness to conventional beamforming benchmarks. Furthermore, the tradeoff between the beamforming gain and the hardware complexity is investigated for different frequency-dependent RIS architectures, in which the TTD-RIS can achieve better spectral efficiency than the SA-RIS while requiring additional energy consumption and hardware cost.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Enhanced Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Interference Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the application of the rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) technique, vital for interference mitigation in modern communication systems. It investigates the use of precoding methods in RSMA, especially in complex multiple-antenna interference channels, employing deep reinforcement learning. The aim is to optimize precoders and power allocation for common and private data streams involving multiple decision-makers. A multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework is employed to address this complexity, where decentralized agents collectively learn to optimize actions in a continuous policy space. We also explore the challenges posed by imperfect channel side information at the transmitter. Additionally, decoding order estimation is addressed to determine the optimal decoding sequence for common and private data sequences. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RSMA method based on MADDPG, achieving the upper bound in single-antenna scenarios and closely approaching theoretical limits in multi-antenna scenarios. Comparative analysis shows superiority over other techniques such as MADDPG without rate-splitting, maximal ratio transmission (MRT), zero-forcing (ZF), and leakage-based precoding methods. These findings highlight the potential of deep reinforcement learning-driven RSMA in reducing interference and enhancing system performance in communication systems.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Optimization for Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA)-based Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The beamforming optimization in continuous aperture array (CAPA)-based multi-user communications is studied. In contrast to conventional spatially discrete antenna arrays, CAPAs can exploit the full spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) by emitting information-bearing electromagnetic (EM) waves through continuous source current distributed across the aperture. Nevertheless, such an operation renders the beamforming optimization problem as a non-convex integral-based functional programming problem, which is challenging for conventional discrete optimization methods. A couple of low-complexity approaches are proposed to solve the functional programming problem. 1) Calculus of variations (CoV)-based approach: Closed-form structure of the optimal continuous source patterns are derived based on CoV, inspiring a low-complexity integral-free iterative algorithm for solving the functional programming problem. 2) Correlation-based zero-forcing (Corr-ZF) approach: Closed-form ZF source current patterns that completely eliminate the inter-user interference are derived based on the channel correlations. By using these patterns, the original functional programming problem is transformed to a simple power allocation problem, which can be solved using the classical water-filling approach with reduced complexity. Our numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed designs and reveal that: i) compared to the state-of-the-art Fourier-based discretization approach, the proposed CoV-based approach not only improves communication performance but also reduces computational complexity by up to hundreds of times for large CAPA apertures and high frequencies, and ii) the proposed Corr-ZF approach achieves asymptotically optimal performance compared to the CoV-based approach.</description>
