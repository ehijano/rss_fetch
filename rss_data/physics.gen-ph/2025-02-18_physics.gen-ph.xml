      <title>Electromagnetism from relativistic fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a matter-space framework characterizing particles and establish its compatibility with electromagnetism. In this approach, matter, such as photons, is considered to reside in a three-dimensional matter space, with the electromagnetic fields observed in four-dimensional spacetime interpreted as projections from this space. By imposing gauge symmetry through constraint equations, we derive the relationship between the vector field $A_a$ and the antisymmetric tensor $F_{ab}$, forming part of Maxwell's equations. The remaining Maxwell equation is obtained through the action principle in relativistic fluid dynamics. Notably, we demonstrate that this imposition of the gauge symmetry and constraints develop the dynamics. This framework offers a fresh perspective on particle-field interactions and deepens the theoretical foundation of relativistic fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Cylindrical gravastars with Kuchowicz metric potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mazur and Mottola's gravastar model represents one of the few serious alternatives to the traditional understanding of the black hole. The gravastar is typically regarded as a theoretical alternative for the black hole. This article investiagtes the creation of gravastar(gravitational vacuum star) within the realm of cylindrically symmetric space-time utilizing the Kuchowicz metric potential. A stable gravastar comprises of three distinct regions, starting with an interior region marked by positive energy density and negative pressure $(p=-\rho)$ which is followed by an intermediate thin shell, where the interior negative pressure induces a outward repulsive force at each point on the shell. Ultra-relativistic stiff fluid makes up the thin shell governed by the equation of state(EoS) $(p=\rho)$, which meets the Zel'dovich criteria. And then comes the region exterior to it which is total vacuum. In this scenario, the central singularity is eliminated and the event horizon is effectively substituted by the thin bounding shell. Employing the Kuchowicz metric potential we have derived the remaining metric functions for the interior region and the shell regions yielding a non-singular solution for both the regions. Additionally, we have investigated various characteristics of this shell region including its proper shell length, the energy content and entropy. This theoretical model successfully resolves the singularity issue inherent to the black holes. Therefore, this gravastar model presents a viable alternative to the traditional black holes, reconciled within the context of Einstein's theory of General Relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new linear mapping of the linear vector space (LVS) of the octonions is suggested as an approach to the co-ordinatization of space-time. This approach resolves some perplexing issues concerning the validity of certain pre-metric notions of orthogonality and mirror symmetry. It makes explicit the tangent space extension of four-dimensional space-time that was alluded to earlier by the author [3] and shows that the null space component of the extended space can be related to ideas that were set out many years ago by H J S Smith.</description>
