      <title>Lossy Catalytic Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A catalytic Turing machine is a variant of a Turing machine in which there exists an auxiliary tape in addition to the input tape and the work tape. This auxiliary tape is initially filled with arbitrary content. The machine can read and write on the auxiliary tape, but it is constrained to restore its initial content when it halts. Studying such a model and finding its powers and limitations has practical applications.
  In this paper, we study catalytic Turing machines with O(log n)-sized work tape and polynomial-sized auxiliary tape that are allowed to lose at most constant many bits of the auxiliary tape when they halt. We show that such catalytic Turing machines can only decide the same set of languages as standard catalytic Turing machines with the same size work and auxiliary tape.</description>

      <title>Channel allocation revisited through 1-extendability of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of channel allocation for Wi-Fi access points (AP). Using mechanisms such as the CSMA/CA protocol, Wi-Fi access points which are in conflict within a same channel are still able to communicate to terminals. In graph theoretical terms, it means that it is not mandatory for the channel allocation to correspond to a proper coloring of the conflict graph. However, recent studies suggest that the structure -- rather than the number -- of conflicts plays a crucial role in the performance of each AP. More precisely, the graph induced by each channel must satisfy the so-called $1$-extendability property, which requires each vertex to be contained in an independent set of maximum cardinality. In this paper we introduce the 1-extendable chromatic number, which is the minimum size of a partition of the vertex set of a graph such that each part induces a 1-extendable graph. We study this parameter and the related optimization problem through different perspectives: algorithms and complexity, structure, and extremal properties. We first show how to compute this number using modular decompositions of graphs, and analyze the running time with respect to the modular width of the input graph. We also focus on the special case of cographs, and prove that the 1-extendable chromatic number can be computed in quasi-polynomial time in this class. Concerning extremal results, we show that the 1-extendable chromatic number of a graph with $n$ vertices is at most $2\sqrt{n}$, whereas the classical chromatic number can be as large as $n$. We are also able to construct graphs whose 1-extendable chromatic number is at least logarithmic in the number of vertices.</description>

      <title>Assembly Theory Reduced to Shannon Entropy and Rendered Redundant by Naive Statistical Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previously, we formally proved that any implementation of the concept of `copy number' underlying Assembly Theory (AT) and its assembly index (Ai) was equivalent to Shannon Entropy and not fundamentally or methodologically different from algorithms like ZIP and PNG via an LZ grammar. We show that the weak empirical correlation between Ai and LZW, which the authors offered as a defence against the previously proven result that the assembly index calculation method is an LZ scheme, is based on a misleading experiment. When the experiment is conducted properly the asymptotic convergence to LZ compression and Shannon Entropy is evident, and aligns with the mathematical proof previously provided. This completes both the theoretical and empirical demonstrations that any variation of the copy-number concept underlying AT, which resorts to counting the number of repetitions to arrive at a measure for life, is equivalent to statistical compression and Shannon Entropy. We demonstrate that the authors' `we-are-better-because-we-are-worse argument' does not withstand basic scrutiny, and that their primary empirical results separating organic from inorganic compounds have not only been previously reported -- sans claims to unify physics and biology -- but are also driven solely by molecular length, not by any special feature of life captured by their assembly index. Finally, we show that Ai is a special subcase of our Block Decomposition Method introduced almost a decade earlier.</description>

      <title>On the parameterized complexity of computing good edge-labelings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A good edge-labeling (gel for short) of a graph $G$ is a function $\lambda: E(G) \to \mathbb{R}$ such that, for any ordered pair of vertices $(x, y)$ of $G$, there do not exist two distinct increasing paths from $x$ to $y$, where ``increasing'' means that the sequence of labels is non-decreasing. This notion was introduced by Bermond et al. [Theor. Comput. Sci. 2013] motivated by practical applications arising from routing and wavelength assignment problems in optical networks. Prompted by the lack of algorithmic results about the problem of deciding whether an input graph admits a gel, called GEL, we initiate its study from the viewpoint of parameterized complexity. We first introduce the natural version of GEL where one wants to use at most $c$ distinct labels, which we call $c$-GEL, and we prove that it is NP-complete for every $c \geq 2$ on very restricted instances. We then provide several positive results, starting with simple polynomial kernels for GEL and $c$-\GEL parameterized by neighborhood diversity or vertex cover. As one of our main technical contributions, we present an FPT algorithm for GEL parameterized by the size of a modulator to a forest of stars, based on a novel approach via a 2-SAT formulation which we believe to be of independent interest. We also present FPT algorithms based on dynamic programming for $c$-GEL parameterized by treewidth and $c$, and for GEL parameterized by treewidth and the maximum degree. Finally, we answer positively a question of Bermond et al. [Theor. Comput. Sci. 2013] by proving the NP-completeness of a problem strongly related to GEL, namely that of deciding whether an input graph admits a so-called UPP-orientation.</description>

Abstract: Scientists have demonstrated that quantum computing has presented novel approaches to address computational challenges, each varying in complexity. Adapting problem-solving strategies is crucial to harness the full potential of quantum computing. Nonetheless, there are defined boundaries to the capabilities of quantum computing. This paper concentrates on aggregating prior research efforts dedicated to solving intricate classical computational problems through quantum computing. The objective is to systematically compile an exhaustive inventory of these solutions and categorize a collection of demanding open problems that await further exploration.hese solutions and categorize a collection of demanding open problems that await further exploration.</description>

      <title>Semi-Classical Subspaces, The No Synchronization Law, and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper looks at the intersection of algorithmic information theory and physics, namely quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and black holes. We discuss theorems which characterize the barrier between the quantum world and the classical realm. The notion of a ``semi-classical subspace'' is introduced. Partial signals and partial cloning can be executed on quantum states in semi-classical subspaces. The No Synchronization Law is detailed, which says separate and isolated physical systems evolving over time cannot have thermodynamic algorithmic entropies that are in synch. We look at future work involving the Kolmogorov complexity of black holes.</description>

      <title>CSPs with Few Alien Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The constraint satisfaction problem asks to decide if a set of constraints over a relational structure $\mathcal{A}$ is satisfiable (CSP$(\mathcal{A})$). We consider CSP$(\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{B})$ where $\mathcal{A}$ is a structure and $\mathcal{B}$ is an alien structure, and analyse its (parameterized) complexity when at most $k$ alien constraints are allowed. We establish connections and obtain transferable complexity results to several well-studied problems that previously escaped classification attempts. Our novel approach, utilizing logical and algebraic methods, yields an FPT versus pNP dichotomy for arbitrary finite structures and sharper dichotomies for Boolean structures and first-order reducts of $(\mathbb{N},=)$ (equality CSPs), together with many partial results for general $\omega$-categorical structures.</description>

      <title>Concise tensors of minimal border rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05713v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine defining equations for the set of concise tensors of minimal border rank in $C^m\otimes C^m\otimes C^m$ when $m=5$ and the set of concise minimal border rank $1_*$-generic tensors when $m=5,6$. We solve this classical problem in algebraic complexity theory with the aid of two recent developments: the 111-equations defined by Buczy\'{n}ska-Buczy\'{n}ski and results of Jelisiejew-\v{S}ivic on the variety of commuting matrices. We introduce a new algebraic invariant of a concise tensor, its 111-algebra, and exploit it to give a strengthening of Friedland's normal form for $1$-degenerate tensors satisfying Strassen's equations. We use the 111-algebra to characterize wild minimal border rank tensors and classify them in $C^5\otimes C^5\otimes C^5$.</description>
