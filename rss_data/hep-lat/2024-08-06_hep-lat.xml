      <title>Highly excited $B$, $B_s$ and $B_c$ meson spectroscopy from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excited state spectra of $B$, $B_s$ and $B_c$ mesons are computed using lattice QCD. Working with a large basis of carefully constructed, approximately-local $q\bar{q}$-like operators we determine a rich spectrum of states up to $J=4$ in $B, B_s$ and $B_c$, that can be grouped into patterns matching those of the quark model. In addition, hybrid-like states are identified at approximately 1500 MeV above the ground states in each of $B, B_s$ and $B_c$, in a multiplet pattern already found in similar computations at a range of quark masses spanning light to bottom. This study is performed using an anisotropic, relativistic Wilson-clover action at a single spatial lattice spacing of $a_s\approx 0.12$ fm and with a light-quark mass corresponding to $m_\pi\approx 391$ MeV. We find good agreement with experimental results where known and discuss prospects for further work in interesting $J^P$ quantum numbers.</description>

      <title>The charge and magnetic radii of the nucleons from the generalized parton distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proton-radius puzzle refers to the discrepancy observed in measurements of the proton's charge radius when using different methods. This inconsistency has prompted extensive research and debate within the physics community, as it challenges the understanding of quantum electrodynamics and the fundamental properties of protons. In the present study, we determine the charge and magnetic radii of the proton and neutron through a global analysis of the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at zero skewness for the first time. Our results challenge the measurements or analyses in which the nucleon's radii are extracted considering just a particular experiment or observable, or using only data points covering particular kinematic regions. We emphasize that simultaneous analysis of all available experimental data related to the radii of the nucleons would be preferable to determine their exact values. The final results obtained from our analysis by this way are: $ r_{pE} = 0.8558 \pm 0.0135~\textrm{fm} $, $ r_{pM} = 0.8268 \pm 0.0533~\textrm{fm} $, $ \left&lt;r_{nE}^2\right&gt; = -0.1181 \pm 0.0270~\textrm{fm}^2 $, and $ r_{nM} = 0.8367 \pm 0.0845~\textrm{fm} $.</description>

      <title>Gauge-independent transition dividing the confinement phase in the lattice SU(2) gauge-adjoint scalar model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lattice SU(2) gauge-scalar model with the scalar field in the adjoint representation of the gauge group has two completely separated confinement and Higgs phases according to the preceding studies based on numerical simulations which have been performed in the specific gauge fixing based on the conventional understanding of the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism.
  In this paper, we re-examine this phase structure in the gauge-independent way based on the numerical simulations performed without any gauge fixing. This is motivated to confirm the recently proposed gauge-independent Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism for generating the mass of the gauge field without relying on any spontaneous symmetry breaking. For this purpose we investigate correlation functions between gauge-invariant operators obtained by combining the original adjoint scalar field and the new field called the color-direction field which is constructed from the gauge field based on the gauge-covariant decomposition of the gauge field due to Cho-Duan-Ge-Shabanov and Faddeev-Niemi.
  Consequently, we reproduce gauge-independently the transition line separating confinement phase and Higgs phase, and show surprisingly the existence of a new transition line that divides completely the confinement phase into two parts. Finally, we discuss the physical meaning of the new transition and implications to confinement mechanism.</description>

      <title>On interpretation of fluctuations of conserved charges at high T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations of conserved charges calculated on the lattice which can be measured experimentally, are well reproduced by a hadron resonanse gas model at temperatures below T_{ch} ~ 155 MeV and radically deviate from the hadron resonance gas predictions above the chiral restoration crossover. This behavior is typically interpreted as an indication of deconfinement in the quark-gluon plasma regime. We present an argument that this interpretation may be too simple. The argument is based on the scaling of quantities with the number of colors: demonstration of deconfinement and QGP requires observable that is sensitive to N_c^2 gluons while the conserved charges are sensitive only to quarks and above T_{ch} scale as N_c^1. The latter scaling is consistent with the existence of an intermediate regime characterized by restored chiral symmetry and by approximate chiral spin symmetry which is a symmetry of confining interaction. In this regime the energy density, pressure and entropy density scale as N_c^1. In the large N_c limit this regime might become a distinct phase separated from the hadron gas and from QGP by phase transitions. A natural observable that associates with deconfinement and is directly sensitive to deconfined N_c^2-1 gluons is the Polyakov loop; in the N_c=3 world it remains very close to 0 at temperatures well above chiral crossover, reaches the value 0.5 around 3T_{ch} and the value close to 1 at temperatures ~1 GeV.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo studies of quantum cosmology by the generalized Lefschetz thimble method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum cosmology aims at elucidating the beginning of our Universe. Back in early 80's, Vilenkin and Hartle-Hawking put forward the "tunneling from nothing" and "no boundary" proposals. Recently there has been renewed interest in this subject from the viewpoint of defining the oscillating path integral for Lorentzian quantum gravity using the Picard-Lefschetz theory. Aiming at going beyond the mini-superspace and saddle-point approximations, we perform Monte Carlo calculations using the generalized Lefschetz thimble method to overcome the sign problem. In particular, we confirm that either Vilenkin or Hartle-Hawking saddle point becomes relevant if one uses the Robin boundary condition depending on its parameter. We also clarify some fundamental issues in quantum cosmology, such as an issue related to the integration domain of the lapse function and an issue related to reading off the real geometry from the complex geometry obtained at the saddle point.</description>
