      <title>The Saga of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$: Parameters, Models, and Phase Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RuCl$_3$ was likely the first ever deliberately synthesized ruthenium compound, following the discovery of the $_{44}$Ru element in 1844. For a long time it was known as an oxidation catalyst, with its physical properties being discrepant and confusing, until a decade ago when its allotropic form $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ rose to exceptional prominence. This "re-discovery" of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has not only reshaped the hunt for a material manifestation of the Kitaev spin liquid, but it has opened the floodgates of theoretical and experimental research in the many unusual phases and excitations that the anisotropic-exchange magnets as a class of compounds have to offer. Given its importance for the field of Kitaev materials, it is astonishing that the low-energy spin model that describes this compound and its possible proximity to the much-desired spin-liquid state is still a subject of significant debate ten years later. In the present study, we argue that the existing key phenomenological observations put strong natural constraints on the effective microscopic spin model of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, and specifically on its spin-orbit-induced anisotropic-exchange parameters that are responsible for the non-trivial physical properties of this material. These constraints allow one to focus on the relevant region of the multi-dimensional phase diagram of the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ model, suggest an intuitive description of it via a different parametrization of the exchange matrix, offer a unifying view on the earlier assessments of its parameters, and bring closer together several approaches to the derivation of anisotropic-exchange models. We explore extended phase diagrams relevant to the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ parameter space using quasi-classical, Luttinger-Tisza, exact diagonalization, and density-matrix renormalization group methods, demonstrating a remarkably c...

      <title>Extended strange metal regime from superconducting puddles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a model of mesoscale superconducting puddles in a metal, represented as dynamical impurities interacting with a finite number of electronic channels via Andreev and normal scattering. We identify conditions under which the collection of puddles make a $T$-linear contribution to the resistivity and a $T\ln(1/T)$ to the specific heat and thermopower. This behavior emerges in an intermediate temperature range that extends from an upper energy scale set by the renormalized charging energy of the puddles, and down to an exponentially small scale associated with a charge-Kondo crossover, provided that the number of electronic channels interacting with the puddle is large. The phenomenology of our model resembles the apparent extended strange metal regime observed in overdoped cuprates which exhibits $T$-linear resistivity at low $T$ over a finite range of doping. We also propose to engineer a strange metal from suitably designed superconducting grains in a metallic matrix.</description>

      <title>Kekul\'e Spiral Order from Strained Topological Heavy Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological heavy fermion (THF) model of twisted bilayer graphene is a framework for treating its strongly interacting topological flat bands. In this work, we employ the THF model with heterostrain and particle-hole symmetry breaking corrections to study its symmetry-broken ground states. We find that the heterostrain correction motivates a specific parent-state wavefunction which dictates the presence or absence of an incommensurate Kekul\'e spiral (IKS) at each integer filling by invoking Dirac node braiding and annihilation as a mechanism to achieve low energy gapped states. We then show that one-shot Hartree-Fock faithfully replicates the numerical results of fully self-consistent states and motivates an analytical approximation for the IKS wavevector. We can also account for the particle-hole asymmetry in the correlated insulator gaps. In particular, the THF model predicts stronger correlated states on the electron side rather than hole side in agreement with magic angle experiments, despite the electron side being more dispersive in the single-particle band structure. This work demonstrates that we can analytically explain even the more subtle symmetry breaking order properties observed in experiments where heterostrain, relaxation, and interactions together determine the ground state.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry breaking and nonreciprocal spin wave in breathing-kagome antiferromagnets at zero field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been known that the spin-wave dispersion, which is usually symmetric in the momentum space with respect to ${\bf q}=0$, can be asymmetric in the presence of the Dzaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction and an applied magnetic field. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that in $J_3$-dominant classical Heisenberg antiferromagnets on the breathing kagome lattice, the asymmetric spin-wave dispersion appears in a chiral phase due to non-uniform geometric phases acquired in the spin-wave propagation processes. This points to the emergence of a nonreciprocal spin wave in the absence of both the DM interaction and the magnetic field. Reflecting the asymmetry, positive-spin-chirality and negative-spin-chirality states, either one of which is selected in the low-temperature phase by the symmetry breaking, show different spin-wave dispersions, suggesting that the two energetically-degenerate chiral states can be distinguished by the spin-wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Physics of Multiferroic Perovskite Manganites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new type of multiferroicity was experimentally discovered in 2003 in a perovskite manganite TbMnO$_3$ where its ferroelectricity is induced by cycloidally ordered Mn spins. Susequently, such spin-cycloid multiferroic phase was also discovered in $R$MnO$_3$ with other rare-earth ions $R$=Dy, Eu$_{1-x}$Y$_x$, Tb$_{1-x}$Gd$_x$, etc. In this class of materials, the magnetism and ferroelectricity are inseparably coupled, and resulting strong magnetoelectric coupling enables us to control/manipulate the electricity (magnetism) by magnetic (electric) fields. Moreover, many interesting magnetoelectric phenomena due to their cross correlation have been discovered. In this article, we discuss a microscopic theoretical model for $R$MnO$_3$ constructed by taking into account their precise electronic and lattice structures and overview the theoretical works based on this model which elucidated rich magnetoelectric phenomena of $R$MnO$_3$. The perovskite manganites are not only the first-discovered spin-spiral multiferroic materials but also a typical class of materials that exhibits most of the magnetoelectric phenomena manifested in many other multiferroics. Therefore, the comprehensive understanding of $R$MnO$_3$ directly leads to the clarification of universal physics of magnetoelectric phenomena in multiferroic materials.</description>

      <title>Controlling Symmetries and Quantum Criticality in the Anisotropic Coupled-Top Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the anisotropic coupled-top model, which describes the interactions between two large spins along both $x-$ and $y-$directions. By tuning anisotropic coupling strengths along distinct directions, we can manipulate the system's symmetry, inducing either discrete $Z_2$ or continuous U(1) symmetry. In the thermodynamic limit, the mean-field phase diagram is divided into five phases: the disordered paramagnetic phase, the ordered ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic phases with symmetry breaking along either $x-$ or $y-$direction. This results in a double degeneracy of the spin projections along the principal direction for $Z_2$ symmetry breaking. When U(1) symmetry is broken, infinite degeneracy associated with the Goldstone mode emerges. Beyond the mean-field ansatz, at the critical points, the energy gap closes, and both quantum fluctuations and entanglement entropy diverge, signaling the onset of second-order quantum phase transitions. These critical behaviors consistently support the universality class of $Z_2$ symmetry. Contrarily, when U(1) symmetry is broken, the energy gap vanishes beyond the critical points, yielding a novel exponent of 1, rather than 1/2 for $Z_2$ symmetry breaking. The framework provides an ideal platform for experimentally controlling symmetries and investigating associated physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Frustration-driven topological textures on the honeycomb lattice: antiferromagnetic meron-antimeron and skyrmion crystals emerging from spiral spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmions -topologically nontrivial magnetic quasi-particles- can emerge in two-dimensional chiral magnets due to moderate or high strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. In this work, we show that the inclusion of weak next-nearest-neighbor DM interaction in the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ honeycomb-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet leads to the emergence of field-induced incommensurate antiferromagnetic meron-antimeron pairs and antiferromagnetic skyrmion structures. Using the Luttinger-Tisza approximation and large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, we report that for lower frustration values, antiferromagnetic meron-antimeron pair crystal and gas phases emerge within a small magnetic field window. In these meron phases, the fundamental unit consists of a meron-antimeron pair residing on different sublattices of the honeycomb lattice, even in the gas phase, where they exhibit greater mobility. For larger frustration, a two-layer-like three-sublattice antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystal phase is stabilized over a wider magnetic field range. At lower temperatures, this region splits into two distinct antiferromagnetic skyrmion phases with skyrmions of different sizes, reflecting the influence of frustration and thermal effects on the stabilization of these topological textures. Interestingly, both meron and skyrmion low-temperature phases connect to spiral spin liquid phases of the honeycomb lattice at higher temperatures. Additionally, we analyze the emergent single-$q$ and double-$q$ phases at low temperatures, constructing a comprehensive phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Spin wave interactions in the pyrochlore Heisenberg antiferromagnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of magnon interactions on the spin wave spectra of the All-in-All-out phase of the pyrochlore nearest neighbour antiferromagnet with a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction $D$. The leading order corrections to spin wave energies indicate a significant renormalisation for commonly encountered strengths of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya term. For low values of $D$ we find a potential instability of the phase itself, indicated by the renormalisation of magnon frequencies to negative values. We have also studied the renormalized spectra in the presence of magnetic fields along three high symmetry directions of the lattice, namely the $[111]$, $[100]$ and $[110]$ directions. Generically, we find that for a fixed value of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction renormalized spectra for the lowest band decrease with an increasing strength of the field. We have also analyzed the limits of the two magnon continuum and probed the possibility of magnon decay. For a range of $D$ and the field strength we identify possible parameter regimes where the decay of the higher bands of the system are kinematically allowed.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Theory of Current-Induced Motion of Magnetic Skyrmions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topological spin textures that appear in magnets with broken spatial inversion symmetry via competition between the (anti)ferromagnetic exchange interactions and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a magnetic field. Their current-driven dynamics have been extensively studied aiming at spintronic applications. However, current-induced skyrmion motion exhibits diverse behaviors depending on various factors and conditions such as the type of skyrmion, driving mechanism, system geometry, direction of applied current, and type of the magnet. While this variety attracts enormous research interest of fundamental science and enriches their possibilities of technical applications, it is, at the same time, a source of difficulty and complexity that hinders their comprehensive understandings. In this article, we discuss fundamental and systematic theoretical descriptions of current-induced motion of skyrmions driven by the spin-transfer torque and the spin-orbit torque. Specifically, we theoretically describe the behaviors of current-driven skyrmions depending on the factors and conditions mentioned above by means of analyses using the Thiele equation. Furthermore, the results of the analytical theory are visually demonstrated and quantitatively confirmed by micromagnetic simulations. In particular, we discuss dependence of the direction and velocity of motion on the type of skyrmion (Bloch type and Neel type) and its helicity, the system geometry (thin plate and nanotrack), the direction of applied current (length and width direction of the nanotrack) and its spin-polarization orientation, and the type of magnet (ferromagnet and antiferromagnet). The comprehensive theory provided by this article is expected to contribute significantly to research on the manipulation and control of magnetic skyrmions by electric currents for future spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Orbital-selective correlation effects and superconducting pairing symmetry in a multiorbital $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ raises key questions about its mechanism and the nature of pairing symmetry. This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Detection of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition is a typical topological phase transition defined between binding and unbinding states of vortices and antivortices, which is not accompanied by spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is known that the BKT transition is difficult to detect from thermodynamic quantities such as specific heat and magnetic susceptibility because of the absence of anomaly in free energy and significant finite-size effects. Therefore, methods based on statistical mechanics which are commonly used to discuss phase transitions cannot be easily applied to the BKT transition. In recent years, several attempts to detect the BKT transition using machine-learning methods based on image recognition techniques have been reported. However, it has turned out that the detection is difficult even for machine learning methods because of the absence of trivial order parameters and symmetry breaking. Most of the methods proposed so far require prior knowledge about the models and/or preprocessing of input data for feature engineering, which is problematic in terms of the general applicability. In this article, we introduce recent development of the machine-learning methods to detect the BKT transitions in several spin models. Specifically, we demonstrate the success of two new methods named temperature-identification method and phase-classification method for detecting the BKT transitions in the q-state clock model and the XXZ model. This progress is expected to sublimate the machine-learning-based study of spin models for exploring new physics beyond simple benchmark test.</description>

      <title>Analog charged black hole formation via percolation: Exploring cosmic censorship and Hoop conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an analog model of charged black hole (BH) formation using the framework of classical percolation. By analyzing the scaling behavior of key quantities, including surface gravity and Komar mass, we establish a robust correspondence between this analog system and gravitational collapse in general relativity. Our numerical simulations of the lattice model show excellent agreement with analytical predictions for the continuum limit, highlighting the potential of analog systems to capture essential features of BH physics. Interestingly, we find that while geometric criteria related to the hoop conjecture are necessary, they are not sufficient for BH formation in our model. Instead, the exponential growth of energy and cluster size emerges as the key indicator, suggesting a novel interpretation of the hoop conjecture and providing further support for cosmic censorship within our analog framework by ensuring horizon formation. This work offers a fresh perspective on the organization of matter within BH event horizons and lays the groundwork for future quantum extensions that could shed light on Hawking radiation and the BH information paradox by linking entanglement entropy in quantum percolation models to BH entropy.</description>

Abstract: Foundation models are highly versatile neural-network architectures capable of processing different data types, such as text and images, and generalizing across various tasks like classification and generation. Inspired by this success, we propose Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States (FNQS) as an integrated paradigm for studying quantum many-body systems. FNQS leverage key principles of foundation models to define variational wave functions based on a single, versatile architecture that processes multimodal inputs, including spin configurations and Hamiltonian physical couplings. Unlike specialized architectures tailored for individual Hamiltonians, FNQS can generalize to physical Hamiltonians beyond those encountered during training, offering a unified framework adaptable to various quantum systems and tasks. FNQS enable the efficient estimation of quantities that are traditionally challenging or computationally intensive to calculate using conventional methods, particularly disorder-averaged observables. Furthermore, the fidelity susceptibility can be easily obtained to uncover quantum phase transitions without prior knowledge of order parameters. These pretrained models can be efficiently fine-tuned for specific quantum systems. The architectures trained in this paper are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/nqs-models, along with examples for implementing these neural networks in NetKet.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Tuned Magnetism and Bandgap Modulation in Layered Fe-Doped CrCl3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the structural, magnetic, vibrational and optical band gap properties under varying pressures. By integrating first-principles calculations with experimental techniques, including Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL), uniaxial pressure studies (thermal expansion), and magnetization measurements, we unveil the intricate pressure-induced transformations in Fe-doped CrCl3, shedding light on its structural, electronic, and magnetic evolution. At ambient pressure, Raman spectra confirm all expected Raman-active modes, which exhibit blue shifts with increasing pressure. The PL measurements demonstrate an optical bandgap of 1.48 eV at ~0.6 GPa, with a progressive increase in the bandgap under pressure, transitioning slower above 6 GPa due to an isostructural phase transition. Magnetization results under pressure shows two competing magnetic components (FM and AFM) at ambient conditions, where at the lowest temperature and applied field, the FM component dominates. The presence of competing FM and AFM energy scales is confirmed by Grueneisen analysis of the thermal expansion and their uniaxial pressure dependence is determined. The experimental findings agree with theoretical results based on Density functional theory (DFT). In the experiments, we observe a pressure-enhanced ferromagnetic interlayer coupling that is followed by the stabilization of antiferromagnetic ordering, due to weakened direct interlayer interactions. Above 1.2 GPa the FM component of the magnetism is gone in the experimental observations, which is also in good agreement with DFT based theory. The findings reported here underscore the potential of CrCl3 for use in pressure-tunable magnetic and optoelectronic applications, where, e.g., the delicate balance between FM and AFM configurations could have potential for sensor applications.</description>

      <title>Unveiling UV/IR Mixing via Symmetry Defects: A View from Topological Entanglement Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09425v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some topological lattice models in two spatial dimensions exhibit intricate lattice size dependence in their ground state degeneracy (GSD). This and other features such as the position-dependent anyonic excitations are manifestations of UV/IR mixing. In the first part of this paper, we perform an exact calculation of the topological entanglement entropy (TEE) for a specific model, the rank-2 toric code. This analysis includes both contractible and non-contractible boundaries, with the minimum entropy states identified specifically for non-contractible boundaries. Our results show that TEE for a contractible boundary remains independent of lattice size, whereas TEE for non-contractible boundaries, similarly to the GSD, shows intricate lattice-size dependence. In the latter part of the paper we focus on the fact that the rank-2 toric code is an example of a translation symmetry-enriched topological phase, and show that viewing distinct lattice size as a consequence of different translation symmetry defects can explain both our TEE results and the GSD of the rank-2 toric code. Our work establishes the translation symmetry defect framework as a robust description of the UV/IR mixing in topological lattice models.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional quantum breakdown model with Krylov subspace many-body localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a two-dimensional (2d) quantum breakdown model of hardcore bosons interacting with disordered spins which would be classical without the bosons. It resembles particles incident into supersaturated vapor. The model exhibits a set of subsystem symmetries, and has a strong fragmentation into Krylov subspaces in each symmetry sector. The Hamiltonian in each Krylov subspace maps to a single-particle problem in a Cayley tree-like graph. At zero disorder, the Krylov subspaces exhibit either (possible) integrable features, or quantum chaos with quantum scar states showing irregular energy and degeneracy patterns. At nonzero disorders, they enter a 2d many-body localization (MBL) phase beyond certain disorder strength $W_*$, as indicated by Poisson level spacing statistics and entanglement entropy growing as $\log t$ with time $t$. Our theoretical arguments suggest $W_*$ is finite or zero for boson number $N_b\lesssim L^\gamma/\log L$ ($1/2\le \gamma \le 1$) as system size $L\rightarrow\infty$. This gives a more stringent condition for MBL than that in the 1d quantum breakdown models. This model reveals the possibility of MBL in systems of quantum particles interacting with classical degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Dopant pairing in a disordered magnetic spin ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I demonstrate a pairing mechanism of dopants in a magnetic lattice, emerging from the underlying high-temperature disorder of the spins. The effect is demonstrated in a mixed-dimensional model, where dopants travel along a two-leg ladder, while the spins feature Ising interactions along the rungs and the legs of the ladder. The dynamics following the sudden immersion of two nearest neighbor dopants in an infinite temperature spin lattice shows that thermal spin disorder frustrates the relative motion of the dopants and enforces them to co-propagate. The predictions are shown to be realistically testable in quantum simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Deconfined quantum criticality of frustrated hard-core dipolar bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical points (DQCPs) are proposed as unconventional second-order phase transitions beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. The nature and experimental realizations of DQCPs are crucial issues of importance. We illustrate the potential for DQCPs between the valence bond solid state and the antiferromagnetic phase to arise in optical lattices containing frustrated dipolar bosons subject to hard-core constraints. The emergence of DQCPs is comprehended through the fusion of two Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions. The DQCPs and the BKTs are confirmed by the scaling of ground-state fidelity susceptibilities in finite systems and the analysis of order parameters obtained from infinite systems. The numerical analysis reveals varying critical exponents of the correlation length in DQCPs and the logarithmic scaling in BKTs, respectively. This work offers a promising platform for realizing DQCPs and provides valuable insights into their nature within the framework of topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical spectra of an organic antiferromagnet as a candidate for altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measured the magneto-optical Kerr effect in an orthorhombic organic antiferromagnet $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Cl, which is a candidate for altermagnets. From the Maxwell equations, we obtained matrix-type general formulae describing the optical propagation and reflection for arbitrary crystals. These formulae enabled us to correctly measure and obtain the off-diagonal optical responses from the anisotropic organic crystal, which appeared at around the N\'eel temperature and exhibited a nonlinear field dependence in the antiferromagnetic phase. These results eliminate the net canted-magnetization origin. The obtained off-diagonal optical conductivity spectra for almost entire $\pi$-electron band clearly shows two spectral end-peaks due to magnetic origin with a large energy scale compared with the very small spin-orbit interaction, and proportionality to anisotropic diagonal conductivities possibly in relation to the piezomagnetic effect. These results suggest the altermagnetic response of this material. We also discuss the analogy between the magnetization in ferromagnets and N\'eel vector with respect to the magneto-optical configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previously, we have shown that the gradient of the chemical potential force arises from the time-component of the Berry connection from many-electron wave functions. We will demonstrate the importance of it in electron conduction problems in metals in this work. We first revisit the well-studied dissipation problem, Joule heating by electric current in a metallic wire connected to an electric battery. It is known that Poynting's theorem explains it in a strange manner: The energy for the Joule heating enters from the outside of the wire as radiation. We show that a sensible explanation is given if the generation of the current is due to the chemical potential gradient generated inside the wire by the battery connection. Next, we demonstrate its importance in the discharging of a capacitor problem where the capacitor plays a role of a battery; and the tunneling supercurrent through the Josephson junction problem, where the original derivation of the Josephson relation does not include the capacitor contribution inherently exists in the junction. Lastly, we argue that the gauge fluctuation of the time-component of the Berry connection included in the chemical potential gradient force explains the Planckian dissipation observed in strange metals.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Origin of Reduced Magnetic Order in a Frustrated Metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although magnetic frustration in metals provides a promising avenue for novel quantum phenomena, their microscopic interpretation is often challenging. Here we use the face-centered cubic intermetallic HoInCu$_4$ as model material to show that Hamiltonians neglecting the charge degree of freedom are appropriate for frustrated metals possessing low density of states at the Fermi surface. Through neutron scattering techniques we determine matching magnetic exchange interactions in the paramagnetic and field-polarized states using an effective spin-1 Heisenberg Hamiltonian, for which we identify antiferromagnetic nearest and next-nearest neighbour interactions $J_1$ and $J_2$ that are close to the critical ratio $J_2$/$J_1$ = 1/2. The study further provides evidence that spin-wave theory fails to predict the low-energy spin dynamics in the antiferromagnetic zero-field state, which is dominated by overdamped magnetic excitations. We conclude that the low-energy fluctuations arise from quantum fluctuations, accounting for the missing moment of the strongly renormalized magnetic long-range order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a set of axioms for locally topologically ordered quantum spin systems in terms of nets of local ground state projections, and we show they are satisfied by Kitaev's Toric Code and Levin-Wen type models. For a locally topologically ordered spin system on $\mathbb{Z}^{k}$, we define a local net of boundary algebras on $\mathbb{Z}^{k-1}$, which provides a mathematically precise algebraic description of the holographic dual of the bulk topological order. We construct a canonical quantum channel so that states on the boundary quasi-local algebra parameterize bulk-boundary states without reference to a boundary Hamiltonian. As a corollary, we obtain a new proof of a recent result of Ogata [Ann. H. Poincar\'e 25, 2024] that the bulk cone von Neumann algebra in the Toric Code is of type $\rm{II}$, and we show that Levin-Wen models can have cone algebras of type $\rm{III}$. Finally, we argue that the braided tensor category of DHR bimodules for the net of boundary algebras characterizes the bulk topological order in (2+1)D, and can also be used to characterize the topological order of boundary states.</description>

      <title>Signatures of two gaps in the spin susceptibility of a cuprate superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major obstacle to understanding high-Tc cuprates is that superconductivity precludes observing normal-state properties at low temperatures. One prime example is the normal-state spin susceptibility \c{hi}spin: although its decrease upon cooling far above Tc typifies pseudogap behavior, its behavior at low temperatures is generally unknown. Here, our measurements in high magnetic fields expose \c{hi}spin of YBa2Cu3Oy down to low temperatures. Even though superconductivity is suppressed by the field, we uncover two thermally-activated contributions alongside a residual \c{hi}spin(T=0) due to gapless excitations. We relate these two distinct gaps to short-range charge-density waves and to the formation of singlets as in certain quantum spin systems. Both phenomena thus contribute to the pseudogap at low temperature, supplementing short-lived antiferromagnetism that initiates pseudogap behavior at high temperatures. We therefore propose that the pseudogap ought to be regarded as a composite property and that, when not undergoing spin-stripe ordering, underdoped cuprates tend to form short-ranged spin singlets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in engineering mesoscopic quantum devices have led to new material platforms where electronic transport can be achieved on foldable structures. In this respect, we study quantum phases and their transitions on a Kirigami structure, a Japanese craft form, where its individual building blocks are topologically non-trivial. In particular, we find that by mechanically deforming the Kirigami structure one can engineer topological phase transitions in the system. Using a multipronged approach, we show that the physics of the system can be captured within a transfer matrix formalism akin to Chalker-Coddington networks, where the junctions describe scattering between effective non-Hermitian one-dimensional edge channels. We further show that the nature of the Kirigami structure can affect the critical folding angles where the topological phase transitions occur. Our study shows the rich interplay between topological quantum phenomena and structural configuration of an underlying Kirigami network reflecting its potential as an intriguing platform.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a quantum strategy from nonlocal games to improve the stabilizer approximation we proposed previously. The resulting approach turns out to be a qubit-by-qubit gauging procedure for standard stabilizers, which could involve discrete or continuous gauge parameters. We take examples from many-body physics and quantum chemistry to show such a procedure leads to an improvement of the performance.</description>

      <title>Page Curve and Entanglement Dynamics in an Interacting Fermionic Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generic non-equilibrium many-body systems display a linear growth of bipartite entanglement entropy in time, followed by a volume law saturation. In stark contrast, the Page curve dynamics of black hole physics shows that the entropy peaks at the Page time $t_{\text{Page}}$ and then decreases to zero. Here, we investigate such Page-like behavior of the von Neumann entropy in a model of strongly correlated spinless fermions in a typical system-environment setup, and characterize the properties of the Page curve dynamics in the presence of interactions using numerically exact matrix product states methods. The two phases of growth, namely the linear growth and the bending down, are shown to be separated by a non-analyticity in the min-entropy before $t_{\text{Page}}$, which separates two different quantum phases, realized as the respective ground states of the corresponding entanglement (or equivalently, modular) Hamiltonian. We confirm and generalize, by introducing interactions, the findings of \href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.224308}{Phys. Rev. B 109, 224308 (2024)} for a free spinless fermionic chain where the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonian undergoes a quantum phase transition at the point of non-analyticity. However, in the presence of interactions, a scaling analysis gives a non-zero critical time for the non-analyticity in the thermodynamic limit only for weak to intermediate interaction strengths, while the dynamics leading to the non-analyticity becomes \textit{instantaneous} for interactions large enough. We present a physical picture explaining these findings.</description>
