      <title>Besicovitch's 1/2 problem and linear programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following classical conjecture of Besicovitch: a $1$-dimensional Borel set in the plane with finite Hausdorff $1$-dimensional measure $\mathcal{H}^1$ which has lower density strictly larger than $\frac{1}{2}$ almost everywhere must be countably rectifiable. We improve the best known bound, due to Preiss and Ti\v{s}er, showing that the statement is indeed true if $\frac{1}{2}$ is replaced by $\frac{7}{10}$ (in fact we improve the Preiss-Ti\v{s}er bound even for the corresponding statement in general metric spaces). More importantly, we propose a family of variational problems to produce the latter and many other similar bounds and we study several properties of them, paving the way for further improvements.</description>

      <title>Weighted norm inequalities for integral transforms with splitting kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16536v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions on weights for a wide class of integral transforms to be bounded between weighted $L^p-L^q$ spaces, with $1\leq p\leq q\leq \infty$. The kernels $K(x,y)$ of such transforms are only assumed to satisfy upper bounds given by products of two functions, one in each variable.
  The obtained results are applicable to a number of transforms, some of which are included here as particular examples. Some of the new results derived here are the characterization of weights for the boundedness of the $\mathscr{H}_\alpha$ (or Struve) transform in the case $\alpha&gt;\frac{1}{2}$, or the characterization of power weights for which the Laplace transform is bounded in the limiting cases $p=1$ or $q=\infty$.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-asymptotic behaviour of solutions of the fractional heat equation on Riemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to study the $L^p$-asymptotic behaviour of solutions to the heat equation and the fractional heat equations on a Riemannian symmetric space of non-compact type. For $\alpha \in (0,1]$, let $h_t^\alpha$ denotes the fractional heat kernel on a Riemannian symmetric space of non-compact type $X=G/K$ (with $h_t^1$ being the standard heat kernel of $X$). Suppose $f \in L^1(X)$ is a left $K$-invariant function. We show that if $p \in [1,2]$ then \begin{equation*} \lim_{t\to\infty}\|h_t^\alpha\|_p^{-1}\|f\ast h_t^\alpha-\what f(i \gamma_p \rho)h_t^\alpha\|_p=0, \end{equation*} where $\gamma_p=2/p-1$, $\rho$ is the half sum of positive roots and $\what f$ denotes the spherical Fourier transform of $f$. If $p\in (2,\infty]$ then \begin{equation*} \lim_{t\to\infty}\|h_t^\alpha\|_p^{-1}\|f\ast h_t^\alpha-\what f(0)h_t^\alpha\|_p=0. \end{equation*} In fact, we will show that the above results are valid for more general class of left $K$-invariant functions larger than the space of integrable left $K$-invariant functions on $X$. The above statements for symmetric spaces were earlier studied in the important special case $p=1=\alpha$, in \cite{Vaz-2, AE}.</description>

      <title>Faber-Krahn inequalities, the Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman formula, and Carleson's $\varepsilon^2$ conjecture in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06187v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main aim of this article is to prove quantitative spectral inequalities for the Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions. More specifically, we prove sharp quantitative stability for the Faber-Krahn inequality in terms of Newtonian capacities and Hausdorff contents of positive codimension, thus providing an answer to a question posed by De Philippis and Brasco.
  One of our results asserts that for any bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$, $n\geq3$, with Lebesgue measure equal to that of the unit ball and whose first eigenvalue is $\lambda_\Omega$, denoting by $\lambda_B$ the first eigenvalue for the unit ball, for any $a\in (0,1)$ it holds $$\lambda_\Omega - \lambda_B \geq C(a) \,\inf_B \bigg(\sup_{t\in (0,1)} \frac1{H^{n-1}(\partial ((1-t) B))} \int_{\partial ((1-t) B)} \frac{\operatorname{Cap}_{n-2}(B(x,atr_B)\setminus \Omega)}{(t\,r_B)^{n-3}}\,dH^{n-1}(x)\bigg)^2,$$ where the infimum is taken over all balls $B$ with the same Lebesgue measure as $\Omega$ and $\operatorname{Cap}_{n-2}$ is the Newtonian capacity of homogeneity $n-2$. In fact, this holds for bounded subdomains of the sphere and the hyperbolic space, as well.
  In a second result, we also apply the new Faber-Krahn type inequalities to quantify the Hayman-Friedland inequality about the characteristics of disjoint domains in the unit sphere. Thirdly, we propose a natural extension of Carleson's $\varepsilon^2$-conjecture to higher dimensions in terms of a square function involving the characteristics of certain spherical domains, and we prove the necessity of the finiteness of such square function in the tangent points via the Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman monotonicity formula. Finally, we answer in the negative a question posed by Allen, Kriventsov and Neumayer in connection to rectifiability and the positivity set of the ACF monotonicity formula.</description>

      <title>$h$-function, Hilbert-Kunz density function and Frobenius-Poincar\'e function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given ideals $I,J$ of a noetherian local ring $(R, \mathfrak m)$ such that $I+J$ is $\mathfrak m$-primary and a finitely generated $R$-module $M$, we associate an invariant of $(M,R,I,J)$ called the $h$-function. Our results on $h$-functions allow extensions of the theories of Frobenius-Poincar\'e functions and Hilbert-Kunz density functions from the known graded case to the local case, answering a question of V.Trivedi. When $J$ is $\mathfrak m$-primary, we describe the support of the corresponding density function in terms of other invariants of $(R, I,J)$. We show that the support captures the $F$-threshold: $c^J(I)$, under mild assumptions, extending results of V. Trivedi and Watanabe. The $h$-function encodes Hilbert-Samuel, Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity and $F$-threshold of the ideal pair involved. Using this feature of $h$-functions, we provide an equivalent formulation of a conjecture of Huneke, Musta\c{t}\u{a}, Takagi, Watanabe; recover a result of Smirnov and Betancourt; prove that a result of Hanes comparing multiplicities, is equivalent to an a priori weaker containment condition on ideals. We also point out that a conjecture of Smirnov-Betancourt as stated is false and suggest a correction which we relate to the conjecture of Huneke et al.
  We develop the theory of $h$-functions in a more general setting which yields a density function for $F$-signature. A key to many results on $h$-functions is a `convexity technique' that we introduce, which in particular proves differentiability of Hilbert-Kunz density functions almost everywhere on $(0,\infty)$, thus contributing to another question of Trivedi.</description>
