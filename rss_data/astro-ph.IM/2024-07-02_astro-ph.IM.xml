      <title>Journey of X-ray astronomy: Indian perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray astronomy is a mature area of observational astronomy. After the discovery of the first non-solar X-ray source in 1962, X-ray astronomy proliferated during the Apollo era's space race. Then, it matured as an established area of research during the period of Great Observatories, and now it has become an indispensable tool to understand a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena. Consequently, in recent times, niche observational areas in X-ray astronomy have been explored, and attempts have been made to expand the sensitivity of observations vastly. India was an active partner in the growth of X-ray astronomy. In the initial years, India leveraged its expertise in balloon technology to get significant results in the research area of hard X-ray astronomy. During the rapid growth phase of X-ray astronomy, India made divergent all-round efforts. Later on, however, the technical expertise available in India was insufficient to compete with the highly sophisticated satellite experiments from around the world. During this phase, work in X-ray astronomy continued in a few low-key experiments, eventually resulting in the launch of India's first multi-wavelength astronomical satellite, AstroSat, in 2015. In this article, I will trace the journey of X-ray astronomy and the developments in the Indian context. I will also explore the sociological aspects of the growth of X-ray astronomy, and, in the end, I will present a speculative sketch of the future of X-ray astronomy with an emphasis on the Indian contribution.</description>

      <title>Using A One-Class SVM To Optimize Transit Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As machine learning algorithms become increasingly accessible, a growing number of organizations and researchers are using these technologies to automate the process of exoplanet detection. These mainly utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect periodic dips in lightcurve data. While having approximately 5% lower accuracy than CNNs, the results of this study show that One-Class Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be fitted to data up to 84 times faster than simple CNNs and make predictions over 3 times faster on the same datasets using the same hardware. In addition, One-Class SVMs can be run smoothly on unspecialized hardware, removing the need for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) usage. In cases where time and processing power are valuable resources, One-Class SVMs are able to minimize time spent on transit detection tasks while maximizing performance and efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We installed the next-generation automated laser adaptive optics system, Robo-AO-2, on the University of Hawaii 2.2-m telescope on Maunakea in 2023. We engineered Robo-AO-2 to deliver robotic, diffraction-limited observations at visible and near-infrared wavelengths in unprecedented numbers. This new instrument takes advantage of upgraded components, manufacturing techniques and control; and includes a parallel reconfigurable natural guide star wavefront sensor with which to explore hybrid wavefront sensing techniques. We present the results of commissioning in 2023 and 2024.</description>

      <title>Closure invariants for polarised radio interferometric observations: a graph theoretical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aperture synthesis observations with full polarisation have long been used to study the magnetic fields of synchrotron emitting sources. Recently proposed closure invariants give us a powerful method for extracting information from measured visibilities which are corrupted by antenna and polarisation dependent gains. In this paper, a formalism developed earlier for complete graphs (where all visibilities are available) is extended to incomplete graphs. The formalism provides a complete and independent set of closure invariants from the measured visibilities in a general situation where not all visibilities are available. We then show in a simulated, quasi-realistic case that the invariants developed here contain usable information even in the presence of noise.</description>

      <title>Drone-Based Antenna Beam Calibration in the High Arctic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of low-frequency radio astronomy experiments for detecting 21-cm line emission from hydrogen presents new opportunities for creative solutions to the challenge of characterizing an antenna beam pattern. The Array of Long Baseline Antennas for Taking Radio Observations from the Seventy-ninth parallel (ALBATROS) is a new radio interferometer sited in the Canadian high Arctic that aims to map Galactic foregrounds at frequencies below $\sim$30 MHz. We present PteroSoar, a custom-built hexacopter outfitted with a transmitter, that will be used to characterize the beam patterns of ALBATROS and other experiments. The PteroSoar drone hardware is motivated by the need for user-servicing at remote sites and environmental factors that are unique to the high Arctic. In particular, magnetic heading is unreliable because the magnetic field lines near the north pole are almost vertical. We therefore implement moving baseline real time kinematic (RTK) positioning with two GPS units to obtain heading solutions with $\sim$1$^\circ$ accuracy. We present a preliminary beam map of an ALBATROS antenna, thus demonstrating successful PteroSoar operation in the high Arctic.</description>

      <title>Optical turbulence vertical distribution at the Peak Terskol Observatory and Mt. Kurapdag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterization of atmospheric turbulence is essential to understanding image quality of astronomical telescopes and applying adaptive optics systems. In this study, the vertical distributions of optical turbulence at the Peak Terskol Observatory (43.27472N 42.50083E, 3127 m a.s.l.) using the Era-5 re-analysis, scintillation measurements and sonic anemometer data are investigated. For the reanalysis grid node closest to the observatory, vertical profiles of the structural constant of the air refractive index turbulent fluctuations $C^2_n$ were obtained. The calculated $C^2_n(z)$ vertical profiles are compared with the vertical distribution of turbulence intensity obtained from tomographic measurements with Shack-Hartmann sensor. The Fried parameter r0 at the location of Terskol Peak Observatory was estimated. Using combination of atmospheric models and scheme paramaterization of turbulence, $C^2_n(z)$ profiles at Mt. Kurapdag were obtained. The r0 values at the Peak Terskol Observatory are compared with estimated values of this length at the ten astronomical sites including Ali, Lenghu and Daocheng.</description>

      <title>On the importance of Earth's atmosphere for SNIa precision cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of colours in photometric surveys is a path to get access to cosmological distances. But for future large surveys like the Large Survey of Space and Time undertaken by the Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile, the large statistical power of the promised catalogues will make the photometric calibration uncertainties dominant in the error budget and will limit our ability to use it for precision cosmology. The knowledge of the in situ atmospheric transmission for each exposure, each season and on average for the entire survey can help reaching the subpercent precision for magnitudes. I will show the impact of precipitable water vapour during a cosmological survey on supernova cosmology. Then I will present how AuxTel at the Vera Rubin Observatory have the capability to measure the on-site atmospheric transmission in real time to improve LSST photometric calibration for precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>Preliminary results of sky brightness measurements in near-infrared at Lenghu, China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low sky brightness is crucial for ground-based astronomical observations, because it limits the observational capability to detect fainter sources. Lenghu, located on the Tibetan Plateau in China, has been identified as an high-quality astronomical site in China, including dark sky in optical band. In this work, we will report the preliminary results of near-infrared sky brightness measurements at Lenghu. Utilizing a wide-field small telescope equipped with an InGaAs camera, we have been conducting long-term monitoring of near-infrared sky brightness in the J and H' bands, respectively, since January 2024. For each image, photometry and astrometry were performed, then sky background was calibrated by standard stars from the 2MASS catalog. This report includes preliminary results on the sky brightness at zenith in the J and H' bands, as well as their variations with solar elevation at Lenghu. Our initial results indicate that the near-infrared sky brightness at Lenghu is comparable to that of other world-class sites, and long-term monitoring will be continued.</description>

      <title>Early Commissioning Results of Slit Mask Integral Field Units on the Southern African Large Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three fibre feed integral field units (IFUs), called Slit Mask IFUs (SMI), are being developed in the SAAO fibre-lab for the Robert Stobie Spectrograph (RSS). The smaller, 200 micron fibre IFU (SMI-200) has 309 x 0.9 arcsec diameter spatial elements covering an elongated hexagonal footprint of 18 $\times$ 23 arcsec is now being commissioned. The larger, 300 (400) micron fibre IFU, SMI-300 (SMI-400), has 221 $\times$ 1.35 arcsec (178 $\times$ 1.8 arcsec) diameter spatial elements covering an on-sky area of 18 $\times$ 29 sq. arcsec (21 $\times$ 44 sq. arcsec). In all SMI units there are two groups of 13 fibres offset by roughly 50 arcsec on either side of the primary array to sample sky. SMI-200 provides a median spectral resolution of 2400 at H$\upalpha$ wavelengths in a low resolution mode simultaneously covering 370 to 740 nm. At a higher grating angles the SMI-200 delivers spectral resolution up to 10,000. A future red spectrograph arm for RSS will extend the simultaneous wavelength coverage up to 900 nm at a median resolution of 6000 for the same IFU. With this upcoming red arm and with the fibre-fed, near-infrared spectrograph NIRWALS on SALT, SMI-300 enables wavelength coverage from blue to NIR wavelengths at the same spatial resolution and footprint. The SMI units are inserted in the same fashion as the existing long-slit cassettes at the SALT focal plane. Prismatic fold mirrors direct the focal plane into the fibre IFU and then back into the RSS collimator after the fibres are routed 180 deg within the cassette and formatted into a pseudo-slit. Fold-prisms ensure that the spectrograph collimator continues to see the same focal plane. In this paper we report the laboratory characterization and on-sky commissioning-performance of the first Slit Mask IFU, SMI-200.</description>

      <title>AtLAST Science Overview Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths provide a unique view of the Universe, from the gas and dust that fills and surrounds galaxies to the chromosphere of our own Sun. Current single-dish facilities have presented a tantalising view of the brightest (sub-)mm sources, and interferometers have provided the exquisite resolution necessary to analyse the details in small fields, but there are still many open questions that cannot be answered with current facilities. In this report we summarise the science that is guiding the design of the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST). We demonstrate how tranformational advances in topics including star formation in high redshift galaxies, the diffuse circumgalactic medium, Galactic ecology, cometary compositions and solar flares motivate the need for a 50m, single-dish telescope with a 1-2 degree field of view and a new generation of highly multiplexed continuum and spectral cameras. AtLAST will have the resolution to drastically lower the confusion limit compared to current single-dish facilities, whilst also being able to rapidly map large areas of the sky and detect extended, diffuse structures. Its high sensitivity and large field of view will open up the field of submillimeter transient science by increasing the probability of serendipitous detections. Finally, the science cases listed here motivate the need for a highly flexible operations model capable of short observations of individual targets, large surveys, monitoring programmes, target of opportunity observations and coordinated observations with other observatories. AtLAST aims to be a sustainable, upgradeable, multipurpose facility that will deliver orders of magnitude increases in sensitivity and mapping speeds over current and planned submillimeter observatories.</description>

      <title>Instrument Overview of Taurus: A Balloon-borne CMB and Dust Polarization Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taurus is a balloon-borne cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment optimized to map the E-mode polarization and Galactic foregrounds at the largest angular scales ($\ell$ $\lt$ 30) and improve measurements of the optical depth to reionization ($\tau$). This will pave the way for improved measurements of the sum of neutrino masses in combination with high-resolution CMB data while also testing the $\Lambda CDM$ model on large angular scales and providing high-frequency maps of polarized dust foregrounds to the CMB community. These measurements take advantage of the low-loading environment found in the stratosphere and are enabled by NASA's super-pressure balloon platform, which provides access to 70% of the sky with a launch from Wanaka, New Zealand. Here we describe a general overview of Taurus, with an emphasis on the instrument design. Taurus will employ more than 10,000 100 mK transition edge sensor bolometers distributed across two low-frequency (150, 220 GHz) and one high-frequency (280, 350 GHz) dichroic receivers. The liquid helium cryostat housing the detectors and optics is supported by a lightweight gondola. The payload is designed to meet the challenges in mass, power, and thermal control posed by the super-pressure platform. The instrument and scan strategy are optimized for rigorous control of instrumental systematics, enabling high-fidelity linear polarization measurements on the largest angular scales.</description>

      <title>A Markovian description of the multi-level source function and its application to the Lyman series in the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. We introduce a new method to calculate and interpret indirect transition rates populating atomic levels using Markov chain theory. Indirect transition rates are essential to evaluate interlocking in a multi-level source function, which quantifies all the processes that add and remove photons from a spectral line. A better understanding of the multi-level source function is central to interpret optically thick spectral line formation in stellar atmospheres, especially outside local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE). Methods. We compute the level populations from a hydrogen model atom in statistical equilibrium, using the solar FALC model, a 1D static atmosphere. From the transition rates, we reconstruct the multi-level source function using our new method and compare it with existing methods to build the source function. We focus on the Lyman series lines and analyze the different contributions to the source functions and synthetic spectra. Results. Absorbing Markov chains can represent the level-ratio solution of the statistical equilibrium equation and can therefore be used to calculate the indirect transition rates between the upper and lower levels of an atomic transition. Our description of the multi-level source function allows a more physical interpretation of its individual terms, particularly a quantitative view of interlocking. For the Lyman lines in the FALC atmosphere, we find that interlocking becomes increasingly important with order in the series, with Ly-{\alpha} showing very little, but Ly-\b{eta} nearly 50% and Ly-{\gamma} about 60% contribution coming from interlocking. In some cases, this view seems opposed to the conventional wisdom that these lines are mostly scattering, and we discuss the reasons why.</description>

      <title>Replication of filtered interferometer measurements in interstellar communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interstellar communication signals have been conjectured to be present, albeit difficult to identify. Experiments conducted since 2018 indicate an anomalous presence of a type of speculated interstellar signal, delta-t delta-f polarized pulse pairs, thought to be possibly sourced from a celestial direction near 5.25 hr Right Ascension and -7.6 deg. Declination. A recent experiment utilizing a radio interferometer identified anomalous pulse pairs associated with these celestial coordinates. The experiment is described in arXiv:2404.08994. Other experiments produced anomalous results, reported in arXiv:2105.03727, arXiv:2106.10168, arXiv:2202.12791 and arXiv:2203.10065. After the recent experiment was concluded, the interferometer antenna elements were modified to have increased aperture and reduction in radio interference-caused false positives. An experiment was conducted to attempt replication of the previously reported interferometer measurements. Observations are reported here. Apparent replicated falsification of an expected random white noise explanatory hypothesis compels the development and testing of alternate and auxiliary hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the actuation system of the inertial sensor for high-precision space missions using torsion pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision space inertial sensors are imperative to Earth geodesy missions, gravitational wave observations and several fundamental physics experiments in space. In these missions, the residual acceleration noise of the test mass(TM) caused by the forces from inertial sensor components and environment is supposed to be kept below a certain level. As a number of forces contributing to residual acceleration are related to actuation system, developing a precise actuation system to exclude any erroneous force and obtain an ultra sensitive value for TM acceleration noise is necessary and essential. However, it is difficult to test the actuation system on ground. In this paper, a torsion pendulum is established to test the influence of actuation system on TM torque noise and a closed-loop control system combined torsion pendulum and parts of actuation modules is designed to assess the performance of actuation control algorithm. The experimental results show that the parameters in an actuation system will introduce additional torque noise and the maximum noise can reach as much as 10^{-13}Nm /Hz^{1/2} at 1 mHz. The stable tracking error for the closed-loop system is about 10^{-7}, indicating that the combination system achieves good tracking performance and robustness for TM rotation control in different conditions of inertial sensors.</description>

      <title>RIS: Regularized Imaging Spectroscopy for STIX on-board Solar Orbiter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaging spectroscopy, i.e., the generation of spatially resolved count spectra and of cubes of count maps at different energies, is one of the main goals of solar hard X-ray missions based on Fourier imaging. For these telescopes, so far imaging spectroscopy has been realized via the generation of either count maps independently reconstructed at the different energy channels, or electron flux maps reconstructed via deconvolution of the bremsstrahlung cross-section. Our aim is to introduce the Regularized Imaging Spectroscopy method (RIS), in which regularization implemented in the count space imposes a smoothing constraint across contiguous energy channels, without the need to deconvolve the bremsstrahlung effect. STIX records imaging data computing visibilities in the spatial frequency domain. Our RIS is a sequential scheme in which part of the information coded in the image reconstructed at a specific energy channel is transferred to the reconstruction process at a contiguous channel via visibility interpolation based on Variably Scaled Kernels. In the case of STIX visibilities recorded during the November 11, 2022 flaring event, we show that RIS is able to generate hard X-ray maps whose morphology smoothly evolves from one energy channel to the contiguous one, and that from these maps it is possible to infer spatially-resolved count spectra characterized by notable numerical stability. We also show that the performances of this approach are robust with respect to both the image reconstruction method and the count energy channel utilized to trigger the sequential process. RIS is appropriate to construct image cubes from STIX visibilities that are characterized by a smooth behavior across count energies, thus allowing the generation of numerically stable (and, thus, physically reliable) local count spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new millimeter- to millimeter-wave double-modulation double-resonance (MMW-MMW DM-DR) scheme has been applied to record spectra of two astronomically relevant complex organic molecules (COMs), propanal (C2H5CHO) and ethyl cyanide (C2H5CN), to demonstrate advantages of the DM-DR experimental technique. The DR technique helps to identify target transitions in a forest of lines and the implementation of a DM procedure (modulation of the pump and probe source) allows for confusion- and baseline-free spectra containing only the line(s) of interest. In particular the unambiguous assignment of weak and blended transitions in very dense MMW spectra is highlighted. Details of the observed Autler-Townes line splitting and possible future applications, such as automated analyses and adaptions of DM-DR methods to other experimental setups, are discussed.</description>

      <title>GRAVITY for MATISSE -- Improving the MATISSE performance with the GRAVITY fringe tracker</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: MATISSE, the mid-infrared spectro-imaging instrument of VLTI, was designed to deliver its advertised performance when paired with an external second generation fringe tracker. Science observation started in 2019, demonstrating imaging capabilities and faint science target observations. Now, The GRAVITY fringe tracker stabilizes the MATISSE fringes which allows using all spectroscopic modes and improves sensitivity and data accuracy. Aims: We present how the MATISSE and GRAVITY instruments were adapted to make the GRAVITY fringe tracker work with MATISSE, under the umbrella of the aptly-named GRA4MAT project, led by ESO in collaboration with the two instrument consortia. Methods: We detail the software modifications needed to implement an acquisition and observing sequence specific to GRA4MAT, including simultaneous fringe tracking and chopping and a narrow off-axis capability inspired by the galactic center and exoplanet capability of GRAVITY. We explain the modified data collection and reduction processes. We show how we leveraged the recent fringe tracker upgrade to implement features specific to its use with MATISSE, e.g. fringe jumps mitigation with an improved group delay control and simultaneous fringe tracking and chopping with a new state machine. Results: We successfully demonstrate significant improvements to the MATISSE instrument. Observations can now be performed at higher spectral resolutions of up to $R\sim3300$ and across the full LM bands at once. Long detector integration times, made possible with stabilized fringes, have improved the LM-bands sensitivity by a factor of 10. Low flux biases in coherently-reduced N-band data have been eliminated. The L-band transfer function is now higher and more stable. We finally illustrate the scientific potential of GRA4MAT with a preview of the first exoplanet observation made by MATISSE on $\beta$ Pictoris b.</description>

      <title>The Black Hole Explorer: Preliminary Antenna Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the basic design of a large, light weight, spaceborne antenna for the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) space Very Long Baseline Interferometry (space-VLBI) mission, achieving high efficiency operation at mm/sub-mm wavelengths. An introductory overview of the mission and its science background are provided. The BHEX mission targets fundamental black hole physics enabled by the detection of the finely structured image feature around black holes known as the photon ring, theoretically expected due to light orbiting the black hole before reaching the observer. Interferometer baselines much longer than an earth diameter are necessary to attain the spatial resolution required to detect the photon ring, leading to a space component. The science goals require high sensitivity observations at mm/sub-mm wavelengths, placing stringent constraints on antenna performance. The design approach described, seeks to balance the antenna aperture, volume and mass constraints of the NASA Explorers mission opportunity profile and the desired high performance. A 3.5 m aperture with a 40 $\mu$m surface rms is targeted. Currently, a symmetric, dual reflector, axially displaced ellipse (Gregorian ring focus) optical design and metallized carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) sandwich construction have been chosen to deliver high efficiency and light weight. Further exploration of design choices and parameter space and reflector shaping studies are in progress</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18148v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have searched for anomalous events using 2,520 hours of archival observations from Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes radio telescope. These observations were originally undertaken to search for pulsars. We used a machine-learning algorithm based on ResNet and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) in order to identify parts of the data stream that potentially contain anomalous signals. Many of these anomalous events are radio frequency interference, which were subsequently filtered using multibeam information. We detected 202 anomalous events and provide their positions and event times. We discuss the possibility that one of the events comes from radio emission from a white dwarf star.The other events are currently of unknown type.</description>

      <title>Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis: an application to gravitational waves data analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.09499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis (MESA) method, developed by Burg, offers a powerful tool for spectral estimation of a time-series. It relies on Jaynes' maximum entropy principle, allowing the spectrum of a stochastic process to be inferred using the coefficients of an autoregressive process AR($p$) of order $p$. A closed-form recursive solution provides estimates for both the autoregressive coefficients and the order $p$ of the process. We provide a ready-to-use implementation of this algorithm in a Python package called \texttt{memspectrum}, characterized through power spectral density (PSD) analysis on synthetic data with known PSD and comparisons of different criteria for stopping the recursion. Additionally, we compare the performance of our implementation with the ubiquitous Welch algorithm, using synthetic data generated from the GW150914 strain spectrum released by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra collaboration. Our findings indicate that Burg's method provides PSD estimates with systematically lower variance and bias. This is particularly manifest in the case of a small (O($5000$)) number of data points, making Burg's method most suitable to work in this regime. Since this is close to the typical length of analysed gravitational waves data, improving the estimate of the PSD in this regime leads to more reliable posterior profiles for the system under study. We conclude our investigation by utilising MESA, and its particularly easy parametrisation where the only free parameter is the order $p$ of the AR process, to marginalise over the interferometers noise PSD in conjunction with inferring the parameters of GW150914.</description>

      <title>A measurement of the sodium and iodine scintillation quenching factors across multiple NaI(Tl) detectors to identify systematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The amount of light produced by nuclear recoils in scintillating targets is strongly quenched compared to that produced by electrons. A precise understanding of the quenching factor is particularly interesting for WIMP searches and CE{\nu}NS measurements since both rely on nuclear recoils, whereas energy calibrations are more readily accessible from electron recoils. There is a wide variation among the current measurements of the quenching factor in sodium iodide (NaI) crystals, especially below 10 keV, the energy region of interest for dark matter and CE{\nu}NS studies. A better understanding of the quenching factor in NaI(Tl) is of particular interest for resolving the decades-old puzzle in the field of dark matter between the null results of most WIMP searches and the claim for dark matter detection by the DAMA/LIBRA collaboration. In this work, we measured sodium and iodine quenching factors for five small NaI(Tl) crystals grown with similar thallium concentrations and growth procedures. Unlike previous experiments, multiple crystals were tested, with measurements made in the same experimental setup to control systematic effects. The quenching factors agree in all crystals we investigated, and both sodium and iodine quenching factors are smaller than those reported by DAMA/LIBRA. The dominant systematic effect was due to the electron equivalent energy calibration originating from the non-proportional behavior of the NaI(Tl) light yield at lower energies, potentially the cause for the discrepancies among the previous measurements.</description>

      <title>Performance of the HAWC Observatory and TeV Gamma-Ray Measurements of the Crab Nebula with Improved Extensive Air Shower Reconstruction Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Gamma-Ray Observatory located on the side of the Sierra Negra volcano in Mexico, has been fully operational since 2015. The HAWC collaboration has recently significantly improved their extensive-air-shower reconstruction algorithms, which has notably advanced the observatory performance. The energy resolution for primary gamma rays with energies below 1~TeV was improved by including a noise-suppression algorithm. Corrections have also been made to systematic errors in direction fitting related to the detector and shower plane inclinations, $\mathcal{O}(0.1^{\circ})$ biases in highly inclined showers, as well as enhancements to the core reconstruction. The angular resolution for gamma rays approaching the HAWC array from large zenith angles ($&gt; 37^{\circ}$) has improved by a factor of four at the highest energies ($&gt; 70$~TeV) as compared to previous reconstructions. The inclusion of a lateral distribution function fit to the extensive air shower footprint on the array to separate gamma-ray primaries from cosmic-ray ones, based on the resulting $\chi^{2}$ values, improved the background rejection performance at all inclinations. At large zenith angles, the improvement in significance is a factor of four compared to previous HAWC publications. These enhancements have been verified by observing the Crab Nebula, which is an overhead source for the HAWC Observatory. We show that the sensitivity to Crab-like point sources ($E^{-2.63}$) with locations overhead to 30$^{\circ}$ zenith is comparable or less than 10\% of the Crab Nebula's flux between 2 and 50~TeV. Thanks to these improvements, HAWC can now detect more sources, including the Galactic Center.</description>

      <title>Quantum Parity Detectors: a qubit based particle detection scheme with meV thresholds for rare-event searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The next generation of rare-event searches, such as those aimed at determining the nature of particle dark matter or in measuring fundamental neutrino properties, will benefit from particle detectors with thresholds at the meV scale, 100-1000x lower than currently available. Quantum parity detectors (QPDs) are a novel class of proposed quantum devices that use the tremendous sensitivity of superconducting qubits to quasiparticle tunneling events as their detection concept. As envisioned, phonons generated by particle interactions within a crystalline substrate cause an eventual quasiparticle cascade within a surface patterned superconducting qubit element. This process alters the fundamental charge parity of the device in a binary manner, which can be used to deduce the initial properties of the energy deposition. We lay out the operating mechanism, noise sources, and expected sensitivity of QPDs based on a spectrum of charge-qubit types and readout mechanisms and detail an R&amp;D pathway to demonstrating sensitivity to sub-eV energy deposits.</description>

      <title>Optimized sampling of SDSS-IV MaStar spectra for stellar classification using supervised models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supervised machine learning models are increasingly being used for solving the problem of stellar classification of spectroscopic data. However, training such models requires a large number of labelled instances, the collection of which is usually costly in both time and expertise. Active learning algorithms minimize training dataset sizes by keeping only the most informative instances. This paper explores the application of active learning to sampling stellar spectra using data from a highly class-imbalanced dataset. We utilize the MaStar library from the SDSS DR17 along with its associated stellar parameter catalogue. A preprocessing pipeline that includes feature selection, scaling, and dimensionality reduction is applied to the data. Using different active learning algorithms, we iteratively query instances, where the model or committee of models exhibits the highest uncertainty or disagreement, respectively. We assess the effectiveness of the sampling techniques by comparing several performance metrics of supervised-learning models trained on the queried samples with randomly-sampled counterparts. Evaluation metrics include specificity, sensitivity, and the area under the curve; in addition to the Matthew's correlation coefficient, which accounts for class imbalance. We apply this procedure to effective temperature, surface gravity, and iron metallicity, separately. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of active learning algorithms in selecting samples that produce performance metrics superior to random sampling and even stratified samples, with fewer training instances. Active learning is recommended for prioritizing instance labelling of astronomical-survey data by experts or crowdsourcing to mitigate the high time cost. Its effectiveness can be further exploited in selection of targets for follow-up observations in automated astronomical surveys.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference: More than Bayes's theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference gets its name from *Bayes's theorem*, expressing posterior probabilities for hypotheses about a data generating process as the (normalized) product of prior probabilities and a likelihood function. But Bayesian inference uses all of probability theory, not just Bayes's theorem. Many hypotheses of scientific interest are *composite hypotheses*, with the strength of evidence for the hypothesis dependent on knowledge about auxiliary factors, such as the values of nuisance parameters (e.g., uncertain background rates or calibration factors). Many important capabilities of Bayesian methods arise from use of the law of total probability, which instructs analysts to compute probabilities for composite hypotheses by *marginalization* over auxiliary factors. This tutorial targets relative newcomers to Bayesian inference, aiming to complement tutorials that focus on Bayes's theorem and how priors modulate likelihoods. The emphasis here is on marginalization over parameter spaces -- both how it is the foundation for important capabilities, and how it may motivate caution when parameter spaces are large. Topics covered include the difference between likelihood and probability, understanding the impact of priors beyond merely shifting the maximum likelihood estimate, and the role of marginalization in accounting for uncertainty in nuisance parameters, systematic error, and model misspecification.</description>
