      <title>Ex-post Stability under Two-Sided Matching: Complexity and Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A probabilistic approach to the stable matching problem has been identified as an important research area with several important open problems. When considering random matchings, ex-post stability is a fundamental stability concept. A prominent open problem is characterizing ex-post stability and establishing its computational complexity. We investigate the computational complexity of testing ex-post stability. Our central result is that when either side has ties in the preferences/priorities, testing ex-post stability is NP-complete. The result even holds if both sides have dichotomous preferences. On the positive side, we give an algorithm using an integer programming approach, that can determine a decomposition with a maximum probability of being weakly stable. We also consider stronger versions of ex-post stability (in particular robust ex-post stability and ex-post strong stability) and prove that they can be tested in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent reinforcement learning strategy to maximize the lifetime of Wireless Rechargeable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thesis proposes a generalized charging framework for multiple mobile chargers to maximize the network lifetime and ensure target coverage and connectivity in large scale WRSNs. Moreover, a multi-point charging model is leveraged to enhance charging efficiency, where the MC can charge multiple sensors simultaneously at each charging location. The thesis proposes an effective Decentralized Partially Observable Semi-Markov Decision Process (Dec POSMDP) model that promotes Mobile Chargers (MCs) cooperation and detects optimal charging locations based on realtime network information. Furthermore, the proposal allows reinforcement algorithms to be applied to different networks without requiring extensive retraining. To solve the Dec POSMDP model, the thesis proposes an Asynchronous Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning algorithm (AMAPPO) based on the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (PPO).</description>

      <title>To Be a Truster or Not to Be: Evolutionary Dynamics of a Symmetric N-Player Trust Game in Well-Mixed and Networked Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trust and reciprocation of it form the foundation of economic, social and other interactions. While the Trust Game is widely used to study these concepts for interactions between two players, often alternating different roles (i.e., investor and trustee), its extensions to multi-player scenarios have been restricted to instances where players assume only one role. We propose a symmetric N-player Trust Game, in which players alternate between two roles, and the payoff of the player is defined as the average across their two roles and drives the evolutionary game dynamics. We find that prosocial strategies are harder to evolve with the present symmetric N-player Trust Game than with the Public Goods Game, which is well studied. In particular, trust fails to evolve regardless of payoff function nonlinearity in well-mixed populations in the case of the symmetric N-player trust game. In structured populations, nonlinear payoffs can have strong impacts on the evolution of trust. The same nonlinearity can yield substantially different outcomes, depending on the nature of the underlying network. Our results highlight the importance of considering both payoff structures and network topologies in understanding the emergence and maintenance of prosocial behaviours.</description>

      <title>Different Strokes in Randomised Strategies: Revisiting Kuhn's Theorem under Finite-Memory Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.10825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-player (antagonistic) games on (possibly stochastic) graphs are a prevalent model in theoretical computer science, notably as a framework for reactive synthesis.
  Optimal strategies may require randomisation when dealing with inherently probabilistic goals, balancing multiple objectives, or in contexts of partial information. There is no unique way to define randomised strategies. For instance, one can use so-called mixed strategies or behavioural ones. In the most general setting, these two classes do not share the same expressiveness. A seminal result in game theory -- Kuhn's theorem -- asserts their equivalence in games of perfect recall.
  This result crucially relies on the possibility for strategies to use infinite memory, i.e., unlimited knowledge of all past observations. However, computer systems are finite in practice. Hence it is pertinent to restrict our attention to finite-memory strategies, defined as automata with outputs. Randomisation can be implemented in these in different ways: the initialisation, outputs or transitions can be randomised or deterministic respectively. Depending on which aspects are randomised, the expressiveness of the corresponding class of finite-memory strategies differs.
  In this work, we study two-player concurrent stochastic games and provide a complete taxonomy of the classes of finite-memory strategies obtained by varying which of the three aforementioned components are randomised. Our taxonomy holds in games of perfect and imperfect information with perfect recall, and in games with more than two players. We also provide an adapted taxonomy for games with imperfect recall.</description>

      <title>Envy-freeness and maximum Nash welfare for mixed divisible and indivisible goods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study fair allocation of resources consisting of both divisible and indivisible goods to agents with additive valuations. When only divisible or indivisible goods exist, it is known that an allocation that achieves the maximum Nash welfare (MNW) satisfies the classic fairness notions based on envy. Moreover, the literature shows the structures and characterizations of MNW allocations when valuations are binary and linear (i.e., divisible goods are homogeneous). In this paper, we show that when all agents' valuations are binary linear, an MNW allocation for mixed goods satisfies the envy-freeness up to any good for mixed goods (EFXM). This notion is stronger than an existing one called envy-freeness for mixed goods (EFM), and our result generalizes the existing results for the case when only divisible or indivisible goods exist. When all agents' valuations are binary over indivisible goods and identical over divisible goods (e.g., the divisible good is money), we extend the known characterization of an MNW allocation for indivisible goods to mixed goods, and also show that an MNW allocation satisfies EFXM. For the general additive valuations, we also provide a formal proof that an MNW allocation satisfies a weaker notion than EFM.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Game Theory-based Mobile Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the continuous advancement of network technology, various emerging complex networking optimization problems have created a wide range of applications utilizing game theory. However, since game theory is a mathematical framework, game theory-based solutions often rely heavily on the experience and knowledge of human experts. Recently, the remarkable advantages exhibited by generative artificial intelligence (GAI) have gained widespread attention. In this work, we propose a novel GAI-enabled game theory solution that combines the powerful reasoning and generation capabilities of GAI to the design and optimization of mobile networking. Specifically, we first outline the game theory and key technologies of GAI, and explore the advantages of combining GAI with game theory. Then, we review the contributions and limitations of existing research and demonstrate the potential application values of GAI applied to game theory in mobile networking. Subsequently, we develop a large language model (LLM)-enabled game theory framework to realize this combination, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through a case study in secured UAV networks. Finally, we provide several directions for future extensions.</description>

      <title>Constant-Factor EFX Exists for Chores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03318v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of fair allocation of chores to agents with additive preferences. In the discrete setting, envy-freeness up to any chore (EFX) has emerged as a compelling fairness criterion. However, establishing its (non-)existence or achieving a meaningful approximation remains a major open question. The current best guarantee is the existence of $O(n^2)$-EFX allocations for $n$ agents, obtained through a sophisticated algorithm (Zhou and Wu, 2022). In this paper, we show the existence of $4$-EFX allocations, providing the first constant-factor approximation of EFX.
  We also investigate the existence of allocations that are both fair and efficient, using Pareto optimality (PO) as our efficiency criterion. For the special case of bivalued instances, we establish the existence of allocations that are both $3$-EFX and PO, thus improving the current best factor of $O(n)$-EFX without any efficiency guarantees. For general additive instances, the existence of allocations that are $\alpha$-EF$k$ and PO has remained open for any constant values of $\alpha$ and $k$, where EF$k$ denotes envy-freeness up to $k$ chores. We provide the first positive result in this direction by showing the existence of allocations that are $2$-EF$2$ and PO.
  Our results are obtained via a novel economic framework called earning restricted (ER) competitive equilibrium for fractional allocations, which limits agents' earnings from each chore. We show the existence of ER equilibria by formulating it as an linear complementarity problem (LCP) and proving that the classic complementary pivot algorithm on the LCP terminates at an ER equilibrium. We design algorithms that carefully round fractional ER equilibria, and perform bundle swaps and merges to meet the desired fairness and efficiency criteria. We expect that the concept of ER equilibrium will be useful in deriving further results on related problems.</description>
