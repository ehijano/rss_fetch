      <title>The Blockchain Risk Parity Line: Moving From The Efficient Frontier To The Final Frontier Of Investments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We engineer blockchain based risk managed portfolios by creating three funds with distinct risk and return profiles: 1) Alpha - high risk portfolio; 2) Beta - mimics the wider market; and 3) Gamma - represents the risk free rate adjusted to beat inflation. Each of the sub-funds (Alpha, Beta and Gamma) provides risk parity because the weight of each asset in the corresponding portfolio is set to be inversely proportional to the risk derived from investing in that asset. This can be equivalently stated as equal risk contributions from each asset towards the overall portfolio risk.
  We provide detailed mechanics of combining assets - including mathematical formulations - to obtain better risk managed portfolios. The descriptions are intended to show how a risk parity based efficient frontier portfolio management engine - that caters to different risk appetites of investors by letting each individual investor select their preferred risk-return combination - can be created seamlessly on blockchain.
  Any Investor - using decentralized ledger technology - can select their desired level of risk, or return, and allocate their wealth accordingly among the sub funds, which balance one another under different market conditions. This evolution of the risk parity principle - resulting in a mechanism that is geared to do well under all market cycles - brings more robust performance and can be termed as conceptual parity.
  We have given several numerical examples that illustrate the various scenarios that arise when combining Alpha, Beta and Gamma to obtain Parity.
  The final investment frontier is now possible - a modification to the efficient frontier, thus becoming more than a mere theoretical construct - on blockchain since anyone from anywhere can participate at anytime to obtain wealth appreciation based on their financial goals.</description>

      <title>Low Volatility Stock Portfolio Through High Dimensional Bayesian Cointegration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a Bayesian modelling technique for high dimensional cointegration estimation to construct low volatility portfolios from a large number of stocks. The proposed Bayesian framework effectively identifies sparse and important cointegration relationships amongst large baskets of stocks across various asset spaces, resulting in portfolios with reduced volatility. Such cointegration relationships persist well over the out-of-sample testing time, providing practical benefits in portfolio construction and optimization. Further studies on drawdown and volatility minimization also highlight the benefits of including cointegrated portfolios as risk management instruments.</description>

      <title>Optimal Investment with Herd Behaviour Using Rational Decision Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the optimal investment problem considering the herd behaviour between two agents, including one leading expert and one following agent whose decisions are influenced by those of the leading expert. In the objective functional of the optimal investment problem, we introduce the average deviation term to measure the distance between the two agents' decisions and use the variational method to find its analytical solution. To theoretically analyze the impact of the following agent's herd behaviour on his/her decision, we decompose his/her optimal decision into a convex linear combination of the two agents' rational decisions, which we call the rational decision decomposition. Furthermore, we define the weight function in the rational decision decomposition as the following agent's investment opinion to measure the preference of his/her own rational decision over that of the leading expert. We use the investment opinion to quantitatively analyze the impact of the herd behaviour, the following agent's initial wealth, the excess return, and the volatility of the risky asset on the optimal decision. We validate our analyses through numerical experiments on real stock data. This study is crucial to understanding investors' herd behaviour in decision-making and designing effective mechanisms to guide their decisions.</description>
