      <title>A Bidirectional DeepParticle Method for Efficiently Solving Low-dimensional Transport Map Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to efficiently compute transport maps between probability distributions arising from particle representation of bio-physical problems. We develop a bidirectional DeepParticle (BDP) method to learn and generate solutions under varying physical parameters. Solutions are approximated as empirical measures of particles that adaptively align with the high-gradient regions. The core idea of the BDP method is to learn both forward and reverse mappings (between the uniform and a non-trivial target distribution) by minimizing the discrete 2-Wasserstein distance (W2) and optimizing the transition map therein by a minibatch technique. We present numerical results demonstrating the effectiveness of the BDP method for learning and generating solutions to Keller-Segel chemotaxis systems in the presence of laminar flows and Kolmogorov flows with chaotic streamlines in three space dimensions. The BDP outperforms two recent representative single-step flow matching and diffusion models (rectified flow and shortcut diffusion models) in the generative AI literature. However when the target distribution is high-dimensional (4 and above), e.g. a mixture of two Gaussians, the single-step diffusion models scale better in dimensions than BDP in terms of W2-accuracy.</description>

      <title>PINNs for Solving Unsteady Maxwell's Equations: Convergence Issues and Comparative Assessment with Compact Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative for solving partial differential equations, offering a mesh-free framework that incorporates physical laws directly into the learning process. In this study, we explore the application of PINNs for solving unsteady Maxwell's equations and compare their performance with two established numerical methods: the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method and a compact Pade scheme with filtering. Three benchmark problems are considered, ranging from 1D free-space wave propagation to 2D Gaussian pulses in periodic and dielectric media. We assess the effectiveness of convergence-enhancing strategies for PINNs, including random Fourier features, spatio-temporal periodicity, and temporal causality training. An ablation study highlights that architectural choices must align with the underlying physics. Additionally, we employ a Neural Tangent Kernel framework to examine the spatio-temporal convergence behavior of PINNs. Results show that convergence rates correlate with error over time but not in space, revealing a limitation in how training dynamics allocate learning effort. Overall, this study demonstrates that PINNs, when properly configured, can match or surpass traditional solvers in accuracy and flexibility, though challenges remain in addressing spatial inhomogeneity and adapting training to localized complexity.</description>

      <title>FEAT: Free energy Estimators with Adaptive Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Free energy Estimators with Adaptive Transport (FEAT), a novel framework for free energy estimation -- a critical challenge across scientific domains. FEAT leverages learned transports implemented via stochastic interpolants and provides consistent, minimum-variance estimators based on escorted Jarzynski equality and controlled Crooks theorem, alongside variational upper and lower bounds on free energy differences. Unifying equilibrium and non-equilibrium methods under a single theoretical framework, FEAT establishes a principled foundation for neural free energy calculations. Experimental validation on toy examples, molecular simulations, and quantum field theory demonstrates improvements over existing learning-based methods.</description>

      <title>Optically Switchable Fluorescence Enhancement at Critical Interparticle Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures provide local field enhancement to be used as efficiency-boosting tools in fluorescence-based applications. For photostable quantum dots (QDs) to have enhanced emission, their size and exact location in the proximity of plasmonic nanostructure become key parameters while constructing light emitting devices. However, plasmonic nanostructures mostly suffer from non-radiative energy transfer at close proximity, which hinders the ultimate performance of fluorophores. In this work, we provided critical interparticle distances through finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations, where the radiative decay rate is equalized to the non-radiative counterpart for light emitting QD-based technologies. To show the promises of the QD placement at a critical distance, we demonstrate an optical switch for the fluorescence efficiency of a CdSe/ZnS core-shell QD (CSQD) by optically exciting the silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance. While the provided single particle spectroscopy allows for the observation of heterogeneity in CSQD-AgNP coupling that is often masked in ensemble measurements, our benchmark study serves as a base reference for the development of QD-based light emitting technologies by resolving the optically switchable active tuning of radiative decay rates.</description>

      <title>Dynamical electronic correlation and chiral magnetism in van der Waals magnet Fe4GeTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the quasi-2D van der Waals magnetic systems, Fe4GeTe2 imprints a profound impact due to its near-room temperature ferromagnetic behaviour and the complex magnetothermal phase diagram exhibiting multiple phase transformations, as observed from magnetization and magnetotransport measurements. A complete analysis of these phase transformations in the light of electronic correlation and its impact on the underlying magnetic interactions remain unattended in the existing literature. Using first-principles methodologies, incorporating the dynamical nature of electron correlation, we have analysed the interplay of the direction of magnetization in the easy-plane and easy-axis manner with the underlying crystal symmetry, which reveals the opening of a pseudogap feature beyond the spin-reorientation transition (SRT) temperature. The impact of dynamical correlation on the calculated magnetic circular dichroism and x-ray absorption spectrum of the L-edge of the Fe atoms compared well with the existing experimental observations. The calculated intersite Heisenberg exchange interactions display a complicated nature, depending upon the pairwise interactions among the two inequivalent Fe sites, indicating a RKKY-like behaviour of the magnetic interactions. We noted the existence of significant anisotropic and antisymmetric exchanges interactions, resulting into a chirality in the magnetic behaviour of the system. Subsequent investigation of the dynamical aspects of magnetism in Fe4GeTe2 and the respective magnetothermal phase diagram reveal that the dynamical nature of spins and the decoupling of the magnetic properties for both sites of Fe is crucial to explain all the experimentally observed phase transformations.</description>

      <title>Lifelong and Universal Machine Learning Potentials for Chemical Reaction Network Explorations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in computational chemistry facilitate the automated quantum chemical exploration of chemical reaction networks for the in-silico prediction of synthesis pathways, yield, and selectivity. However, the underlying quantum chemical energy calculations require vast computational resources, limiting these explorations severely in practice. Machine learning potentials (MLPs) offer a solution to increase computational efficiency, while retaining the accuracy of reliable first-principles data used for their training. Unfortunately, MLPs will be limited in their generalization ability within chemical (reaction) space, if the underlying training data is not representative for a given application. Within the framework of automated reaction network exploration, where new reactants or reagents composed of any elements from the periodic table can be introduced, this lack of generalizability will be the rule rather than the exception. Here, we therefore study the benefits and drawbacks of two MLP concepts in this context. Whereas universal MLPs are designed to cover most of the relevant chemical space in their training, lifelong MLPs push their adaptability by efficient continual learning of additional data. While the accuracy of the universal MLPs turns out to be not yet sufficient for reaction search trials without any fine-tuning, lifelong MLPs can reach chemical accuracy. We propose an improved learning algorithm for lifelong adaptive data selection yielding efficient integration of new data while previous expertise is preserved.</description>

      <title>Evidential Deep Learning for Interatomic Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have been widely used to facilitate large-scale molecular simulations with accuracy comparable to ab initio methods. In practice, MLIP-based molecular simulations often encounter the issue of collapse due to reduced prediction accuracy for out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Addressing this issue requires enriching the training dataset through active learning, where uncertainty serves as a critical indicator for identifying and collecting OOD data. However, existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods tend to involve either expensive computations or compromise prediction accuracy. In this work, we introduce evidential deep learning for interatomic potentials (eIP) with a physics-inspired design. Our experiments indicate that eIP provides reliable UQ results without significant computational overhead or decreased prediction accuracy, consistently outperforming other UQ methods across a variety of datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applications of eIP in exploring diverse atomic configurations, using examples including water and universal potentials. These results highlight the potential of eIP as a robust and efficient alternative for UQ in molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>Is fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo reproducible?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is a widely-trusted many-body method for solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, known for its reliable predictions of material and molecular properties. Furthermore, its excellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of computational power makes FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in computing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the method is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across the numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This difficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave functions, compounded by the method's inherent stochastic nature. This study represents a community-wide effort to address the titular question, affirming that: Yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the water-methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven different FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the non-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies between them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of determinantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible predictions can be achieved by employing the T-move (TM), the determinant locality approximation (DLA), or the determinant T-move (DTM) schemes, while the older locality approximation (LA) leads to considerable variability in results. This work lays the foundation to establish accurate and reproducible FN-DMC estimates for all future studies across applications in materials science, physics, chemistry, and biology.</description>

      <title>KPROJ: A Program for Unfolding Electronic and Phononic Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10910v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a program named KPROJ that unfolds the electronic and phononic band structure of materials modeled by supercells. The program is based on the $\textit{k}$-projection method, which projects the wavefunction of the supercell onto the ${\textbf{k}}$-points in the Brillouin zone of the artificial primitive cell. It allows for obtaining an effective "local" band structure by performing partial integration over the wavefunctions, e.g., the unfolded band structure with layer-projection for interfaces and the weighted band structure in the vacuum for slabs. The layer projection is accelerated by a scheme that combines the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the inverse FFT algorithms. It is now interfaced with a few first-principles codes based on plane waves such as VASP, Quantum Espresso, and ABINIT. In addition, it also has interfaces with ABACUS, a first-principles simulation package based on numerical atomic basis sets, and PHONOPY, a program for phonon calculations.</description>

      <title>Fast Jet Finding in Julia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jet reconstruction remains a critical task in the analysis of data from HEP colliders. We describe in this paper a new, highly performant, Julia package for jet reconstruction, JetReconstruction.jl, which integrates into the growing ecosystem of Julia packages for HEP. With this package users can run sequential reconstruction algorithms for jets. In particular, for LHC events, the Anti-${k}_\text{T}$, Cambridge/Aachen and Inclusive-${k}_\text{T}$ algorithms can be used. For FCCee studies the use of alternative algorithms such as the Generalised ${k}_\text{T}$ for $e^+e^-$ and Durham are also supported.
  The performance of the core algorithms is better than Fastjet's C++ implementation, for typical LHC and FCCee events, thanks to the Julia compiler's exploitation of single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD), as well as ergonomic compact data layouts.
  The full reconstruction history is made available, allowing inclusive and exclusive jets to be retrieved. The package also provides the means to visualise the reconstruction. Substructure algorithms have been added that allow advanced analysis techniques to be employed. The package can read event data from EDM4hep files and reconstruct jets from these directly, opening the door to FCCee and other future collider studies in Julia.</description>

      <title>Dynamical errors in machine learning forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In machine learning forecasting, standard error metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) quantify discrepancies between predictions and target values. However, these metrics do not directly evaluate the physical and/or dynamical consistency of forecasts, an increasingly critical concern in scientific and engineering applications.
  Indeed, a fundamental yet often overlooked question is whether machine learning forecasts preserve the dynamical behavior of the underlying system. Addressing this issue is essential for assessing the fidelity of machine learning models and identifying potential failure modes, particularly in applications where maintaining correct dynamical behavior is crucial.
  In this work, we investigate the relationship between standard forecasting error metrics, such as MAE and MSE, and the dynamical properties of the underlying system. To achieve this goal, we use two recently developed dynamical indices: the instantaneous dimension ($d$), and the inverse persistence ($\theta$). Our results indicate that larger forecast errors -- e.g., higher MSE -- tend to occur in states with higher $d$ (higher complexity) and higher $\theta$ (lower persistence). To further assess dynamical consistency, we propose error metrics based on the dynamical indices that measure the discrepancy of the forecasted $d$ and $\theta$ versus their correct values. Leveraging these dynamical indices-based metrics, we analyze direct and recursive forecasting strategies for three canonical datasets -- Lorenz, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and Kolmogorov flow -- as well as a real-world weather forecasting task. Our findings reveal substantial distortions in dynamical properties in ML forecasts, especially for long forecast lead times or long recursive simulations, providing complementary information on ML forecast fidelity that can be used to improve ML models.</description>
