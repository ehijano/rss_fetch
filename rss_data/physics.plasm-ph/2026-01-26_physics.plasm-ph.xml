      <title>Improved Kelbg Potentials for $Z&gt;1$ and Application to Carbon Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a general form for the electron-ion diffractive potential derived from the quantum pair density matrix and fit to the improved Kelbg potential for atomic numbers up to $Z = 54$. We apply classical molecular dynamics using the improved Kelbg potential for carbon with various forms of the Pauli potential to compute internal energies and pressures for hot, dense plasma conditions. Our results are compared to an equation of state model based on path integral Monte Carlo and density functional theory simulations to examine the extent to which the improved Kelbg potential reproduces the internal energy and pressure of carbon plasmas. The regions of validity for carbon agree generally with those derived previously for hydrogen once pressure ionization effects are incorporated. Based on our carbon results and previously published hydrogen studies, we discuss the general applicability and limitations of these potentials for equation of state studies in warm dense matter and high energy density plasmas.</description>

      <title>Information Propagation in Predator-Prey Dynamics of Turbulent Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetically confined fusion plasmas exhibit predator-prey-like cyclic oscillations through the self-regulating interaction between drift-wave turbulence and zonal flow. To elucidate the detailed mechanism and causality underlying this phenomenon, we construct a simple stochastic predator-prey model that incorporates intrinsic fluctuations and analyze its statistical properties from an information-theoretic perspective. We first show that the model exhibits persistent fluctuating cyclic oscillations called quasi-cycles due to amplification of intrinsic noise. This result suggests the possibility that the previously observed periodic oscillations in a toroidal plasma are not limit cycles but quasi-cycles, and that such quasi-cycles may be widely observed under various conditions. For this model, we further prove that information of the zonal flow is propagated to turbulence. This result suggests that turbulence behavior may be predictable to a certain extent based on zonal flow characteristics.</description>

      <title>Ion Temperature Anisotropy Limits from Magnetic Curvature Scattering in Magnetotail Reconnection Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In collisionless plasmas, relaxation of the deviations of ion velocity distribution functions (VDFs) from local thermodynamic equilibrium occurs through particle interactions with electromagnetic fields. In particular, in the Earth's magnetotail, the deviations of the ion VDFs, typically consisting of multiple components, from the equilibrium must be limited to maintain stability of the current sheet. Curvature scattering is a leading candidate mechanism to limit such deviations, but its role remains insufficiently understood. We investigate the limits of ion temperature anisotropy in a magnetotail-like configuration by modeling a quasi-1D current sheet with a finite magnetic field curvature and three ion populations. We derive analytical thresholds for anisotropy based on current sheet stability and validate against spacecraft observations and numerical simulations. Our findings demonstrate that curvature scattering imposes limits on ion anisotropies, thereby maintaining the stability of the current sheet.</description>
