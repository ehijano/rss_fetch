      <title>Generalized Reynolds algebras from Volterra integrals and their free construction by complete shuffle product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces algebraic structures for Volterra integral operators with separable kernels, in the style of differential algebra for derivations and Rota-Baxter algebra for operators with kernels dependent solely on a dummy variable. We demonstrate that these operators satisfy a generalization of the algebraic identity defining the classical Reynolds operator, which is rooted in Reynolds's influential work on fluid mechanics.
  To study Volterra integral operators and their integral equations through this algebraic lens, particularly in providing a general form of these integral equations, we construct free objects in the category of algebras equipped with generalized Reynolds operators and the associated differential operators, termed differential Reynolds algebras. Due to the cyclic nature of the Reynolds identity, the natural rewriting rule derived from it does not terminate. To address this challenge, we develop a completion for the underlying space, where a complete shuffle product is defined for the free objects. We also include examples and applications related to Volterra integral equations.</description>

      <title>Almost fine gradings on algebras and classification of gradings up to isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of classifying gradings by groups on a finite-dimensional algebra $A$ (with any number of multilinear operations) over an algebraically closed field. We introduce a class of gradings, which we call almost fine, such that every $G$-grading on $A$ is obtained from an almost fine grading on $A$ in an essentially unique way, which is not the case with fine gradings. For abelian groups, we give a method of obtaining all almost fine gradings if fine gradings are known. We apply these ideas to the case of semisimple Lie algebras in characteristic $0$: to any abelian group grading with nonzero identity component, we attach a (possibly nonreduced) root system and, in the simple case, construct an adapted grading by this root system.</description>

      <title>On Bott--Samelson rings for Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the cohomology ring of the Bott--Samelson variety. We compute an explicit presentation of this ring via Soergel's result, which implies that it is a purely combinatorial invariant. We use the presentation to introduce the Bott--Samelson ring associated with a word in arbitrary Coxeter system by generators and relations. In general, it is a split quadratic complete intersection algebra with a triangular pattern of relations. By a result of Tate, it follows that it is a Koszul algebra and we provide a quadratic (reduced) Gr{\"o}bner basis. Furthermore, we prove that it satisfies the whole K\"ahler package, including the Poincar\'e duality, the hard Lefschetz theorem, and the Hodge--Riemann bilinear relations.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of graded module categories over skew polynomial algebras at roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an operation on skew-symmetric matrices over $\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}$ called switching, and also define a class of skew-symmetric matrices over $\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}$ referred to as modular Eulerian matrices. We then show that these are closely related to the graded module categories over skew polynomial algebras at $\ell$-th roots of unity. As an application, we study the point simplicial complexes of skew polynomial algebras at cube roots of unity.</description>
