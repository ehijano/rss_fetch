      <title>Powers of ghost ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theory of ordinal powers of the ideal $\mathfrak{g}_{\mathcal{S}}$ of $\mathcal{S}$-ghost morphisms is developed by introducing for every ordinal $\lambda$, the $\lambda$-th inductive power $\mathcal{J}^{(\lambda)}$ of an ideal $\mathcal{J}.$ The Generalized $\lambda$-Generating Hypothesis ($\lambda$-GGH) for an ideal $\mathcal J$ of an exact category $\mathcal{A}$ is the proposition that the $\lambda$-th inductive power ${\mathcal{J}}^{(\lambda)}$ is an object ideal.
  It is shown that under mild conditions every inductive power of a ghost ideal is an object-special preenveloping ideal. When $\lambda$ is infinite, the proof is based on an ideal version of Eklof's Lemma. When $\lambda$ is an infinite regular cardinal, the Generalized $\lambda$-Generating Hypothesis is established for the ghost ideal $\mathfrak{g}_{\mathcal{S}}$ for the case when $\mathcal A$ a locally $\lambda$-presentable Grothendieck category and $\mathcal{S}$ is a set of $\lambda$-presentable objects in $\mathcal A$ such that $^\perp (\mathcal{S}^\perp)$ contains a generating set for $\mathcal A.$
  As a consequence of $\lambda$-GGH for the ghost ideal $\mathfrak{g}_{R\mbox{-}\mathrm{mod}}$ in the category of modules $R\mbox{-}\mathrm{Mod}$ over a ring, it is shown that if the class of pure projective left $R$-modules is closed under extensions, then every left FP-projective module is pure projective. A restricted version $n$-GGH($\mathfrak{g}(\mathbf{C}(R))$) for the ghost ideal in $\mathbf{C}(R))$ is also considered and it is shown that $n$-GGH($\mathfrak{g}(\mathbf{C}(R))$) holds for $R$ if and only if the $n$-th power of the ghost ideal in the derived category $\mathbf{D}(R)$ is zero if and only if the global dimension of $R$ is less than $n.$ If $R$ is coherent, then the Generating Hypothesis holds for $R$ if and only if $R$ is von Neumann regular.</description>

      <title>Lambda-pure global dimension of Grothendieck categories and some applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $\lambda$-pure global dimension of a Grothendieck category $\cal A$, and provide two different applications about this dimension. We obtain that if the $\lambda$-pure global dimension $\plgldA&lt;\infty$, then (1) The ordinary bounded derived category (where $\cal A$ has enough projective objects) and the bounded $\lambda$-pure one differ only by a homotopy category; (2) The $\lambda$-pure singularity category $\DlsgA =0$. At last, we explore the reason why the general construction of classic Buchweitz-Happel Theorem is not feasible for $\lambda$-pure one.</description>

      <title>Towards computational methods for category theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we describe a computational model for categories and functors. The categories that are handled by this model are locally finitely presentable categories which can be "sufficiently finitely" described to a computer. As an application of this model, we introduce a criterion to show whether a functor, as described in the model, is a left adjoint. The verification of this criterion can be partially automatised, if not fully in some cases, as witnessed by an implementation. While this work is focused on computational aspects, it is relevant to the broader categorical community, as it presents a new way to check whether functors are left adjoints and outlines a new computational methodology in category theory.</description>

      <title>On Unitary 2-Group Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global internal symmetries act unitarily on local observables or states of a quantum system. In this note, we aim to generalise this statement to extended observables by considering unitary actions of finite global 2-group symmetries $\mathcal{G}$ on line operators. We propose that the latter transform in unitary 2-representations of $\mathcal{G}$, which we classify up to unitary equivalence. Our results recover the known classification of ordinary 2-representations of finite 2-groups, but provide additional data interpreted as a type of reflection anomaly for $\mathcal{G}$.</description>

      <title>A symmetric monoidal fracture square</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a symmetric monoidal stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ which is rigidly-compactly generated and a set of compact objects $\mathcal{K}$ of $\mathcal{C}$, one can form the subcategories of $\mathcal{K}$-complete and $\mathcal{K}$-local objects. The goal of this paper is to explain how to recover $\mathcal{C}$ from its $\mathcal{K}$-local and $\mathcal{K}$-complete subcategories while retaining the symmetric monoidal structure. Specializing to the case where $\mathcal{C}$ is the $\infty$-category of $G$-spectra for a finite group $G$, our result can be viewed as a symmetric monoidal variant of the isotropy separation decomposition, a version of which appeared previously in work of Krause.</description>

      <title>Diagonal $p$-permutation functors in characteristic $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number. We consider diagonal $p$-permutation functors over a (commutative, unital) ring $\mathsf{R}$ in which all prime numbers different from $p$ are invertible. We first determine the finite groups $G$ for which the associated essential algebra $\mathcal{E}_\mathsf{R}(G)$ is non zero: These are groups of the form $G=L\rtimes \langle u\rangle$, where $(L,u)$ is a $D^\Delta$-pair. When $\mathsf{R}$ is an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic 0 or $p$, this yields a parametrization of the simple diagonal $p$-permutation functors over $\mathbb{F}$ by triples $(L,u,W)$, where $(L,u)$ is a $D^\Delta$-pair, and $W$ is a simple $\mathbb{F}\mathrm{Out}(L,u)$-module. Finally, we describe the evaluations of the simple functor $\mathsf{S}_{L,u,W}$ parametrized by the triple $(L,u,W)$. We show in particular that if $G$ is a finite group and $\mathbb{F}$ has characteristic $p$, the dimension of $\mathsf{S}_{L,1,\mathbb{F}}(G)$ is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of $p$-regular elements of $G$ with defect isomorphic to $L$.</description>

      <title>Bundles of metric structures as left ultrafunctors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We pursue the study of Ultracategories initiated by Makkai and more recently Lurie by looking at properties of Ultracategories of complete metric structures, i.e. coming from continuous model theory, instead of ultracategories of models of first order theories. Our main result is that for any continuous theory $\mathbb{T}$, there is an equivalence between the category of left ultrafunctors from a compact Hausdorff space $X$ to the category of $\mathbb{T}$-models and a notion of bundle of $\mathbb{T}$-models over $X$. The notion of bundle of $\mathbb{T}$-models is new but recovers many classical notions like Bundle of Banach spaces, or (semi)-continuous field of $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras or Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Pre-Calabi-Yau algebras and topological quantum field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14667v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion generalizing Calabi-Yau structures on A-infinity algebras and categories, which we call pre-Calabi-Yau structures. This notion does not need either one of the finiteness conditions (smoothness or compactness) which are required for Calabi-Yau structures to exist. In terms of noncommutative geometry, a pre-CY structure is as a polyvector field satisfying an integrability condition with respect to a noncommutative analogue of the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket. We show that a pre-CY structure defines an action of a certain PROP of chains on decorated Riemann surfaces. In the language of the cobordism perspective on TQFTs, this gives a partially defined extended 2-dimensional TQFT, whose 2-dimensional cobordisms are generated only by handles of index one. We present some examples of pre-CY structures appearing naturally in geometric and topological contexts.</description>

      <title>Smooth Calabi-Yau structures and the noncommutative Legendre transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the relation between smooth Calabi-Yau structures and pre-Calabi-Yau structures. We show that, from a smooth Calabi-Yau structure on an $A_\infty$-category $A$, one can produce a pre-Calabi-Yau structure on $A$; as defined in our previous work, this is a shifted noncommutative version of an integrable polyvector field. We explain how this relation is an analogue of the Legendre transform, and how it defines a one-to-one mapping, in a certain homological sense. For concreteness, we apply this formalism to chains on based loop spaces of (possibly non-simply connected) Poincar\'e duality spaces, and fully calculate the case of the circle.</description>

      <title>Operadic approach to Markov processes with boundaries on the square lattice in dimension 2 and larger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov processes are omnipresent in any dimension, especially in statistical mechanics; however their algebraic description is complete only in dimension 1 (which is often interpreted as "time"), for which linear algebra provides many tools complementary to the probabilistic approach: in particular, invariant measures are eigenvectors of the generator. In larger dimension, such algebraic tools are absent due to the more involved structure of boundaries. One of the consequences is the difficulty of the construction of infinite-volume Gibbs measures on the whole lattice for such Markov processes. Such constructions are usually handled in an analytical way, with the DLR approach, guesses of approximate boundary conditions and Riesz theorem. We introduce in the present document new operadic tools to describe in a fully algebraic way Markov processes in any dimension on the square lattice. The main consequence is a natural description of probabilistic boundary weights in terms of matrix product representations, for which we generalize the eigenvector property of 1D invariant measures. This approach leads to new algebraic objects, with a local-to-global perspective, that are suitable for the use of Kolmogorov's extension theorem. Moreover, finite size Markov processes on the square lattice can also be seen as a toy case of statistical Euclidean field theory: our algebraic tools are related to other categorical approaches to field theory, with the advantage of providing concrete computational tools.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simplicial sets generalise many categories of graphs. In this paper, we give a complete characterisation of the Lawvere-Tierney topologies on (semi-)simplicial sets, on bicolored graphs, and on fuzzy sets. We apply our results to establish that 'partially simple' simplicial sets and 'partially simple' graphs form quasitoposes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study properties of boundary conditions (BCs) in theories with categorical (or non-invertible) symmetries. We describe how the transformation properties, or (generalized) charges, of BCs are captured by topological BCs of Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), which is a topological field theory in one higher spacetime dimension. As an application of the SymTFT chracterization, we discuss the symmetry properties of boundary conditions for (1+1)d gapped and gapless phases. We provide a number of concrete examples in spacetime dimensions $d=2,3$. We furthermore expand the lattice description for (1+1)d anyon chains with categorical symmetries to include boundary conditions carrying arbitrary 1-charges under the symmetry.</description>
