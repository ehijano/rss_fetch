      <title>On the Potential of Microtubules for Scalable Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the quantum coherence properties of tubulin heterodimers in the Microtubule (MT) lattice. In the cavity-MT model proposed by the authors, according to which the MT interiors are modeled as high-Q quantum-electrodynamics cavities, decoherence-resistant entangled states have been argued to emerge under physiological conditions, with decoherence times of order $\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$ s. The latter is the result of strong electric-dipole interactions of tubulin dimers with ordered-water dipole quanta in the MT interior. We re-interpret the classical nonlinear (pseudospin) $\sigma$-models, describing the emergent dynamics of solitonic excitations in such systems, as representing quantum coherent (or possibly pointer) states, arising from the incomplete collapse of quantum-coherent dipole states. These solitons mediate dissipation-free energy transfer across the MT networks. We underpin logic-gate-like behavior through MT-associated proteins and detail how these structures may support scalable, ambient-temperature quantum computation, with the fundamental unit of information storage being a quDit associated with the basic unit of the MT honeycomb lattice. We describe in detail the decision-making process, after the action of an external stimulus, during which optimal path selection for energy-loss-free signal and information transport across the MT network emerges. Finally, we propose experimental pathways, including Rabi-splitting spectroscopy and entangled surface plasmon probes, to experimentally validate our predictions for MT-based, scalable quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Optimizing SPION Labeling for Single-Cell Magnetic Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the correlation between iron mass on cell surfaces and the resultant magnetic field. Human colorectal cancer cells (HT29 line) were labeled with varying concentrations of SPIONs and imaged via a NV center widefield magnetic microscope. To assess the labeling efficacy, a convolutional neural network trained on simulated magnetic dipole data was utilized to reconstruct key labeling parameters on a cell-by-cell basis, including cell diameter, sensor proximity, and the iron mass associated with surface-bound SPIONs.
  Our analysis provided quantitative metrics for these parameters across a range of labeling concentrations. The findings indicated that increasing SPION concentration enhances both the cell-surface iron mass and magnetic field strength, demonstrating a saturation effect. This methodology offers a coherent framework for the quantitative, high-throughput characterization of magnetically labeled cells, presenting significant implications for the fields of cell biology and magnetic sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Rosette formations as symmetry-breaking events: theory and experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multicellular rosettes are observed in different situations such as morphogenesis, wound healing, and cancer progression. While some molecular insights have been gained to explain the presence of these assemblies of five or more cells around a common center, what are the tunable, global features that favors/hinders their formation is still largely unknown. Here, we made use of a Voronoi dynamical model to investigate the ingredients driving the emergence of rosettes characterized by different degree of stability and organization. We found that (i) breaking the local spatial symmetry of the system, i.e., introducing curvature-inducing defects, allows for the formation of rosette-like structures (ii) whose probability of formation depends on the characteristic of the cellular layer. In particular, a trade-off between tissue fluidity and single cell deformability dictates the assembly of transient rosettes, that are strongly stabilized in the presence of cell alignment interactions. To test our model predictions, we performed fluorescence microscopy experiments on rosette-forming neural populations derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), finding significant agreement. Overall, our work may set the stage to gain an unifying understanding of the plethora of biophysical mechanisms involving the occurrence of rosette-like structure both in physiology and their altered formation in pathology.</description>

      <title>Decoding Breast Cancer in X-ray Mammograms: A Multi-Parameter Approach Using Fractals, Multifractals, and Structural Disorder Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explored the fractal and multifractal characteristics of breast mammogram micrographs to identify quantitative biomarkers associated with breast cancer progression. In addition to conventional fractal and multifractal analyses, we employed a recently developed fractal-functional distribution method, which transforms fractal measures into Gaussian distributions for more robust statistical interpretation. Given the sparsity of mammogram intensity data, we also analyzed how variations in intensity thresholds, used for binary transformations of the fractal dimension, follow unique trajectories that may serve as novel indicators of disease progression. Our findings demonstrate that fractal, multifractal, and fractal-functional parameters effectively differentiate between benign and cancerous tissue. Furthermore, the threshold-dependent behavior of intensity-based fractal measures presents distinct patterns in cancer cases. To complement these analyses, we applied the Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR) light localization technique to quantify structural disorder at the microscopic level. This multi-parametric approach, integrating spatial complexity and structural disorder metrics, offers a promising framework for enhancing the sensitivity and specificity of breast cancer detection.</description>

      <title>Effect of Vaccine Dose Intervals: Considering Immunity Levels, Vaccine Efficacy, and Strain Variants for Disease Control Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present an immuno-epidemic model to understand mitigation options during an epidemic break. The model incorporates comorbidity and multiple-vaccine doses through a system of coupled integro-differential equations to analyze the epidemic rate and intensity from a knowledge of the basic reproduction number and time-distributed rate functions. Our modeling results show that the interval between vaccine doses is a key control parameter that can be tuned to significantly influence disease spread. We show that multiple doses induce a hysteresis effect in immunity levels that offers a better mitigation alternative compared to frequent vaccination which is less cost-effective while being more intrusive. Optimal dosing intervals, emphasizing the cost-effectiveness of each vaccination effort, and determined by various factors such as the level of immunity and efficacy of vaccines against different strains, appear to be crucial in disease management. The model is sufficiently generic that can be extended to accommodate specific disease forms.</description>

      <title>Theory of cell size regulation during migration in adhered cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell migration is closely linked to cell shape, yet cell size is often assumed to remain constant. This assumption is challenged by recent experiments showing that cells undergo volume loss during spreading and swelling upon activation, with migration velocity correlated to cell size. In this Letter, we present a minimal theoretical framework for cellular size regulation and its influence on migration velocity. We connect cell size to membrane potential and active, actin-driven forces. Spatial inhomogeneities in these forces establish cell polarization and drive migration. Crucially, inhomogeneity is easier to establish over larger sizes, giving rise to a critical contact area, above which migration is possible. Our theory captures the coupled dynamics of cell volume, surface area, and motility and explains recent experiments on neutrophils.</description>

      <title>Generic multicomponent mixtures are multistable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liquid mixtures of many interacting components often exhibit numerous coexisting types of droplets. An exciting example is the cytosol of biological cells, where diverse droplets, called condensates, are essential for cellular function. However, how much their formation is constrained by thermodynamics is currently unclear. Linear stability analysis predicts that homogeneous mixtures become more robust to fluctuations as the number of components increases, suggesting that droplets do not form easily in multicomponent mixtures. In contrast, we show through numerical simulations and analytical scaling laws that the number of coexisting phases typically increases with the number of components in equilibrium. The combination of both results suggests that generic multicomponent mixtures can maintain many metastable states with various droplets, generalizing the nucleation-and-growth regime of binary mixtures. Our theory also indicates why cells exhibit much fewer condensates than components and how they could exploit multistability to independently form various condensates.</description>

      <title>Metabolic coordination and phase transitions in spatially distributed multi-cellular systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During overflow metabolism, cells excrete glycolytic byproducts when growing under aerobic conditions in a seemingly wasteful fashion. While potentially advantageous for microbes with finite oxidative capacity, its role in higher organisms is harder to assess. Recent single-cell experiments suggest overflow metabolism arises due to imbalances in inter-cellular exchange networks. We quantitatively characterize this scenario by integrating spatial metabolic modeling with tools from statistical physics and experimental single-cell flux data. Our results provide a theoretical demonstration of how diffusion-limited exchanges shape the space of accessible multi-cellular metabolic states. Specifically, a phase transition from a balanced network of exchanges to an unbalanced, overflow regime occurs as mean glucose and oxygen uptake rates vary. Heterogeneous single-cell metabolic phenotypes occur near this transition. Time-resolved tumor-stroma co-culture data support the idea that overflow metabolism stems from failure of inter-cellular metabolic coordination. In summary, environmental control is an emergent multi-cellular property, rather than a cell-autonomous effect.</description>

      <title>Residual U-Net for accurate and efficient prediction of hemodynamics in two-dimensional asymmetric stenosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents residual U-Net (U-ResNet), a deep learning surrogate model for predicting steady hemodynamic fields in two-dimensional asymmetric stenotic channels at Reynolds numbers ranging from 200 to 800. By integrating residual connections with multi-scale feature extraction, U-ResNet achieves exceptional accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches. Comprehensive evaluation against U-Net, Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and U-Net enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (UFNO) demonstrates U-ResNet superior performance in capturing sharp hemodynamic gradients and complex flow features. For pressure prediction, U-ResNet achieves a normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) of 1.10%. Similarly, the performance of U-ResNet for wall shear stress (NMAE: 0.56%), velocity (NMAE: 1.06%), and vorticity (NMAE: 0.69%) consistently surpasses alternative architectures. Notably, U-ResNet demonstrates robust generalization to interpolated Reynolds numbers without retraining - a capability rarely achieved in existing models. From a computational perspective, U-ResNet delivers a 180-fold acceleration over CFD, reducing simulation time from approximately 30 minutes to 10 seconds per case. The model with non-dimensional formulation ensures scalability across vessel sizes and anatomical locations, enhancing its applicability to diverse clinical scenarios. These advances position U-ResNet as a promising auxiliary tool to complement CFD simulations for real-time clinical decision support, treatment planning, and medical device optimization. Future work will focus on extending the framework to three-dimensional geometries and integrating it with patient-specific data.</description>
