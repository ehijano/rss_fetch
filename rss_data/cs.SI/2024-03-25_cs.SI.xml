      <title>Nonparametric inference of higher order interaction patterns in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for obtaining parsimonious decompositions of networks into higher order interactions which can take the form of arbitrary motifs.The method is based on a class of analytically solvable generative models, where vertices are connected via explicit copies of motifs, which in combination with non-parametric priors allow us to infer higher order interactions from dyadic graph data without any prior knowledge on the types or frequencies of such interactions. Crucially, we also consider 'degree--corrected' models that correctly reflect the degree distribution of the network and consequently prove to be a better fit for many real world--networks compared to non-degree corrected models. We test the presented approach on simulated data for which we recover the set of underlying higher order interactions to a high degree of accuracy. For empirical networks the method identifies concise sets of atomic subgraphs from within thousands of candidates that cover a large fraction of edges and include higher order interactions of known structural and functional significance. The method not only produces an explicit higher order representation of the network but also a fit of the network to analytically tractable models opening new avenues for the systematic study of higher order network structures.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a new deep learning framework, combining Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN) with a Large Language Model (LLM), for bike demand forecasting. Addressing challenges in transforming discrete datasets and integrating unstructured language data, the framework leverages LLMs to extract insights from Points of Interest (POI) text data. The proposed STGCN-L model demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing models, showcasing its potential in predicting bike demand. Experiments using Philadelphia datasets highlight the effectiveness of the hybrid model, emphasizing the need for further exploration and enhancements, such as incorporating additional features like weather data for improved accuracy.</description>

      <title>#TeamFollowBack: Detection &amp; Analysis of Follow Back Accounts on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Follow back accounts inflate their follower counts by engaging in reciprocal followings. Such accounts manipulate the public and the algorithms by appearing more popular than they really are. Despite their potential harm, no studies have analyzed such accounts at scale. In this study, we present the first large-scale analysis of follow back accounts. We formally define follow back accounts and employ a honeypot approach to collect a dataset of such accounts on X (formerly Twitter). We discover and describe 12 communities of follow back accounts from 12 different countries, some of which exhibit clear political agenda. We analyze the characteristics of follow back accounts and report that they are newer, more engaging, and have more followings and followers. Finally, we propose a classifier for such accounts and report that models employing profile metadata and the ego network demonstrate promising results, although achieving high recall is challenging. Our study enhances understanding of the follow back accounts and discovering such accounts in the wild.</description>

      <title>Model, Analyze, and Comprehend User Interactions and Various Attributes within a Social Media Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we effectively model, analyze, and comprehend user interactions and various attributes within a social media platform based on post-comment relationship? In this study, we propose a novel graph-based approach to model and analyze user interactions within a social media platform based on post-comment relationship. We construct a user interaction graph from social media data and analyze it to gain insights into community dynamics, user behavior, and content preferences. Our investigation reveals that while 56.05% of the active users are strongly connected within the community, only 0.8% of them significantly contribute to its dynamics. Moreover, we observe temporal variations in community activity, with certain periods experiencing heightened engagement. Additionally, our findings highlight a correlation between user activity and popularity showing that more active users are generally more popular. Alongside these, a preference for positive and informative content is also observed where 82.41% users preferred positive and informative content. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and managing online communities, leveraging graph-based techniques to gain valuable insights into user behavior and community dynamics.</description>

      <title>From Clicks to Conversions: Analysis of Traffic Sources in E-Commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past years, e-commerce platforms have expanded substantially, providing customers with convenient shopping experiences. To enhance e-commerce websites, it's essential to grasp user engagement and factors affecting conversion rates. This optimization is achieved by aligning platforms with user expectations, thereby fostering successful online shopping experiences, and contributing to sustained growth in the dynamic digital marketplace. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis focusing on user interactions, conversion metrics, and the entire user journey within an e-commerce platform. Our exploration spans exit rates and sessions across different devices and browsers, conversion rates for various traffic sources, and the user journey from product details to checkout. Findings suggest a need for targeted improvements in mobile optimization and browser compatibility, indicated by higher exit rates on mobile devices and varying rates on different browsers. The conversion rate analysis emphasizes the varying effectiveness of traffic sources, highlighting the potential of advertised mediums, while identifying areas for improvement in referral and affiliate traffic. Examining the user journey showed potential bottlenecks in the conversion process, the identified gap was between user interest and completed transactions. Our study suggests improving the checkout process strategically to streamline user transactions. These insights provide actionable guidance for businesses seeking to refine their platforms and optimize performance in the ever-evolving landscape of e-commerce.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Affective Polarization: From Consensus to Partisan Divides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Politically divided societies are also often divided emotionally: people like and trust those with similar political views (in-group favoritism) while disliking and distrusting those with different views (out-group animosity). This phenomenon, called affective polarization, influences individual decisions, including seemingly apolitical choices such as whether to wear a mask or what car to buy. We present a dynamical model of decision-making in an affectively polarized society, identifying three potential global outcomes separated by a sharp boundary in the parameter space: consensus, partisan polarization, and non-partisan polarization. Analysis reveals that larger out-group animosity compared to in-group favoritism, i.e. more hate than love, is sufficient for polarization, while larger in-group favoritism compared to out-group animosity, i.e., more love than hate, is necessary for consensus. We also show that, counter-intuitively, increasing cross-party connections facilitates polarization, and that by emphasizing partisan differences, mass media creates self-fulfilling prophecies that lead to polarization. Affective polarization also creates tipping points in the opinion landscape where one group suddenly reverses their trends. Our findings aid in understanding and addressing the cascading effects of affective polarization, offering insights for strategies to mitigate polarization.</description>

      <title>CapsF: Capsule Fusion for Extracting psychiatric stressors for suicide from twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Along with factors such as cancer, blood pressure, street accidents and stroke, suicide has been one of Iran main causes of death. One of the main reasons for suicide is psychological stressors. Identifying psychological stressors in an at risk population can help in the early prevention of suicidal and suicidal behaviours. In recent years, the widespread popularity and flow of real time information sharing of social media have allowed for potential early intervention in large scale and even small scale populations. However, some automated approaches to extract psychiatric stressors from Twitter have been presented, but most of this research has been for non Persian languages. This study aims to investigate the techniques of detecting psychological stress related to suicide from Persian tweets using learning based methods. The proposed capsule based approach achieved a binary classification accuracy of 0.83.</description>

      <title>Detection of Opioid Users from Reddit Posts via an Attention-based Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The opioid epidemic, referring to the growing hospitalizations and deaths because of overdose of opioid usage and addiction, has become a severe health problem in the United States. Many strategies have been developed by the federal and local governments and health communities to combat this crisis. Among them, improving our understanding of the epidemic through better health surveillance is one of the top priorities. In addition to direct testing, machine learning approaches may also allow us to detect opioid users by analyzing data from social media because many opioid users may choose not to do the tests but may share their experiences on social media anonymously. In this paper, we take advantage of recent advances in machine learning, collect and analyze user posts from a popular social network Reddit with the goal to identify opioid users. Posts from more than 1,000 users who have posted on three sub-reddits over a period of one month have been collected. In addition to the ones that contain keywords such as opioid, opiate, or heroin, we have also collected posts that contain slang words of opioid such as black or chocolate. We apply an attention-based bidirectional long short memory model to identify opioid users. Experimental results show that the approaches significantly outperform competitive algorithms in terms of F1-score. Furthermore, the model allows us to extract most informative words, such as opiate, opioid, and black, from posts via the attention layer, which provides more insights on how the machine learning algorithm works in distinguishing drug users from non-drug users.</description>

      <title>Attention is all you need for boosting graph convolutional neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) possess strong capabilities for processing graph data in non-grid domains. They can capture the topological logical structure and node features in graphs and integrate them into nodes' final representations. GCNs have been extensively studied in various fields, such as recommendation systems, social networks, and protein molecular structures. With the increasing application of graph neural networks, research has focused on improving their performance while compressing their size. In this work, a plug-in module named Graph Knowledge Enhancement and Distillation Module (GKEDM) is proposed. GKEDM can enhance node representations and improve the performance of GCNs by extracting and aggregating graph information via multi-head attention mechanism. Furthermore, GKEDM can serve as an auxiliary transferor for knowledge distillation. With a specially designed attention distillation method, GKEDM can distill the knowledge of large teacher models into high-performance and compact student models. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that GKEDM can significantly improve the performance of various GCNs with minimal overhead. Furthermore, it can efficiently transfer distilled knowledge from large teacher networks to small student networks via attention distillation.</description>

      <title>Decoding Multilingual Topic Dynamics and Trend Identification through ARIMA Time Series Analysis on Social Networks: A Novel Data Translation Framework Enhanced by LDA/HDP Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, the authors present a novel methodology adept at decoding multilingual topic dynamics and identifying communication trends during crises. We focus on dialogues within Tunisian social networks during the Coronavirus Pandemic and other notable themes like sports and politics. We start by aggregating a varied multilingual corpus of comments relevant to these subjects. This dataset undergoes rigorous refinement during data preprocessing. We then introduce our No-English-to-English Machine Translation approach to handle linguistic differences. Empirical tests of this method showed high accuracy and F1 scores, highlighting its suitability for linguistically coherent tasks. Delving deeper, advanced modeling techniques, specifically LDA and HDP models are employed to extract pertinent topics from the translated content. This leads to applying ARIMA time series analysis to decode evolving topic trends. Applying our method to a multilingual Tunisian dataset, we effectively identified key topics mirroring public sentiment. Such insights prove vital for organizations and governments striving to understand public perspectives during crises. Compared to standard approaches, our model outperforms, as confirmed by metrics like Coherence Score, U-mass, and Topic Coherence. Additionally, an in-depth assessment of the identified topics revealed notable thematic shifts in discussions, with our trends identification indicating impressive accuracy, backed by RMSE-based analysis.</description>

      <title>On the role of network structure in learning to coordinate with bounded rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many socioeconomic phenomena, such as technology adoption, collaborative problem-solving, and content engagement, involve a collection of agents coordinating to take a common action, aligning their decisions to maximize their individual goals. We consider a model for networked interactions where agents learn to coordinate their binary actions under a strict bound on their rationality. We first prove that our model is a potential game and that the optimal action profile is always to achieve perfect alignment at one of the two possible actions, regardless of the network structure. Using a stochastic learning algorithm known as Log Linear Learning, where agents have the same finite rationality parameter, we show that the probability of agents successfully agreeing on the correct decision is monotonically increasing in the number of network links. Therefore, more connectivity improves the accuracy of collective decision-making, as predicted by the phenomenon known as Wisdom of Crowds. Finally, we show that for a fixed number of links, a regular network maximizes the probability of success. We conclude that when using a network of irrational agents, promoting more homogeneous connectivity improves the accuracy of collective decision-making.</description>

      <title>Optimized Model Selection for Estimating Treatment Effects from Costly Simulations of the US Opioid Epidemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent-based simulation with a synthetic population can help us compare different treatment conditions while keeping everything else constant within the same population (i.e., as digital twins). Such population-scale simulations require large computational power (i.e., CPU resources) to get accurate estimates for treatment effects. We can use meta models of the simulation results to circumvent the need to simulate every treatment condition. Selecting the best estimating model at a given sample size (number of simulation runs) is a crucial problem. Depending on the sample size, the ability of the method to estimate accurately can change significantly. In this paper, we discuss different methods to explore what model works best at a specific sample size. In addition to the empirical results, we provide a mathematical analysis of the MSE equation and how its components decide which model to select and why a specific method behaves that way in a range of sample sizes. The analysis showed why the direction estimation method is better than model-based methods in larger sample sizes and how the between-group variation and the within-group variation affect the MSE equation.</description>

      <title>Node Classification via Semantic-Structural Attention-Enhanced Graph Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph data, also known as complex network data, is omnipresent across various domains and applications. Prior graph neural network models primarily focused on extracting task-specific structural features through supervised learning objectives, but they fell short in capturing the inherent semantic and structural features of the entire graph. In this paper, we introduce the semantic-structural attention-enhanced graph convolutional network (SSA-GCN), which not only models the graph structure but also extracts generalized unsupervised features to enhance vertex classification performance. The SSA-GCN's key contributions lie in three aspects: firstly, it derives semantic information through unsupervised feature extraction from a knowledge graph perspective; secondly, it obtains structural information through unsupervised feature extraction from a complex network perspective; and finally, it integrates these features through a cross-attention mechanism. By leveraging these features, we augment the graph convolutional network, thereby enhancing the model's generalization capabilities. Our experiments on the Cora and CiteSeer datasets demonstrate the performance improvements achieved by our proposed method. Furthermore, our approach also exhibits excellent accuracy under privacy settings, making it a robust and effective solution for graph data analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph self-supervised learning is now a go-to method for pre-training graph foundation models, including graph neural networks, graph transformers, and more recent large language model (LLM)-based graph models. There is a wide variety of knowledge patterns embedded in the structure and properties of graphs which may be used for pre-training, but we lack a systematic overview of self-supervised pre-training tasks from the perspective of graph knowledge. In this paper, we comprehensively survey and analyze the pre-training tasks of graph foundation models from a knowledge-based perspective, consisting of microscopic (nodes, links, etc) and macroscopic knowledge (clusters, global structure, etc). It covers a total of 9 knowledge categories and 25 pre-training tasks, as well as various downstream task adaptation strategies. Furthermore, an extensive list of the related papers with detailed metadata is provided at https://github.com/Newiz430/Pretext.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become important tools in Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI), enabling new ways to analyze data, treat patients, and conduct research. This bibliometric review aims to provide a panoramic view of how LLMs have been used in BHI by examining research articles and collaboration networks from 2022 to 2023. It further explores how LLMs can improve Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications in various BHI areas like medical diagnosis, patient engagement, electronic health record management, and personalized medicine. To do this, our bibliometric review identifies key trends, maps out research networks, and highlights major developments in this fast-moving field. Lastly, it discusses the ethical concerns and practical challenges of using LLMs in BHI, such as data privacy and reliable medical recommendations. Looking ahead, we consider how LLMs could further transform biomedical research as well as healthcare delivery and patient outcomes. This comprehensive review serves as a resource for stakeholders in healthcare, including researchers, clinicians, and policymakers, to understand the current state and future potential of LLMs in BHI.</description>

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting is a fundamental problem in intelligent transportation systems and learning long-range traffic representations with key information through spatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) is a basic assumption of current traffic flow prediction models. However, due to structural limitations, existing STGNNs can only utilize short-range traffic flow data; therefore, the models cannot adequately learn the complex trends and periodic features in traffic flow. Besides, it is challenging to extract the key temporal information from the long historical traffic series and obtain a compact representation. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel LSTTN (Long-Short Term Transformer-based Network) framework comprehensively considering the long- and short-term features in historical traffic flow. First, we employ a masked subseries Transformer to infer the content of masked subseries from a small portion of unmasked subseries and their temporal context in a pretraining manner, forcing the model to efficiently learn compressed and contextual subseries temporal representations from long historical series. Then, based on the learned representations, long-term trend is extracted by using stacked 1D dilated convolution layers, and periodic features are extracted by dynamic graph convolution layers. For the difficulties in making time-step level prediction, LSTTN adopts a short-term trend extractor to learn fine-grained short-term temporal features. Finally, LSTTN fuses the long-term trend, periodic features and short-term features to obtain the prediction results. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that in 60-minute-ahead long-term forecasting, the LSTTN model achieves a minimum improvement of 5.63\% and a maximum improvement of 16.78\% over baseline models.

      <title>Linguistically Differentiating Acts and Recalls of Racial Microaggressions on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the linguistic signature of online racial microaggressions (acts) and how it differs from that of personal narratives recalling experiences of such aggressions (recalls) by Black social media users. We manually curate and annotate a corpus of acts and recalls from in-the-wild social media discussions, and verify labels with Black workshop participants. We leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) and qualitative analysis on this data to classify (RQ1), interpret (RQ2), and characterize (RQ3) the language underlying acts and recalls of racial microaggressions in the context of racism in the U.S. Our findings show that neural language models (LMs) can classify acts and recalls with high accuracy (RQ1) with contextual words revealing themes that associate Blacks with objects that reify negative stereotypes (RQ2). Furthermore, overlapping linguistic signatures between acts and recalls serve functionally different purposes (RQ3), providing broader implications to the current challenges in content moderation systems on social media.</description>

      <title>Who is bragging more online? A large scale analysis of bragging in social media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bragging is the act of uttering statements that are likely to be positively viewed by others and it is extensively employed in human communication with the aim to build a positive self-image of oneself. Social media is a natural platform for users to employ bragging in order to gain admiration, respect, attention and followers from their audiences. Yet, little is known about the scale of bragging online and its characteristics. This paper employs computational sociolinguistics methods to conduct the first large scale study of bragging behavior on Twitter (U.S.) by focusing on its overall prevalence, temporal dynamics and impact of demographic factors. Our study shows that the prevalence of bragging decreases over time within the same population of users. In addition, younger, more educated and popular users in the U.S. are more likely to brag. Finally, we conduct an extensive linguistics analysis to unveil specific bragging themes associated with different user traits.</description>

      <title>The latent cognitive structures of social networks</title>

Abstract: When people are asked to recall their social networks, theoretical and empirical work tells us that they rely on shortcuts, or heuristics. Cognitive Social Structures (CSS) are multilayer social networks where each layer corresponds to an individual's perception of the network. With multiple perceptions of the same network, CSSs contain rich information about how these heuristics manifest, motivating the question, Can we identify people who share the same heuristics? In this work, we propose a method for identifying cognitive structure across multiple network perceptions, analogous to how community detection aims to identify social structure in a network. To simultaneously model the joint latent social and cognitive structure, we study CSSs as three-dimensional tensors, employing low-rank nonnegative Tucker decompositions (NNTuck) to approximate the CSS--a procedure closely related to estimating a multilayer stochastic block model (SBM) from such data. We propose the resulting latent cognitive space as an operationalization of the sociological theory of social cognition by identifying individuals who share relational schema. In addition to modeling cognitively independent, dependent, and redundant networks, we propose a specific model instance and related statistical test for testing when there is social-cognitive agreement in a network: when the social and cognitive structures are equivalent. We use our approach to analyze four different CSSs and give insights into the latent cognitive structures of those networks.</description>

Abstract: It is often necessary to introduce the main characteristics of population mobility dynamics to model critical social phenomena such as the economy, violence, transmission of information, or infectious diseases. In this work, we focus on modeling and inferring urban population mobility using the geospatial data of its inhabitants. The objective is to estimate mobility and times inhabitants spend in the areas of interest, such as zip codes and census geographical areas. The proposed method uses the Brownian bridge model for animal movement in ecology. We illustrate its possible applications using mobile phone GPS data in 2020 from the city of Hermosillo, Sonora, in Mexico. We incorporate the estimated residence-mobility matrix into a multi-patch compartmental SEIR model to assess the effect of mobility changes due to governmental interventions</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks can Recover the Hidden Features Solely from the Graph Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10956v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are popular models for graph learning problems. GNNs show strong empirical performance in many practical tasks. However, the theoretical properties have not been completely elucidated. In this paper, we investigate whether GNNs can exploit the graph structure from the perspective of the expressive power of GNNs. In our analysis, we consider graph generation processes that are controlled by hidden (or latent) node features, which contain all information about the graph structure. A typical example of this framework is kNN graphs constructed from the hidden features. In our main results, we show that GNNs can recover the hidden node features from the input graph alone, even when all node features, including the hidden features themselves and any indirect hints, are unavailable. GNNs can further use the recovered node features for downstream tasks. These results show that GNNs can fully exploit the graph structure by themselves, and in effect, GNNs can use both the hidden and explicit node features for downstream tasks. In the experiments, we confirm the validity of our results by showing that GNNs can accurately recover the hidden features using a GNN architecture built based on our theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Spectral clustering in the Gaussian mixture block model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian mixture block models are distributions over graphs that strive to model modern networks: to generate a graph from such a model, we associate each vertex $i$ with a latent feature vector $u_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ sampled from a mixture of Gaussians, and we add edge $(i,j)$ if and only if the feature vectors are sufficiently similar, in that $\langle u_i,u_j \rangle \ge \tau$ for a pre-specified threshold $\tau$. The different components of the Gaussian mixture represent the fact that there may be different types of nodes with different distributions over features -- for example, in a social network each component represents the different attributes of a distinct community. Natural algorithmic tasks associated with these networks are embedding (recovering the latent feature vectors) and clustering (grouping nodes by their mixture component).
  In this paper we initiate the study of clustering and embedding graphs sampled from high-dimensional Gaussian mixture block models, where the dimension of the latent feature vectors $d\to \infty$ as the size of the network $n \to \infty$. This high-dimensional setting is most appropriate in the context of modern networks, in which we think of the latent feature space as being high-dimensional. We analyze the performance of canonical spectral clustering and embedding algorithms for such graphs in the case of 2-component spherical Gaussian mixtures, and begin to sketch out the information-computation landscape for clustering and embedding in these models.</description>

      <title>On the resilience of Collaborative Learning-based Recommender Systems Against Community Detection Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collaborative-learning-based recommender systems emerged following the success of collaborative learning techniques such as Federated Learning (FL) and Gossip Learning (GL). In these systems, users participate in the training of a recommender system while maintaining their history of consumed items on their devices. While these solutions seemed appealing for preserving the privacy of the participants at first glance, recent studies have revealed that collaborative learning can be vulnerable to various privacy attacks. In this paper, we study the resilience of collaborative learning-based recommender systems against a novel privacy attack called Community Detection Attack (CDA). This attack enables an adversary to identify community members based on a chosen set of items (eg., identifying users interested in specific points-of-interest). Through experiments on three real recommendation datasets using two state-of-the-art recommendation models, we evaluate the sensitivity of an FL-based recommender system as well as two flavors of Gossip Learning-based recommender systems to CDA. The results show that across all models and datasets, the FL setting is more vulnerable to CDA compared to Gossip settings. Furthermore, we assess two off-the-shelf mitigation strategies, namely differential privacy (DP) and a \emph{Share less} policy, which consists of sharing a subset of less sensitive model parameters. The findings indicate a more favorable privacy-utility trade-off for the \emph{Share less} strategy, particularly in FedRecs.</description>

      <title>Inductive Knowledge Graph Completion with GNNs and Rules: An Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of inductive knowledge graph completion requires models to learn inference patterns from a training graph, which can then be used to make predictions on a disjoint test graph. Rule-based methods seem like a natural fit for this task, but in practice they significantly underperform state-of-the-art methods based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), such as NBFNet. We hypothesise that the underperformance of rule-based methods is due to two factors: (i) implausible entities are not ranked at all and (ii) only the most informative path is taken into account when determining the confidence in a given link prediction answer. To analyse the impact of these factors, we study a number of variants of a rule-based approach, which are specifically aimed at addressing the aforementioned issues. We find that the resulting models can achieve a performance which is close to that of NBFNet. Crucially, the considered variants only use a small fraction of the evidence that NBFNet relies on, which means that they largely keep the interpretability advantage of rule-based methods. Moreover, we show that a further variant, which does look at the full KG, consistently outperforms NBFNet.</description>

      <title>Four universal growth regimes in degree-dependent first passage percolation on spatial random graphs I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One-dependent first passage percolation is a spreading process on a graph where the transmission time through each edge depends on the direct surroundings of the edge. In particular, the classical iid transmission time $L_{xy}$ is multiplied by $(W_xW_y)^\mu$, a polynomial of the expected degrees $W_x, W_y$ of the endpoints of the edge $xy$, which we call the penalty function. Beyond the Markov case, we also allow any distribution for $L_{xy}$ with regularly varying distribution near $0$. We then run this process on three spatial scale-free random graph models: finite and infinite Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs, and Scale-Free Percolation. In these spatial models, the connection probability between two vertices depends on their spatial distance and on their expected degrees.
  We show that as the penalty-function, i.e., $\mu$ increases, the transmission time between two far away vertices sweeps through four universal phases: explosive (with tight transmission times), polylogarithmic, polynomial but strictly sublinear, and linear in the Euclidean distance. The strictly polynomial growth phase here is a new phenomenon that so far was extremely rare in spatial graph models. The four growth phases are highly robust in the model parameters and are not restricted to phase boundaries. Further, the transition points between the phases depend non-trivially on the main model parameters: the tail of the degree distribution, a long-range parameter governing the presence of long edges, and the behaviour of the distribution $L$ near $0$. In this paper we develop new methods to prove the upper bounds in all sub-explosive phases. Our companion paper complements these results by providing matching lower bounds in the polynomial and linear regimes.</description>

      <title>Form-From: A Design Space of Social Media Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media systems are as varied as they are pervasive. They have been almost universally adopted for a broad range of purposes including work, entertainment, activism, and decision making. As a result, they have also diversified, with many distinct designs differing in content type, organization, delivery mechanism, access control, and many other dimensions. In this work, we aim to characterize and then distill a concise design space of social media systems that can help us understand similarities and differences, recognize potential consequences of design choices, and identify spaces for innovation. Our model, which we call Form-From, characterizes social media based on (1) the form of the content, either threaded or flat, and (2) from where or from whom one might receive content, ranging from spaces to networks to the commons. We derive Form-From inductively from a larger set of 62 dimensions organized into 10 categories. To demonstrate the utility of our model, we trace the history of social media systems as they traverse the Form-From space over time, and we identify common design patterns within cells of the model.</description>

      <title>Designing Sousveillance Tools for Gig Workers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As independently-contracted employees, gig workers disproportionately suffer the consequences of workplace surveillance, which include increased pressures to work, breaches of privacy, and decreased digital autonomy. Despite the negative impacts of workplace surveillance, gig workers lack the tools, strategies, and workplace social support to protect themselves against these harms. Meanwhile, some critical theorists have proposed sousveillance as a potential means of countering such abuses of power, whereby those under surveillance monitor those in positions of authority (e.g., gig workers collect data about requesters/platforms). To understand the benefits of sousveillance systems in the gig economy, we conducted semi-structured interviews and led co-design activities with gig workers. We use "care ethics" as a guiding concept to understand our interview and co-design data, while also focusing on empathic sousveillance technology design recommendations. Through our study, we identify gig workers' attitudes towards and past experiences with sousveillance. We also uncover the type of sousveillance technologies imagined by workers, provide design recommendations, and finish by discussing how to create empowering, empathic spaces on gig platforms.</description>
