      <title>Energy-Weighted Flow Matching: Unlocking Continuous Normalizing Flows for Efficient and Scalable Boltzmann Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling from unnormalized target distributions, e.g. Boltzmann distributions $\mu_{\text{target}}(x) \propto \exp(-E(x)/T)$, is fundamental to many scientific applications yet computationally challenging due to complex, high-dimensional energy landscapes. Existing approaches applying modern generative models to Boltzmann distributions either require large datasets of samples drawn from the target distribution or, when using only energy evaluations for training, cannot efficiently leverage the expressivity of advanced architectures like continuous normalizing flows that have shown promise for molecular sampling. To address these shortcomings, we introduce Energy-Weighted Flow Matching (EWFM), a novel training objective enabling continuous normalizing flows to model Boltzmann distributions using only energy function evaluations. Our objective reformulates conditional flow matching via importance sampling, allowing training with samples from arbitrary proposal distributions. Based on this objective, we develop two algorithms: iterative EWFM (iEWFM), which progressively refines proposals through iterative training, and annealed EWFM (aEWFM), which additionally incorporates temperature annealing for challenging energy landscapes. On benchmark systems, including challenging 55-particle Lennard-Jones clusters, our algorithms demonstrate sample quality competitive with state-of-the-art energy-only methods while requiring up to three orders of magnitude fewer energy evaluations.</description>

      <title>Testing for correlation between network structure and high-dimensional node covariates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many application domains, networks are observed with node-level features. In such settings, a common problem is to assess whether or not nodal covariates are correlated with the network structure itself. Here, we present four novel methods for addressing this problem. Two of these are based on a linear model relating node-level covariates to latent node-level variables that drive network structure. The other two are based on applying canonical correlation analysis to the node features and network structure, avoiding the linear modeling assumptions. We provide theoretical guarantees for all four methods when the observed network is generated according to a low-rank latent space model endowed with node-level covariates, which we allow to be high-dimensional. Our methods are computationally cheaper and require fewer modeling assumptions than previous approaches to network dependency testing. We demonstrate and compare the performance of our novel methods on both simulated and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Generative Models Meet Compressed Sensing, with Applications to Image Data and Financial Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops dimension reduction techniques for accelerating diffusion model inference in the context of synthetic data generation. The idea is to integrate compressed sensing into diffusion models: (i) compress the data into a latent space, (ii) train a diffusion model in the latent space, and (iii) apply a compressed sensing algorithm to the samples generated in the latent space, facilitating the efficiency of both model training and inference. Under suitable sparsity assumptions on data, the proposed algorithm is proved to enjoy faster convergence by combining diffusion model inference with sparse recovery. As a byproduct, we obtain an optimal value for the latent space dimension. We also conduct numerical experiments on a range of datasets, including image data (handwritten digits, medical images, and climate data) and financial time series for stress testing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the inverse problem in a Bayesian framework and aim to train a generative model that allows us to simulate (i.e., sample from the likelihood) and do inference (i.e., sample from the posterior). We review the use of triangular normalizing flows for conditional sampling in this context and show how to combine two such triangular maps (an upper and a lower one) in to one invertible mapping that can be used for simulation and inference. We work out several useful properties of this invertible generative model and propose a possible training loss for training the map directly. We illustrate the workings of this new approach to conditional generative modeling numerically on a few stylized examples.</description>

      <title>Batched Stochastic Matching Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel bandit framework for stochastic matching based on the Multi-nomial Logit (MNL) choice model. In our setting, $N$ agents on one side are assigned to $K$ arms on the other side, where each arm stochastically selects an agent from its assigned pool according to an unknown preference and yields a corresponding reward. The objective is to minimize regret by maximizing the cumulative revenue from successful matches across all agents. This task requires solving a combinatorial optimization problem based on estimated preferences, which is NP-hard and leads a naive approach to incur a computational cost of $O(K^N)$ per round. To address this challenge, we propose batched algorithms that limit the frequency of matching updates, thereby reducing the amortized computational cost (i.e., the average cost per round) to $O(1)$ while still achieving a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$.</description>

      <title>Connections between reinforcement learning with feedback,test-time scaling, and diffusion guidance: An anthology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we reflect on several fundamental connections among widely used post-training techniques. We clarify some intimate connections and equivalences between reinforcement learning with human feedback, reinforcement learning with internal feedback, and test-time scaling (particularly soft best-of-$N$ sampling), while also illuminating intrinsic links between diffusion guidance and test-time scaling. Additionally, we introduce a resampling approach for alignment and reward-directed diffusion models, sidestepping the need for explicit reinforcement learning techniques.</description>

      <title>SharedRep-RLHF: A Shared Representation Approach to RLHF with Diverse Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uniform-reward reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which trains a single reward model to represent the preferences of all annotators, fails to capture the diversity of opinions across sub-populations, inadvertently favoring dominant groups. The state-of-the-art, MaxMin-RLHF, addresses this by learning group-specific reward models, and by optimizing for the group receiving the minimum reward, thereby promoting fairness. However, we identify that a key limitation of MaxMin-RLHF is its poor performance when the minimum-reward group is a minority. To mitigate this drawback, we introduce a novel framework, termed {\em SharedRep-RLHF}. At its core, SharedRep-RLHF learns and leverages {\em shared traits} in annotations among various groups, in contrast to learning separate reward models across groups. We first show that MaxMin-RLHF is provably suboptimal in learning shared traits, and then quantify the sample complexity of SharedRep-RLHF. Experiments across diverse natural language tasks showcase the effectiveness of SharedRep-RLHF compared to MaxMin-RLHF with a gain of up to 20% in win rate.</description>

      <title>The Personality Illusion: Revealing Dissociation Between Self-Reports &amp; Behavior in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human behavior.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior. Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Sparse Autoencoder Neural Operators: Model Recovery in Function Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We frame the problem of unifying representations in neural models as one of sparse model recovery and introduce a framework that extends sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to lifted spaces and infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling mechanistic interpretability of large neural operators (NO). While the Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that neural networks converge to similar representations across architectures, the representational properties of neural operators remain underexplored despite their growing importance in scientific computing. We compare the inference and training dynamics of SAEs, lifted-SAE, and SAE neural operators. We highlight how lifting and operator modules introduce beneficial inductive biases, enabling faster recovery, improved recovery of smooth concepts, and robust inference across varying resolutions, a property unique to neural operators.</description>

      <title>RAGuard: A Novel Approach for in-context Safe Retrieval Augmented Generation for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accuracy and safety are paramount in Offshore Wind (OSW) maintenance, yet conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail when confronted with highly specialised or unexpected scenarios. We introduce RAGuard, an enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that explicitly integrates safety-critical documents alongside technical manuals.By issuing parallel queries to two indices and allocating separate retrieval budgets for knowledge and safety, RAGuard guarantees both technical depth and safety coverage. We further develop a SafetyClamp extension that fetches a larger candidate pool, "hard-clamping" exact slot guarantees to safety. We evaluate across sparse (BM25), dense (Dense Passage Retrieval) and hybrid retrieval paradigms, measuring Technical Recall@K and Safety Recall@K. Both proposed extensions of RAG show an increase in Safety Recall@K from almost 0\% in RAG to more than 50\% in RAGuard, while maintaining Technical Recall above 60\%. These results demonstrate that RAGuard and SafetyClamp have the potential to establish a new standard for integrating safety assurance into LLM-powered decision support in critical maintenance contexts.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based Inference via Langevin Dynamics with Score Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) enables Bayesian analysis when the likelihood is intractable but model simulations are available. Recent advances in statistics and machine learning, including Approximate Bayesian Computation and deep generative models, have expanded the applicability of SBI, yet these methods often face challenges in moderate to high-dimensional parameter spaces. Motivated by the success of gradient-based Monte Carlo methods in Bayesian sampling, we propose a novel SBI method that integrates score matching with Langevin dynamics to explore complex posterior landscapes more efficiently in such settings. Our approach introduces tailored score-matching procedures for SBI, including a localization scheme that reduces simulation costs and an architectural regularization that embeds the statistical structure of log-likelihood scores to improve score-matching accuracy. We provide theoretical analysis of the method and illustrate its practical benefits on benchmark tasks and on more challenging problems in moderate to high dimensions, where it performs favorably compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Prob-GParareal: A Probabilistic Numerical Parallel-in-Time Solver for Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Prob-GParareal, a probabilistic extension of the GParareal algorithm designed to provide uncertainty quantification for the Parallel-in-Time (PinT) solution of (ordinary and partial) differential equations (ODEs, PDEs). The method employs Gaussian processes (GPs) to model the Parareal correction function, as GParareal does, further enabling the propagation of numerical uncertainty across time and yielding probabilistic forecasts of system's evolution. Furthermore, Prob-GParareal accommodates probabilistic initial conditions and maintains compatibility with classical numerical solvers, ensuring its straightforward integration into existing Parareal frameworks. Here, we first conduct a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity and derive error bounds of Prob-GParareal. Then, we numerically demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm on five benchmark ODE systems, including chaotic, stiff, and bifurcation problems. To showcase the flexibility and potential scalability of the proposed algorithm, we also consider Prob-nnGParareal, a variant obtained by replacing the GPs in Parareal with the nearest-neighbors GPs, illustrating its increased performance on an additional PDE example. This work bridges a critical gap in the development of probabilistic counterparts to established PinT methods.</description>

      <title>Towards understanding Accelerated Stein Variational Gradient Flow -- Analysis of Generalized Bilinear Kernels for Gaussian target distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is a kernel-based and non-parametric particle method for sampling from a target distribution, such as in Bayesian inference and other machine learning tasks. Different from other particle methods, SVGD does not require estimating the score, which is the gradient of the log-density. However, in practice, SVGD can be slow compared to score-estimation-based sampling algorithms. To design a fast and efficient high-dimensional sampling algorithm with the advantages of SVGD, we introduce accelerated SVGD (ASVGD), based on an accelerated gradient flow in a metric space of probability densities following Nesterov's method. We then derive a momentum-based discrete-time sampling algorithm, which evolves a set of particles deterministically. To stabilize the particles' position update, we also include a Wasserstein metric regularization. This paper extends the conference version \cite{SL2025}. For the bilinear kernel and Gaussian target distributions, we study the kernel parameter and damping parameters with an optimal convergence rate of the proposed dynamics. This is achieved by analyzing the linearized accelerated gradient flows at the equilibrium. Interestingly, the optimal parameter is a constant, which does not depend on the covariance of the target distribution. For the generalized kernel functions, such as the Gaussian kernel, numerical examples with varied target distributions demonstrate the effectiveness of ASVGD compared to SVGD and other popular sampling methods. Furthermore, we show that in the setting of Bayesian neural networks, ASVGD outperforms SVGD significantly in terms of log-likelihood and total iteration times.</description>

      <title>Sharp Convergence Rates of Empirical Unbalanced Optimal Transport for Spatio-Temporal Point Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We statistically analyze empirical plug-in estimators for unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) formalisms, focusing on the Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance, between general intensity measures based on observations from spatio-temporal point processes. Specifically, we model the observations by two weakly time-stationary point processes with spatial intensity measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ over the expanding window $(0,t]$ as $t$ increases to infinity, and establish sharp convergence rates of the empirical UOT in terms of the intrinsic dimensions of the measures. We assume a sub-quadratic temporal growth condition of the variance of the process, which allows for a wide range of temporal dependencies. As the growth approaches quadratic, the convergence rate becomes slower. This variance assumption is related to the time-reduced factorial covariance measure, and we exemplify its validity for various point processes, including the Poisson cluster, Hawkes, Neyman-Scott, and log-Gaussian Cox processes. Complementary to our upper bounds, we also derive matching lower bounds for various spatio-temporal point processes of interest and establish near minimax rate optimality of the empirical Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance.</description>

      <title>A Primer on Causal and Statistical Dataset Biases for Fair and Robust Image Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning methods often fail when deployed in the real world. Worse still, they fail in high-stakes situations and across socially sensitive lines. These issues have a chilling effect on the adoption of machine learning methods in settings such as medical diagnosis, where they are arguably best-placed to provide benefits if safely deployed. In this primer, we introduce the causal and statistical structures which induce failure in machine learning methods for image analysis. We highlight two previously overlooked problems, which we call the \textit{no fair lunch} problem and the \textit{subgroup separability} problem. We elucidate why today's fair representation learning methods fail to adequately solve them and propose potential paths forward for the field.</description>

      <title>We Have It Covered: A Resampling-based Method for Uplift Model Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uplift models play a critical role in modern marketing applications to help understand the incremental benefits of interventions and identify optimal targeting strategies. A variety of techniques exist for building uplift models, and it is essential to understand the model differences in the context of intended applications. The uplift curve is a widely adopted tool for assessing uplift model performance on the selection universe when observations are available for the entire population. However, when it is uneconomical or infeasible to select the entire population, it becomes difficult or even impossible to estimate the uplift curve without appropriate sampling design. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has addressed uncertainty quantification of uplift curve estimates, which is essential for model comparisons. We propose a two-step sampling procedure and a resampling-based approach to compare uplift models with uncertainty quantification, examine the proposed method via simulations and real data applications, and conclude with a discussion.</description>

      <title>Parking Availability Prediction via Fusing Multi-Source Data with A Self-Supervised Learning Enhanced Spatio-Temporal Inverted Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of private car ownership has worsened the urban parking predicament, underscoring the need for accurate and effective parking availability prediction to support urban planning and management. To address key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes (i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro) contribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that excluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to substantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling spatial dependencies.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Unadjusted Langevin in High Dimensions: Delocalization of Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unadjusted Langevin algorithm is commonly used to sample probability distributions in extremely high-dimensional settings. However, existing analyses of the algorithm for strongly log-concave distributions suggest that, as the dimension $d$ of the problem increases, the number of iterations required to ensure convergence within a desired error in the $W_2$ metric scales in proportion to $d$ or $\sqrt{d}$. In this paper, we argue that, despite this poor scaling of the $W_2$ error for the full set of variables, the behavior for a small number of variables can be significantly better: a number of iterations proportional to $K$, up to logarithmic terms in $d$, often suffices for the algorithm to converge to within a desired $W_2$ error for all $K$-marginals. We refer to this effect as delocalization of bias. We show that the delocalization effect does not hold universally and prove its validity for Gaussian distributions and strongly log-concave distributions with certain sparse interactions. Our analysis relies on a novel $W_{2,\ell^\infty}$ metric to measure convergence. A key technical challenge we address is the lack of a one-step contraction property in this metric. Finally, we use asymptotic arguments to explore potential generalizations of the delocalization effect beyond the Gaussian and sparse interactions setting.</description>

      <title>The Strong, Weak and Benign Goodhart's law. An independence-free and paradigm-agnostic formalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Goodhart's law is a famous adage in policy-making that states that ``When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure''. As machine learning models and the optimisation capacity to train them grow, growing empirical evidence reinforced the belief in the validity of this law without however being formalised. Recently, a few attempts were made to formalise Goodhart's law, either by categorising variants of it, or by looking at how optimising a proxy metric affects the optimisation of an intended goal. In this work, we alleviate the simplifying independence assumption, made in previous works, and the assumption on the learning paradigm made in most of them, to study the effect of the coupling between the proxy metric and the intended goal on Goodhart's law. Our results show that in the case of light tailed goal and light tailed discrepancy, dependence does not change the nature of Goodhart's effect. However, in the light tailed goal and heavy tailed discrepancy case, we exhibit an example where over-optimisation occurs at a rate inversely proportional to the heavy tailedness of the discrepancy between the goal and the metric. %</description>

      <title>Bayesian Additive Regression Trees for functional ANOVA model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) is a powerful statistical model that leverages the strengths of Bayesian inference and regression trees. It has received significant attention for capturing complex non-linear relationships and interactions among predictors. However, the accuracy of BART often comes at the cost of interpretability. To address this limitation, we propose ANOVA Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (ANOVA-BART), a novel extension of BART based on the functional ANOVA decomposition, which is used to decompose the variability of a function into different interactions, each representing the contribution of a different set of covariates or factors. Our proposed ANOVA-BART enhances interpretability, preserves and extends the theoretical guarantees of BART, and achieves superior predictive performance. Specifically, we establish that the posterior concentration rate of ANOVA-BART is nearly minimax optimal, and further provides the same convergence rates for each interaction that are not available for BART. Moreover, comprehensive experiments confirm that ANOVA-BART surpasses BART in both accuracy and uncertainty quantification, while also demonstrating its effectiveness in component selection. These results suggest that ANOVA-BART offers a compelling alternative to BART by balancing predictive accuracy, interpretability, and theoretical consistency.</description>

      <title>Estimation of High-Dimensional Markov-Switching VAR Models with an Approximate EM Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regime shifts in high-dimensional time series arise naturally in many applications, from neuroimaging to finance. This problem has received considerable attention in low-dimensional settings, with both Bayesian and frequentist methods used extensively for parameter estimation. The EM algorithm is a particularly popular strategy for parameter estimation in low-dimensional settings, although the statistical properties of the resulting estimates have not been well understood. Furthermore, its extension to high-dimensional time series has proved challenging. To overcome these challenges, in this paper we propose an approximate EM algorithm for Markov-switching VAR models that leads to efficient computation and also facilitates the investigation of asymptotic properties of the resulting parameter estimates. We establish the consistency of the proposed EM algorithm in high dimensions and investigate its performance via simulation studies. We also demonstrate the algorithm by analyzing a brain electroencephalography (EEG) dataset recorded on a patient experiencing epileptic seizure.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping the Cross-Validation Estimate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-validation is a widely used technique for evaluating the performance of prediction models, ranging from simple binary classification to complex precision medicine strategies. It helps correct for optimism bias in error estimates, which can be significant for models built using complex statistical learning algorithms. However, since the cross-validation estimate is a random value dependent on observed data, it is essential to accurately quantify the uncertainty associated with the estimate. This is especially important when comparing the performance of two models using cross-validation, as one must determine whether differences in estimated error are due to chance. Although various methods have been developed to make inferences on cross-validation estimates, they often have many limitations, such as requiring stringent model assumptions. This paper proposes a fast bootstrap method that quickly estimates the standard error of the cross-validation estimate and produces valid confidence intervals for a population parameter measuring average model performance. Our method overcomes the computational challenges inherent in bootstrapping a cross-validation estimate by estimating the variance component within a random-effects model. It is also as flexible as the cross-validation procedure itself. To showcase the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted comprehensive simulations and real-data analysis across two applications.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel algorithm that leverages Stochastic Gradient Descent strategies in conjunction with Random Features to augment the scalability of Conic Particle Gradient Descent (CPGD) specifically tailored for solving sparse optimization problems on measures. By formulating the CPGD steps within a variational framework, we provide rigorous mathematical proofs demonstrating the following key findings: $\mathrm{(i)}$ The total variation norms of the solution measures along the descent trajectory remain bounded, ensuring stability and preventing undesirable divergence; $\mathrm{(ii)}$ We establish a global convergence guarantee with a convergence rate of ${O}(\log(K)/\sqrt{K})$ over $K$ iterations, showcasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm, $\mathrm{(iii)}$ Additionally, we analyse and establish local control over the first-order condition discrepancy, contributing to a deeper understanding of the algorithm's behaviour and reliability in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Robust training of implicit generative models for multivariate and heavy-tailed distributions with an invariant statistical loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional implicit generative models are capable of learning highly complex data distributions. However, their training involves distinguishing real data from synthetically generated data using adversarial discriminators, which can lead to unstable training dynamics and mode dropping issues. In this work, we build on the \textit{invariant statistical loss} (ISL) method introduced in \cite{de2024training}, and extend it to handle heavy-tailed and multivariate data distributions.
  The data generated by many real-world phenomena can only be properly characterised using heavy-tailed probability distributions, and traditional implicit methods struggle to effectively capture their asymptotic behavior. To address this problem, we introduce a generator trained with ISL, that uses input noise from a generalised Pareto distribution (GPD). We refer to this generative scheme as Pareto-ISL for conciseness. Our experiments demonstrate that Pareto-ISL accurately models the tails of the distributions while still effectively capturing their central characteristics.
  The original ISL function was conceived for 1D data sets. When the actual data is $n$-dimensional, a straightforward extension of the method was obtained by targeting the $n$ marginal distributions of the data. This approach is computationally infeasible and ineffective in high-dimensional spaces. To overcome this, we extend the 1D approach using random projections and define a new loss function suited for multivariate data, keeping problems tractable by adjusting the number of projections. We assess its performance in multidimensional generative modeling and explore its potential as a pretraining technique for generative adversarial networks (GANs) to prevent mode collapse, reporting promising results and highlighting its robustness across various hyperparameter settings.</description>

      <title>MARS: Unleashing the Power of Variance Reduction for Training Large Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10438v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training deep neural networks--and more recently, large models demands efficient and scalable optimizers. Adaptive gradient algorithms like Adam, AdamW, and their variants have been central to this task. Despite the development of numerous variance reduction algorithms in the past decade aimed at accelerating stochastic optimization in both convex and nonconvex settings, variance reduction has not found widespread success in training deep neural networks or large language models. Consequently, it has remained a less favored approach in modern AI. In this paper, to unleash the power of variance reduction for efficient training of large models, we propose a unified optimization framework, MARS (Make vAriance Reduction Shine), which reconciles preconditioned gradient methods with variance reduction via a scaled stochastic recursive momentum technique. Within our framework, we introduce three instances of MARS that leverage preconditioned gradient updates based on AdamW, Lion, and Shampoo, respectively. We also draw a connection between our algorithms and existing optimizers. Experimental results on training GPT-2 models indicate that MARS consistently outperforms AdamW by a large margin. The implementation of MARS is available at https://github.com/AGI-Arena/MARS.</description>

      <title>Dataset Distillation as Pushforward Optimal Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to find a synthetic training set such that training on the synthetic data achieves similar performance to training on real data, with orders of magnitude less computational requirements. Existing methods can be broadly categorized as either bi-level optimization problems that have neural network training heuristics as the lower level problem, or disentangled methods that bypass the bi-level optimization by matching distributions of data. The latter method has the major advantages of speed and scalability in terms of size of both training and distilled datasets. We demonstrate that when equipped with an encoder-decoder structure, the empirically successful disentangled methods can be reformulated as an optimal quantization problem, where a finite set of points is found to approximate the underlying probability measure by minimizing the expected projection distance. In particular, we link existing disentangled dataset distillation methods to the classical optimal quantization and Wasserstein barycenter problems, demonstrating consistency of distilled datasets for diffusion-based generative priors. We propose Dataset Distillation by Optimal Quantization, based on clustering in a latent space. Compared to the previous SOTA method D\textsuperscript{4}M, we achieve better performance and inter-model generalization on the ImageNet-1K dataset with trivial additional computation, and SOTA performance in higher image-per-class settings. Using the distilled noise initializations in a stronger diffusion transformer model, we obtain SOTA distillation performance on ImageNet-1K and its subsets, outperforming diffusion guidance methods.</description>

      <title>Extended Histogram-based Outlier Score (EHBOS)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Histogram-Based Outlier Score (HBOS) is a widely used outlier or anomaly detection method known for its computational efficiency and simplicity. However, its assumption of feature independence limits its ability to detect anomalies in datasets where interactions between features are critical. In this paper, we propose the Extended Histogram-Based Outlier Score (EHBOS), which enhances HBOS by incorporating two-dimensional histograms to capture dependencies between feature pairs. This extension allows EHBOS to identify contextual and dependency-driven anomalies that HBOS fails to detect. We evaluate EHBOS on 17 benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness across diverse anomaly detection scenarios. EHBOS outperforms HBOS on several datasets, particularly those where feature interactions are critical in defining the anomaly structure, achieving notable improvements in ROC AUC. These results highlight that EHBOS can be a valuable extension to HBOS, with the ability to model complex feature dependencies. EHBOS offers a powerful new tool for anomaly detection, particularly in datasets where contextual or relational anomalies play a significant role.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Supervised and Unsupervised Segmentation and Classification of Materials Microstructure Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microstructure of materials is often characterized through image analysis to understand processing-structure-properties linkages. We propose a largely automated framework that integrates unsupervised and supervised learning methods to classify micrographs according to microstructure phase/class and, for multiphase microstructures, segments them into different homogeneous regions. With the advance of manufacturing and imaging techniques, the ultra-high resolution of imaging that reveals the complexity of microstructures and the rapidly increasing quantity of images (i.e., micrographs) enables and necessitates a more powerful and automated framework to extract materials characteristics and knowledge. The framework we propose can be used to gradually build a database of microstructure classes relevant to a particular process or group of materials, which can help in analyzing and discovering/identifying new materials. The framework has three steps: (1) segmentation of multiphase micrographs through a recently developed score-based method so that different microstructure homogeneous regions can be identified in an unsupervised manner; (2) {identification and classification of} homogeneous regions of micrographs through an uncertainty-aware supervised classification network trained using the segmented micrographs from Step $1$ with their identified labels verified via the built-in uncertainty quantification and minimal human inspection; (3) supervised segmentation (more powerful than the segmentation in Step $1$) of multiphase microstructures through a segmentation network trained with micrographs and the results from Steps $1$-$2$ using a form of data augmentation. This framework can iteratively characterize/segment new homogeneous or multiphase materials while expanding the database to enhance performance. The framework is demonstrated on various sets of materials and texture images.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic QoS Metric Forecasting in Delay-Tolerant Networks Using Conditional Diffusion Models on Latent Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Active QoS metric prediction, commonly employed in the maintenance and operation of DTN, could enhance network performance regarding latency, throughput, energy consumption, and dependability. Naturally formulated as a multivariate time series forecasting problem, it attracts substantial research efforts. Traditional mean regression methods for time series forecasting cannot capture the data complexity adequately, resulting in deteriorated performance in operational tasks in DTNs such as routing. This paper formulates the prediction of QoS metrics in DTN as a probabilistic forecasting problem on multivariate time series, where one could quantify the uncertainty of forecasts by characterizing the distribution of these samples. The proposed approach hires diffusion models and incorporates the latent temporal dynamics of non-stationary and multi-mode data into them. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach by showing that it outperforms the popular probabilistic time series forecasting methods.</description>

      <title>Cryo-em images are intrinsically low dimensional</title>

Abstract: Simulation-based inference provides a powerful framework for cryo-electron microscopy, employing neural networks in methods like CryoSBI to infer biomolecular conformations via learned latent representations. This latent space represents a rich opportunity, encoding valuable information about the physical system and the inference process. Harnessing this potential hinges on understanding the underlying geometric structure of these representations. We investigate this structure by applying manifold learning techniques to CryoSBI representations of hemagglutinin (simulated and experimental). We reveal that these high-dimensional data inherently populate low-dimensional, smooth manifolds, with simulated data effectively covering the experimental counterpart. By characterizing the manifold's geometry using Diffusion Maps and identifying its principal axes of variation via coordinate interpretation methods, we establish a direct link between the latent structure and key physical parameters. Discovering this intrinsic low-dimensionality and interpretable geometric organization not only validates the CryoSBI approach but enables us to learn more from the data structure and provides opportunities for improving future inference strategies by exploiting this revealed manifold geometry.</description>

      <title>Imputation-free Learning of Tabular Data with Missing Values using Incremental Feature Partitions in Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14610</link>

Abstract: Tabular data sets with varying missing values are prepared for machine learning using an arbitrary imputation strategy. Synthetic values generated by imputation models often raise concerns about data quality and the reliability of data-driven outcomes. To address these concerns, this article proposes an imputation-free incremental attention learning (IFIAL) method for tabular data. A pair of attention masks is derived and retrofitted to a transformer to directly streamline tabular data without imputing or initializing missing values. The proposed method incrementally learns partitions of overlapping and fixed-size feature sets to enhance the efficiency and performance of the transformer. The average classification performance rank order across 17 diverse tabular data sets highlights the superiority of IFIAL over 11 state-of-the-art learning methods with or without missing value imputations. Further experiments substantiate the robustness of IFIAL against varying missing value types and rates compared to methods involving missing value imputation. Our analysis reveals that a feature partition size of half the original feature space is, both computationally and in terms of accuracy, the best choice for the proposed incremental learning. The proposed method is one of the first solutions to enable deep attention learning of tabular data without requiring missing-value imputation. The source code for this paper is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Improved sampling algorithms and Poincar\'e inequalities for non-log-concave distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution $\mu$ with density $\propto e^{-V}$ for some potential function $V:\mathbb R^d\to \mathbb R$ with query access to $V$ and $\nabla V$. We start with the following standard assumptions:
  (1) The potential function $V$ is $L$-smooth.
  (2) The second moment $\mathbf{E}_{X\sim \mu}[\|X\|^2]\leq M$.
  Recently, He and Zhang (COLT'25) showed that the query complexity of sampling from such distributions is at least $\left(\frac{LM}{d\epsilon}\right)^{\Omega(d)}$ where $\epsilon$ is the desired accuracy in total variation distance, and the Poincar\'e constant can be arbitrarily large.
  Meanwhile, another common assumption in the study of diffusion based samplers (see e.g., the work of Chen, Chewi, Li, Li, Salim and Zhang (ICLR'23)) strengthens the smoothness condition (1) to the following:
  (1*) The potential function of *every* distribution along the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process starting from $\mu$ is $L$-smooth.
  We show that under the assumptions (1*) and (2), the query complexity of sampling from $\mu$ can be $\mathrm{poly}(L,d)\cdot \left(\frac{Ld+M}{\epsilon^2}\right)^{\mathcal{O}(L+1)}$, which is polynomial in $d$ and $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ when $L=\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $M=\mathrm{poly}(d)$. This improves the algorithm with quasi-polynomial query complexity developed by Huang et al. (COLT'24). Our results imply that the seemly moderate strengthening of the smoothness condition (1) to (1*) can lead to an exponential gap in the query complexity of sampling algorithms.
  Moreover, we show that together with the assumption (1*) and the stronger moment assumption that $\|X\|$ is $\lambda$-sub-Gaussian for $X\sim\mu$, the Poincar\'e constant of $\mu$ is at most $\mathcal{O}(\lambda)^{2(L+1)}$. As an application of our technique, we obtain improved estimate of the Poincar\'e constant for mixture of Gaussians with the same covariance.</description>
