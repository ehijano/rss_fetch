      <title>GlycoPy: An Equation-Oriented and Object-Oriented Software for Hierarchical Modeling, Optimization, and Control in Python</title>

Abstract: Most existing model predictive control (MPC) applications in process industries employ lin-ear models, although real-world (bio)chemical processes are typically nonlinear. The use of linear models limits the performance and applicability of MPC for processes that span a wide range of operating conditions. A challenge in employing nonlinear models in MPC for com-plex systems is the lack of tools that facilitate hierarchical model development, as well as lack of efficient implementations of the corresponding nonlinear MPC (NMPC) algorithms. As a step towards making NMPC more practical for hierarchical systems, we introduce Gly-coPy, an equation-oriented, object-oriented software framework for process modeling, opti-mization, and NMPC in Python. GlycoPy enables users to focus on writing equations for modeling while supporting hierarchical modeling. GlycoPy includes algorithms for parame-ter estimation, dynamic optimization, and NMPC, and allows users to customize the simula-tion, optimization, and control algorithms. Three case studies, ranging from a simple differ-ential algebraic equation system to a multiscale bioprocess model, validate the modeling, optimization, and NMPC capabilities of GlycoPy. GlycoPy has the potential to bridge the gap between advanced NMPC algorithms and their practical application in real-world (bio)chemical processes.</description>

      <title>Vectorized Parallel in Time methods for low-order discretizations with application to Porous Media problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High order methods have shown great potential to overcome performance issues of simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs) on modern hardware, still many users stick to low-order, matrix-based simulations, in particular in porous media applications. Heterogeneous coefficients and low regularity of the solution are reasons not to employ high order discretizations. We present a new approach for the simulation of instationary PDEs that allows to partially mitigate the performance problems. By reformulating the original problem we derive a parallel in time time integrator that increases the arithmetic intensity and introduces additional structure into the problem. By this it helps accelerate matrix-based simulations on modern hardware architectures. Based on a system for multiple time steps we will formulate a matrix equation that can be solved using vectorized solvers like Block Krylov methods. The structure of this approach makes it applicable for a wide range of linear and nonlinear problems. In our numerical experiments we present some first results for three different PDEs, a linear convection-diffusion equation, a nonlinear diffusion-reaction equation and a realistic example based on the Richards' equation.</description>
