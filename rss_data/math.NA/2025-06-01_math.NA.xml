      <title>Hybrid CG-Tikhonov as a filtration of the CG Lanczos vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider iterative methods for solving linear ill-posed problems with compact operator and right-hand side only available via noise-polluted measurements. Conjugate gradients (CG) applied to the normal equations with an appropriate stopping rule and CG applied to the system solving for a Tikhonov-regularized solution (CGT) $(A^\ast A + c I_{\mathcal{X}}) x^{(\delta,c)} = A^\ast y^\delta$ are closely related methods as build iterates from the same family of Krylov subspaces.
  In this work, we show that the CGT iterate can be expressed as $x^{(\delta,c)}_m = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \gamma^{(m)}_i(c) z_i^{(m)}v_i$, where $\left\lbrace \gamma_i^{(m)}(c)\right\rbrace_{i=1}^m$ are functions of the Tikhonov parameter and $x_m = \sum_{i=1}^{m} z_i^{(m)}v_i$ is the $m$-th CG iterate. We call these functions Lanczos filters, and they can be shown to have decay properties as $c\rightarrow\infty$ with the speed of decay increasing with $i$. This has the effect of filtering out the contribution of the later terms of the CG iterate.
  We demonstrate with numerical experiments that good parameter choices correspond to appropriate damping of the Lanczos vectors corresponding to larger amplifications of the measurement noise. We conclude by noting that analysis of other hybrid regularization schemes via damping of (Krylov) subspace basis vectors from the iteration itself may be a useful avenue for understanding the behavior of these methods for different choice of parameter.</description>

      <title>A positivity-preserving hybrid DDG method for Poisson--Nernst--Planck systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In earlier work [H. Liu and Z. Wang, J. Comput. Phys., 328(2017)], an arbitrary high-order conservative and energy-dissipative direct discontinuous Galerkin (DDG) scheme was developed. Although this scheme enforced solution positivity using cell averages as reference values, it lacked a theoretical guarantee for the positivity of those cell averages. In this study, we develop a novel arbitrary high-order DDG method with rigorously proven positivity-preserving properties. Specifically, the positivity of the cell averages is ensured through a modified numerical flux in combination with forward Euler time discretization. To achieve point-wise positivity of ion concentrations, we introduce a hybrid algorithm that integrates a positivity-preserving limiter. The proposed method is further extended to higher-dimensional problems with rectangular meshes. Numerical results confirm the scheme's high-order accuracy, guaranteed positivity preservation, and consistent discrete energy dissipation.</description>

      <title>Jacobian-free Multigrid Preconditioner for Discontinuous Galerkin Methods applied to Numerical Weather Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are promising high order discretizations for unsteady compressible flows. Here, we focus on Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). These flows are characterized by a fine resolution in $z$-direction and low Mach numbers, making the system stiff. Thus, implicit time integration is required and for this a fast, highly parallel, low-memory iterative solver for the resulting algebraic systems. As a basic framework, we use inexact Jacobian-Free Newton-GMRES with a preconditioner.
  For low order finite volume discretizations, multigrid methods have been successfully applied to steady and unsteady fluid flows. However, for high order DG methods, such solvers are currently lacking. %The lack of efficient solvers suitable for contemporary computer architectures inhibits wider adoption of DG methods. This motivates our research to construct a Jacobian-free precondtioner for high order DG discretizations. The preconditioner is based on a multigrid method constructed for a low order finite volume discretization defined on a subgrid of the DG mesh. We design a computationally efficient and mass conservative mapping between the grids. As smoothers, explicit Runge-Kutta pseudo time iterations are used, which can be implemented in parallel in a Jacobian-free low-memory manner.
  We consider DG Methods for the Euler equations and for viscous flow equations in 2D, both with gravity, in a well balanced formulation. Numerical experiments in the software framework DUNE-FEM on atmospheric flow problems show the benefit of this approach.</description>

      <title>AFIRE: Accurate and Fast Image Reconstruction Algorithm for Geometric-inconsistency Multispectral CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For nonlinear multispectral computed tomography (CT), accurate and fast image reconstruction is challenging when the scanning geometries under different X-ray energy spectra are inconsistent or mismatched. Motivated by this, we propose an accurate and fast algorithm named AFIRE to address such problem in the case of mildly full scan. We discover that the derivative operator (gradient) of the involved nonlinear mapping at some special points, for example, at zero, can be represented as a composition (block multiplication) of a diagonal operator (matrix) composed of X-ray transforms (projection matrices) and a very small-scale matrix. Based on the insights, the AFIRE is proposed respectively from the continuous, discrete and actual-use perspectives by leveraging the simplified Newton method. Under proper conditions, we establish the convergence theory of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, numerical experiments are also carried out to verify that the proposed algorithm can accurately and effectively reconstruct the basis images in completely geometric-inconsistency dual-energy CT with noiseless and noisy projection data. Particularly, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Finally, the flexibility and extensibility of the proposed algorithm are also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>A localized consensus-based sampling algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel interacting-particle method for sampling from non-Gaussian distributions. As a first step, we propose a new way to derive the consensus-based sampling (CBS) algorithm, starting from ensemble-preconditioned Langevin diffusions. We approximate the target potential by its Moreau envelope, such that the gradient in the Langevin equation can be replaced by a proximal operator. We then approximate the proximal operator by a weighted mean, and finally assume that the initial and target distributions are Gaussian, resulting in the CBS dynamics. If we keep only those approximations that can be justified in the non-Gaussian setting, the result is a new interacting-particle method for sampling, which we call localized consensus-based sampling. We prove that our algorithm is affine-invariant and exact for Gaussian distributions in the mean-field setting. Numerical tests illustrate that localized CBS compares favorably to alternative methods in terms of affine-invariance and performance on non-Gaussian distributions.</description>

      <title>STORK: Improving the Fidelity of Mid-NFE Sampling for Diffusion and Flow Matching Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in high-fidelity image and video generation. Because high-quality generations with DMs typically require a large number of function evaluations (NFEs), resulting in slow sampling, there has been extensive research successfully reducing the NFE to a small range (&lt;10) while maintaining acceptable image quality. However, many practical applications, such as those involving Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and SANA, commonly operate in the mid-NFE regime (20-50 NFE) to achieve superior results, and, despite the practical relevance, research on the effective sampling within this mid-NFE regime remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel, training-free, and structure-independent DM ODE solver called the Stabilized Taylor Orthogonal Runge--Kutta (STORK) method, based on a class of stiff ODE solvers with a Taylor expansion adaptation. Unlike prior work such as DPM-Solver, which is dependent on the semi-linear structure of the DM ODE, STORK is applicable to any DM sampling, including noise-based and flow matching-based models. Within the 20-50 NFE range, STORK achieves improved generation quality, as measured by FID scores, across unconditional pixel-level generation and conditional latent-space generation tasks using models like Stable Diffusion 3.5 and SANA. Code is available at https://github.com/ZT220501/STORK.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear PDEs with modulated dispersion IV: normal form approach and unconditional uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the modulated Korteweg-de~Vries equation (KdV) on the circle with a time non-homogeneous modulation acting on the linear dispersion term. By adapting the normal form approach to the modulated setting, we prove sharp unconditional uniqueness of solutions to the modulated KdV in $L^2(\mathbb T)$ if a modulation is sufficiently irregular. For example, this result implies that if the modulation is given by a sample path of a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $0 &lt; H &lt; \frac 25$, the modulated KdV on the circle is unconditionally well-posed in $L^2(\mathbb T)$. Our normal form approach provides the construction of solutions to the modulated KdV (and the associated nonlinear Young integral) {\it without} assuming any positive regularity in time. As an interesting byproduct of our normal form approach, we extend the construction of the nonlinear Young integral to a much larger class of functions, and obtain an improved Euler approximation scheme as compared to the classical sewing lemma approach. We also establish analogous sharp unconditional uniqueness results for the modulated Benjamin-Ono equation and the modulated derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) with a quadratic nonlinearity. In the appendix, we prove sharp unconditional uniqueness of the cubic modulated NLS on the circle in $H^{\frac 16}(\mathbb T)$.</description>

      <title>Factorization method for near-field inverse scattering problems in elastodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a time-harmonic elastic point source incident on a bounded obstacle which is embedded in an open space filled with a homogeneous and isotropic elastic medium. This paper is concerned with the inverse problem of recovering the location and shape of the obstacle from near-field data generated by infinitely many incident point source waves at a fixed energy. The incident point sources and the receivers for recording scattered signals are both located on a spherical closed surface, on which an outgoing-to-incoming operator is defined for facilitating the factorization of the near-field operator. Numerical examples in 2D are presented to show the validity and accuracy of the inversion algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We show that one can always identify a point on an algebraic variety $X$ uniquely with $\dim X +1$ generic linear measurements taken themselves from a variety under minimal assumptions. As illustrated by several examples the result is sharp, that is, $\dim X$ measurements are in general not enough for unique identifiability.</description>

      <title>Provably convergent stochastic fixed-point algorithm for free-support Wasserstein barycenter of continuous non-parametric measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a provably convergent algorithm for approximating the 2-Wasserstein barycenter of continuous non-parametric probability measures. Our algorithm is inspired by the fixed-point iterative scheme of \'Alvarez-Esteban et al. (2016) whose convergence to the 2-Wasserstein barycenter relies on obtaining exact optimal transport (OT) maps. However, typically in practice, OT maps are only approximately computed and exact computation of OT maps between continuous probability measures is only tractable for certain restrictive parametric families. To circumvent the need to compute exact OT maps between general non-parametric measures, we develop a tailored iterative scheme that utilizes consistent estimators of the OT maps instead of the exact OT maps. This gives rise to a computationally tractable stochastic fixed-point algorithm which is provably convergent to the 2-Wasserstein barycenter. Our algorithm remarkably does not restrict the support of the 2-Wasserstein barycenter to be any fixed finite set and can be implemented in a distributed computing environment, which makes it suitable for large-scale data aggregation problems. In our numerical experiments, we propose a method of generating non-trivial instances of 2-Wasserstein barycenter problems where the ground-truth barycenter measure is known. Our numerical results showcase the capability of our algorithm in developing high-quality approximations of the 2-Wasserstein barycenter, as well as its superiority over state-of-the-art methods based on generative neural networks in terms of accuracy, stability, and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Sparse grid approximation of nonlinear SPDEs: The Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show convergence rates for a sparse grid approximation of the distribution of solutions of the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. Beyond being a frequently studied equation in engineering and physics, the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation poses many interesting challenges that do not appear simultaneously in previous works on uncertainty quantification: The equation is strongly non-linear, time-dependent, and has a non-convex side constraint. Moreover, the parametrization of the stochastic noise features countably many unbounded parameters and low regularity compared to other elliptic and parabolic problems studied in uncertainty quantification. We use a novel technique to establish uniform holomorphic regularity of the parameter-to-solution map based on a Gronwall-type estimate and the implicit function theorem. This method is very general and based on a set of abstract assumptions. Thus, it can be applied beyond the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation as well. We demonstrate numerically the feasibility of approximating with sparse grid and show a clear advantage of a multilevel sparse grid scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the application of finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) methods to a class of canonical Hamiltonian PDE systems involving differential forms. Solutions to these systems satisfy a local multisymplectic conservation law, which generalizes the more familiar symplectic conservation law for Hamiltonian systems of ODEs, and which is connected with physically-important reciprocity phenomena, such as Lorentz reciprocity in electromagnetics. We characterize hybrid FEEC methods whose numerical traces satisfy a version of the multisymplectic conservation law, and we apply this characterization to several specific classes of FEEC methods, including conforming Arnold-Falk-Winther-type methods and various hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods. Interestingly, the HDG-type and other nonconforming methods are shown, in general, to be multisymplectic in a stronger sense than the conforming FEEC methods. This substantially generalizes previous work of McLachlan and Stern [Found. Comput. Math., 20 (2020), pp. 35-69] on the more restricted class of canonical Hamiltonian PDEs in the de Donder-Weyl "grad-div" form.</description>

      <title>A nonstandard numerical scheme for a novel SECIR integro-differential equation-based model allowing nonexponentially distributed stay times</title>

Abstract: Ordinary differential equations (ODE) are a popular tool to model the spread of infectious diseases, yet they implicitly assume an exponential distribution to describe the flow from one infection state to another. However, scientific experience yields more plausible distributions where the likelihood of disease progression changes accordingly with the duration spent in a particular state of the disease. Furthermore, transmission dynamics depend heavily on the infectiousness of individuals. The corresponding nonlinear variation with the time individuals have already spent in an infectious state requires more realistic models. The previously mentioned items are particularly crucial when modeling dynamics at change points such as the implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions. In order to capture these aspects and to enhance the accuracy of simulations, integro-differential equations (IDE) can be used. In this paper, we propose a generalized model based on IDEs with eight infection states. The model allows for variable stay time distributions and generalizes the concept of ODE-based models as well as IDE-based age-of-infection models. In this, we include particular infection states for severe and critical cases to allow for surveillance of the clinical sector, avoiding bottlenecks and overloads in critical epidemic situations. On the other hand, a drawback of IDE-based models is that efficient numerical solvers are not as widely available. We extend a recently introduced nonstandard numerical scheme. This scheme is adapted to our more advanced model and we prove important mathematical and biological properties. Furthermore, we validate our approach numerically by demonstrating the convergence rate. Eventually, we also show that our novel model is intrinsically capable of better assessing disease dynamics upon the introduction of nonpharmaceutical interventions.</description>

      <title>Low-rank variance reduction for uncertain radiative transfer with control variates</title>

Abstract: The radiative transfer equation models various physical processes ranging from plasma simulations to radiation therapy. In practice, these phenomena are often subject to uncertainties. Modeling and propagating these uncertainties requires accurate and efficient solvers for the radiative transfer equations. Due to the equation's high-dimensional phase space, fine-grid solutions of the radiative transfer equation are computationally expensive and memory-intensive. In recent years, dynamical low-rank approximation has become a popular method for solving kinetic equations due to the development of computationally inexpensive, memory-efficient and robust algorithms like the augmented basis update \&amp; Galerkin integrator. In this work, we propose a low-rank Monte Carlo estimator and combine it with a control variate strategy based on multi-fidelity low-rank approximations for variance reduction. We investigate the error analytically and numerically and find that a joint approach to balance rank and grid size is necessary. Numerical experiments further show that the efficiency of estimators can be improved using dynamical low-rank approximation, especially in the context of control variates.</description>

      <title>Sampling Theory for Function Approximation with Numerical Redundancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the interaction between numerical rounding errors and discretization errors involved in linear function approximation schemes. To precisely identify when numerical effects become significant, we introduce the concept of numerical redundancy: a set of functions is numerically redundant if, due to finite-precision arithmetic, it spans a lower-dimensional space numerically than it does analytically. This phenomenon arises in a variety of settings, though it is not always explicitly identified as such. When such a set is used as a basis for numerical approximations, recovering the expansion coefficients of the best approximation is generally impossible. More specifically, we show that approximations produced by practical algorithms-affected by rounding errors-are implicitly subject to $\ell^2$-regularization. The computed solutions, therefore, exhibit reduced accuracy compared to the best approximation. On the other hand, there is also a benefit: regularization reduces the amount of data needed for accurate and stable discrete approximation. The primary aim of this paper is to develop the tools needed to fully understand this effect. Additionally, we present a constructive method for optimally selecting random data points for $L^2$-approximations, explicitly accounting for the influence of rounding errors. We illustrate our results in two typical scenarios that lead to numerical redundancy: (1) approximation on irregular domains and (2) approximation that incorporate specific features of the function to be approximated. In doing so, we obtain new results on random sampling for Fourier extension frames.</description>

      <title>Geometric adaptive smoothed aggregation multigrid for discontinuous Galerkin discretisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a geometric multigrid solver based on adaptive smoothed aggregation suitable for Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretisations. Mesh hierarchies are formed via domain decomposition techniques, and the method is applicable to fully unstructured meshes using arbitrary element shapes. Furthermore, the method can be employed for a wide range of commonly used DG numerical fluxes for first- and second-order PDEs including the Interior Penalty and the Local Discontinuous Galerkin methods. We demonstrate excellent and mesh-independent convergence for a range of problems including the Poisson equation, and convection-diffusion for a range of P\'eclet numbers.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of an H(div)-conforming divergence-free DG method with a second-order explicit Runge-Kutta scheme for incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, H(div)-conforming DG type methods coupled with Runge-Kutta (RK) time stepping have been widely employed for simulating high Reynolds number flows, with the convective terms treated explicitly. Although the analysis techniques of RKDG methods were well developed, the extension to incompressible flows is highly nontrivial due to the exactly divergence-free constraint, where the key lies in analyzing the convective terms. We neglect viscosity effects, and conduct an error analysis for an H(div)-conforming divergence-free DG method combined with a second-order explicit RK scheme, for the incompressible Euler equations. We derive an a priori error estimate of $O(h^{k+1 / 2}+\tau^2)$ under a restrictive CFL condition $\tau \lesssim h^{4 / 3}$ for polynomials of degree $k \geq 1$, where $h$ and $\tau$ are the mesh size and time step size, respectively, assuming that the exact solution is smooth. For the case of linear polynomials, we investigate whether existing analytical techniques can relax the restrictive CFL condition to a standard CFL condition $\tau \lesssim h$. It is demonstrated that the exactly divergence-free constraint prevents the application of these techniques. We conjecture that the error estimates for linear polynomials cannot be derived under a standard CFL condition. Finally, we mention that based on our analytical framework, our analytical results will be readily extended to the Navier-Stokes equations at high mesh Reynolds number, with the viscous and convective terms treated explicitly. Numerical experiments are conducted, supporting our analytical results and the conjecture for linear polynomials.</description>

      <title>Unified theoretical guarantees for stability, consistency, and convergence in neural PDE solvers from non-IID data to physics-informed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a unified theoretical framework addressing the stability, consistency, and convergence of neural networks under realistic training conditions, specifically, in the presence of non-IID data, geometric constraints, and embedded physical laws. For standard supervised learning with dependent data, we derive uniform stability bounds for gradient-based methods using mixing coefficients and dynamic learning rates. In federated learning with heterogeneous data and non-Euclidean parameter spaces, we quantify model inconsistency via curvature-aware aggregation and information-theoretic divergence. For Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), we rigorously prove perturbation stability, residual consistency, Sobolev convergence, energy stability for conservation laws, and convergence under adaptive multi-domain refinements. Each result is grounded in variational analysis, compactness arguments, and universal approximation theorems in Sobolev spaces. Our theoretical guarantees are validated across parabolic, elliptic, and hyperbolic PDEs, confirming that residual minimization aligns with physical solution accuracy. This work offers a mathematically principled basis for designing robust, generalizable, and physically coherent neural architectures across diverse learning environments.</description>

      <title>Rigorous enclosure of Lyapunov exponents of stochastic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a powerful and general method to provide rigorous and accurate upper and lower bounds for Lyapunov exponents of stochastic flows. Our approach is based on computer-assisted tools, the adjoint method and established results on the ergodicity of diffusion processes. We do not require any structural assumptions on the stochastic system and work under mild hypoellipticity conditions and outside of perturbative regimes. Therefore, our method allows for the treatment of systems that were so far out of reach from existing mathematical tools. We demonstrate our method to exhibit the chaotic nature of four different systems. Finally, we show the robustness of our approach by combining it with continuation methods to produce bounds on Lyapunov exponents over large parameter regions.</description>

      <title>Defining Foundation Models for Computational Science: A Call for Clarity and Rigor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread success of foundation models in natural language processing and computer vision has inspired researchers to extend the concept to scientific machine learning and computational science. However, this position paper argues that as the term "foundation model" is an evolving concept, its application in computational science is increasingly used without a universally accepted definition, potentially creating confusion and diluting its precise scientific meaning. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a formal definition of foundation models in computational science, grounded in the core values of generality, reusability, and scalability. We articulate a set of essential and desirable characteristics that such models must exhibit, drawing parallels with traditional foundational methods, like the finite element and finite volume methods. Furthermore, we introduce the Data-Driven Finite Element Method (DD-FEM), a framework that fuses the modular structure of classical FEM with the representational power of data-driven learning. We demonstrate how DD-FEM addresses many of the key challenges in realizing foundation models for computational science, including scalability, adaptability, and physics consistency. By bridging traditional numerical methods with modern AI paradigms, this work provides a rigorous foundation for evaluating and developing novel approaches toward future foundation models in computational science.</description>
