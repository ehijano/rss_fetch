      <title>Leavitt path algebras and their representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viewing Leavitt path algebras of finite digraphs as rings of quotients defined by the ideal topology of the ideal generated by all arrows and sinks allows us to induce their representations from those of the quiver algebras and therefore provides a way to construct representations of Leavitt path algebras of not necessarily finite digraphs together with a computation of the endomorphism rings. This approach emphasizes the decisive role of infinite emitters, i.e., vertices with infinitely many outgoing arrows, in the representation theory of Leavitt path algebras. In particular, extensions of representations of ordinary quivers by taking tensor products are no longer simple extensions when infinite emitters exist, hence they become the targets of further study. Our results connect Leavitt path algebras to other vigorously active working areas in ring theory like localizations, quiver algebras, free associative algebras as well as noncommutative noetherian domains. Moreover, as Cuntz algebras ${\mathcal O}_n$ for operator graph algebras, our treatment emphasizes the central role of classical Leavitt algebras $L_K(1, n)$ in the study of Leavitt path algebras.</description>

      <title>The Nilpotentizers and the Nilpotent Graphs of Lie Superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the nilpotentizer for a Lie superalgebra by analogy with the corresponding notion for a group or a Lie algebra. First, we systematically investigate the structural properties of the nilpotentizer and establish some fundamental algebraic characteristics. Next, we define the nilpotent graph for a Lie superalgebra and study their basic properties. In particular, it is shown that the nilpotent graph is one of the isomorphic invariants of the Lie superalgebras. Furthermore, we introduce the nilpotency measure which provides a quantitative assessment of nilpotency for a Lie superalgebra. Finally, we define the category that systematically links the Lie superalgebras to their nilpotent substructures based on the construction of the nilpotentizer.</description>

      <title>Modified Rota-Baxter operators of non-zero weight on $3$-Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of modified Rota-Baxter operators of non-zero weight on $3$-Lie algebras and provide some examples. Next, we give various constructions of modified Rota-Baxter operators of non-zero weight according to constructions of $3$-Lie algebras. Furthermore, we define a cohomology of modified Rota-Baxter operators of non-zero weight on $3$-Lie algebras with coefficients in a suitable representation. As an application, we study formal deformations of modified Rota-Baxter operators of non-zero weight that are generated by the above-defined cohomology. In the final part of the paper, we construct two \(L_\infty[1]\)-algebra structures whose Maurer-Cartan elements correspond to relative and absolute modified Rota-Baxter \(3\)-Lie algebra structures of nonzero weight, respectively. Lastly, we compare our \(L_\infty[1]\)-algebraic approach with the deformation-controlling \(L_\infty[1]\)-algebra for relative Rota-Baxter \(3\)-Lie operators developed by Hou, Sheng, and Zhou.</description>

      <title>On the Subtractive Ideal Structure of Commutative Semirings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the theory of commutative semirings, the lack of additive inverses creates a structural divergence between ideals and congruences that does not exist in ring theory. The aim of this article is to restore critical ideal-theoretic properties via the subtractive property. We first prove a subtractive analogue of Krull's existence theorem, guaranteeing the existence of $k$-prime ideals disjoint from multiplicative sets. We show that in arithmetic semirings, the distinction between $k$-irreducible and $k$-strongly irreducible ideals vanishes, a coherence that we show is preserved under localisation. We investigate the structural properties and coincidence phenomena among associated subclasses of $k$-ideals in Laskerian semirings, von Neumann regular semirings, unique factorisation semidomains, principal ideal semidomains, and weakly Noetherian semirings. Finally, within the framework of additively idempotent semirings, we tether subtractive ideal-theoretic structures to underlying order-theoretic constraints, thereby obtaining new characterizations of $k$-prime and $k$-semiprime ideals. In that process, we also establish that every absolutely $k$-prime ideal is $k$-prime and every $k$-maximal ideal is absolutely $k$-prime.</description>

      <title>On the Diophantine problem related to power circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Myasnikov, Ushakov and Won introduced power circuits in 2012 to construct a polynomial algorithm for the word problem in the Baumslag group, which has a non-elementary Dehn function. Power circuits are circuits supporting addition and operation $(x,y) = x \cdot 2^y$ for integer numbers. Also they posed a question about decidability of the Diophantine problem over the structure $\langle \mathbb{N}_{&gt;0}; +, x \cdot 2^y, \leq, 1 \rangle$, which is closely related to power circuits. In this paper we prove undecidability of the Diophantine problem over this structure.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic size of finite irreducible semigroups of rational matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study finite semigroups of $n \times n$ matrices with rational entries. Such semigroups provide a rich generalization of transition monoids of unambiguous (and, in particular, deterministic) finite automata. In this paper we determine the maximum size of finite semigroups of rational $n \times n$ matrices, with the goal of shedding more light on the structure of such matrix semigroups.
  While in general such semigroups can be arbitrarily large in terms of $n$, a classical result of Sch\"utzenberger from 1962 implies an upper bound of $2^{O(n^2 \log n)}$ for irreducible semigroups, i.e., the only subspaces of $Q^n$ that are invariant for all matrices in the semigroup are $Q^n$ and the subspace consisting only of the zero vector. Irreducible matrix semigroups can be viewed as the building blocks of general matrix semigroups, and as such play an important role in mathematics and computer science. From the point of view of automata theory, they generalize strongly connected automata.
  Using a very different technique from that of Sch\"utzenberger, we improve the upper bound on the cardinality to $3^{n^2}$. This is the main result of the paper. The bound is in some sense tight, as we show that there exists, for every $n$, a finite irreducible semigroup with $3^{\lfloor n^2/4 \rfloor}$ rational matrices. Our main result also leads to an improvement of a bound, due to Almeida and Steinberg, on the mortality threshold. The mortality threshold is a number $\ell$ such that if the zero matrix is in the semigroup, then the zero matrix can be written as a product of at most $\ell$ matrices from any subset that generates the semigroup.</description>

      <title>Generic Cuspidal Points and Their Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider generic coalescing of eigenvalues of smooth complex valued matrix functions depending on 2 parameters. We call generic cuspidal points the parameter values where eigenvalues coalesce and we discuss the relation between cuspidal points and the closely related exceptional points studied in the literature. By considering loops in parameter space enclosing the cuspidal points, we rigorously prove when there is a phase accumulation for the eigenvectors and further detail how, by looking at the periodicity of the eigenvalues along the loop, and/or by looking at the aforementioned phase accumulation, one may be able to localize generic cuspidal points.</description>

Abstract: A division ring $D$ is Amitsur-Small if for every $n$ and every maximal left ideal $I$ in $D[x_1,\dots,x_n]$, $I \cap D[x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}]$ is maximal in $D[x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}]$. The goal of this note is to prove that cyclic division algebras of odd prime degree over their center are never Amitsur-Small.</description>

      <title>Suggestion of a definition of the twisted affine Yangian of type $D$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We suggest a definition of the 1-parameter twisted affine Yangian $TY_{\hbar}(\widehat{\mathfrak{so}}(n))$ and the 2-parameter twisted affine Yangian $TY_{\hbar,\ve}(\widehat{\mathfrak{so}}(2n))$. These twisted affine Yangians are deformations of subalgebras of the universal central extension of $\mathfrak{sl}(2n)[u^{\pm1},v]$. As for the 1-parameter twisted affine Yangian, we show that $TY_{\hbar}(\widehat{\mathfrak{so}}(n))$ is a coideal of the affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n)$. As for the two parameter twisted affine Yangian, we construct a homomorphism from $TY_{\hbar,\ve}(\widehat{\mathfrak{so}}(8))$ to the universal enveloping algebra of the rectangular $W$-algebra $\mathcal{W}^k(\mathfrak{sp}(16),(2^8))$.</description>

      <title>Classification of real modules in monoidal categorifications of cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a conjectural formula for the highest $\ell$-weight monomial of an arbitrary real module over a simply-laced quantum affine algebra. We verify the conjecture under a multiplicative reachability condition, answering the Hernandez--Leclerc classification problem in monoidal categorifications of cluster algebras under this condition. Moreover, we introduce the notion of cluster modules, generalizing Kirillov--Reshetikhin modules and Hernandez--Leclerc modules as special cases. We prove that cluster modules are reachable real modules, and obtain a system of equations governing $q$-characters of the prime cluster modules, providing a natural generalization of both the classical T-system relations for Kirillov--Reshetikhin modules and the exchange relations for Hernandez--Leclerc modules.</description>
