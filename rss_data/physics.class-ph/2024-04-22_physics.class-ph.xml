      <title>Interphase in the mechanical behaviour prediction models for nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymers are increasingly used in the transport sector due to their many advantages; lightness, corrosion resistance, ease to process... However, most of them have limited mechanical properties. To improve these latter, one of the solutions is the addition of nano-reinforcements, this type of material is called nanocomposite. The particularity of these nanocomposites comes from the influence of the interphase, which is an interaction zone between the nanofillers and the matrix. It is therefore imperative to take it into account in the mechanical prediction models.Several analytical schemes are available to study nanocomposites. Some models use a serial or parallel representation of the phases (rule of mixture, Ji model, ...), while others rely on the mean field homogenization approach (Eshelby, Self-consistent, Mori-Tanaka, Double Inclusion, ...).However, directly observing the interphase and its properties experimentally is complex due to its size. Consequently, it is laborious to check the consistency of its consideration in analytical schemes. To compare these schemes, some limit cases of the interphase are studied. A numerical model is also used as a reference for two nanocomposites with distinct interphases.</description>

      <title>Eclectic Notes on Uncertainty, Information, and Classical Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information is everywhere in nature which is very uncertain and unpredictable. But information, in itself, is a very ambiguous term. In this cursory write-up, we attempt to understand the formal meaning of information by quantifying uncertainty and discuss how it naturally appears in two core topics of classical physics -- classical mechanics and statistical mechanics. In the process, we witness how the concepts of the information theory render a unique viewpoint in physics. Except for the presentation of the material, the author claims no originality; however, the responsibility of every inadvertent error lies entirely with the author.</description>

      <title>Universal formal asymptotics for localized oscillation of a discrete mass-spring-damper system of time-varying properties, embedded into a one-dimensional medium described by the telegraph equation with variable coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a quite general problem concerning a linear free oscillation of a discrete mass-spring-damper system. This discrete sub-system is embedded into a one-dimensional continuum medium described by the linear telegraph equation. In a particular case, the discrete sub-system can move along the continuum one at a sub-critical speed. Provided that the dissipation in both discrete and continuum sub-systems is absent, if parameters of the sub-systems are constants, under certain conditions (the localization conditions), a non-vanishing oscillation localized near the discrete sub-system can be possible. In the paper we assume that the dissipation in the damper and the medium is small, and all discrete-continuum system parameters are slowly varying functions in time and in space (when applicable), such that the localization condition is fulfilled for the instantaneous values of the parameters in a certain neighbourhood of the discrete sub-system position. This general statement can describe a number of mechanical systems of various nature. We derive the expression for the leading-order term of a universal asymptotics, which describes a localized oscillation of the discrete sub-system. In the non-dissipative case, the leading-order term of the expansion for the amplitude is found in the form of an algebraic expression, which involves the instantaneous values of the system parameters. In the dissipative case, the leading-order term for the amplitude, generally, is found in quadratures in the form of a functional, which depends on the history of the system parameters, though in some exceptional cases the result can be obtained as a function of time and the instantaneous limiting values of the system parameters. Finally, we have justified the universal asymptotics by numerical calculations for some particular cases.</description>

      <title>Dynamics: A different outlook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present article deals with general mechanics in an unconventional manner. At first, Newtonian mechanics for a point particle has been described in vectorial picture, considering Cartesian, polar and tangent-normal formulations in a unified manner. An extensive differential geometric notions have been used when motion on curved surfaces has been considered. Both the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian formulations have been discussed with various examples. The relevant part of the calculus of variation has been presented in the appendix. Also, a detailed study about the nature of the Lagrangian has been shown in the appendix and it has been found that the usual Lagrangian can be extended to curved space-time using the notion of differential geometry. The article may be suitable both for undergraduate and postgraduate students.</description>
