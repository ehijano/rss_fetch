      <title>Extremal rotating BTZ black holes cannot be dressed in (anti-)self-dual Maxwell field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell system with a negative cosmological constant $\Lambda$ admits a solution with an (anti-)self-dual Maxwell field obtained by Kamata and Koikawa and later generalized by Cataldo and Salgado. Since this Cataldo-Salgado solution, locally characterized by two parameters, reduces to the extremal rotating Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) solution in the vacuum limit and its curvature invariants are constant, it has been stated in some literature that the solution describes a black hole even in the charged case. In this paper, we reject this usual interpretation by showing that there appears a parallelly propagated curvature singularity corresponding to an infinite affine parameter along spacelike geodesics at the location of the Killing horizon in the extremal rotating BTZ solution when the (anti-)self-dual Maxwell field is added. If the spatial coordinate $\theta$ is periodic, closed timelike curves exist near the singularity. It is also shown that the Cataldo-Salgado solution is of the Cotton type N (in contrast to charged rotating BTZ black holes which are of type I away from the horizon), and the energy-momentum tensor of the Maxwell field is of the Hawking-Ellis type II. The metric solves the Einstein-$\Lambda$ equations also with a massless scalar field or a null dust fluid. We explicitly demonstrate that it belongs to the Kundt shear-free, non-twisting, and non-expanding class of geometries, whereas extremal rotating BTZ black holes have expanding principal null directions. It means that the Cataldo-Salgado metric represents the specific null (that is "radiative") Maxwell field generated by a singular source, rather than an extremal rotating BTZ black hole dressed in an (anti-)self-dual Maxwell field.</description>

      <title>Higher-order gaugino condensates on a twisted $\mathbb T^4$: In the beginning, there was semi-classics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the gaugino condensates, $\left\langle \prod_{i=1}^k \text{tr}(\lambda\lambda)(x_i) \right\rangle $ for $1$ $\leq$ $k$ $\le$ $N-1$, in $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills theory on a small four-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^4$, subject to 't Hooft twisted boundary conditions. Two recent advances are crucial to performing the calculations and interpreting the result: the understanding of generalized anomalies involving $1$-form center symmetry and the construction of multi-fractional instantons on the twisted $\mathbb T^4$. These self-dual classical configurations have topological charge $k/N$ and can be described as a sum over $k$ closely packed lumps in an instanton liquid. Using the path integral formalism, we perform the condensate calculations in the semi-classical limit and find, assuming gcd$(k,N)=1$, $\left\langle \prod_{i=1}^k \text{tr}(\lambda\lambda)(x_i) \right\rangle = {\bf n}^{-1} \; N^2\left(16\pi^2 \Lambda^3\right)^k$, where $\Lambda$ is the strong-coupling scale and ${\bf n}$ is a normalization constant. We determine the normalization constant, using path integral, as ${\bf n} = N^2$, which is $N$ times larger than the normalization used in our earlier publication arXiv:2210.13568. This finding resolves the extra-factor-of-$N$ discrepancy encountered there, aligning our results with those obtained through direct supersymmetric methods on $\mathbb R^4$. The normalization constant ${\bf n}$ can be interpreted within the Euclidean path-integral formulation as the Witten index $I_W$. It is well-established that a Hamiltonian calculation of $I_W$ yields $I_W=N$, suggesting that while ${\bf n}=N^2$ correctly reproduces the condensate result, it presents a puzzle in reconciling the Witten index computation via the path integral formalism, an issue warranting further investigation.</description>

      <title>Notes on peculiarities of Schwinger--DeWitt technique: one-loop double poles, total-derivative terms and determinant anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss peculiarities of the Schwinger--DeWitt technique for quantum effective action, associated with the origin of dimensionally regularized double-pole divergences of the one-loop functional determinant for massive Proca model in a curved spacetime. These divergences have the form of the total-derivative term generated by integration by parts in the functional trace of the heat kernel for the Proca vector field operator. Because of the nonminimal structure of second-order derivatives in this operator, its vector field heat kernel has a nontrivial form, involving the convolution of the scalar d'Alembertian Green's function with its heat kernel. Moreover, its asymptotic expansion is very different from the universal predictions of Gilkey-Seeley heat kernel theory because the Proca operator violates one of the basic assumptions of this theory -- the nondegeneracy of the principal symbol of an elliptic operator. This modification of the asymptotic expansion explains the origin of double-pole total-derivative terms. Another hypostasis of such terms is in the problem of multiplicative determinant anomalies -- lack of factorization of the functional determinant of a product of differential operators into the product of their individual determinants. We demonstrate that this anomaly should have the form of total-derivative terms and check this statement by calculating divergent parts of functional determinants for products of minimal and nonminimal second-order differential operators in curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Physical Meaning Behind Elko's Dual structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we shall analyze the necessity of a proper definition of the dual structure for Elko spinors, and singular spinors in general. We examine in detail why the Dirac dual structure fails and it is not functional for these cases, highlighting all the physical consequences of this misdirection. The approach considered here is different from the one usually taken in current literature. We pinpoint the shortcomings that this dual structure brings to particle interpretation, and propagator structure, as well as the implications in non-locality, and the existence of negative energy levels. This investigation furnishes a background for the successful achievements in the field associated with such proper dual formulation.</description>

      <title>Modular invariance groups and defect McKay-Thompson series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been known since 1992 that the McKay-Thompson series $T_g(q)$ of the Moonshine module form Hauptmoduln for genus zero subgroups of $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$. In 2021, Lin and Shao constructed a series analogous to the McKay-Thompson series (a twined partition function of the Monster CFT), but using a non-invertible topological defect rather than an element of the Monster group $\mathcal{M}$. This "defect McKay-Thompson series" was found to be invariant under a genus zero subgroup of $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$, but was shown not to be the Hauptmodul of the subgroup. Nevertheless, one might wonder if a weaker version of Borcherds' theorem holds for non-invertible defects: perhaps defect McKay-Thompson series enjoy genus zero invariance groups in $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$, whether or not they are Hauptmoduln for those groups. Using the decompositions of the monster stress tensor found in Bae et al. (2021), we construct several new defect McKay-Thompson series, study their modular properties, and determine their invariance groups in $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$. We discover that many of the invariance groups are not genus zero.</description>

      <title>On one-loop corrections to the Bunch-Davies wavefunction of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the loop corrections to cosmological observables is of paramount importance for having control on the quantum consistency of a theory in an expanding universe as well as for phenomenological reasons. In the present work, we begin with a systematic study of such corrections in the context scalar toy models whose perturbative Bunch-Davies wavefunction enjoys an intrinsic definition in terms of cosmological polytopes, focusing on one-loop graphs. Owing to the underlying twisted period integral representation they admit, their combinatorial structure along with their vector space structure, emerging from polynomial ideals algebra and intersection theory, are exploited to set-up and analyse the differential equations that the two- and three-site one-loop corrections have to satisfy upon variation of the external kinematic variables. We find that, while the two-site contribution can be written in terms of multiple-polylogarithms, this is no longer true for the three-site case, for which elliptic structures appear. As a non-trivial check, we consider the scattering amplitude limit, recovering the known result in terms of polylogarithms only.</description>

      <title>On the physical and mathematical foundations of quantum physics via functional integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to preserve the leading role of the action principle in formulating all field theories one needs quantum field theory, with the associated BRST symmetry, and Feynman-DeWitt-Faddeev-Popov ghost fields. Such fields result from the fibre-bundle structure of the space of histories, but the physics-oriented literature used them formally because a rigorous theory of measure and integration was lacking. Motivated by this framework, this paper exploits previous work of Gill and Zachary, where the use of Banach spaces for the Feynman integral was proposed. The Henstock-Kurzweil integral is first introduced, because it makes it possible to integrate functions like the exponential of (i times x squared). The Lebesgue measure on R(infinity) is then built and used to define the measure on every separable Hilbert space. The subsequent step is the construction of a new Hilbert space KS2, which contains square-integrable functions on R**n as a continuous dense embedding, and contains both the test functions and their dual, the Schwartz space of distributions, as continuous embeddings. This space allows us to construct the Feynman path integral in a manner that maintains its intuitive and computational advantages. We also extend this space to KS2[H], where H is any separable Banach space. Last, the existence of a unique universal definition of time, tau(h), that we call historical time, is proved. We use tau(h) as the order parameter for our construction of Feynman's time ordered operator calculus, which in turn is used to extend the path integral in order to include all time dependent groups and semigroups with a kernel.</description>

      <title>Topological zero modes and bounded modes at smooth domain walls: exact solutions and dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology describes global quantities invariant under continuous deformations, such as the number of elementary excitations at a phase boundary, without detailing specifics. Conversely, differential laws are needed to understand the physical properties of these excitations, such as their localization and spatial behavior. For instance, topology mandates the existence of solitonic zero-energy modes at the domain walls between topologically inequivalent phases in topological insulators and superconductors. However, the spatial dependence of these modes is only known in the idealized (and unrealistic) case of a sharp domain wall. Here, we find the analytical solutions of these zero-modes by assuming a smooth and exponentially-confined domain wall. This allows us to characterize the zero-modes using a few length scales: the domain wall width, the exponential decay length, and oscillation wavelength. These quantities define distinct regimes: featureless modes with "no hair" at sharp domain walls, and nonfeatureless modes at smooth domain walls, respectively, with "short hair", i.e., featureless at long distances, and "long hair", i.e., nonfeatureless at all length scales. We thus establish a universal relation between the bulk excitation gap, decay rate, and oscillation momentum of the zero modes, which quantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in terms of experimentally measurable physical quantities. Additionally, we reveal an unexpected duality between topological zero modes and Shockley modes, unifying the understanding of topologically-protected and nontopological boundary modes. These findings shed some new light on the localization properties of edge modes in topological insulators and Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors and on the differences and similarities between topological and nontopological zero modes in these systems.</description>

      <title>Low-energy limit of N-photon amplitudes in a constant field: Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the worldline formalism to derive a series representation of the low-energy limit of the N -photon amplitude in a constant background field for both scalar and spinor QED. The amplitudes are then written in terms of a single proper-time integral. The above-mentioned series representation terminates when considering a constant crossed field. This allows us to obtain even more compact expressions for these particular amplitudes for which the result of the proper-time integral, for fixed parameters, takes the form of a factorial function. In addition, we derive all helicity components of these amplitudes and express them explicitly in terms of Bernoulli numbers and spinor products.</description>

      <title>Background independent higher derivative double field theory action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double field theory (DFT) can be constructed from the color-kinematic double copy of Yang-Mills theory. In a recent work, this construction has been extended to higher-derivative terms, starting from the four-derivative extension of Yang-Mills theory with an expectation to obtain a conformally invariant DFT action up to the third order. Here, I attempt to extend this higher-derivative DFT action for all orders in a manifestly background-independent way starting from the second order terms. The third order terms I obtained do not match the third order terms obtained directly from the double copy map. A clear understanding of this mismatch can give valuable information about the double copy procedure for DFT, its relation to background independence, and the conformal symmetry in double configuration space.</description>

      <title>Solitons in 4d Wess-Zumino-Witten models -- Towards unification of integrable systems --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct soliton solutions of the four-dimensional Wess-Zumino-Witten (4dWZW) model in the context of a unified theory of integrable systems with relation to the 4d/6d Chern-Simons theory. We calculate the action density of the solutions and find that the soliton solutions behave as the KP-type solitons, that is, the one-soliton solution has a localized action/energy density on a 3d hyperplane in 4-dimensions (soliton wall) and the n-soliton solution describes n intersecting soliton walls with phase shifts. We note that the Ward conjecture holds mostly in the split signature (+,+,-,-). Furthermore, the 4dWZW model describes the string field theory action of the open N=2 string theory in the four-dimensional space-time with the split signature and hence our soliton solutions would describe a new-type of physical objects in the N=2 string theory. We discuss instanton solutions in the 4dWZW model as well. Noncommutative extension and quantization of the unified theory of integrable systems are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Weak $G_2$-manifolds and scale separation in M-theory from type IIA backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides evidence for the existence of supersymmetric and scale-separated AdS$_4$ vacua in M-theory of the Freund-Rubin type. The internal space has weak $G_2$-holonomy, which is obtained from the lift of AdS vacua in massless type IIA on a specific SU(3)-structure with O6-planes. Such lifts require a local treatment of the O6-planes, therefore going beyond the usual smeared approximation. The setup is analysed by solving the pure spinor equations and the Bianchi identities perturbatively in a small backreaction parameter, preserving supersymmetry manifestly and therefore extending on previous work. This approach is applicable to lifts of other type IIA vacua on half-flat SU(3)-structures, including those with D6-brane sources. The resulting 7d manifold presented here exhibits singularities originating from the O6-planes loci in type IIA theory. Additionally, scale separation in M-theory arises from a decoupling between the Ricci curvature and the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian of the proposed 7d manifold, thereby challenging certain conjectures in the swampland program.</description>

      <title>Intersection Numbers from Companion Tensor Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted period integrals are ubiquitous in theoretical physics and mathematics, where they inhabit a finite-dimensional vector space governed by an inner product known as the intersection number. In this work, we uncover the associated tensor structures of intersection numbers and integrate them with the fibration method to develop a novel and efficient evaluation scheme. Companion matrices allow us to cast the computation of the intersection numbers in terms of a matrix operator calculus within the ambient tensor space. Our algorithm has been successfully applied to the decomposition of two-loop five-point massless functions, representing a significant advancement for the direct projection of Feynman integrals to master integrals via intersection numbers.</description>

      <title>Correlators of long strings on AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times$T$^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we calculate correlators of long strings on AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times$T$^4$ with pure NS-NS flux. We first construct physical vertex operators that correspond to long strings. Due to the GSO projection, they depend on the parity of the spectral flow parameter $w$. For a given $w$, we construct the physical operators that have the lowest space-time weights in both the NS and R sector. Then, we calculate three point correlators for each possible type of parities of spectral flows. We find that the recursion relations of correlators in the bosonic SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$ WZW model can be understood from the equivalence of these superstring correlators with different picture choices. Furthermore, after carefully mapping the vertex operators to appropriate operators in the dual CFT, we find that once the fermionic contributions together with the picture changing effects are correctly taken into account, some mathematical identities of covering maps lead to the matching of the correlators of the two sides. We check this explicitly at the leading order in the conformal perturbation computation and conjecture that this remains correct to all orders.</description>

      <title>Ambitwistor Yang-Mills Theory Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the Movshev-Mason-Skinner Cauchy-Riemann (CR) ambitwistor approach, we provide a rigorous yet elementary construction of a twisted CR holomorphic Chern-Simons action on CR ambitwistor space for maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on four-dimensional Euclidean space. The key ingredient in our discussion is the homotopy algebraic perspective on perturbative quantum field theory. Using this technology, we show that both theories are semi-classically equivalent, that is, we construct a quasi-isomorphism between the cyclic $L_\infty$-algebras governing both field theories. This confirms a conjecture from the literature. Furthermore, we also show that the Yang-Mills action is obtained by integrating out an infinite tower of auxiliary fields in the Chern-Simons action, that is, the two theories are related by homotopy transfer. Given its simplicity, this Chern-Simons action should form a fruitful starting point for analysing perturbative properties of Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Galilean fluids from non-relativistic gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $1/c$-expansion of general relativity appropriately sourced by matter can be used to derive an action principle for Newtonian gravity. The gravitational part of this action is known as non-relativistic gravity (NRG). It is possible to source NRG differently and in such a way that one can construct solutions that are not described by Newtonian gravity (as they do not admit a notion of absolute time). It is possible to include a negative cosmological constant such that NRG admits a non-relativistic AdS solution. This non-relativistic AdS vacuum has Killing vectors that form the Galilean conformal algebra and a boundary that admits a conformal class of Newton-Cartan geometries. This begs the question of whether there exists an analogue of the fluid/gravity correspondence for NRG. In this paper we derive a non-relativistic AdS brane solution of NRG and confirm that it corresponds to the $1/c^2$-expansion of the AdS black brane geometry. We perform a Galilean boost of the non-relativistic AdS brane and derive the associated boundary energy-momentum tensor. We then show that this is the energy-momentum tensor of a massless Galilean fluid and explain how this is linked to the conformal isometries of the boundary. Along the way, we also present several new results for the theory of non-relativistic gravity itself. In particular we present a rewriting that greatly shortens and simplifies the equations of motion of the NRG action.</description>

      <title>Gravitino Thermal Production, Dark Matter, and Reheating of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a full one-loop calculation of the gravitino thermal production rate, beyond the so-called hard thermal loop approximation, using the corresponding thermal spectral functions in numerical form on both sides of the light cone. This framework requires a full numerical evaluation. We interpret our results within the framework of a general supergravity-based model, remaining agnostic about the specifics of supersymmetry breaking. In this context, assuming that gravitinos constitute the entirety of the dark matter in the Universe imposes strict constraints on the reheating temperature. For example, with a gluino mass at the current LHC limit, a maximum reheating temperature of $T_\mathrm{reh} \simeq 10^9$ GeV is compatible with a gravitino mass of $m_{3/2} \simeq 1$ TeV. Additionally, with a reheating temperature an order of magnitude lower at $T_\mathrm{reh} \simeq 10^8$ GeV, the common gaugino mass $M_{1/2}$ can range from $2$ to $4 $ TeV within the same gravitino mass range. For much higher values of $M_{1/2}$, which are favored by current accelerator and cosmological data in the context of supersymmetric models, such as $M_{1/2} = 10$ TeV, and for $m_{3/2} \simeq 1$ TeV the reheating temperature compatible with the gravitino dark matter scenario is $ 10^7$ GeV. If other dark matter particles are considered, the reheating temperature could be much lower.</description>

      <title>Discrete Leptonic Flavor Symmetries: UV Mediators and Phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the absence of a definitive top-down indication for understanding the peculiar structure of the lepton sector, discrete flavor symmetries offer a profound perspective for examining the intricate patterns of lepton masses and mixings. In this work, drawing upon previous studies on the interplay of flavor symmetries with the potential UV completions from a purely bottom-up perspective, three well-motivated discrete flavor groups, suitable for portraying the leptonic sector as well as the neutrino masses, specifically $A_4$, $A_5$ and $S_4$, are explored within this framework, leading to the comprehensive classification of the NP mediators, along with the tree-level matching relations onto dimension-6 SMEFT operators. Particular emphasis is placed on the discrete leptonic directions, for which a phenomenological analysis is carried out in order to constrain various NP mediators, where significant focus is directed towards the examination of the cLFV operators, which, for the wide range of applicable cases, offer the leading constraint.</description>

      <title>Corner Charge Fluctuations and Many-Body Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many-body systems with U(1) global symmetry, the charge fluctuations in a subregion reveal important insights into entanglement and other global properties. For subregions with sharp corners, bipartite fluctuations have been predicted to exhibit a universal shape dependence on the corner angle in certain quantum phases and transitions, characterized by a "universal angle function" and a "universal coefficient." However, we demonstrate that this simple formula is insufficient for charge insulators, including composite fermi liquids. In these systems, the corner contribution may depend on the corner angle, subregion orientation, and other microscopic details. We provide an infinite series representation of the corner term, introducing orientation-resolved universal angle functions with their non-universal coefficients. In the small-angle limit or under orientation averaging, the remaining terms' coefficients are fully determined by the many-body quantum metric, which, while not universal, adheres to both a universal topological lower bound and an energetic upper bound. We also clarify the conditions for bound saturation in (anisotropic) Landau levels, leveraging the generalized Kohn theorem and holomorphic properties of many-body wavefunctions. We find that a broad class of fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions, including unprojected parton states and composite-fermion Fermi sea wavefunctions, saturates the bounds.</description>

      <title>Effective interactions and on-shell recursion relation for massive spin 3/2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use on-shell methods to compute all three-point interactions of massive spin-3/2 particles involving a graviton and particles of spin $\leq 1$. By employing the massive spinor-helicity formalism we identify the interactions which have a smooth massless limit as expected from the superHiggs mechanism. These interactions are then used to on-shell construct four-point massive spin-3/2 amplitudes using an all-line transverse shift for the external momenta, which correctly reproduces the contact gravitino interactions in the $N=1$ supergravity Lagrangian. The on-shell constructed four-point amplitudes are also used to derive well-known unitarity bounds in supergravity. In particular, by adding scalar and pseudoscalar interactions to construct the four-point massive spin-3/2 amplitudes that scale as $E^2$ in the high-energy limit, we recover the on-shell Polonyi model with a Planck scale unitarity bound. These effective three-point interactions and on-shell recursion relations provide an alternative and simpler way to study the interactions of massive spin-3/2 particles without a Lagrangian or the use of Feynman diagrams.</description>

      <title>Accurate quasinormal modes of the analogue black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quasinormal modes of the spherically-symmetric $(2+1)$-dimensional analogue black hole, modeled by the ``draining bathtub'' fluid flow, and the $(3+1)$-dimensional canonical acoustic black hole. In the both cases the emphasis is on the accuracy. Formally, the radial equation describing perturbations of the $(2+1)$-dimensional black hole is a special case of the general master equation of the 5-dimensional Tangherlini black hole. Similarly, the $(3+1)$-dimensional equation can be obtained from the master equation of the 7-dimensional Tangherlini black hole. For the $(2+1)$-dimensional analogue black hole we used three major techniques: the higher-order WKB method with the Pad\'e summation, the Hill-determinant method and the continued fraction method, the latter two with the convergence acceleration. In the $(3+1)$-dimensional case, we propose the simpler recurrence relations and explicitly demonstrate that both recurrences, i.e., the eight-term and the six-term recurrences yield identical results. Since the application of the continued-fraction method require five (or three) consecutive Gauss eliminations, we decided not to use this technique in the $(3+1)$-dimensional case. Instead, we used the Hill-determinant method in the two incarnations and the higher-order WKB. We accept the results of our calculations if at least two (algorithmically) independent methods give the same answer to some prescribed accuracy. Our results correct and extend the results existing in the literature and we believe that we approached assumed accuracy of 9 decimal places. In most cases, there is perfect agreement between all the methods; however, in a few cases, the performance of the higher-order WKB method is slightly worse.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Stasis from a Single Annihilating Particle Species: Extending Stasis Into the Thermal Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that extended cosmological epochs can exist during which the abundances associated with different energy components remain constant despite cosmological expansion. Indeed, this "stasis" behavior has been found to arise generically in many BSM theories containing large towers of states, and even serves as a cosmological attractor. However, all previous studies of stasis took place within non-thermal environments, or more specifically within environments in which thermal effects played no essential role in realizing or sustaining the stasis. In this paper, we demonstrate that stasis can emerge and serve as an attractor even within thermal environments, with thermal effects playing a critical role in the stasis dynamics. Moreover, within such environments, we find that no towers of states are needed -- a single state experiencing two-body annihilations will suffice. This work thus extends the stasis phenomenon into the thermal domain and demonstrates that thermal effects can also generally give rise to an extended stasis epoch, even when only a single matter species is involved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of high-energy events can take place in the seconds leading up to a binary neutron-star merger. Mechanisms involving tidal resonances, electrodynamic interactions, or shocks in mass-loaded wakes have been proposed as instigators of these precursors. With a view of gravitational-wave and multimessenger astrophysics more broadly, premerger observations and theory are reviewed emphasising how gamma-ray precursors and dynamical tides can constrain the neutron-star equation of state, thermodynamic microphysics, and evolutionary pathways. Connections to post-merger phenomena, notably gamma-ray bursts, are discussed together with how magnetic fields, spin and misalignment, crustal elasticity, and stratification gradients impact observables.</description>

      <title>First-order deformations of freely generated vertex algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the problem of how to classify the first-order vertex-algebraic deformations for any grading-restricted vertex algebra $V$ that is freely generated by homogeneous elements of positive weights. We approach by computing the second cohomology $H^2_{1/2}(V, V)$ constructed by Yi-Zhi Huang. We start with the cocycle on two generators and show that its cohomology class is completely determined by its singular part. To extend the cocycle to any pair of elements in $V$, we take a generating function approach, formulate the cocycle equation, and show that all the complementary solutions are coboundaries. Then we use a very general procedure to construct a particular solution. The procedure applies to vertex algebras that are not freely generated. As a by-product, we show that $H^2_{1/2}(V, V) = H^2_\infty(V, V)$. Using these results, we explicitly determine the first-order deformations of the universal Virasoro VOA $Vir_c$, universal affine VOA $V^l(\mathfrak{g})$, Heisenberg VOA $V^l(\mathfrak{h})$, and the universal Zamolodchikov VOA $W_3^c$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings, theoretical one-dimensional topological defects from the early universe, provide a valuable opportunity for exploring dark matter (DM) production and gravitational wave (GW) emission. Our study investigates the production of gauge bosons and GW emission from cosmic string decay, considering the constraints imposed by cosmological observations. We specifically examine how gauge bosons radiated from strings contribute to DM and dark radiation, with limits set by the observed DM abundance and cosmic microwave background data, respectively. Additionally, we analyze the gravitational wave spectrum of this model across both low and high frequencies. Notably, the spectrum typically follows a $f^{-1/3}$ pattern at high frequencies, beyond the pivot frequency $f_*$. We derive an analytical expression for the frequency $f_*$ and confirm its accuracy through numerical verification. Furthermore, we compare the GW spectrum of this model with the forecasted capabilities of future GW observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, the Big Bang Observer, and $\mu$Ares. Finally, we discuss how these considerations impact the model parameters, specifically the gauge boson mass and the energy scale of U(1) symmetry breaking, providing insights into how cosmic strings could enhance our understanding of DM and GW astronomy.</description>

Abstract: We propose a gauge singlet scalar with mass around $1-10$ TeV as a thermal heavy dark matter candidate along with a dilaton as a Higgs portal mediator in a dimensionless scalar extension of the Standard Model. We demonstrate analytically that such a model gives rise to very strong first-order electroweak phase tyransition through supercooling. We calculate the corresponding gravitational wave signals due to bubble collisions during the phase transition. The produced gravitational waves can detected by future space-based gravitational wave detectors in the frequency range from $10^{-4}$ Hz to $0.1$ Hz.</description>

      <title>Normal bound states out of massive complex ghosts degrees of freedom in superrenormalizable quantum gravity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the remarkable differences between renormalizable quantum gravity with four-derivative action and its superrenormalizable polynomial generalizations is that the latter admit a more sophisticated particle mass spectrum. Already in the simplest superrenormalizable case, the theory has a six-derivative Lagrangian, admitting either a real or complex spectrum of masses. In the case of a real spectrum, there are the graviton, massive unphysical ghosts, and normal particles with masses exceeding the ones of the ghosts. It is also possible to have pairs of complex conjugate massive ghost-like particles. We show that in both cases, these theories do not admit a K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation and do not satisfy the positivity criterium of consistency. In the main part of the work, using a relatively simple Euclidean scalar toy model, we show that the theory with complex spectrum forms bound states confining unphysical massive excitations into a normal composite particle. Finally, we discuss the cosmological implications of such a ghost confinement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum decoherence is the effect that bridges quantum physics to well-understood classical physics. As such, it plays a crucial role in understanding the mysterious nature of quantum physics represented by Schr\"odinger's cat, for example. Quantum decoherence is also a source of quantum noise that has to be well under control in quantum computing and in various experiments based on quantum technologies. Here we point out that quantum decoherence can be captured by $\textit{complex}$ saddle points in the Feynman path integral in much the same way as quantum tunneling can be captured by instantons. In particular, we present some first-principle calculations in the Caldeira-Leggett model, which reproduce the predicted scaling behavior of quantum decoherence with respect to the parameters of the environment such as the temperature and the coupling to the system of interest. We also discuss how to extend our work to general models by Monte Carlo calculations using a recently developed method to overcome the sign problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study algebraic varieties that encode the kinematic data for $n$ massless particles in $d$-dimensional spacetime subject to momentum conservation. Their coordinates are spinor brackets, which we derive from the Clifford algebra associated to the Lorentz group. This was proposed for $d=5$ in the recent physics literature. Our kinematic varieties are given by polynomial constraints on tensors with both symmetric and skew symmetric slices.</description>

Abstract: We present a formula for trigonometric orthosymplectic $R$-matrices associated with any parity sequence. We further apply the Yang-Baxterization technique of [M.Ge, Y.Wu, K.Xue, "Explicit trigonometric Yang-Baxterization", Internat. J. Modern Phys. A 6 (1991), no.21, 3735-3779] to derive affine orthosymplectic $R$-matrices, generalizing [M.Mehta, K.Dancer, M.Gould, J.Links, "Generalized Perk-Schultz models: solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation associated with quantized orthosymplectic superalgebras", J. Phys. A 39 (2006), no.1, 17-26] that treated the case of the standard parity sequence.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the minimum sound speed above neutron star densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the existence of massive neutron stars and asymptotic freedom of QCD place robust upper bounds on the lowest sound speed of the ultra-dense matter unattainable in neutron stars. Our approach does not rely on explicitly representing the equation of state in the density range $\sim 2-40 n_0$, and does not require probabilistic interpretations. The upper limit decreases rapidly when the maximum mass of neutron stars is greater than about $2.5M_\odot$. Discovery of $\sim 3 M_\odot$ neutron stars would strongly support first-order phase transitions at high baryon densities</description>

      <title>Entanglement of Disjoint Intervals in Dual-Unitary Circuits: Exact Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth of the entanglement between a disjoint subsystem and its complement after a quantum quench is regarded as a dynamical chaos indicator. Namely, it is expected to show qualitatively different behaviours depending on whether the underlying microscopic dynamics is chaotic or integrable. So far, however, this could only be verified in the context of conformal field theories. Here we present an exact confirmation of this expectation in a class of interacting microscopic Floquet systems on the lattice, i.e., dual-unitary circuits. These systems can either have zero or a super extensive number of conserved charges: the latter case is achieved via fine-tuning. We show that, for almost all dual unitary circuits the asymptotic entanglement dynamics agrees with what is expected for chaotic systems. On the other hand, if we require the systems to have conserved charges, we find that the entanglement displays the qualitatively different behaviour expected for integrable systems. Interestingly, despite having many conserved charges, charge-conserving dual-unitary circuits are in general not Yang-Baxter integrable.</description>

      <title>$G_2$-Manifolds from 4d N=1 Theories, Part I: Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose new $G_2$-holonomy manifolds, which geometrize the Gaiotto-Kim 4d N=1 duality domain walls of 5d N=1 theories. These domain walls interpolate between different extended Coulomb branch phases of a given 5d superconformal field theory. Our starting point is the geometric realization of such a 5d superconformal field theory and its extended Coulomb branch in terms of M-theory on a non-compact singular Calabi-Yau three-fold and its K\"ahler cone. We construct the 7-manifold that realizes the domain wall in M-theory by fibering the Calabi-Yau three-fold over a real line, whilst varying its K\"ahler parameters as prescribed by the domain wall construction. In particular this requires the Calabi-Yau fiber to pass through a canonical singularity at the locus of the domain wall. Due to the 4d N=1 supersymmetry that is preserved on the domain wall, we expect the resulting 7-manifold to have holonomy $G_2$. Indeed, for simple domain wall theories, this construction results in 7-manifolds, which are known to admit torsion-free $G_2$-holonomy metrics. We develop several generalizations to new 7-manifolds, which realize domain walls in 5d SQCD theories and walls between 5d theories which are UV-dual.</description>

      <title>Constraining Spacetime Dimensions in Quantum Gravity by Scale Invariance and Electric-Magnetic Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15161v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a low energy effective theory of $p$-branes in a $D$-dimensional spacetime, and impose two conditions: 1) the theory is scale invariant, and 2) the electric-magnetic dual $(D-p-4)$-branes exist and they obey the same type of interactions to the $p$-branes. (We also assume other natural conditions such as Lorentz invariance but not string theory, supersymmetry, supergravity and so on.) We then ask what $p$ and $D$ are consistent with these conditions. Using simple dimensional analysis, we find that only two solutions are possible: $(p,D)=(2,11)$ and $(p,D)=(2n-1,4n+2)$, ($n=1,2,3,\cdots$). The first solution corresponds to M-theory, and the second solutions at $n=1$ and $n=2$ correspond to self-dual strings in little string theory and D3-branes in type IIB superstring theory, respectively, while the second solutions for $n \ge 3$ are unknown but would be higher spin theories. Thus, quantum gravity (massless spin two theory) satisfying our two conditions would only be superstring theories, and the conditions would be strong enough to characterize superstring theories in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Numerical Conformal bootstrap with Analytic Functionals and Outer Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the numerical conformal bootstrap in general spacetime dimensions through the lens of a distinct category of analytic functionals, previously employed in two-dimensional studies. We extend the application of these functionals to a more comprehensive backdrop, demonstrating their adaptability and efficacy in general spacetime dimensions above two. The bootstrap is implemented using the outer approximation methodology, with computations conducted in double precision. The crux of our study lies in comparing the performance of this category of analytic functionals with conventional derivatives at crossing symmetric points. It is worth highlighting that in our study, we identified some novel kinks in the scalar channel during the maximization of the gap in two-dimensional conformal field theory. Our numerical analysis indicates that these analytic functionals offer a superior performance, thereby revealing a potential alternative paradigm in the application of conformal bootstrap.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics in $\kappa$-deformed spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We treat two identical and mutually independent two-level atoms that are coupled to a quantum field as an open quantum system. The master equation that governs their evolution is derived by tracing over the degree of freedom of the field. With this, we compare the entanglement dynamics of the two atoms moving with different trajectories in $\kappa$-deformed and Minkowski spacetimes. Notably, when the environment-induced interatomic interaction does not exist, the entanglement dynamics of two static atoms in $\kappa$-deformed spacetime are reduced to that in Minkowski spacetime in the case that the spacetime deformation parameter $\kappa$ is sufficiently large as theoretically predicted. However, if the atoms undergo relativistic motion, regardless of whether inertial or non-inertial, their entanglement dynamics in $\kappa$-deformed spacetime behave differently from that in Minkowski spacetime even when $\kappa$ is large. We investigate various types of entanglement behavior, such as decay and generation, and discuss how different relativistic motions, such as uniform motion in a straight line and circular motion, amplify the differences in the entanglement dynamics between the $\kappa$-deformed and Minkowski spacetime cases. In addition, when the environment-induced interatomic interaction is considered, we find that it may also enhance the differences in the entanglement dynamics between these two spacetimes. Thus, in principle, one can tell whether she/he is in $\kappa$-deformed or Minkowski spacetime by checking the entanglement behavior between two atoms in certain circumstances.</description>

      <title>The worldvolume fermion as baryon in holographic QCD with instanton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the worldvolume fermion on the flavor brane in the D0-D4/D8 model which is holographically equivalent to the four-dimensional QCD with instantons, or equivalently with a theta angle. The action for the worldvolume fermion is obtained by the T-duality rules in string theory and we accordingly derive its effectively five-dimensional, canonical four-dimensional forms by using the systematical dimensional reduction and decomposition of spinor. Afterwards, we employ the AdS/CFT dictionary in order to evaluate the two-point correlation function as the spectral function for the worldvolume fermion and interpret the fermion as baryon by analyzing its quantum number with the baryon vertex in holography. In this sense, the interacted action involving the worldvolume fermion and gauge field on the flavor brane are finally derived in holography which describes the various interaction of meson and baryon with instantons in large-N limit. Therefore, this work provides a holographic picture to describe baryon and its interactions based on string theory, in particular, in the presence of instantons or a theta angle.</description>

      <title>Massless limit and conformal soft limit for celestial massive amplitudes</title>

Abstract: In celestial holography, the massive and massless scalars in 4d space-time are represented by the Fourier transform of the bulk-to-boundary propagators and the Mellin transform of plane waves respectively. Recently, the 3pt celestial amplitude of one massive scalar and two massless scalars was discussed in arXiv:2312.08597. In this paper, we compute the 3pt celestial amplitude of two massive scalars and one massless scalar. Then we take the massless limit $m\to 0$ for one of the massive scalars, during which process the gamma function $\Gamma(1-\Delta)$ appears. By requiring the resulting amplitude to be well-defined, that is it goes to the 3pt amplitude of arXiv:2312.08597, the scaling dimension of this massive scalar has to be conformally soft $\Delta \to 1$. The pole $1/(1-\Delta)$ coming from $\Gamma(1-\Delta)$ is crucial for this massless limit. Without it the resulting amplitude would be zero. This can be compared with the conformal soft limit in celestial gluon amplitudes, where a singularity $1/(\Delta -1)$ arises and the leading contribution comes from the soft energy $\omega\to 0$. The phase factors in the massless limit of massive conformal primary wave functions, dicussed in arXiv:1705.01027, plays an import and consistent role in the celestial massive amplitudes. Furthermore, the subleading orders $m^{2n}$ can also contribute poles when the scaling dimension is analytically continued to $\Delta=1-n$ or $\Delta = 2$, and we find that this consistent massless limit only exists for dimensions belonging to the generalized conformal primary operators $\Delta \in 2-\mathbb{Z}_{\geqslant 0}$ of massless bosons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the scaling dimension $\Delta_n$ for the class of composite operators $\phi^n$ in the $\lambda \phi^4$ theory taking the double scaling limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ and $\lambda \rightarrow 0$ with fixed $\lambda n$ via a semiclassical approach. Our results resum the leading power of $n$ at any loop order. In the small $\lambda n$ regime we reproduce the known diagrammatic results and predict the infinite series of higher-order terms. For intermediate values of $\lambda n$ we find that $\Delta_n/n$ increases monotonically approaching a $(\lambda n)^{1/3}$ behavior in the $\lambda n \to \infty$ limit. We further generalize our results to the $\displaystyle{\left(\vec{\phi} \cdot \vec{\phi}\right)^{n/2}}$ operators in the $O(N)$ model.</description>

Abstract: We explore a novel interpretation of Symmetry Topological Field Theories (SymTFTs) as theories of gravity, proposing a holographic duality where the bulk SymTFT (with the gauging of a suitable Lagrangian algebra) is dual to the universal effective field theory (EFT) that describes spontaneous symmetry breaking on the boundary. We test this conjecture in various dimensions and with many examples involving different continuous symmetry structures, including non-Abelian and non-invertible symmetries, as well as higher groups. For instance, we find that many Abelian SymTFTs are dual to free theories of Goldstone bosons or generalized Maxwell fields, while non-Abelian SymTFTs relate to non-linear sigma models with target spaces defined by the symmetry groups. We also extend our analysis to include the non-invertible $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ axial symmetry, finding it to be dual to axion-Maxwell theory, and a non-Abelian 2-group structure in four dimensions, deriving a new parity-violating interaction that has implications for the low-energy dynamics of U(N) QCD.</description>

Abstract: We employ holography to calculate the quantum complexity of $T\bar{T}$-deformation, utilizing the complexity equals volume (CV) and the complexity equals action (CA) proposals within the bulk spacetime with a finite radius cutoff. We find that the complexity of the deformed theory differs from the renormalized complexity of the original theory by a geometric functional: the bending (Willmore) energy of the time-constant slice of the base manifold. We use this result to propose an unambiguous scheme for calculating holographic quantum complexity through the CA proposal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, our aim is to illustrate that the process of open string scattering corresponds to the evolution of the entanglement wedge, where the width of the scattering cross-section is identified as the entanglement wedge cross-section. Moreover, open-closed string scattering, specifically the disk-disk interaction, works for the evolution of the reflected entanglement wedge, with the circumference of the scattering cross-section equating to the reflected entropy. It therefore provides evidence for the deep connections between the string worldsheet and the Ryu-Takayanagi surface. The validity of this result arises from the fact that the bulk dual of entanglement entropy and the string vertices both are intrinsic hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>A new formulation of strong-field magnetohydrodynamics for neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.01636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a formulation of magnetohydrodynamics which can be used to describe the evolution of strong magnetic fields in neutron star interiors. Our approach is based on viewing magnetohydrodynamics as a theory with a one-form global symmetry and developing an effective field theory for the hydrodynamic modes associated with this symmetry. In the regime where the local velocity and temperature variations can be neglected, we derive the most general constitutive relation consistent with symmetry constraints for the electric field in the presence of a strong magnetic field. This constitutive relation not only reproduces the phenomena of Ohmic decay, ambipolar diffusion, and Hall drift derived in a phenomenological model by Goldreich and Reisenegger, but also reveals new terms in the evolution of the magnetic field which cannot easily be seen from such microscopic models. This formulation gives predictions for novel diffusion behaviors of small perturbations around a constant background magnetic field, and for the two-point correlation functions among various components of the electric and magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: We study the kinetic mixing between the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photon and the birefringent dark photon. These birefringent dark photon may exist in parity-violating dark sector, for example, through the coupling to axion field. We show that the birefringence of the dark photon propagates to the CMB photon, but the resulting birefringence may not be isotropic over the sky, but will be anisotropic in general. Moreover, our investigation sheds light on the essential role played by kinetic mixing in the generation of two fundamental characteristics of the CMB: circular polarization and spectral distortion.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger evolution of a scalar field in Riemannian and pseudoRiemannian expanding metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum field theory (QFT) of a scalar field in the Schr\"odinger picture in the functional formulation.
  We derive a formula for the evolution kernel in a flat expanding metric. We discuss a transition between Riemannian and pseudoRiemannian metrics (signature inversion). We express the real time Schr\"odinger evolution by the Brownian motion . We discuss the Feynman integral for a scalar field in a radiation background. We show that the unitary Schr\"odinger evolution for positive time can go over for negative time into a dissipative evolution described by diffusive paths.</description>

      <title>Topological Data Analysis of Monopole Current Networks in $U(1)$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07739v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In $4$-dimensional pure compact $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory, we analyse topological aspects of the dynamics of monopoles across the deconfinement phase transition. We do this using tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). We demonstrate that observables constructed from the zeroth and first homology groups of monopole current networks may be used to quantitatively and robustly locate the critical inverse coupling $\beta_{c}$ through finite-size scaling. Our method provides a mathematically robust framework for the characterisation of topological invariants related to monopole currents, putting on firmer ground earlier investigations. Moreover, our approach can be generalised to the study of Abelian monopoles in non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>On the (in)consistency of perturbation theory at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A well-known difficulty of perturbative approaches to quantum field theory at finite temperature is the necessity to address theoretical constraints that are not present in the vacuum theory. In this work, we use lattice simulations of scalar correlation functions in massive $\phi^{4}$ theory to analyse the extent to which these constraints affect the perturbative predictions. We find that the standard perturbative predictions deteriorate even in the absence of infrared divergences at relatively low temperatures, and that this is directly connected to the analytic structure of the propagators used in the expansion. This suggests that the incorporation of non-perturbative thermal effects in the propagators is essential for a consistent perturbative formulation of scalar quantum field theories at finite temperature. By utilising the spectral constraints imposed on finite-temperature correlation functions, we explore how these effects manifest themselves in the lattice data, and discuss why the presence of distinct thermoparticle excitations provides a potential resolution to these issues.</description>

      <title>On perturbation around closed exclusion processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02675v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the formula for the stationary states of particle-number conserving exclusion processes infinitesimally perturbed by inhomogeneous adsorption and desorption. The formula not only proves but also generalises the conjecture proposed in arXiv:1711.06949 to account for inhomogeneous adsorption and desorption. As an application of the formula, we draw part of the phase diagrams of the open asymmetric simple exclusion process with and without Langmuir kinetics, correctly reproducing known results.</description>

      <title>Corner Charge Fluctuation as an Observable for Quantum Geometry and Entanglement in Two-dimensional Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring bipartite fluctuations of a conserved charge, such as the particle number, is a powerful approach to understanding quantum systems. When the measured region has sharp corners, the bipartite fluctuation receives an additional contribution known to exhibit a universal angle-dependence in 2D isotropic and uniform systems. Here we establish that, for generic lattice systems of noninteracting electrons, the corner charge fluctuation is directly related to quantum geometry; we further generalize the conclusion to interacting systems for the case where there is one atom per unit cell. We first provide a practical scheme to isolate the corner contribution on lattices, and analytically prove that its angle-dependence in the small-angle limit measures the integrated quantum metric exclusively. A model of a compact obstructed atomic insulator is introduced to illustrate this effect analytically, while numerical verification for various Chern insulator models further demonstrate the experimental relevance of the corner charge fluctuation in a finite-size quantum simulator as a probe of quantum geometry. Last but not least, for free-fermions, we unveil a remarkable connection between quantum geometry and quantum information through the lens of corner entanglement entropies.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounds on the Mass of Fundamental Fields from Primordial Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations in the vacuum zero point energy associated to quantum fields and their statistical distributions during inflation. It is shown that the perturbations in the vacuum zero point energy have large amplitudes which are highly non-Gaussian. The effects of vacuum zero point fluctuations can be interpreted as the loop corrections in primordial power spectrum and bispectrum. Requiring that the primordial curvature perturbation to remain nearly Gaussian and the loop corrections to be under perturbative control impose strong upper bounds on the mass of fundamental fields during inflation. We show that the fundamental fields can not be much heavier than the Hubble scale during inflation, otherwise their vacuum zero point fluctuations induce large non-Gaussianities in primordial perturbations. Considering the observational upper bound on tensor to scalar ratio, we conclude that all fundamental fields are lighter than $10^{14}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Backward DVCS on the pion in Sullivan processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to do a systematic feasibility study of measuring in backward region deeply virtual Compton scattering on the pion in Sullivan processes in the framework of collinear QCD factorization where pion to photon transition distribution amplitudes (TDAs) describe the photon content of the $\pi$ meson. Our approach employs TDAs based on the overlap of light front wave functions, using a previously developed pion light-front wave function and deriving a consistent model for the light front wave functions of the photon. This work is expected to lead us to an estimate of the cross-sections that could be measured in the future U.S. and China's electron-ion colliders. It will also provide a comparison with the forward Sullivan DVCS case, which gives access to pion GPDs and for which a strong signal is expected.</description>

      <title>Extended Relativity: Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their success, General Relativity (GR) and the Standard Model (SM) are currently understood as effective field theories only valid up to some energy (length) scale, where new physics is expected to appear. We review the framework of extended relativity (ER) in Clifford spaces (C-spaces), summarizing some of its concepts, methods and results. We also discuss likely links of this approach with other relativities (OR), beyond GR and SM theories, recent ideas from emergent spacetime (ES) and quantum entanglement (QE), in search for quantum gravity (QG) and unification (U). Finally, we explore and expose the need to go even beyond ER, and the challenges it poses, from both experimental and theoretical sides.</description>

      <title>Holographic analysis of boundary correlation functions for the hyperbolic-lattice Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze boundary spin correlation functions of the hyperbolic-lattice Ising model from the holographic point of view. Using the corner-transfer-matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) method, we demonstrate that the boundary correlation function exhibits power-law decay with quasi-periodic oscillation, while the bulk correlation function always decays exponentially. On the basis of the geometric relation between the bulk correlation path and distance along the outer edge boundary, we find that scaling dimensions for the boundary correlation function can be well explained by the combination of the bulk correlation length and background curvatures inherent to the hyperbolic lattice. We also investigate the cutoff effect of the bond dimension in CTMRG, revealing that the long-distance behavior of the boundary spin correlation is accurately described even with a small bond dimension. In contrast, the sort-distance behavior rapidly loses its accuracy.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Semiclassical Methods Inspired by Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiclassical methods are essential in analyzing quantum mechanical systems. Although they generally produce approximate results, relatively rare potentials exist for which these methods are exact. Such intriguing potentials serve as crucial test cases for semiclassical approximations. Recent research has demonstrated a deep connection between supersymmetric quantum mechanics and the exactness of semiclassical methods. Specifically, the mathematical form of conventional shape-invariant potentials guarantees exactness in several related situations. In this manuscript, we review these recent results and discuss their significance.</description>
