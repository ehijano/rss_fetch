      <title>QSO MUSEUM III: the circumgalactic medium in Ly$\alpha$ emission around 120 $z\sim3$ quasars covering the SDSS parameter space. Witnessing the instantaneous AGN feedback on halo scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent surveys show that $z&gt;2$ quasars are surrounded by Hydrogen Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) glows with diverse emission levels and extents. These seem to depend on the activity of embedded quasars, the number of active galactic nucleus (AGN) photons able to reach the halo gas or circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the physical properties of the CGM. In this framework, we present VLT/MUSE snapshot observations (45 min/source) of 59 $z\sim3$ quasars extending the long-term QSO MUSEUM campaign to fainter SDSS sources. The whole survey now targets 120 quasars with a median redshift of $z$=3.13, and bolometric luminosities, black hole masses and Eddington ratios of $45.1&lt;\log(L_{\rm bol}/[{\rm erg\,s^{-1}]})&lt;48.7$, $7.9&lt;\log(M_{\rm BH}/[{\rm M_{\odot}]})&lt;10.3 $ and $0.01&lt;\lambda_{\rm Edd}&lt;1.8$, respectively. We detect extended Ly$\alpha$ emission in 110/120 systems, with all non-detections in the new fainter sample. Stacking non-detections unveils emission below our individual detection limit. The Ly$\alpha$ surface brightness (SB$_{\rm Ly\alpha}$) of the CGM increases with quasar luminosity. Moreover, the Ly$\alpha$ linewidth increases in the central regions (projected radius $R&lt;40$ kpc or $\sim$40% $R_{\rm vir}$) of the CGM around brighter quasars. These trends indicate that we are witnessing the instantaneous AGN feedback in action on CGM scales. Assuming that all targeted quasars sit in halos of $M_{\rm DM}\sim10^{12.5}\,M_\odot$, as found in clustering studies, the trend in SB$_{\rm Ly\alpha}$ can be explained by larger fractions of cool gas mass illuminated, implying that brighter quasars have larger ionization cone opening angles. Similarly, brighter AGNs seem to perturb the cool ($T\sim10^4$ K) gas more strongly. We show that QSO MUSEUM now has enough statistics to study the instantaneous AGN feedback while controlling for black hole properties, which are key to constraining AGN models.</description>

      <title>Unusually High Gas-to-Dust Ratios Observed in High-Redshift Quiescent Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracking the cold molecular gas contents of galaxies is critical to understand the interplay between star formation and galaxy growth across cosmic time. Observations of the long-wavelength dust continuum, a proxy for the cold gas, are widely used in the high-redshift community because of their ease and efficiency. These measurements rely on the assumption of a molecular gas-to-dust mass ratio, typically taken to be GDR ~ 100 in massive, metal-rich systems. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the 870um dust continuum in a sample of five massive quiescent galaxies at z ~ 1 with existing detections of CO(2-1). We find surprisingly weak dust emission, falling a factor of &gt;~0.4-0.8 dex below the typical correlation between CO and continuum luminosity. We interpret this dust deficiency as evidence for unusually high GDR in these galaxies, which we calculate to range from 300 to at least 1200. Our results and other observations from the literature are generally compatible with predictions from the SIMBA cosmological simulation that dust is preferentially destroyed in quiescent galaxies. Ultimately, we conclude that the dust continuum is a highly unreliable tracer of the molecular gas in high-redshift quiescent galaxies. As a consequence we may know much less about the cold gas contents of this population than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Atomic hydrogen reservoirs in quiescent galaxies at z = 0.4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Based on Local Universe observations, quiescent galaxies (QGs) host lower to no HI compared to star-forming galaxies (SFGs), but no constraints have been derived so far at higher redshift (z&gt;0.1). Understanding whether QGs can retain significant HI reservoirs at higher z is crucial to refine quenching and gas accretion models and to constrain overall star formation efficiency at different epochs. Aims. We aim to probe HI in candidate QGs at intermediate redshifts (z=0.36) and to understand whether there exists a class of QGs retaining consistent HI reservoirs and which parameters (dust content, stellar mass, Dn4000, morphology, environment) effectively capture HI-rich QGs. Methods. We perform 21-cm spectral line stacking on MIGHTEE-HI data at z=0.36, targeting two different samples of QGs, defined by means of a color-selection criterion and a spectroscopic criterion based on Dn4000, respectively. We also perform stacking on subsamples of the spectroscopically-selected quiescent sample to investigate the correlation between the HI content and other galaxy properties. Results. We find that QGs with an IR counterpart (i.e., dusty galaxies) are found to host a substantial HI content, on average just 40% lower than SFGs. In contrast, color-selected QGs still hold HI, but lower than SFGs by a factor 3. Among dusty objects, we find morphology to have a mild impact on the atomic gas content, with spirals hosting approximately 15-30% more HI than spheroids. Environmental effects are also present, with low-density regions hosting galaxies that are HI-richer than in high-density ones, by approximately 30% for spirals and 60% for spheroids. We suggest that, in general, HI content is driven by several factors, including quenching mechanisms and ISM enrichment processes. Also, quiescent galaxies - and especially dusty systems - seem to yield HI more consistently than in the Local Universe.</description>

      <title>ALMA survey of a massive node of the Cosmic Web at $z\sim 3$. II. A dynamically cold and massive disk galaxy in the proximity of a hyperluminous quasar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancing our understanding of the formation and evolution of early massive galaxies and black holes requires detailed studies of dense structures in the high-redshift Universe. In this work, we present high-angular resolution ($\simeq0.3''$) ALMA observations targeting the CO(4--3) line and the underlying 3-mm dust continuum toward the Cosmic Web node MQN01, a region identified through deep multiwavelength surveys as one of the densest concentrations of galaxies and AGN at cosmic noon. At the center of this structure, we identify a massive, rotationally supported disk galaxy located approximately at $\sim10\,{\rm kpc}$ projected-distance and $\sim-300\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ from a hyperluminous quasar at $z=3.2510$. By accurately modeling the cold gas kinematics, we determine a galaxy dynamical mass of $2.5\times10^{11}\,{M_{\odot}}$ within the inner $\simeq 4\,{\rm kpc}$, and a high degree of rotational support of $V_{\rm rot}/\sigma \approx 11$. This makes it the first quasar companion galaxy confirmed as a massive, dynamically cold rotating disk at such an early cosmic epoch. Despite the small projected separation from the quasar host, we find no clear evidence of strong tidal interactions affecting the galaxy disk. This might suggest that the quasar is a satellite galaxy in the early stages of a merger. Furthermore, our spectroscopic analysis reveals a broad, blueshifted component in the CO(4--3) line profile of the quasar host, which may trace a powerful molecular outflow or kinematic disturbances induced by its interaction with the massive companion galaxy. Our findings show that rotationally supported cold disks are able to survive even in high-density environments of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>An analytic formalism to describe the $N_{\rm eff}(\rm H)$-$n_{\rm H}$ relationship in molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Astrochemical modeling requires, as input, the effective column density of gas (or extinction) that attenuates an external, isotropic, far-ultraviolet radiation field. In three-dimensional simulations, this can be calculated through ray-tracing schemes, while in 0D chemical models it is often treated as a free parameter. Aims. We aim to produce an analytic, physically motivated formalism to predict the average relationship between the effective hydrogen-nuclei column density, $N_{\rm eff}({\rm H})$, and the local hydrogen-nuclei number density, $n_{\rm H}$. Methods. We construct an analytic model utilizing characteristic length scales that connects the turbulence-dominated regime and the gravitational-dominated regime at high-density. Results. The model well-reproduces a previous analytic fit to simulation results and is consistent with the high-density power-law indices, e.g., $N_{\rm eff}(H) \propto n^{\gamma}$, of $\gamma \approx 0.4 - 0.5$ found in previous numerical simulations utilizing ray-tracing. Conclusions. We present an analytic model relating the average effective column density, $N_{\rm eff}$, to the local number density, $n_{\rm H}$, which reproduces the behaviors found in three-dimensional simulations. The analytic model can be utilized as a sub-grid prescription for shielded molecular gas or in astrochemical models for a physically motivated estimation of the attenuating column density.</description>

      <title>Detection of a dark matter sub-halo near the Sun from pulsar timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using pulsar accelerations, we identify and constrain the properties of a dark matter sub-halo in the Galaxy for the first time from analyzing the excess, correlated power in the acceleration field of binary pulsars. We find that this sub-halo has a mass of $1.02^{+3.47}_{-0.90} \times 10^{7}~M_{\odot}$ and is located at Galactic coordinates $d = 0.93^{+0.32}_{-0.38}$ kpc, $b=36.78^{+17.59}_{-23.55}$, $l=30.16^{+19.36}_{-23.82}$, or equivalently at Galactocentric coordinates $X = 7.52^{+0.34}_{-0.38}~\rm$ kpc, $Y = 0.36^{+0.39}_{-0.43} ~\rm kpc$, $Z = 0.53^{+0.41}_{-0.45} ~\rm kpc$. We examine \textit{Gaia} data and the atomic and molecular hydrogen data of our Galaxy and show that this excess power cannot arise from the gas or the stars in our Galaxy. Additionally, by analyzing the full sample of binary pulsars with available acceleration measurements that span 3.4 kpc in Galactocentric radius from the Sun and 3.6 kpc in vertical height, we find that massive (with mass $&gt;10^{8}~M_{\odot}~$) sub-halos are disfavored for the Milky Way within several kiloparsec of the Sun. The detection of a $10^{7}~M_{\odot}$ sub-halo within a few kpc of the Sun is potentially consistent with the expected number counts of sub-halos in the prevailing $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, for a substantial sub-halo mass fraction. The pulsar accelerations are however better fit by a compact object, such as arising from a primordial black hole or a sub-halo having a steep density profile, as in self-interacting dark matter. As the number and precision of direct acceleration measurements continues to grow, we will obtain tighter constraints on dark matter sub-structure in our Galaxy. These measurements now open a new avenue for studying dark matter and have implications across many fields of astrophysics - from understanding the nature of dark matter to galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Galactokinetics II: Spiral structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified theory of linear spiral structure in stellar disks. We begin by identifying the characteristic scales involved in the spiral structure problem and listing some quantitative requirements of a successful theory. We then write down the general linear response theory for thin disks, making clear the equivalence between different representations (e.g., Volterra, Landau, van Kampen) of the theory. Next, using the asymptotic expansions developed in our previous galactokinetics paper, we consider spiral structure on different spatial scales and thereby show how several classic results - including Lindblad-Kalnajs density waves, swing amplification, Lin-Shu-Kalnajs modes, and groove instabilities - emerge as limiting cases. In addition, many of our asymptotic results connect smoothly when extrapolated to intermediate regimes, rendering the analytic theory valid over a larger range of scales than naively expected. Finally, we identify situations in which nonlinear physics is unavoidable. Though many nonlinear questions remain unanswered, we hope that the theoretical synthesis developed here will allow us to both connect and distinguish the plethora of ideas that have accumulated over the last six decades of spiral structure studies, and will provide a foundation upon which a comprehensive theory might ultimately be built.</description>

      <title>The AURORA Survey: Robust Helium Abundances at High Redshift Reveal A Subpopulation of Helium-Enhanced Galaxies in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first robust helium (He) abundance measurements in star-forming galaxies at redshifts $1.6\lesssim z\lesssim 3.3$ using deep, moderate-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy from the AURORA survey. We establish a High$-z$ HeI Sample consisting of 20 galaxies with multiple high-S/N ($&gt;5\sigma$) HeI emission-line detections, including the critical near-infrared $\lambda$10833 line. This is the first study at high redshift leveraging $\lambda$10833 to break degeneracies between temperature, electron density, optical depth, and He$^+$/H$^+$, enabling reliable He abundance determinations in the early universe. We use a custom MCMC framework incorporating direct-method electron temperature priors, extended optical depth ($\tau_{\lambda3890}$) model grids up to densities of $10^6$~cm$^{-3}$, and simultaneous fits of the physical conditions and HeI/HI line ratios to derive ionic He$^+$/H$^+$ abundances. Most of the AURORA galaxies follow the extrapolated $z\sim0$ He/H-O/H trend, indicating modest He enrichment by $z\sim2-3$. However, we identify a subpopulation of four galaxies that exhibit elevated He mass fractions ($\Delta Y&gt;0.03$) without corresponding enhancements in N/O or $\alpha$-elements ($\sim20$% of the sample). This abundance pattern is inconsistent with enrichment from asymptotic giant branch stars, but favors early He enrichment from very massive stars (VMSs; $M\gtrsim100\ M_\odot$), which can eject He-rich, N-poor material via stellar winds and binary stripping in young stellar populations. We speculate that these elevated-He systems may represent an early phase of globular cluster (GC) formation where N enrichment is still lagging behind He production. This work demonstrates the power of JWST multi-line HeI spectroscopy for tracing early stellar feedback, enrichment pathways, and GC progenitor signatures in the high-z universe.</description>

      <title>Environmental Effects on Galaxy Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies evolve within a web-like cosmic structure, and their properties are strongly shaped by their surrounding environments. We apply a nonparametric Bayesian two-sample test based on P\'olya tree priors to galaxy data from SDSS DR7 and DESI DR1 BGS to quantify the differences between galaxies in dense and sparse cosmic environments. Compared to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and parametric Bayesian test, our approach does not require strong assumptions about the underlying distributional form and provides a more sensitive and robust comparison of galaxy evolution across different environments. In particular, galaxies in VoidFinder voids tend to be fainter, less massive, and more star-forming compared to wall galaxies, while such contrasts are diminished under the V^2 REVOLVER pruning. These findings underscore the importance of both the statistical framework and the void classification algorithm in interpreting environmental effects on galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>The $10~\rm{kpc}$ collar of early-type galaxies -- probing evolution by focusing on the inner stellar density profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The post-quenching evolution process of early-type galaxies (ETGs) is still not fully understood. The amount of growth in stellar mass and size incurred after quenching is still under debate.
  Aims: In this work we aim to investigate the late evolution of ETGs, both observationally and theoretically, by focusing on the stellar mass density profile inside a fixed aperture, within $10$~kpc from the galaxy center.
  Methods: We first studied the stellar mass and mass-weighted density slope within $10 ~\rm{kpc}$, respectively $M_{*,10}$ and $\mathit{\Gamma_{*,10}}$, of a sample of early-type galaxies from the GAMA survey. We measured the \gmr~and its evolution over the redshift range $0.17\leq z \leq 0.37$. We then built a toy model for the merger evolution of galaxies, based on N-body simulations, to explore to what extent the observed growth in \gmr~is consistent with a dry-merger evolution scenario.
  Results: From the observations, we do not detect evidence for an evolution of the \gmr relation. We put an upper limit on $~(\mu)$ and $~(\beta)$ of the \gmr: $|\partial \mu/\partial \log (1+z)| \leq 0.13$ and $\left|\partial \beta/\partial \log (1+z)\right| \leq 1.10$, respectively. Simulations show that most mergers induce a decrease in $\mathit{\Gamma_{*,10}}$ and an increase in $M_{*,10}$, although some show a decrease in $M_{*,10}$, particularly for the most extended galaxies and smaller merger mass ratios. By combining the observations with our merger toy model, we placed an upper limit on $f_M = 11.2 \%$ in the redshift range $0.17 \leq z \leq 0.37$.
  Conclusions: While our measurement is limited by systematics, the application of our approach to samples with a larger redshift baseline, particularly with a time interval $\Delta t \geq 3.2~\mathrm{Gyr}$, should enable us to detect a signal and help us better understand the late growth of ETGs.</description>

      <title>Through the fog: a complementary optical galaxy classification scheme for 'intermediate' redshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding galaxy classification depends on our interpretation of their spectra. To date, the hydrogen Balmer lines remain the most consistent way to classify galaxies, but at 'intermediate' redshifts ($1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5$), galaxies are hard to parse in the BPT diagram (and its siblings) because the crucial H$\alpha$ emission line is out of range of ground-based optical spectographs. In this work, we re-explore a known diagram, which we call the OB-I diagram, that compares the equivalent width of H$\beta$ with the emission line ratio of [OIII]$\lambda$5007/H$\beta$, and breathe new life into it, as it has the potential to 'illuminate the fog' that permeates galaxy classification in the restframe optical spectra. Using data from SDSS, LEGA-C, VANDELS, JADES, 3D-HST and MOSDEF, we explore galaxy classification in the OB-I diagram at a wide range of redshifts ($0 &lt; z &lt; 2.7$). We find that, at $z &lt; 0.4$, the OB-I diagram clearly separates galaxies between two distinct types, which we divide with an empirical fit: one dominated by AGN and a second made up of a mixed population of SF galaxies and AGN activity. This mixed population can be partially separated from a pure SF population, with a simple semi-empirical fit derived from a comparison with theoretical models and the BPT diagrams. At higher redshifts, we find that the majority of AGNs identified by other classification schemes are correctly recovered by the OB-I diagram, potentially making this diagram resistant to the 'cosmic shift' that plagues most optical classification schemes. Overall, the OB-I diagram, which only requires two emission lines to be implemented, is a useful tool at separating galaxies that possess a dominating AGN component in their emission from others, from the Local Universe ($z &lt; 0.1$) to the Cosmic Noon ($z \sim 2$), without any need for significant adjustments in our empirical fit.</description>

      <title>VERTICO IX: Signatures of environmental processing of the gas in Virgo cluster spiral galaxies through mapping of CO isotopologues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study CO isotopologue emission in the largest cluster galaxy sample to date: 48 VERTICO spiral galaxies in Virgo. We show for the first time in a significant sample that the physical conditions within the molecular gas appear to change as a galaxy's ISM is affected by environmental processes. 13CO is detected across the sample, both directly and via stacking, while C18O is detected in a smaller number of systems. We use these data to study trends with global and radial galaxy properties. We show that the CO/13CO line ratio changes systematically with a variety of galaxy properties, including mean gas surface density, HI-deficiency and galaxy morphology. 13CO/C18O line ratios vary significantly, both radially and between galaxies, suggesting real variations in abundances are present. Such abundance changes may be due to star formation history differences, or speculatively even stellar initial mass function variations. We present a model where the optical depth of the molecular gas appears to change as a galaxy's ISM is affected by environmental processes. The molecular gas appears to become more transparent as the molecular medium is stripped, and then more opaque as the tightly bound remnant gas settles deep in the galaxy core. This explains the variations we see, and also helps explain similar observations in cluster early-type galaxies. Next generation simulations and dedicated observations of additional isotopologues could thus provide a powerful tool to help us understand the impact of environment on the ISM, and thus the quenching of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning the complex organic molecule formation: sulfur and CO ice as regulators of surface chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain-surface chemistry plays a crucial role in the formation of molecules of astrobiological interest, including H$_{2}$S and complex organic molecules (COMs). They are commonly observed in the gas phase toward star-forming regions, but their detection in ices remains limited. Combining gas-phase observations with chemical modeling is therefore essential for advancing our understanding of their chemistry. In this paper we investigate the factors that promote or hinder molecular complexity combining gas-phase observations of CH$_{3}$OH, H$_{2}$S, OCS, N$_{2}$H$^{+}$, and C$^{18}$O with chemical modeling in two dense cores: Barnard-1b and IC348. We observed millimeter emission lines of CH$_{3}$OH, H$_{2}$S, OCS, N$_{2}$H$^{+}$, and C$^{18}$O along strips using the IRAM 30m and Yebes 40m telescopes. We used the gas-grain chemical model \texttt{Nautilus} to reproduce the observed abundance profiles adjusting parameters such as initial sulfur abundances and binding energies. H$_{2}$S, N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ and C$^{18}$O gas-phase abundances vary up to one order of magnitude towards the extinction peak. CH$_{3}$OH abundance remains quite uniform. These abundances can only be reproduced assuming a decreasing sulfur budget, which lowers H$_{2}$S and enhances CH$_{3}$OH abundances. Decreasing binding energies, which are expected in CO-rich apolar ices, are also required. The sulfur depletion required by H$_2$S is generally higher than that required by CH$_3$OH, suggesting unknown sulfur sinks. These findings highlight the intricate relationship between sulfur chemistry and COM formation, driven by the competition between sulfur and CO for hydrogen atoms. Our study emphasizes that the growth of CO ice and the progressive sequestration of hydrogen atoms by sulfur are critical in determining whether chemical complexity can develop, providing key insights into the early stages of star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>A Galactic Self-Portrait: Density Structure and Integrated Properties of the Milky Way Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution history of the Milky Way disk is imprinted in the ages, positions, and chemical compositions of individual stars. In this study, we derive the intrinsic density distribution of different stellar populations using the final data release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey. A total of 203,197 red giant branch stars are used to sort the stellar disk ($R \leq 20$ kpc) into sub-populations of metallicity ($\Delta$[M/H]$= 0.1$ dex), age ($\Delta \log(\frac{\textrm{age}}{\textrm{yr}})= 0.1$), and $\alpha$-element abundances ([$\alpha$/M]). We fit the present-day structural parameters and density distribution of each stellar sub-population after correcting for the survey selection function. The low-$\alpha$ disk is characterized by longer scale lengths and shorter scale heights, and is best fit by a broken exponential radial profile for each population. The high-$\alpha$ disk is characterized by shorter scale lengths and larger scale heights, and is generally well-approximated by a single exponential radial profile. These results are applied to produce new estimates of the integrated properties of the Milky Way from early times to the present day. We measure the total stellar mass of the disk to be $5.27^{+0.2}_{-1.5} \times 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ and the average mass-weighted scale length is $R_{d} = 2.37 \pm 0.2$ kpc. The Milky Way's present-day color of $(g-r) = 0.72 \pm 0.02$ is consistent with the classification of a red spiral galaxy, although it has only been in the "green valley" region of the galaxy color-mass diagram for the last $\sim 3$ Gyr.</description>

      <title>Watching our Galaxy Grow Up: The Mass and Color Evolution of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using our rich observations within the Milky Way to better understand galaxy evolution requires understanding what the Milky Way looks like "as a galaxy" -- that is, its "true" shape and abundance profiles (unskewed by observational biases), signatures of past mergers and significant accretion events, and even its total stellar mass and integrated SED, which have historically been difficult to constrain. We present a new approach to determining the Milky Way's integrated mass and colors, using recent measurements of the intrinsic density profiles of stellar populations spanning nearly 13 Gyr in time and 1.5 dex in metallicity (representing nearly all of the Galaxy's stars). We trace the evolution of the Milky Way in various diagnostic spaces, explore the impact of specific events on the present-day Milky Way's integrated properties, and use TNG50 simulations to identify "young" Galactic analogs and their eventual fates, compared to the real Milky Way's path. From the simulation comparisons, we find strong evidence for an earlier-than-average stellar mass assembly of the MW, and that present-day MW analogs follow a similar growth history, albeit at slightly later times; we also find that analogs of the early MW are in no way guaranteed to follow the MW's subsequent path. This empirical study offers new constraints on our "Galaxy as a galaxy" -- today and across cosmic time -- and on its place in the general galactic population.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Dot: an LRD-like nucleus at the Heart of an IR-Bright Galaxy and its implications for high-redshift LRDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact, red sources discovered by JWST at high redshift ($z \gtrsim 4$), marked by distinctive "V-shaped" spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and often interpreted as rapidly accreting AGNs. Their evolution remains unclear, as identifying counterparts at lower redshifts is challenging. We present WISEA J123635.56+621424.2 (here dubbed {\it the Saguaro}), a $z=2.0145$ galaxy in GOODS-North, as a possible analog of high-redshift LRDs and a potential missing link in their evolutionary path toward lower-redshift systems. It features a compact LRD-like nucleus surrounded by a face-on spiral host. Its connection to LRDs includes that: (1) its nuclear spectrum shows a clear "V-shaped" SED; and (2) when redshifted to $z=7$, surface brightness dimming makes the host undetectable, thus mimicking an LRD. This suggests that high-redshift LRDs may be embedded in extended hosts. To test this, we stack rest-frame UV images of 99 photometrically selected LRDs, revealing faint, diffuse emission. Stacking in redshift bins reveals mild radial growth, consistent with the expected galaxy size evolution. A simple analytic model confirms that surface brightness dimming alone can explain their compact appearance. Lastly, we show that {\it the Saguaro} is not unique by describing similar objects from the literature at $z\lesssim3.5$. Taken together, our results support a scenario in which LRDs may not be a distinct population, but could be the visible nuclei of galaxies undergoing a short-lived, AGN-dominated evolutionary phase, with their compact, red appearance driven largely by observational biases.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Linear Matter Power Spectrum Enhancement on Dark Matter Substructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present cosmological dark matter (DM)--only zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way (MW) analog originating from enhanced linear matter power spectra $P(k)$ relative to the standard cold, collisionless DM (CDM) cosmology. We consider a Gaussian power excess in $P(k)$ followed by a cutoff in select cases; this behavior could arise from early-universe physics that alters the primordial matter power spectrum or DM physics in the radiation-dominated epoch. We find that enhanced initial conditions (ICs) lead to qualitative differences in substructure relative to CDM. In particular, the subhalo mass function (SHMF) resulting from ICs with both an enhancement and cutoff is amplified at high masses and suppressed at low masses, indicating that DM substructure is sensitive to features in $P(k)$. Critically, the amplitude and shape of the SHMF enhancement depend on the wave number of the $P(k)$ excess and the presence or absence of a cutoff on smaller scales. These alterations to the SHMF are mainly imprinted at infall rather than during tidal evolution. Additionally, subhalos are found systematically closer to the host center and their concentrations are increased in scenarios with $P(k)$ enhancement. Thus, nonlinear mode coupling must be captured to enable $P(k)$ reconstruction using DM substructure.</description>

      <title>Variable X-ray reverberation in the rapidly accreting AGN Ark 564: the response of the soft excess to the changing geometry of the inner accretion flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray reverberation, which exploits the time delays between variability in different energy bands as a function of Fourier frequency, probes the structure of the inner accretion disks and X-ray coronae of active galactic nuclei. We present a systematic X-ray spectroscopic and reverberation study of the high-Eddington-ratio narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy Ark 564, using over 900 ks of \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{NuSTAR} observations spanning 13 years. The time-averaged spectra can be well described by the a model consisting of a coronal continuum, relativistic disk reflection, warm Comptonization, and three warm absorbers. Leveraging the high X-ray brightness of Ark 564, we are able to resolve the time evolution of the spectra and contemporaneous reverberation lags. The soft-band lag relative to the continuum increases with the X-ray flux, while Fe K$\alpha$ lags are detected in only a subset of epochs and do not correlate with soft lags. Models based on a lamppost corona and reflection from a standard thin disk can broadly reproduce the observed lag-energy spectra of low-flux epochs; however, additional reverberation from the warm Comptonized atmosphere is required to explain the soft lags observed in high-flux epochs. A vertically puffed-up inner disk and a variable, vertically extended corona can better explain the observed evolution of the lags and covariance spectra. Our study underscores the importance of multi-epoch, multi-band analyses for a comprehensive understanding the inner accretion disk and corona.</description>

      <title>Polarisation as a probe of neutrino emission from blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The source of extragalactic neutrinos in the TeV-PeV range is a matter of very active research, with blazar jets having been postulated to be the origin of at least some of the detections. The blazar PKS 0735+178 is a prominent example; during its multi-band flare in late 2021 a neutrino event was reported by four observatories, with its origin consistent with the direction of that source. While no new jet component was observed to be ejected during that narrow time-frame, our analysis shows that a propagating shock front originating from the core region was the likely source of the multi-band flare, using very-long-baseline interferometry images of PKS 0735+178 in polarised light. Taken together, our findings are suggestive of a coherent scenario in which the shock may contribute to the acceleration of protons, with the target photons potentially originating either from the ambient medium surrounding the jet or from proton synchrotron radiation. The necessary conditions for neutrino emission via proton-photon interactions are, hence, present in this jet.</description>

      <title>Tidal adaptive softening and artificial fragmentation in cosmological simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional N-body methods introduce localised perturbations in the gravitational forces governing their evolution. These perturbations lead to an artificial fragmentation in the filamentary network of the Large Scale Structure, often referred to as "beads-on-a-string." This issue is particularly apparent in cosmologies with a suppression of the matter power spectrum at small spatial scales, such as warm dark matter models, where the perturbations induced by the N-body discretisation dominate the cosmological power at the suppressed scales. Initial conditions based on third-order Lagrangian perturbation theory, which allow for a late-starting redshift, have been shown to minimise numerical errors contributing to such artefacts. In this work, we investigate whether the additional use of a spatially adaptive softening for dark matter particles, based on the gravitational tidal field, can reduce the severity of artificial fragmentation. Tidal adaptive softening significantly improves force accuracy in idealised filamentary collapse simulations over a fixed softening approach. However, it does not substantially reduce spurious haloes in cosmological simulations when paired with such optimised initial conditions. Nevertheless, tidal adaptive softening induces a shift in halo formation times in warm dark matter simulations compared to a fixed softening counterpart, an effect not seen in cold dark matter simulations. Furthermore, initialising the initial conditions at an earlier redshift generally results in z=0 haloes forming from Lagrangian volumes with lower average sphericity. This sphericity difference could impact post-processing algorithms identifying spurious objects based on Lagrangian volume morphology. We propose potential strategies for reducing spurious haloes without abandoning current N-body methods.</description>

      <title>A framework for modeling the evolution of young stellar objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring properties of young stellar objects (YSOs) is necessary for probing the pre-main-sequence evolution of stars. As YSOs exhibit complex geometry, measurement generally entails comparing observed radiation to template populations of radiative-transfer model YSO spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Due to uncertainty on the precise mechanics of star formation, the properties inferred for YSOs using these models often depend strongly on the assumed accretion history. We develop a framework for predicting observable properties of YSOs that is agnostic to the underlying accretion history, enabling comparison between theories. This framework links a set of radiative-transfer SEDs with protostellar evolutionary tracks to create models of evolving YSOs. Unlike previous works, we directly relate evolution models to observables through theoretical physical parameters rather than through intermediate, observationally derived analogues. We make flux predictions for YSOs corresponding to stars with birth masses from 0.2 to 50 $M_\odot$ during their accretion phase following isothermal-sphere, turbulent-core, and competitive accretion histories, showing that these histories may be observationally distinguished by examining the 100-$\mu$m and 3-mm fluxes of a YSO. We discuss the impact of dust models and parameter ranges on the output of radiative transfer simulations through a comparison to another SED model grid. We quantify the degree of confusion between YSO Stages and Classes across a wide range of physical scenarios; for each, we calculate confusion matrices that enable inference of the number of objects of a given Stage from an observed population. Finally, we critically examine the physical significance of various literature Stage and Class definitions.</description>

      <title>Ancient, eclipsing, tidally-locked: A blue lurker progenitor in the population of extreme-velocity star candidates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many extreme velocity candidate stars have been found based on \textit{Gaia} astrometry, but need spectroscopic confirmation. We select late-type hypervelocity star (HVS) candidates from the \textit{Gaia} DR3 catalog with a $1\sigma$ lower limit of the tangential velocity of 800 km\,s$^{-1}$. J1903-0023, one of the brightest targets, stands out as high priority candidate for follow-up spectroscopy using the X-shooter instrument at ESO-VLT. We determine its atmospheric parameters and abundances utilizing synthetic spectral grids and a global $\chi^2-$minimization procedure, and its stellar parameters with the help of evolutionary tracks and the spectral energy distribution. The star shows variability in its light curve and follow-up spectroscopy confirms that the star is radial-velocity variable. The spectroscopic distance of J1903-0023 is lower than that based on the parallax, indicating that the star is not a hypervelocity binary star but bound to the Galaxy. The star turned out to be of spectral type F, very similar to the extreme-velocity star J0725-2351, which we analyse in the same way as the target. Apparently, both stars are very metal poor and old halo main-sequence (sdF) stars with masses slightly below the halo turn-off mass, and share the low metallicity ([Fe/H]=-2.3,-2.6) and strong alpha enhancement ([$\alpha$/Fe]$\sim0.44$). While J0725-2351 is non-rotating ($v\sin\,i&lt;3$\,km\,s$^{-1}$), J1903-0023 is a fast rotator ($v\sin i=42.3\pm2.0$ km\,s$^{-1}$). The Gaia, and ZTF light curves show an eclipse at a 1.179 day period, similar to the rotation period of J1903-0023. We therefore conclude that J1903-0023 is a high-velocity tidally-synchronised binary most likely with a metal-poor M dwarf companion.</description>

Abstract: We present a "dictionary" to expedite the identification of potential deviations in gravitational waveforms from those predicted by General Relativity (GR) during the inspiral phase of black hole binaries. Assuming deviations from GR can be described by a local Effective Field Theory (EFT) formulated in terms of curvature operators (and possibly additional scalar fields), this dictionary characterizes how deviations scale with the masses of the binary components and identifies the leading order Post-Newtonian corrections in generic theories constructed within the EFT framework. By establishing a direct connection between observations and candidate theories beyond GR, this dictionary also aids in distinguishing genuine physical effects from systematic errors. These results can be readily incorporated into essentially all existing tests for the inspiral regime and, in particular, facilitate a more efficient combination of data from multiple events.</description>

      <title>Early Identification of Optical Tidal Disruption Events: A science module for the Fink broker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of tidal disruption events (TDEs) is one of the key science goals of large optical time-domain surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time. However, identifying TDEs in the vast alert streams produced by these surveys requires automated and reliable classification pipelines that can select promising candidates in real time. We developed a module within the Fink alert broker to identify TDEs during their rising phase. It was built to autonomously operate within the ZTF alert stream, producing a list of candidates every night and enabling spectral and multi-wavelength follow-up near peak brightness. All rising alerts are submitted to selection cuts and feature extraction using the Rainbow multi-band lightcurve fit. Best-fit values were used as input to train an XGBoost classifier with the goal of identifying TDEs. The training set was constructed using ZTF observations for objects with available classification in the Transient Name Server. Finally, candidates with high enough probability were visually inspected. The classifier achieves 76% recall, indicating strong performance in early-phase identification, despite the limited available information before peak. We show that, out of the known TDEs that pass the selection cuts, half of them are flagged as TDE before halfway in their rise, proving the feasibility of early classification. Additionally, new candidates were identified by applying the classifier on archival data, including a likely repeated TDE and some potential TDEs occurring in active galaxies. The module is implemented into the Fink alert processing framework, reporting each night a small number of candidates to dedicated communication channels through a user-friendly interface, for manual vetting and potential follow-up.</description>

      <title>Photometric Mapping of Carbonaceous/Siliceous Dust and Water Ice in the ISM with JWST: Applications to the Dense Sightlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new photometric mapping method for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to measure the spatial distribution of carbonaceous dust, siliceous dust and water ice by using absorption features arising from the grains in the dense interstellar medium (ISM). Employing NIRCam and MIRI imaging filters, low-resolution spectroscopic data can be obtained to measure the optical depths of the 3.0-$\mu$m water ice -OH feature, the 3.4-$\mu$m aliphatic hydrocarbon -CH feature, and the 10-$\mu$m silicate -SiO feature for large fields of view. This method provides extensive statistical data of the grains across wide fields in the ISM at minimal observing cost. In this study, we present its application on observational data from the literature to validate the measured optical depths and simulations to assess the accuracy of the method under various conditions. We showed that the photometric method can be employed to obtain reasonably accurate measurements of optical depth. We demonstrate that JWST optical depth maps enable the independent exploration of abundance distributions of major grain components across a wide spatial coverage in the ISM.</description>

      <title>GW231123: a product of successive mergers from $\sim 10 $ stellar-mass black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GW231123 is an exceptionally massive binary black hole (BBH) merger with unusually high component spins. Such extreme properties challenge conventional stellar evolution models predicting a black hole mass gap due to pair-instability supernovae. We analyze GW231123 using population-informed priors on BH mass and spin distributions to test possible formation scenarios: first-generation stellar collapse, hierarchical (multi-generation) mergers, and primordial origin. Our analysis strongly prefers scenarios where at least one component is a higher-generation BH. Both components are favored to have high spins, which rules out scenarios in which they are both first-generation (low spin) or primordial (nearly non-spin). We conclude that GW231123 is a hierarchical merger, with components plausibly originate from the successive mergers of $\sim 6$ and $\sim 4$ first-generation BHs, respectively. This suggests that repeated mergers can be frequent and even more massive intermediate-mass black holes may be produced. Thus mechanisms that can efficiently harden the BBHs' orbits are required, e.g., gas dynamical fraction in the disks of active galactic nucleus.</description>

      <title>Mapping ground-based coronagraphic images to Helioprojective-Cartesian coordinate system by image registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A few ground-based solar coronagraphs have been installed in western China for observing the low-layer corona in recent years. However, determining the Helioprojective Coordinates for the coronagraphic data with high precision is an important but challenging step for further research with other multi-wavelength data. In this paper, we propose an automatic coronal image registration method that combines local statistical correlation and feature point matching to achieve accurate registration between ground-based coronal green-line images and space-based 211 {\AA} images. Then, the accurate field of view information of the coronal green-line images can be derived, allowing the images to be mapped to the Helioprojective Cartesian Coordinates with an accuracy of no less than 0.1''. This method has been extensively validated using 100 days of coronal data spanning an 11-year period, demonstrating its broad applicability to ground-based coronagraphs equipped with green-line observations. It significantly enhances the scientific value of ground-based coronal data, enabling comprehensive studies of coronal transient activities and facilitating the joint analysis of data from multiple instruments. Additionally, it holds potential for future applications in improving the pointing accuracy of coronagraphs.</description>

      <title>A first measurement of baryonic feedback with Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baryonic feedback fundamentally alters the total matter distribution on small to intermediate cosmological scales, posing a significant challenge for contemporary cosmological analyses. Direct tracers of the baryon distribution are therefore key for unearthing cosmological information buried under astrophysical effects. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as a novel and direct probe of baryons, tracing the integrated ionised electron density along the line-of-sight, quantified by the dispersion measure (DM). The scatter of the DM as a function of redshift provides insight into the lumpiness of the electron distribution and, consequently, baryonic feedback processes. Using a model calibrated to the \texttt{BAHAMAS} hydrodynamical simulation suite, we forward-model the statistical properties of the DM with redshift. Applying this model to approximately 100 localised FRBs, we constrain the governing feedback parameter, $\log T_\mathrm{AGN}$. Our findings represent the first measurement of baryonic feedback using FRBs, demonstrating a strong rejection of no-feedback scenarios at greater than $99.7\,\%$ confidence ($3\sigma$), depending on the FRB sample. We find that FRBs prefer fairly strong feedback, similar to other measurements of the baryon distribution, via the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. The results are robust against sightline correlations and modelling assumptions. We emphasise the importance of accurate calibration of the host galaxy and Milky Way contributions to the DM. Furthermore, we discuss implications for future FRB surveys and necessary improvements to current models to ensure accurate fitting of upcoming data, particularly that from low-redshift FRBs.</description>

      <title>Direct correlation of line intensity mapping and CMB lensing from lightcone evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Line intensity mapping (LIM) promises to probe previously inaccessible corners of the faint and high-redshift universe. However, confusion with bright foregrounds is a major challenge for current-era pathfinder LIM experiments. Cross-correlation with cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing is a promising avenue to enable the first LIM detections at high redshifts, a pristine probe of fundamental physics but sparsely populated by faint galaxies, and to further probe the connection between matter and spectral line emission, expanding our understanding of galaxies and the IGM. Previous works have suggested that this direct correlation between LIM and CMB lensing is effectively impossible because smoothly varying modes in the intensity map are lost to bright foregrounds. In this work, we analytically revisit the direct correlation of foreground-filtered line intensity mapping with CMB lensing, highlighting lightcone evolution's previously neglected yet unavoidable and crucial effects. Indeed, the growth of structure and evolution of line emission along the lightcone breaks statistical translational invariance and thus induces mode coupling, even in linear theory, which enables the recovery of the smoothly varying modes lost to bright foregrounds. We compute the effects of these lightcone evolution-induced mode couplings on the LIMxCMB lensing cross-spectrum detectability, predicting that future wider-sky versions of COMAP, CCAT, and HETDEX will be able to precisely measure this cross-correlation. Although we focus on the direct correlation of LIM with CMB lensing in this paper, our arguments generalize to the direct correlation of LIM with any projected field.</description>

Abstract: Galactic disks lie at the heart of many of the most pressing astrophysical puzzles. There are sophisticated kinetic theories that describe some aspects of galaxy disk dynamics, but extracting quantitative predictions from those theories has proven very difficult, meaning they have shed little light on observations/simulations of galaxies. Here, we begin to address this issue by developing a tractable theory describing fluctuations and transport in thin galactic disks. Our main conceptual advance is to split potential fluctuations into asymptotic wavelength regimes relative to orbital guiding radius and epicyclic amplitude (similar to plasma gyrokinetics), and then to treat separately the dynamics in each regime. As an illustration, we apply our results to quasilinear theory, calculating the angular-momentum transport due to a transient spiral. At each stage we verify our formulae with numerical examples. Our approach should simplify many important calculations in galactic disk dynamics. In a follow-up paper, we apply these ideas to the theory of linear spiral structure in stellar disks.</description>

      <title>The Arizona Molecular ISM Survey with the SMT: Variations in the CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) Line Ratio Across the Galaxy Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03963v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The J=1$\rightarrow$0 spectral line of carbon monoxide (CO(1-0)) is the canonical tracer of molecular gas. However, CO(2-1) is frequently used in its place, following the assumption that the higher energy line can be used to infer the CO(1-0) luminosity and molecular gas mass. The use of CO(2-1) depends on a knowledge of the ratio between CO(2-1) and CO(1-0) luminosities, r$_{21}$. Here we present galaxy-integrated r$_{21}$ measurements for 122 galaxies spanning stellar masses from 10$^9$ to 10$^{11.5}$ M$_\odot$ and star formation rates (SFRs) from 0.08 to 35 M$_\odot$/yr. We find strong trends between r$_{21}$ and SFR, SFR surface density, star formation efficiency, and distance from the star formation main sequence (SFMS). We show that the assumption of a constant r$_{21}$ can introduce biases into the molecular gas trends in galaxy population studies and demonstrate how this affects the recovery of important galaxy scaling relations, including the Kennicutt-Schmidt law and the relation between SFMS offset and star formation efficiency. We provide a prescription which accounts for variations in r$_{21}$ as a function of SFR and can be used to convert between CO(2-1) and CO(1-0) when only one line is available. Our prescription matches variations in r$_{21}$ for both AMISS and literature samples and can be used to derive more accurate gas masses from CO(2-1) observations.</description>

      <title>Optimised neural network predictions of galaxy formation histories using semi-stochastic corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16548v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology to improve predictions of galaxy formation histories by incorporating semi-stochastic corrections to account for short-timescale variability. Our paper addresses limitations in existing models that capture broad trends in galaxy evolution, but fail to reproduce the bursty nature of star formation and chemical enrichment, resulting in inaccurate predictions of key observables such as stellar masses, optical spectra, and colour distributions. We introduce a simple technique to add a stochastic components by utilizing the power spectra of galaxy formation histories. We justify our stochastic approach by studying the correlation between the phases of the halo mass assembly and star-formation histories in the IllustrisTNG simulation, and we find that they are correlated only on timescales longer than 6 Gyr, with a strong dependence on galaxy type. We demonstrate our approach by applying our methodology to the predictions on a neural network trained on hydrodynamical simulations, which failed to recover the high-frequency components of star-formation and chemical enrichment histories. Our methodology successfully recovers realistic variability in galaxy properties at short timescales. It significantly improves the accuracy of predicted stellar masses, metallicities, spectra, and colour distributions and provides a practical framework for generating large, realistic mock galaxy catalogs, while also enhancing our understanding of the complex interplay between galaxy evolution and dark matter halo assembly.</description>

      <title>Rising from the Ashes II: The Bar-driven Abundance Bimodality of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Milky Way hosts at least two modes in its present day distribution of Fe and alpha-elements. The exact cause of this bimodality is disputed, but one class of explanations involves the merger between the Milky Way and a relatively massive satellite (Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus) at z~2. However, reproducing this bimodality in simulations is not straightforward, with conflicting results on the prevalence, morphology, and mechanism behind multimodality. We present a case study of a galaxy in the Illustris TNG50 simulation which undergoes sequential phases of starburst, brief quiescence, and then rejuvenation. This scenario results in a pronounced abundance bimodality after a post-processing adjustment of the [alpha/Fe] of old stars designed to mimic a higher star formation efficiency in dense gas. The high- and low-alpha sequences are separated in time by the brief quiescent period, which is not associated with a merger but by the formation of a bar followed by AGN activity. This galaxy indicates a novel scenario in which the alpha-bimodality in the Milky Way is caused by the formation of the bar via AGN-induced quenching. In addition to a stellar age gap in the Milky Way, we predict that abundance bimodalities should be more common in barred as opposed to unbarred galaxies.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal core: A 5D Analysis for a 6D Methodology with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Gaia DR3 data, we examine the kinematics of the central core of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy using data which includes proper motions and line-of-sight velocities for member stars in addition to their projected positions. We extract a sample of bright stars that are high-probability members of Sgr. We model the distances to these stars, which is the only missing phase-space component measurement from our 5D sample, highlighting how their corresponding uncertainties propagate to affect the kinematics. Using line-of-sight velocity data only, which are not affected by the distance uncertainties, and assuming a jeans-based equilibrium analysis, we obtain a velocity anisotropy of $\beta_a = -2.24 \pm 1.99$, which implies a system with tangentially-biased orbits. With the full 5D data, we project that the data will significantly improve upon measurements of the log-slope of the dark matter density profile and the stellar velocity anisotropy. Tests with mock distance data show an improvement of anisotropy errors of approximately an order of magnitude, and log slope at the half light radius of approximately half an order of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: We present JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy observations of the z=5.89 quasar NDWFS J1425+3254 from 0.6-5.3 microns, covering the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical at spectral resolution R~100. The quasar has a black hole mass of $M_{\rm{BH}}=(1.4\substack{+3.1\\-1.0})\times10^9 M_\odot$ and an Eddington ratio $L_{\rm{Bol}}/L_{\rm{Edd}}=0.3\substack{+0.6\\-0.2}$, as implied from the broad Balmer H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines. The quasar host has significant ongoing obscured star formation, as well as a quasar-driven outflow with velocity $6050\substack{+460\\-630}$ km/s and ionised outflow rate of $1650\substack{+130\\-1230}M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$, possibly one of the most extreme outflows in the early Universe. The data also reveal that two companion galaxies are merging with the quasar host. The north-eastern companion galaxy is relatively old and very massive, with luminosity-weighted stellar age $65\substack{+9\\-4}$ Myr, stellar mass $(3.6\substack{+0.6\\-0.3})\times10^{11} M_\odot$, and star-formation rate (SFR) ~15-30 $M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$. A bridge of gas connects this companion galaxy and the host, confirming their ongoing interaction. A second merger is occurring between the quasar host and a much younger companion galaxy to the south, with stellar age $6.7\pm1.8$ Myr, stellar mass $(1.9\pm0.4)\times10^{10} M_\odot$, and SFR ~40-65 $M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$. There is also another galaxy in the field that is likely in the foreground at z=1.135, that could be gravitationally lensing the quasar with magnification $1&lt;\mu&lt;2$, and so &lt;0.75 mag. Overall, the system is a "train-wreck" merger of three galaxies, with star formation and extreme quasar activity that were likely triggered by these ongoing interactions.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Winds Drive Cold Gas Outflows on Kiloparsec Scales in Reionization-Era Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are thought to influence the evolution of their host galaxies through multi-phase feedback driven by powerful nuclear outflows. Although this mechanism is central to theoretical models of SMBH-galaxy co-evolution across cosmic time, direct observational evidence connecting nuclear winds to large-scale cold gas outflows remains limited, especially in the early universe. Here we report statistical evidence for such a connection in a sample of luminous quasars at $z \sim 5.5$. We compare stacked [C\,{\sc ii}] 158 $\mu$m emission profiles from ALMA observations, which trace galactic-scale neutral gas, for quasars with and without broad absorption lines (BALs) that indicate powerful nuclear winds on sub-kiloparsec scales. The BAL quasar stack exhibits a significant (S/N = 4.45) blueshifted broad component in the [C\,{\sc ii}] line profile, with a velocity offset of $\Delta v_{\rm b} = -2.1 \times 10^2\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$ and a full width at half maximum of $1.18 \times 10^3\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$, whereas the non-BAL stack shows no such feature. We estimate that a few percent to one-quarter of the nuclear wind energy may be transferred to cold neutral gas on kiloparsec scales. These results suggest that BAL winds can couple to the host galaxy's interstellar medium, providing empirical support for models of multi-phase AGN feedback. This mechanism may also contribute to the observed divers ity in $M_{\rm BH}/M_*$ among luminous quasars recently identified by JWST.</description>

      <title>The response of warm absorbers to the variations in the ionizing continuum in the active galaxy NGC 4051</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a time-resolved X-ray spectral analysis of the warm absorbers in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4051, which has an active galactic nucleus (AGN), using observations from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). Despite NICER's moderate spectral resolution, its high-cadence monitoring allows us to probe the response of the ionized outflows, also known as warm absorbers, on timescales of approximately 5500 seconds. We detect two distinct components of ionized absorbers in this source. The ionization parameter of the low-ionization warm absorber component tracks changes in the ionizing flux with no measurable time lag. This rapid response implies photoionization equilibrium and places a lower limit on the electron density of about 9 x 10^6 cm^-3, based on the most abundant ionic species, O VII. The absorber is located within approximately 0.02 parsecs of the central source, consistent with an origin in the inner regions of the active nucleus. In contrast, the high-ionization absorber remains consistently under-ionized relative to equilibrium predictions. This suggests that it may be collisional plasma, as also indicated in previous studies. These results demonstrate that time-resolved spectroscopy, even with moderate-resolution instruments, can provide valuable constraints on the density and location of warm absorbers in AGN. As a potential contributor to AGN feedback, the study of these ionized outflows is crucial to understanding AGN--host galaxy interactions.</description>

      <title>$R_{\rm e}$. II. Understanding the IC 3475 galaxy type, including ultra-diffuse galaxy, structural scaling relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is explained why relatively gas-poor ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), a subset of IC 3475 galaxy types, do not have unexpectedly large sizes but large sizes that are in line with expectations from the curved size-luminosity relation defined by brighter early-type galaxies (ETGs). These UDGs extend the faint end of the (absolute magnitude, $\mathfrak{M}$)-log(S\'ersic index, $n$) and $\mathfrak{M}$-(central surface brightness, $\mu_{\rm 0}$) relations defined by all ETGs, leading to the large effective half-light radii, $R_{\rm e}$, in these UDGs. It is detailed how the scatter in $\mu_{\rm 0}$, at a given $\mathfrak{M}$, relates to variations in the galaxies' values of $n$ and effective surface brightness, $\mu_{\rm e}$. These variations map into changes in $R_{\rm e}$ and produce the scatter about the $\mathfrak{M}$-$R_{\rm e}$ relation at fixed $\mathfrak{M}$. Similarly, the scatter in $\mathfrak{M}$, at fixed $\mu_{\rm 0}$ and $n$, can be mapped into changes in $R_{\rm e}$. The suggestion that there may be two types of relatively gas-poor UDGs appears ill-founded, arising from the scatter about the $\mathfrak{M}$-$\mu_{\rm 0}$ relation. The increased scatter about the faint end of the $\mathfrak{M}$-$R_{\rm e}$ relation and the smaller scatter about $\mathfrak{M}$-(isophotal radii, $R_{\rm iso}$) relations are explained. Artificial and potentially misleading size-luminosity relations for UDGs are also addressed. Finally, expected trends with dynamical mass, and evolutionary pathways towards relatively gas-rich galaxies, are briefly discussed. Hopefully, the understanding presented here will prove helpful for interpreting the many low surface brightness galaxies that the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will detect.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Milky Way's star formation at cosmic noon with high proper-motion stars: A precursor to the merger-driven starburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evidence suggests that the Milky Way (MW) underwent a major collision with the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE) dwarf galaxy around cosmic noon. While GSE has since been fully disrupted, it brought in ex situ stars and dynamically heated in situ stars into the halo. In addition, the gas-rich merger may have triggered a burst of in situ star formation, potentially giving rise to a chemically distinct stellar component. We investigated the region of phase space where stars formed during the GSE merger likely reside, and retain distinct chemical and dynamical signatures. Building on our previous investigation of metallicity ([Fe/H]) and vertical angular momentum ($L_Z$) distributions, we analysed spectroscopic samples from GALAH, APOGEE, SDSS, and LAMOST, combined with Gaia kinematics. We focused on high proper-motion stars as effective tracers of the phase-space volume likely influenced by the GSE merger. To correct for selection effects, we incorporated metallicity estimates derived from SDSS and SMSS photometry. Our analysis reveals that low-$\alpha$ stars with GSE-like kinematics exhibit bimodality in [Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe] at $-1.0 \lesssim {\rm [Fe/H]} \lesssim -0.4$. One group follows the low light-element abundances of GSE stars, while another exhibits enhanced values. These low-$\alpha$, high-Na stars have eccentric orbits but are more confined to the inner MW. Eos overlaps with a high-eccentricity subset of these stars, implying that it constitutes a smaller structure nested within the broader population. After correcting for sampling biases, we estimated a population ratio of approximately 1:10 between the low-$\alpha$, high-Na stars and the GSE debris. These results suggest that the low-$\alpha$, high-Na stars formed in a compact region, likely fuelled by gas from the GSE progenitor, analogous to clumpy star-forming clouds seen in high-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Evolutions in Globular Clusters and Dwarf Galaxies: Conduction Fluid Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new two-fluid conduction scheme to simulate the evolution of an isolated, self-gravitating, equilibrium cluster of stars and collisionless dark matter on secular (gravothermal) timescales. We integrate the equations in Lagrangian coordinates via a second-order, semi-implicit algorithm, which is unconditionally stable when the mass of the lighter species is much less than that of the heavier species. The method can be straightforwardly generalized to handle a multi-species system with a population of stars or components beyond collisionless dark matter and stars. We apply the method to simulate the dynamical evolution of stellar-dark matter systems, exploring the consequences of mass segregation and gravothermal core collapse, and assessing those effects for observed globular clusters and dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume.</description>

      <title>The vertical structure of the stellar disk in NGC 551</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We self-consistently determine the 3D density distribution of NGC 551's stellar disk and study observational signatures of two-component stellar disks. Assuming baryonic disks are in hydrostatic equilibrium, we solved the Poisson-Boltzmann equation to estimate 3D density distribution. We used integral-field spectroscopic observations to estimate stellar velocity dispersion and built a 3D dynamical model using these density solutions and the observed rotation curve. We generated simulated surface brightness maps and compared them with observations to verify modeling consistency. The dynamical model was inclined to 90{\deg} to produce an edge-on surface density map, which we investigated by fitting different 2D functions and plotting vertical cuts in logarithmic scale. We estimated vertical stellar velocity dispersion using an iterative method, obtaining results consistent with the Disk Mass Survey formalism. Through dynamical modeling, we produced moment maps that reasonably matched observations. We examined the simulated edge-on model by taking vertical cuts and decomposing them into multiple Gaussian components. We find that artificial double Gaussian components arise due to line-of-sight integration effects, even for single-component disks. This indicates that decomposing vertical intensity cuts into multiple Gaussian components is unreliable for multicomponent disks. Instead, an up-bending break visible in logarithmic-scale vertical cuts serves as a more reliable indicator for two-component disks. We performed 2D fitting on the edge-on surface density map using the product of a scaled modified Bessel function and $sech^2$ function to estimate structural parameters. These traditional methods systematically underestimate the scale length and flattening ratio. Therefore, we suggest using detailed modeling to accurately deduce stellar disk structural parameters.</description>

      <title>The Potential Impact of Primordial Black Holes on Exoplanet Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The orbits of planetary systems can be deformed from their initial configurations due to close encounters with larger astrophysical bodies. Typical candidates for close encounters are stars and binaries. We explore the prospect that if there is a sizeable population of primordial black holes (PBH) in our galaxy, then these may also impact the orbits of exoplanets. Specifically, in a simplified setting, we study numerically how many planetary systems might have a close encounter with a PBH, and analyze the potential changes to the orbital parameters of systems that undergo PBH flybys.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of 70 $\mu$m Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES). XII. Unanchored Forked Stream in the Propagating Path of a Protostellar Outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Outflows are key indicators of ongoing star formation. We report the discovery of an unanchored forked stream within the propagating path of an extremely young protostellar outflow in the 70 $\mu$m-dark clump G34.74-0.12, based on ALMA 1.3 mm observations with an angular resolution of 1''.6 (~ 5000 au). This outflow originate from a 9.7 $M_{\odot}$ core, exhibits a fork-shaped stream structure in its red-shifted lobe, which is traced by CO (2-1), SiO (5-4), and H$_2$CO (3$_{0,3}$-2$_{0,2}$). It has a momentum of 13 $M_{\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$, an energy of 107 $M_{\odot}$ km$^{2}$ s$^{-2}$, and a dynamical timescale of ~10$^{4}$ yr. Significantly, the enhanced relative abundances of SiO, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$OH with respect to CO, along with the increased temperature at the forked point, indicate a collisional origin. The forked point does not coincide with any dust continuum core &gt; 0.1 $M_{\odot}$. Moreover, CO (2-1) emission also traces three other outflows in this region, characterized by their masses (0.40, 0.02 and 0.15 $M_{\odot}$) and momenta (5.2, 0.2, 1.8 $M_{\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$), as part of the ALMA Survey of 70 $\mu$m dark High-mass clumps in Early Stages (ASHES) project. All the newly discovered morphological and kinematic features associated with these extremely young protostellar outflows (with timescales of 10$^3$ - 10$^4$ years) suggest that the initial stages of star formation are more complicated than previously understood.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots from Small-Scale Primordial Black Hole Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have identified a class of compact galaxies at high redshifts ($4 \lesssim z \lesssim 11$), dubbed "little red dots" (LRDs). The supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of $10^{5-8}{\rm\,M}_{\odot}$ in LRDs favor a heavy-seed origin. We propose a mechanism for their formation: Clusters of primordial black holes, formed through long-short mode coupling on small scales in the early Universe, undergo sequential mergers over extended timescales. This mechanism can evade cosmic microwave background distortions and result in heavy-seed SMBHs via runaway mergers. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to solve the Smoluchowski coagulation equation and determine the runaway merging timescale. The resulting stochastic gravitational wave background offers a distinct signature of this process, and the forming SMBHs can be highly spinning at their formation due to the spin residual of the cluster from tidal fields. This mechanism may explain the rapidly spinning SMBHs in LRDs under the assumption of obscured active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Imaging-spectroscopy diagnosis of the giant sloshing spiral in the Virgo cluster with the Einstein Probe Follow-up X-ray Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We performed deep X-ray observations of the Virgo cluster using the Einstein Probe Follow-up X-ray Telescope (EP-FXT) with a total exposure of 295 ks. Leveraging the large field of view (FoV) and low particle background of EP-FXT, the image reveals a giant spiral feature connecting the cold fronts in the northwest and southeast, forming a coherent structure consistent with earlier results from XMM-Newton and Suzaku. We also present two-dimensional maps of temperature, metallicity, and entropy across the Virgo Cluster, covering a FoV of approximately 28.5 arcmin. These maps clearly show a spiral structure with high density, low temperature, high metallicity, and low entropy. The results support a scenario where the spiral morphology arises from gas sloshing driven by a minor merger. Additionally, EP-FXT temperature measurements agree well with XMM-Newton data within uncertainties.</description>
