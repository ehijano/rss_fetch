      <title>Does the Forced Van der Pol Oscillator Exhibit Irregular Behavior?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear oscillators are commonly encountered in a wide range of physical and engineering systems, exhibiting rich and complex dynamics. Among these, the Van der Pol oscillator is well known for its self-sustained limit cycle behavior. However, when subjected to external sinusoidal forcing, its dynamics can deviate significantly from this regular behavior. This study explores the emergence of complex dynamical regimes in the sinusoidally forced Van der Pol oscillator, focusing on identifying the transition from regular to aperiodic behavior. The primary research objective is to determine whether the system exhibits irregular dynamics such as quasi-periodicity or chaos and to identify the conditions under which these arise. We hypothesize that varying the amplitude and frequency ratio of the external forcing relative to the natural frequency of the oscillator can induce a spectrum of dynamical responses, including higher-order periodic and chaotic regimes. We perform numerical simulations using Python and examine the behavior of the system through time series analysis, phase portraits, and bifurcation diagrams to test this. The results demonstrate that as the forcing amplitude and frequency ratio are varied, the system undergoes transitions through periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic states. These findings highlight the complex nonlinear interactions in forced oscillatory systems and have significant implications for applications in biological rhythms, electronic circuits, and astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Modeling extreme events and intermittency in turbulent diffusion with a mean gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of passive tracer transport in turbulent flows with a mean gradient, emphasizing tracer intermittency and extreme events. An analytically tractable model is developed, coupling zonal and shear velocity components with both linear and nonlinear stochastic dynamics. Formulating the model in Fourier space, a simple explicit solution for the tracer invariant statistics is derived. Through this model we identify the resonance condition responsible for non-Gaussian behavior and bursts in the tracer. Resonant conditions, that lead to a peak in the tracer variance, occur when the zonal flow and the shear flow phase speeds are equivalent. Numerical experiments across a range of regimes, including different energy spectra and zonal flow models, are performed to validate these findings and demonstrate how the velocity field and stochasticity determines tracer extremes. These results provide additional insight into the mechanisms underlying turbulent tracer transport, with implications for uncertainty quantification and data assimilation in geophysical and environmental applications.</description>

      <title>Nonadaptive Output Regulation of Second-Order Nonlinear Uncertain Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the robust output regulation problem of second-order nonlinear uncertain systems with an unknown exosystem. Instead of the adaptive control approach, this paper resorts to a robust control methodology to solve the problem and thus avoid the bursting phenomenon. In particular, this paper constructs generic internal models for the steady-state state and input variables of the system. By introducing a coordinate transformation, this paper converts the robust output regulation problem into a nonadaptive stabilization problem of an augmented system composed of the second-order nonlinear uncertain system and the generic internal models. Then, we design the stabilization control law and construct a strict Lyapunov function that guarantees the robustness with respect to unmodeled disturbances. The analysis shows that the output zeroing manifold of the augmented system can be made attractive by the proposed nonadaptive control law, which solves the robust output regulation problem. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed nonadaptive internal model approach by its application to the control of the Duffing system.</description>

      <title>Transitions to Intermittent Chaos in Quorum Sensing Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study analyses the dynamical consequences of heterogeneous temporal delays within a quorum sensing-inspired (QS-inspired) system, specifically addressing the differential response kinetics of two sub-populations to signalling molecules. A nonlinear delay differential equation (DDE) model, predicated upon an activator-inhibitor framework, is formulated to represent the interspecies interactions. Key analytical techniques, including the derivation of the pseudo-characteristic polynomial and the determination of Hopf bifurcation criteria, are employed to investigate the stability properties of steady-state solutions. The analysis reveals the critical role of multiple, dissimilar delays in modulating system dynamics and inducing bifurcations. Numerical simulations, conducted in conjunction with analytical results, reveal the emergence of periodic self-sustained oscillations and intermittent chaotic behaviour. These observations emphasise the intricate relationship between temporal heterogeneity and the stability landscape of systems exhibiting QS-inspired dynamics. This interplay highlights the capacity for temporal variations to induce complex dynamical transitions within such systems. These findings assist to the comprehension of temporal dynamics within these and related systems, and may contribute to the development of strategies aimed at modulating intercellular communication and engineering synthetic biological systems with temporal control.</description>
