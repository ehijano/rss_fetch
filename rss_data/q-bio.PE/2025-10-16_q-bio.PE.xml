      <title>Evolvable Chemotons: Toward the Integration of Autonomy and Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we provide a relatively simple simulation framework for constructing artificial life (ALife) with both autonomous and evolutionary aspects by extending chemoton model. While the original chemoton incorporates metabolism, membrane, and genetic templates, it lacks a mechanism for phenotypic variation, preventing true evolutionary dynamics. To address this, we introduced a genotype-phenotype coupling by linking templates to a second autocatalytic cycle, enabling mutations to affect phenotype and be subject to selection. Using a genetic algorithm, we simulated populations of chemotons over generations. Results showed that chemotons without access to the new cycle remained in a stable but complexity-limited regime, while lineages acquiring the additional metabolic set evolved longer templates. These findings demonstrate that even simple replicator systems can achieve primitive evolvability, highlighting structural thresholds and rare innovations as key drivers. Our framework provides a tractable model for exploring autonomy and evolution in ALife.</description>

      <title>Viral population dynamics at the cellular level, considering the replication cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viruses are microscopic infectious agents that require a host cell for replication. Viral replication occurs in several stages, and the completion time for each stage varies due to differences in the cellular environment. Thus, the time to complete each stage in viral replication is a random variable. However, no analytic expression exists for the viral population at the cellular level when the completion time for each process constituting viral replication is a random variable. This paper presents a simplified model of viral replication, treating each stage as a renewal process with independently and identically distributed completion times. Using the proposed model, we derive an analytical formula for viral populations at the cellular level, based on viewing viral replication as a birth-death process. The mean viral count is expressed via probability density functions representing the completion time for each step in the replication process. This work validates the results with stochastic simulations. This study provides a new quantitative framework for understanding viral infection dynamics.</description>

      <title>Cumulants, Moments and Selection: The Connection Between Evolution and Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cumulants and moments are closely related to the basic mathematics of continuous and discrete selection (respectively). These relationships generalize Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection and also make clear some of its limitation. The relationship between cumulants and continuous selection is especially intuitive and also provides an alternative way to understand cumulants. We show that a similarly simple relationship exists between moments and discrete selection. In more complex scenarios, we show that thinking of selection over discrete generations has significant advantages. For a simple mutation model, we find exact solutions for the equilibrium moments of the fitness distribution. These solutions are surprisingly simple and have some interesting implications including: a necessary and sufficient condition for mutation selection balance, a very simple formula for mean fitness and the fact that the shape of the equilibrium fitness distribution is determined solely by mutation (whereas the scale is determined by the starting fitness distribution).</description>

      <title>Propagation speed of traveling waves for diffusive Lotka-Volterra system with strong competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the propagation speed of bistable traveling waves in the classical two-component diffusive Lotka-Volterra system under strong competition. From an ecological perspective, the sign of the propagation speed determines the long-term outcome of competition between two species and thus plays a central role in predicting the success or failure of invasion of an alien species into habitats occupied by a native species. Using comparison arguments, we establish sufficient conditions determining the sign of the propagation speed, which refine previously known results. In particular, we show that in the symmetric case, where the two species differ only in their diffusion rates, the faster diffuser prevails over a substantially broader parameter range than previously established. Moreover, we demonstrate that when the interspecific competition coefficients differ significantly, the outcome of competition cannot be reversed by adjusting diffusion or growth rates. These findings provide a rigorous theoretical framework for analyzing invasion dynamics, offering sharper mathematical criteria for invasion success or failure.</description>

      <title>A Human-Vector Susceptible--Infected--Susceptible Model for Analyzing and Controlling the Spread of Vector-Borne Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an epidemic model for the spread of vector-borne diseases. The model, which is built extending the classical susceptible-infected-susceptible model, accounts for two populations -- humans and vectors -- and for cross-contagion between the two species, whereby humans become infected upon interaction with carrier vectors, and vectors become carriers after interaction with infected humans. We formulate the model as a system of ordinary differential equations and leverage monotone systems theory to rigorously characterize the epidemic dynamics. Specifically, we characterize the global asymptotic behavior of the disease, determining conditions for quick eradication of the disease (i.e., for which all trajectories converge to a disease-free equilibrium), or convergence to a (unique) endemic equilibrium. Then, we incorporate two control actions: namely, vector control and incentives to adopt protection measures. Using the derived mathematical tools, we assess the impact of these two control actions and determine the optimal control policy.</description>

      <title>Two Issues in Modelling Fish Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fish migration is a dynamic phenomenon observed in many surface water bodies on the earth, while its understanding is still insufficient. Particularly, the biological mechanism behind fish migration is not fully understood. Moreover, its observation is often conducted visually and hence manually, raising questions of accuracy and interpretation of the data sampled. We address the two issues, mechanism and observation, of fish migration based on a recently developed mathematical model. The results obtained in this short paper show that fish migration can be characterized through a minimization principle and evaluate the error of its manual observations. The minimization principle we hypothesize is an optimal control problem where the migrating fish population dynamically changes its size and fluctuation. We numerically investigate alternating and intensive observation schemes as case studies, demonstrating that in some realistic conditions the estimate of total fish count is not reliable. We believe that this paper contributes to a deeper understanding of fish migration.</description>

      <title>A contribution to discern the true impact of covid-19 on human mortality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The years 2020 and 2021 were characterized by the COVID-19 pandemic. The true impact of the pandemic on populations' health and life still has to be fully discerned. The main objective of this work is to discern the true impact of COVID-19 pandemic in the EU countries. The mortality trends are considered and modelled. The excess mortality attributable to COVID-19, on a yearly basis, is estimated via a novel strategy that combines datasets from different official sources. Considering demographic and geographic factors, new indices are also formulated, ranking the pandemic impact on EU countries, and new sociopolitical/economic reflections. This work, which is also in line with the conclusions of previously published authoritative studies on excess mortality, represents an original methodology that, in a timely manner, can be implemented in the services of public decision makers for future emerging needs.</description>

      <title>A data-driven analysis of the impact of non-compliant individuals on epidemic diffusion in urban settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Individuals who do not comply with public health safety measures pose a significant challenge to effective epidemic control, as their risky behaviours can undermine public health interventions. This is particularly relevant in urban environments because of their high population density and complex social interactions. In this study, we employ detailed contact networks, built using a data-driven approach, to examine the impact of non-compliant individuals on epidemic dynamics in three major Italian cities: Torino, Milano, and Palermo. We use a heterogeneous extension of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model that distinguishes between ordinary and non-compliant individuals, who are more infectious and/or more susceptible. By combining electoral data with recent findings on vaccine hesitancy, we obtain spatially heterogeneous distributions of non-compliance. Epidemic simulations demonstrate that even a small proportion of non-compliant individuals in the population can substantially increase the number of infections and accelerate the timing of their peak. Furthermore, the impact of non-compliance is greatest when disease transmission rates are moderate. Including the heterogeneous, data-driven distribution of non-compliance in the simulations results in infection hotspots forming with varying intensity according to the disease transmission rate. Overall, these findings emphasise the importance of monitoring behavioural compliance and tailoring public health interventions to address localised risks.</description>
