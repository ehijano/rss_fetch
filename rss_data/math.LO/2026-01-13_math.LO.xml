      <title>G\"odel-Dummett and $\mathsf{BD_2}$: Linearity and Depth-Two Branching in Kripke Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the semantic relationship between G\"odel-Dummett logic $\mathsf{GL}$ and bounded-depth-2 logic $\mathsf{BD_2}$, two well-known intermediate logics. While $\mathsf{GL}$ imposes linearity on Kripke frames, $\mathsf{BD_2}$ bounds their depth to two. We prove these logics are incomparable (neither contains the other) through minimal frame conditions. Notably, their combination $\mathsf{GL+BD_2}$ collapses to the logic of one or two world frames, bringing it remarkably close to classical logic. This illustrates how controlling breadth and depth in intuitionistic semantics leads to mutually exclusive structural constraints. Finally, we give a conceptual and philosophical interpretation of the previous results.

      <title>Cardinal invariants of idealized Miller null sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an extensive study of the $\mathscr{I}$-Miller null ideals $M_\mathscr{I}$, $\sigma$-ideals on the Baire space parametrized by ideals $\mathscr{I}$ on countable sets. These $\sigma$-ideals are associated to the idealized versions of Miller forcing in the same way that the meager ideal is associated to Cohen forcing. We compute the cardinal invariants of $M_\mathscr{I}$ for typical examples of Borel ideals $\mathscr{I}$ and show that Cicho\'{n}'s Maximum can be extended by adding the uniformity and covering numbers of $M_\mathscr{I}$ for different ideals $\mathscr{I}$.</description>

      <title>Low-like basis theorems for Ramsey's theorem for pairs in first-order arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an $\ll^2$-solution (also known as a weakly low solution) to ${\mathrm{D}^2}$ within ${\mathrm{B}\Sigma^0_{3}}$ and prove the $\ll^2$-basis theorem for $\mathrm{RT}^2$ over ${\mathrm{B}\Sigma^0_{3}}$. The $\ll^2$-basis theorem is a variant of the low basis theorem, which has recently received focus in the context of the first-order part of Ramsey type theorems. For the construction, we use Mathias forcing in an effectively coded $\omega$-model of $\mathsf{WKL_0}$ to ensure sufficient computability under the system with weaker induction. Using a similar method, we also show the $\ll^2$-basis theorem for $\mathrm{RT}^2_2$ and $\mathrm{EM}_{&lt;\infty}$, a version of Erd\H{o}s-Moser principle, within $\mathrm{I}\Sigma^0_{2}$. These results provide simpler proofs of known results on the $\Pi^1_1$-conservativities of $\mathrm{RT}^2, \mathrm{RT}^2_2$ and $\mathrm{EM}_{&lt;\infty}$ as corollaries.</description>

      <title>Preservation of some topological properties under forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We add to the theory of preservation of topological properties under forcing. In particular, we answer a question of Gilton and Holshouser in a strong sense, showing that if player II has a winning strategy in the strong countable fan tightness game of a space at a point, then this continues to hold in every set forcing extension of the universe. The same is also true for the Rothberger game, but not for the countable fan tightness or Menger games.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity and a Taylor approximation theorem for transseries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the composition of omega-series by surreal numbers, or more generally by elements of any confluent field of transseries, is monotonic in its second argument. In particular, omega-series and LE-series interpreted as functions on positive infinite omega-series, or respectively LE-series, have the intermediate value property. We also deduce a Taylor approximation theorem for omega-series with maximal radius of validity.</description>

      <title>A Note on Pseudofinite W*-Probability Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce pseudofinite W*-probability spaces. These are W*-probability spaces that are elementarily equivalent to Ocneanu ultraproducts of finite-dimensional von Neumann algebras equipped with arbitrary faithful normal states. We are particularly interested in the case where these finite-dimensional von Neumann algebras are full matrix algebras: the pseudofinite factors. We show that these are indeed factors. We see as a consequence that pseudofinite factors are never of type $\mathrm{III}_0$. Mimicking the construction of the Powers factors, we give explicit families of examples of matrix algebra ultraproducts that are $\mathrm{III}_\lambda$ factors for $\lambda \in (0,1]$. We show that these examples share their universal theories with the corresponding Powers factor and thus have uncomputable universal theories. Finally, we show that pseudofinite factors are full. This generalizes a theorem of Farah-Hart-Sherman which shows that pseudofinite tracial factors do not have property $\Gamma$. It has the consequence that hyperfinite factors of type $\mathrm{III}$ (the Powers factors) are never pseudofinite. Our proofs combine operator algebraic insights with routine continuous logic syntactic arguments: using \L os' theorem to prove that certain sentences which are true for all matrix algebras are inherited by their ultraproducts.</description>

      <title>Path Types in Algebraic Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new approach to the semantics of identity types in intensional Martin-L\"of type theory is proposed, assuming only a category with finite limits and an interval. The specification of \emph{extensional} identity types in the original presentation of natural models paralleled that of the other type formers $\Sigma$ and $\Pi$, but the treatment of the \emph{intensional} case there was less uniform. It was later reformulated to an account based on polynomials; here a further improvement in the style of the other type formers is achieved by employing an interval, in order to give a single pullback specification of a model with \emph{path types}. The interval is also used to specify a (Hurewicz) fibration structure on the universe of the model. It is shown that the combination of these two conditions suffices to model the intensional identity rules, assuming only finite limits. The addition of an interval also relates the current treatment to that of cubical type theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12771v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study various universal-existential fragments of first-order theories of fields, in particular of function fields and of equicharacteristic henselian valued fields. For example we discuss to what extent the theory of a field k determines the universal-existential theories of the rational function field over k and of the field of Laurent series over k, and we find various many-one reductions between such fragments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper is an extensive and systematic study of cardinal invariants we call slalom numbers, describing the combinatorics of sequences of sets of natural numbers. Our general approach, based on relational systems, covers many such cardinal characteristics, including localization and anti-localization cardinals. We show that most of the slalom numbers are connected to topological selection principles, in particular, we obtain the representation of the uniformity of meager and the cofinality of measure. Considering instances of slalom numbers parametrized by ideals on natural numbers, we focus on monotonicity properties with respect to ideal orderings and computational formulas for the disjoint sum of ideals. Hence, we get such formulas for several pseudo-intersection numbers as well as for the bounding and dominating numbers parametrized with ideals. Based on the effect of adding a Cohen real, we get many consistent constellations of different values of slalom numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a well-known result that, after adding one Cohen real, the transcendence degree of the reals over the ground-model reals is continuum. We extend this result for a set $X$ of finitely many Cohen reals, by showing that, in the forcing extension, the transcendence degree of the reals over a combination of the reals in the extension given by each proper subset of $X$ is also maximal. This answers a question of Kanovei and Schindler.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00443v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of the definable rank of an ordered field, ordered abelian group and ordered set, respectively. We study the relation between the definable rank of an ordered field and the definable rank of the value group of its natural valuation. Similarly, we compare the definable rank of an ordered abelian group to that of its value set with respect to the natural valuation. We describe the definable rank on the group-level by characterizing the definable convex subgroups. We also give a detailed comparison of field- and group-level, in particular for ordered fields with henselian natural valuation. We investigate definability of final segments in ordered sets and introduce definable condensation as a tool for further study.</description>

      <title>Iterating PP-packages without Choice: A Cohen symmetric seed and a localization framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Partition Principle $\mathsf{PP}$ asserts that whenever there is a surjection $A\twoheadrightarrow B$, there is an injection $B\hookrightarrow A$. Russell conjectured in 1906 that $\mathsf{PP}$ is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice $\mathsf{AC}$; while $\mathsf{AC}\Rightarrow \mathsf{PP}$ is immediate, the converse has remained open. We show that $\mathsf{PP}$ does not imply $\mathsf{AC}$ by constructing a transitive model of $\mathsf{ZF}+\mathsf{DC}+\mathsf{PP}+\neg\mathsf{AC}$.
  Starting from a Cohen symmetric model $\mathcal{N}$ of $\mathrm{Add}(\omega,\omega_1)$ built with a countable-support symmetry filter, we fix parameters $S:=A^\omega$ and $T:=\mathcal{P}(S)$ and perform a class-length countable-support symmetric iteration. At successor stages we use orbit-symmetrized packages that split targeted surjections, yielding $\mathsf{PP}\!\restriction T$ and $\mathsf{AC}_{\mathsf{WO}}$, while preserving $\mathsf{DC}$ and ensuring that $A$ remains non-well-orderable. A diagonal-cancellation/diagonal-lift infrastructure supplies a proper $\omega_1$-complete normal filter at limit stages. Finally, Ryan--Smith localization shows that under $\mathsf{SVC}^+(T)$, $\mathsf{PP}$ is equivalent to $\mathsf{PP}\!\restriction T \wedge \mathsf{AC}_{\mathsf{WO}}$, so the final model satisfies $\mathsf{PP}$ but not $\mathsf{AC}$.</description>

      <title>Hereditarily indecomposable continua as generic mathematical structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06886v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the pseudo-arc as well as P-adic pseudo-solenoids (for a set of primes P) as generic structures, arising from a natural game in which two players alternate in building an inverse sequence of surjections. The second player wins if the limit of this sequence is homeomorphic to a concrete (fixed in advance) space, called generic whenever the second player has a winning strategy.
  For this purpose, we develop a new robust approximate Fra\"iss\'e theory in the context of MU-categories, a generalization of metric-enriched categories, suitable for working directly with continuous maps between metrizable compacta. Our framework extends both the classical and projective Fra\"iss\'e theories.
  We reprove the Fra\"iss\'e-theoretic characterization of the pseudo-arc and we realize every P-adic pseudo-solenoid as a Fra\"iss\'e limit of a suitable category of continuous surjections on the circle. Moreover, we show that, when playing the game with continuous surjections between non-degenerate Peano continua, the pseudo-arc is always generic, while the universal pseudo-solenoid is generic over all surjections between circle-like continua. This gives a complete classification of generic continua over full non-trivial subcategories of connected polyhedra with continuous surjections.</description>

      <title>The classification of homomorphism homogeneous oriented graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The modern theory of homogeneous structures begins with the work of Roland Fra\"iss\'e. The theory developed in the last seventy years is placed in the border area between combinatorics, model theory, algebra, and analysis. We turn our attention to its combinatorial pillar, namely, the work on the classification of structures for given homogeneity types, and focus onto the homomorphism homogeneous ones, introduced in 2006 by Cameron and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il. An oriented graph is called homomorphism homogeneous if every homomorphism between finite induced subgraphs extends to an endomorphism. In this paper we present a complete classification of the countable homomorphism homogeneous oriented graphs.</description>

      <title>SAD Neural Networks: Divergent Gradient Flows and Asymptotic Optimality via o-minimal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gradient flows for loss landscapes of fully connected feedforward neural networks with commonly used continuously differentiable activation functions such as the logistic, hyperbolic tangent, softplus or GELU function. We prove that the gradient flow either converges to a critical point or diverges to infinity while the loss converges to an asymptotic critical value. Moreover, we prove the existence of a threshold $\varepsilon&gt;0$ such that the loss value of any gradient flow initialized at most $\varepsilon$ above the optimal level converges to it. For polynomial target functions and sufficiently big architecture and data set, we prove that the optimal loss value is zero and can only be realized asymptotically. From this setting, we deduce our main result that any gradient flow with sufficiently good initialization diverges to infinity. Our proof heavily relies on the geometry of o-minimal structures. We confirm these theoretical findings with numerical experiments and extend our investigation to more realistic scenarios, where we observe an analogous behavior.</description>
