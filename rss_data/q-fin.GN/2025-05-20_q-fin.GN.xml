      <title>The Stablecoin Discount: Evidence of Tether's U.S. Treasury Bill Market Share in Lowering Yields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stablecoins represent a critical bridge between cryptocurrency and traditional finance, with Tether (USDT) dominating the sector as the largest stablecoin by market capitalization. By Q1 2025, Tether directly held approximately $98.5 billion in U.S. Treasury bills, representing 1.6% of all outstanding Treasury bills, making it one of the largest non-sovereign buyers in this crucial asset class, on par with nation-state-level investors. This paper investigates how Tether's market share of U.S. Treasury bills influences corresponding yields. The baseline semi-log time trend model finds that a 1% increase in Tether's market share is associated with a 1-month yield reduction of 3.8%, corresponding to 14-16 basis points. However, threshold regression analysis reveals a critical market share threshold of 0.973%, above which the yield impact intensifies significantly. In this high regime, a 1% market share increase reduces 1-month yields by 6.3%. At the end of Q1 2025, Tether's market share placed it firmly within this high-impact regime, reducing 1-month yields by around 24 basis points relative to a counterfactual. In absolute terms, Tether's demand for Treasury Bills equates to roughly $15 billion in annual interest savings for the U.S. government. Aligning with theories of liquidity saturation and nonlinear price impact, these results highlight that stablecoin demand can reduce sovereign funding costs and provide a potential buffer against market shocks.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Affine GARCH with Heavy Tails: A Unified Framework for Portfolio Optimization and Option Valuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops and estimates a multivariate affine GARCH(1,1) model with Normal Inverse Gaussian innovations that captures time-varying volatility, heavy tails, and dynamic correlation across asset returns. We generalize the Heston-Nandi framework to a multivariate setting and apply it to 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks. The model jointly supports three core financial applications: dynamic portfolio optimization, wealth path simulation, and option pricing. Closed-form solutions are derived for a Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) investor's intertemporal asset allocation, and we implement a forward-looking risk-adjusted performance comparison against Merton-style constant strategies. Using the model's conditional volatilities, we also construct implied volatility surfaces for European options, capturing skew and smile features. Empirically, we document substantial wealth-equivalent utility losses from ignoring time-varying correlation and tail risk. These findings underscore the value of a unified econometric framework for analyzing joint asset dynamics and for managing portfolio and derivative exposures under non-Gaussian risks.</description>

      <title>Vague Knowledge: Evidence from Analyst Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: People in the real world often possess vague knowledge of future payoffs, for which quantification is not feasible or desirable. We argue that language, with differing ability to convey vague information, plays an important but less known-role in subjective expectations. Empirically, we find that in their reports, analysts include useful information in linguistic expressions but not numerical forecasts. Specifically, the textual tone of analyst reports has predictive power for forecast errors and subsequent revisions in numerical forecasts, and this relation becomes stronger when analyst's language is vaguer, when uncertainty is higher, and when analysts are busier. Overall, our theory and evidence suggest that some useful information is vaguely known and only communicated through language.</description>

      <title>Characterizing asymmetric and bimodal long-term financial return distributions through quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of logarithmic return distributions defined over large time scales is crucial for understanding the long-term dynamics of asset price movements. For large time scales of the order of two trading years, the anticipated Gaussian behavior of the returns often does not emerge, and their distributions often exhibit a high level of asymmetry and bimodality. These features are inadequately captured by the majority of classical models to address financial time series and return distributions. In the presented analysis, we use a model based on the discrete-time quantum walk to characterize the observed asymmetry and bimodality. The quantum walk distinguishes itself from a classical diffusion process by the occurrence of interference effects, which allows for the generation of bimodal and asymmetric probability distributions. By capturing the broader trends and patterns that emerge over extended periods, this analysis complements traditional short-term models and offers opportunities to more accurately describe the probabilistic structure underlying long-term financial decisions.</description>
