      <title>Fractional Quantum Hall Wedding Cakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the coexistence of distinct topologically ordered phases within a single setup. We demonstrate this concept through tensor network simulations of the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard model under a spatially modulated chemical potential. Focusing on cylindrical geometries, we realize regions exhibiting the Laughlin-1/2 phase and its particle-hole conjugate, and confirm their topological character via the local St\v{r}eda's response and Laughlin's flux insertion protocol. Our approach offers a new pathway for experimentally and numerically charting entire phase diagrams within a single system, possibly eliminating the need for independent parameter scans.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic hydrodynamization and quasinormal modes of nonthermal attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonthermal attractors characterize the emergent self-similar evolution of far-from-equilibrium quantum systems, from nuclear collisions to cold-atom experiments. Within the adiabatic hydrodynamization framework, the approach to the nonthermal attractor can be understood as the decay of excited states of an effective Hamiltonian. We use an exactly solvable case of the Boltzmann equation -- the longitudinally expanding overoccupied gluon plasma dominated by small-angle elastic collisions -- to map the eigenmodes in adiabatic hydrodynamization to the quasinormal mode spectrum of the nonthermal attractor. If generalized, this equivalence may be used as a discovery tool for new phenomena in out-of-equilibrium systems. A byproduct of our analysis is the analytic prescaling solutions for systems undergoing strong longitudinal expansion.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy from Correlation Functions of Scalar Fields in and out of Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that odd order R\'enyi entropies $S^{(2q+1)}$ of a system of interacting scalar fields can be calculated as the free energy of $2q+1$ replicas of the system with additional quadratic inter-replica couplings in the subsystem at the time of measurement of the entropy. These couplings replace boundary field matching conditions. This formalism works both in and out of thermal equilibrium, for closed as well as open quantum systems, and provides a general dictionary between measurable correlation functions and entanglement entropy. $S^{(2q+1)}$ can be analytically continued to calculate the von Neumann entropy $S^{\mathrm{vN}}$. We provide an exact formula relating $S^{(2q+1)}$ and $S^{\mathrm{vN}}$ with correlation functions in a non-interacting theory. For interacting theories, we provide rules for constructing all possible Feynman diagrams for $S^{(2q+1)}$. We show that the boundary matching conditions cannot be completely eliminated while calculating R\'enyi entropies of even order due to presence of zero modes in replica space.</description>

      <title>Exploring molecular supersolidity via exact and mean-field theories: single microwave shielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultracold polar molecules with microwave shielding provide a powerful platform for exploring quantum many-body physics with strong, anisotropic interactions. We develop an extended Gross-Pitaevskii framework for bosonic molecules under single microwave shielding, incorporating effective interactions and quantum fluctuations, and benchmark it against exact Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In the regime of positive scattering lengths, our approach captures superfluid, supersolid, and droplet phases with excellent accuracy. We show that elliptic microwave polarization induces direction-dependent superfluidity--absent in cylindrically symmetric systems. A quasi-1D theory reveals that roton softening and instabilities can be controlled via ellipticity, consistent with recent experiments. Furthermore, we find that the nature of the superfluid-to-supersolid transition is strongly influenced by the ellipticity: the transition is sharp at low ellipticity and continuous at higher values. This tunability offers a potential route for low entropy preparation of molecular supersolids via adiabatic ramps. While double shielding is often used experimentally, our results demonstrate that single-shielded molecules already offer rich, controllable behavior, laying the groundwork for future studies with more complex shielding schemes.</description>

      <title>Decaying superfluid turbulence near an anomalous non-thermal fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomalously slow coarsening in a dilute two-dimensional (2d) superfluid -- associated with a non-thermal fixed point in the closed system's universal dynamics and driven by three-vortex collisions which initiate vortex-pair annihilations -- is found to exhibit spatial scaling characteristics of Kraichnan-Kolmogorov turbulence. During a universal interval, when the characteristic length scale related to the inter-defect distance grows as $\ell_\text{v}\sim t^{\,\beta}$, with $\beta\approx1/5$, moments of the superfluid velocity circulation around an area of extent $r$ scale as predicted by classical turbulence theory, $\Gamma^{p}(r)\sim r^{4p/3}$. Intermittency corrections seen for higher values of $p$ are found to be consistent with values measured for fully developed, classical turbulence. Hence, we link the decaying quantum turbulence cascade in a closed superfluid to universal dynamics close to a non-thermal fixed point. The decay exponent $\beta$ clearly deviates from values known for classical systems.</description>

      <title>The Infra-Red Road to Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review work in areas ranging from condensed matter physics to quantum gravity, with the following interconnected questions in mind: (i) what is the nature of the vacuum in condensed matter systems, in quantum field theory, and in classical and quantum gravity; (ii) how do analogies between these systems work, how well do they work, and how useful are they; (iii) what modifications can we make to quantum mechanics to deal with quantum gravity, and (iv) how and why low-energy theories of quantum gravity are, in our view, the right way to make progress in this field. We use many different examples to illustrate our arguments.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03647v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which are understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge-invariant momentum (gauge fields), and position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, $S$-duality, topological invariants, flat bands, and topologically quantized current in the incommensurate regimes. In essence, this work unveils an unexpected link between gravity and gauge fields, opens new avenues for studying analog gravity, e.g., the Unruh effect and universe expansions/contractions, suggests the existence of an $S$-duality of spacetime curvatures, and hints at novel pathways to quantized gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Hawking time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a time crystal based on a quantum black-hole laser, where the genuinely spontaneous character of the symmetry breaking stems from the self-amplification of spontaneous Hawking radiation. The resulting Hawking time crystal (HTC) is characterized by the periodic dependence of the out-of-time density-density correlation function, while equal-time observables are time-independent because they embody averages over different realizations with a random oscillation phase. The HTC can be regarded as a nonlinear periodic analogue of the Andreev-Hawking effect, exhibiting anticorrelation bands resulting from the spontaneous, quantum emission of pairs of dispersive waves and solitons into the upstream and downstream regions. Remarkably, the time-crystal formation is understood in terms of two time operators: one associated to the initial black-hole laser and another associated to the final spontaneous Floquet state.</description>
