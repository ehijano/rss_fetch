      <title>Experimentally probing Landauer's principle in the quantum many-body regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landauer's principle bridges information theory and thermodynamics by linking the entropy change of a system during a process to the average energy dissipated to its environment. Although typically discussed in the context of erasing a single bit of information, Landauer's principle can be generalised to characterise irreversibility in out-of-equilibrium processes, such as those involving complex quantum many-body systems. Specifically, the relationship between the entropy change of the system and the energy dissipated to its environment can be decomposed into changes in quantum mutual information and a difference in relative entropies of the environment. Here we experimentally probe Landauer's principle in the quantum many-body regime using a quantum field simulator of ultracold Bose gases. Employing a dynamical tomographic reconstruction scheme, we track the temporal evolution of the quantum field following a global mass quench from a Klein-Gordon to a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid model and analyse the information-theoretic contributions to Landauer's principle for various system-environment partitions of the composite system. Our results agree with theoretical predictions, interpreted using a semi-classical quasiparticle picture. Our work demonstrates the potential of ultracold atom-based quantum field simulators to experimentally investigate quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Polaron formation in insulators and the key role of hole scattering processes: Band insulators, charge density waves and Mott transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mobile impurity immersed in a non-interacting Fermi sea is dressed by the gapless particle-hole excitations of the fermionic medium. This conventional Fermi-polaron setting is well described by the so-called ladder approximation, which consists in neglecting impurity-hole scattering processes. In this work, we analyze polaron formation in the context of insulating states of matter, considering increasing levels of correlation in the medium:~band insulators originating from external periodic potentials, spontaneously-formed charge density waves, and a Fermi-Hubbard system undergoing a metal-Mott insulator transition. The polaron spectral function is shown to exhibit striking signatures of the underlying fermionic background, such as the single-particle band gap, particle-hole symmetry and the transition to the Mott state. These signatures are identified within the framework of the Chevy ansatz, i.e. upon restricting the Hilbert space to single particle-hole excitations. Interestingly, we find that the ladder approximation is inaccurate in these band systems, due to the fact that the particle and hole scattering phase spaces are comparable. Our results provide a step forward in the understanding of polaron formation in correlated many-body media, which are relevant to both cold-atom and semiconductor experiments.</description>

      <title>Lattice-induced wavefunction effects on trapped superfluids</title>

Abstract: Wavefunction effects in uncorrelated systems are characterized by the Berry curvature and quantum metric. Beyond those, we propose gauge-independent tensors describing Bloch wavefunction effects on local interaction between correlated particles. We derive an effective hydrodynamic theory for ultracold bosons in optical lattices. Ground states and collective modes of superfluids in isotropic harmonic traps are solved for highly symmetric lattices. In a dynamic process, the wavefunction effects are featured by the eigenfrequency, amplitude, and phase shift of an excited breathing mode and can be observed in experiments. We also give a tight-binding model of a bipartite square lattice with nontrivial wavefunction effects, where results are estimated with typical experimental parameters. Our discovery advances the connections between the modern band theory and quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Resonance Cascades and Number Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04361v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we are interested in situations where the existence of a contiguous cascade of quantum resonant transitions is predicated on the validity of a particular statement in number theory. The setting is a tailored one-atom one-dimensional potential with a prescribed spectrum, under a weak periodic perturbation. The former is, by now, an experimental reality [D. Cassettari, G. Mussardo and A. Trombettoni, PNAS Nexus {\bf 2}, pgac279 (2022)].
  As a case study, we look at the following trivial statement: "Any power of $3$ is an integer." Consequently, we "test" this statement in a numerical experiment where we demonstrate an unimpeded upward mobility along an equidistant, $\ln(3)$-spaced subsequence of the energy levels of a potential with a log-natural spectrum, under a frequency $\ln(3)$ time-periodic perturbation. We further show that when we "remove" $9$ from the set of integers -- by excluding the corresponding energy level from the spectrum -- the cascade halts abruptly.</description>

      <title>Bogoliubov phonons in a Bose-Einstein condensate from the one-loop perturbative renormalization group</title>

Abstract: Wilson's renormalization-group approach to the weakly-interacting single-component Bose gas is discussed within the symmetry-broken, condensate phase. Extending upon the work by Bijlsma and Stoof [Phys. Rev. A 54, 5085 (1996), see http://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.54.5085 ], wave-function renormalization of the temporal derivative contributions to the effective action is included in order to capture sound-like quasiparticle excitations with wave lengths larger than the healing-length scale. By means of a suitable rescaling scheme we achieve convergence of the coupling flows, which serve as a means to determine the condensate depletion in accordance with Bogoliubov theory, as well as the interaction-induced shift of the critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Suppression of the superfluid Kelvin-Helmholtz instability due to massive vortex cores, friction and confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the dynamical instability responsible for the breakdown of regular rows and necklaces of quantized vortices that appear at the interface between two superfluids in relative motion. Making use of a generalized point-vortex model, we identify several mechanisms leading to the suppression of this instability. They include a non-zero mass of the vortex cores, dissipative processes resulting from the interaction between the vortices and the excitations of the superfluid, and the proximity of the vortex array to the sample boundaries. We show that massive vortex cores not only have a mitigating effect on the dynamical instability, but also change the associated scaling law and affect the direction along which it develops. The predictions of our massive and dissipative point-vortex model are eventually compared against recent experimental measurements of the maximum instability growth rate relevant to vortex necklaces in a cold-atom platform.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal order parameter of pair superfluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15972v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Order parameters represent a fundamental resource to characterize quantum matter. We show that pair superfluids can be rigorously defined in terms of a nonlocal order parameter, named odd parity, which derivation is experimentally accessible by local density measurements. As a case of study, we first investigate a constrained Bose-Hubbard model at different densities, both in one and two spatial dimensions. Here, our analysis finds pair superfluidity for relatively strong attractive interactions. The odd parity operator acts as the unique order parameter for such phase irrespectively to the density of the system and its dimensionality. In order to enforce our finding, we confirm the generality of our approach also on a two-component Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, which experimental realization represents a timely topic in ultracold atomic systems. Our results shed new light on the role of correlated density fluctuations in pair superfluids. In addition, they provide a powerful tool for the experimental detection of such exotic phases and the characterization of their transition to the atomic superfluid phase.</description>

      <title>Next nearest neighbour coupling with spinor polariton condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04210v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on experimental observation of next-nearest-neighbour coupling between ballistically expanding spinor exciton-polariton condensates in a planar semiconductor microcavity. All-optical control over the coupling strength between neighbouring condensates is demonstrated through distance-periodic pseudospin screening of their ballistic particle outflow due to the inherent splitting of the planar cavity transverse-electric (TE) and transverse-magnetic (TM) modes. By screening the nearest-neighbour coupling we overcome the conventional spatial coupling hierarchy between condensates. This offers a promising route towards creating unconventional non-planar many-body Hamiltonians using networks of ballistically expanding spinor exciton-polariton condensates.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy-Induced Spin Parity Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19311v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin parity effects refer to those special situations where a dichotomy in the physical behavior of a system arises, solely depending on whether the relevant spin quantum number is integral or half-odd integral. As is the case with the Haldane conjecture in antiferromagnetic spin chains, their pursuit often derives deep insights and invokes new developments in quantum condensed matter physics. Here we put forth a simple and general scheme for generating such effects in any spatial dimension through the use of anisotropic interactions, and a setup within reasonable reach of state-of-the-art cold-atom implementations. We demonstrate its utility through a detailed analysis of the magnetization behavior of a specific one-dimensional spin chain model -- an anisotropic antiferromagnet in a transverse magnetic field, unraveling along the way the quantum origin of finite-size effects observed in the magnetization curve that had previously been noted but not clearly understood.</description>

      <title>Path integral approach to bosonisation and nonlinearities in exciton-polariton systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large exciton-polariton optical nonlinearities present a key mechanism for photonics-based communication, ultimately in the quantum regime. Enhanced nonlinear response from various materials hosting excitons and allowing for their strong coupling with light is therefore the topic of intense studies, both in theoretical and experimental domains. Reports on the scattering rates arising due to various system's nonlinearities, such as the exciton-exciton Coulomb interaction and the Pauli blocking that leads to the saturation of the exciton oscillator strength, however, are contradictory. In this work, we develop a formalism allowing to track the exciton nonlinearities appearing in the regime of strong coupling with photons, that includes finite temperatures, mixing of the exciton excited states, and the dark exciton contributions to saturation self-consistently. The equilibrium path integration approach employed here to address the polariton composite nature, leads to a transparent hierarchy of various contributions to nonlinearity. At the same time, by taking the simplest limit of zero temperature and so-called "rigid" excitons, through our framework we retrieve the expressions derived in conventional approaches for exciton interaction constants. In particular, our theory allows to clearly show that such interaction constants cannot be used as fitting parameters tunable in a wide range of values, as they are strictly defined by the material properties, and that other explanations are due for large optical nonlinearities recently reported.</description>
