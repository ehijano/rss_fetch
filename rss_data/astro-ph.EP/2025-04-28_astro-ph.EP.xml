      <title>The steady state population of Earth's minimoons of lunar provenance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines the plausibility of a lunar origin of natural objects that have a negative total energy (ET) with respect to the geocenter while within 3 Earth Hill radii (RH), a population that we will refer to as 'bound'. They are a super-set of the population of 'minimoons' which require that the object make at least one orbit around Earth in a synodic frame rotating with Earth and that its geocentric distance be &lt;RH at some point while ET&lt;0. Only two minimoons have been discovered to date, 2006 RH120 and 2020 CD3, while 2024 PT5 and 2022 NX1 meet our condition for 'bound'. The likely source region of co-orbital objects is either the main belt, lunar ejecta, or a combination of both. Earlier works found that dynamical evolution of asteroids from the MB could explain the observed minimoon population, but spectra of 2020 CD3 and 2024 PT5 and Earth co-orbital (469219) Kamo'oalewa are more consistent with lunar basalts than any MB asteroid spectra. This work calculates the steady-state size-frequency distribution of the bound population given our understanding of the lunar impact rate, the energy of the impactors, crater-scaling relations, and the relationship between the ejecta mass and speed. We integrate the trajectory of lunar ejecta and calculate the statistics of 'prompt' bounding that take place immediately after ejection, and 'delayed' bounding that occurs after the objects have spent time on heliocentric orbits. A sub-set of the delayed bound population composes the minimoon population. We find that lunar ejecta can account for the observed population of bound objects but uncertainties in the crater formation and lunar ejecta properties induce a many orders of magnitude range on the predicted population. If the bound objects can be distinguished as lunar or asteroidal based on their spectra it may be possible to constrain crater formation processes.</description>

      <title>Sun Close-Encounter Model of Long-Period Comet and Meteoroid Orbit Stochastic Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical evolution of long-period comets (LPCs) and their meteoroid streams is usually described with the Sun as the primary body, but over most of their orbits the Solar System barycenter (SSB) is effectively the orbital focus. Detailed numerical integrations show that the orbital elements in the barycentric reference frame are nearly constant, except within the orbit of Jupiter where the comet or meteoroid shifts to a heliocentric orbit. Here we show that this encounter can be modeled in the barycentric frame analogously to how planetary close encounters are treated in the heliocentric frame, with the comet captured into an elliptic orbit about the Sun as it in turn orbits SSB. Modeling the encounters as a two-body interaction in the SSB frame gives a different insight into the dynamics than offered by secular perturbation analyses, and reveals that a large portion of the stochasticity seen in the evolution of the comet's orbit is due to the Sun's state relative to SSB at the time of encounter. LPCs sample the Sun's state randomly at each return, so that a statistical characterization of Sun's state is sufficient to determine the qualitative evolution of their orbits, including stream dispersion. The barycentric orbital elements are shown to execute random walks well-characterized by Maxwellian distributions. This is superimposed atop a systematic orbital precession induced by planetary torques. Planetary close encounters add a second stochastic component, but this component does not typically dominate the solar perturbations. Based on the statistics of Sun's state alone, the age of a long-period comet meteoroid stream in a given orbit can be derived to reasonable precision from the observed random dispersion of the angular orbital elements at Earth.</description>

Abstract: Uranus and Neptune, the so-called "ice giants", represent a fascinating class of planets. They are the outermost planets in the solar system with intermediate masses/sizes, complex non-polar magnetic fields, strong atmospheric winds, and not well-understood internal structures. Studying the interiors of Uranus and Neptune is vital for advancing our understanding of planetary formation and evolution as well as for the characterization of planets around other stars. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of the interior and formation of Uranus and Neptune. Both planets are expected to be composed of rocks and ices and have H-He atmospheres of the order of 10% of their total masses. The rock-to-water ratios in Uranus and Neptune, however, are very uncertain. It is also unclear how the different materials are distributed within the interiors and whether distinct layers exist. While often Uranus and Neptune are viewed as being "twin planets" it is in fact unclear how different the two planets are from each other, and whether they are indeed "icy" (water-dominated) planets. After summarizing the current-knowledge of the interiors of Uranus and Neptune, we briefly discuss their magnetic fields and atmosphere dynamics. We next introduce the challenges in constraining the formation paths of Uranus and Neptune: it is still unclear whether the planets formed at their current locations, and what the dominating processes that led to their formation (accretion rates, size of solids, etc.) were. We also mention the possible role of giant impacts shortly after their formation. Finally, we suggest that advanced modeling, future observations from space and the ground, lab experiments, and links with exoplanetary science can improve our understanding of Uranus and Neptune as a class of astronomical objects which seems to be very common in our galaxy.</description>

      <title>A transiting rocky super-Earth and a non-transiting sub-Neptune orbiting the M dwarf TOI-771</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin and evolution of the sub-Neptune population is a highly debated topic in the exoplanet community. With the advent of JWST, atmospheric studies can now put unprecedented constraints on the internal composition of this population. In this context, the THIRSTEE project aims to investigate the population properties of sub-Neptunes with a comprehensive and demographic approach, providing a homogeneous sample of precisely characterised sub-Neptunes across stellar spectral types. We present here the precise characterisation of the planetary system orbiting one of the THIRSTEE M-dwarf targets, TOI-771 (V = 14.9 mag), known to host one planet, TOI-771 b, which has been statistically validated using TESS observations. We use TESS, SPECULOOS, TRAPPIST and M-Earth photometry together with 31 high-precision ESPRESSO radial velocities to derive the orbital parameters and investigate the internal composition of TOI-771 b, as well as exploring the presence of additional companions in the system. We derive precise mass and radius for TOI-771 b, a super-Earth with R_b = 1.36 +/- 0.10 R_e and M_b = 2.47 +/- 0.32 M_e orbiting at 2.3 d. Its composition is consistent with an Earth-like planet, and it adds up to the rocky population of sub-Neptunes lying below the density gap identified around M dwarfs. With a 13% precision in mass, a 7% radius precision, and a warm equilibrium temperature of T_eq= 543 K, TOI-771 b is a particularly interesting target for atmospheric characterisation, and it is indeed one of the targets under consideration for the Rocky World DDT program. Additionally, we discover the presence of a second, non-transiting planet, TOI-771 c, with a period of 7.6 d and a minimum mass of Mp sin(i) = 2.9 +/- 0.4 M_e. Even though the inclination is not directly constrained, the planet likely belongs to the temperate sub-Neptune population, with an equilibrium temperature of 365 K.</description>

      <title>Dust-driven vortex cascades originating at water snow region: A pathway to planetesimal formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of observed planetary systems, including our solar system, as well as their diversity is still an open question. Streaming instability (SI) is an important mechanism for the formation of gravitationally bound planetesimals, which can grow to form planetary embryos and eventually planets. Snow lines in a protoplanetary disk can assist this process, as they can form pressure maxima and promote both dust accumulation and growth. Since the sublimation of a volatile is gradual due to opacity changes, a snow line in a protoplanetary disk is in fact a radially extended "snow region" of constant temperature. Reg\'aly et al. (2021) showed that the dust can affect the disk viscosity by adsorption of charged particles and a small perturbation in gas can lead to excitation of multiple small-scale Rossby vortices. Here we investigate the possibility of excitation of Rossby vortices and rapid planetesimal formation at temperature substructures associated with the snow regions, with the help of global, two dimensional, gas-dust coupled hydrodynamic simulations, which include dust feedback and self-gravity. We find that an initial temperature substructure in a protoplanetary disk can seed a rapid cascade of long-lived, self-sustaining Rossby vortices. The vortices accumulate significant amount of dust and the local conditions are favorable for streaming instability as well as gravitational collapse. However, the vortex formation via this mechanism requires sufficient decoupling between dust and gas, and such conditions may not be satisfied at early time when the disk is dense in gas, resulting in a delayed onset of vortex formation. The self-sustaining Rossby vortices offer exceptionally favorable conditions for dust growth and formation of planetesimals, as well as a possible pathway for rapid formation of planetary cores.</description>

      <title>Life on the Edge: Using Planetary Context to Enhance Biosignatures and Avoid False Positives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a probability theory framework to discuss the search for biosignatures. This perspective allows us to analyse the potential for different biosignatures to provide convincing evidence of extraterrestrial life and to formalise frameworks for accumulating evidence. Analysing biosignatures as a function of planetary context motivates the introduction of 'peribiosignatures', biosignatures observed where life is unlikely. We argue, based on prior work in Gaia theory, that habitability itself is an example of a peribiosignature. Finally, we discuss the implications of context dependence on observational strategy, suggesting that searching the edges of the habitable zone rather than the middle might be more likely to provide convincing evidence of life.</description>

      <title>First detections of PN, PO and PO+ toward a shocked low-mass starless core</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phosphorus is a key element that plays an essential role in biological processes important for living organisms on Earth. The origin and connection of phosphorus-bearing molecules to early Solar system objects and star-forming molecular clouds is therefore of great interest, yet there are limited observations throughout different stages of low-mass ($M &lt; $ a few M$_\odot$) star formation. Observations from the Yebes 40 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes detect for the first time in the 7mm, 3mm, and 2mm bands multiple transitions of PN and PO, as well as a single transition of PO$^{+}$, toward a low-mass starless core. The presence of PN, PO and PO$^{+}$ is kinematically correlated with bright SiO(1-0) emission. Our results reveal not only that shocks are the main driver of releasing phosphorus from dust grains and into the gas-phase, but that the emission originates from gas not affiliated with the shock itself, but quiescent gas that has been shocked in the recent past. From radiative transfer calculations, the PO/PN abundance ratio is found to be $3.1^{+0.4}_{-0.6}$, consistent with other high-mass and low-mass star-forming regions. This first detection of PO$^{+}$ toward any low-mass star-forming region reveals a PO$^{+}$/PO ratio of $0.0115^{+0.0008}_{-0.0009}$, a factor of ten lower than previously determined from observations of a Galactic Center molecular cloud, suggesting its formation can occur under more standard Galactic cosmic-ray ionization rates. These results motivate the need for additional observations that can better disentangle the physical mechanisms and chemical drivers of this precursor of prebiotic chemistry.</description>

      <title>Confirmation of a ring structure in the disk around MP Mus (PDS 66) with ALMA Band 7 observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young stellar objects (YSOs) are surrounded by protoplanetary disks, which are the birthplace of young planets. Ring and gap structures are observed among evolved protoplanetary disks, often interpreted as a consequence of planet formation. The pre-Main Sequence (pre-MS) star MP Mus hosts one of the few known examples of protoplanetary disks within ~100 pc. Previously, a disk ring structure, with a radius of 80-85 au, was detected in scattered light via near-infrared coronographic/polarimetric imaging. This ring structure may be indicative of the disk clearing process. Although such ring structures were not seen in the ALMA Band 6 images, some features were detected at $\sim$50 au. In this paper, we analyzed new ALMA Band 7 observations of MP Mus in order to investigate the details of its disk substructures. By subtracting the continuum profile generated from Band 7 data, we discovered a ring structure in the Band 7 dust continuum image at $\sim$50 au. We calculated the overall dust mass as $28.4\pm2.8 M_{\oplus}$ at 0.89 mm and $26.3\pm2.6 M_{\oplus}$ at 1.3 mm and the millimeter spectral index $\alpha_{0.89-1.3mm} \sim 2.2 \pm 0.3$ between 0.89 mm and 1.3 mm. Moreover, we display the spatial distribution of the spectral index ($\alpha_{mm}$), estimating values ranging from 1.3 at the inner disk to 4.0 at a large radius. Additionally, we observed an extended gas disk up to $\sim$120 au, in contrast with a compact continuum millimeter extent of $\sim$60 au. We conclude that there are strong indicators for an active radial drift process within the disk. However, we cannot discard the possibility of a dust evolution process and a grain growth process as responsible for the outer disk structures observed in the ALMA continuum imaging.</description>

      <title>SSOXmatch: a Java pipeline to compute cross-matches of Solar System bodies in astronomical observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper I will describe a new software package developed using the Java programming language, aimed to compute the positions of any Solar System body (among asteroids, comets, planets, and satellites) to help to perform cross-matches of them in observations taken from earth- and space-based observatories. The space telescopes supported are Hubble, James Webb, Euclid, XMM-Newton, Spitzer, Herschel, Gaia, Kepler, Chandra, and TESS, although the flexibility of the software allows to support any other mission without the need to change a single line of code. The orbital elements can be selected among the asteroid database from the Lowell observatory (completed with the cometpro database of comets maintained by the LTE), and the JPL database of minor bodies.
  The software does not depend on external tools, and performs its own numerical integration of minor bodies. The dynamical model implemented for the Solar System includes the gravity effects of all major bodies, including the Earth, Moon, and Pluto as individual bodies, 16 perturbing asteroids as in other tools, the General Relativity effects, the oblateness of the Sun, Earth, and Moon, and the non-gravitational forces for both comets and asteroids. A complete set of web services allow to compute the cross-matches (that are later to be confirmed, for instance by visual inspection of the images) and also ephemerides of specific bodies. The code is highly optimized and follows the highest standards in terms of software quality and documentation.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Impact of Alfv\'en Wave Forcing in Interplanetary Space on the Distribution of near-Earth Solar Wind Speeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broadly, solar wind source regions can be classified by their magnetic topology as intermittently and continuously open to the heliosphere. Early models of solar wind acceleration do not account for the fastest, non-transient solar wind speeds observed near-Earth and energy must be deposited into the solar wind after it leaves the Sun. Alfv\'en wave energy deposition and thermal pressure gradients are likely candidates and the relative contribution of each acceleration mechanism likely depends on the source region. Although solar wind speed is a rough proxy for solar wind source region, it cannot unambiguously identify source region topology.
  Using near-Sun observations of the solar wind's kinetic energy flux, we predict the expected kinetic energy flux near-Earth. This predicted kinetic energy flux corresponds to the range of solar wind speeds observed in the fast solar wind and infer that the solar wind's near-Sun kinetic energy flux is sufficient to predict the distribution of fastest, non-transient speeds observed near Earth. Applying a recently developed model of solar wind evolution in the inner heliosphere, we suggest that the acceleration required to generate this distribution of fastest, non-transient speeds is likely due to the continuous deposition of energy by Alfv\'en wave forcing during the solar wind's propagation through interplanetary space. We infer that the solar wind's Alfv\'enicity can statistically map near-Earth observations to their source regions because the Alfv\'en wave forcing that the solar wind experiences in transit is a consequence of the source region topology.</description>

      <title>Validation of the ESPRESSO Wavelength Calibration Using Iodine Absorption Cell Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High quality wavelength calibration is crucial for science cases like radial-velocity studies of exoplanets, the search for a possible variation of fundamental constants, and the redshift drift experiment. However, for state-of-the-art spectrographs it has become difficult to verify the wavelength calibration on sky, because no astrophysical source provides spectra with sufficiently stable or accurate wavelength information. We therefore propose to use iodine absorption cells to validate the wavelength calibration. Observing a bright and featureless star through the iodine cell emulates an astrophysical target with exactly known spectral features that can be analyzed like any other science target, allowing to verify the wavelength calibration derived from the internal calibration sources and to identify systematics in the data processing. As demonstration, we temporarily installed an I$_2$ absorption cell at ESPRESSO. Employing a full forward modeling approach of the I$_2$ spectrum, including the instrumental line-spread function, we demonstrate wavelength calibration accuracy at the level of a few m/s. We also show that wavelength measurements do depend on the geometry of the light-injection into the spectrograph fibers. This highlights the importance of probing exactly the same light path as science targets, something not possible with internal calibration sources alone. We also demonstrate excellent radial-velocity stability at the &lt;20 cm/s level in a full end-to-end fashion, from sky to data product. Our study therefore showcases the great potential of absorption cells for the verification and long-term monitoring of the wavelength calibration as well as the unique insights they can provide.</description>

Abstract: Exoplanet transits contain substantial information about the architecture of a system. By fitting transit lightcurves we can extract dynamical parameters and place constraints on the properties of the planets and their host star. Having a well-defined probabilistic model plays a crucial role in making robust measurements of these parameters, and the ability to differentiate the model provides access to more robust inference tools. Gradient-based inference methods can allow for more rapid and accurate sampling of high-dimensional parameter spaces. We present a fully differentiable photodynamical model for multi-planet transit lightcurves that display transit-timing variations. We model time-integrated exposures, compute the dynamics of a system over the full length of observations, and provide analytic expressions for derivatives of the flux with respect to the dynamical and photometric model parameters. The model has been implemented in the Julia language and is available open-source on GitHub. We demonstrate with a simulated dataset that Bayesian inference with the NUTS HMC algorithm, which uses the model gradient, can outperform the affine-invariant (e.g. \texttt{emcee}) MCMC algorithm in CPU time per effective sample, and we find that the relative sampling efficiency improves with the number of model parameters.</description>

      <title>Time Resolved Absorption of Six Chemical Species With MAROON-X Points to Strong Drag in the Ultra Hot Jupiter TOI-1518 b</title>

Abstract: Wind dynamics play a pivotal role in governing transport processes within planetary atmospheres, influencing atmospheric chemistry, cloud formation, and the overall energy budget. Understanding the strength and patterns of winds is crucial for comprehensive insights into the physics of ultra-hot Jupiter atmospheres. This study focuses on unraveling the wind dynamics and the chemical composition in the atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter TOI-1518 b. Two transit observations using the high-resolution (R{\lambda} = 85 000), optical (spectral coverage between 490 and 920 nm) spectrograph MAROON-X were obtained and analyzed to explore the chemical composition and wind dynamics using the cross-correlation techniques, global circulating models, and atmospheric retrieval. We report the detection of 14 species in the atmosphere of TOI-1518 b through cross-correlation analysis. Additionally, we measure the time-varying cross-correlation trails for 6 different species, compare them with predictions from General Circulation Models (GCM) and conclude that a strong drag is present in TOI-1518b's atmosphere. We find that the trails are species-dependent. Fe+ favors a stronger drag than Fe, which we interpret as a sign of magnetic effects being responsible for the observed strong drag. Furthermore, we show that Ca+ probes layers above the Roche lobe, leading to a qualitatively different trail than the other species. Finally, we use a retrieval analysis to characterize the abundance of the different species detected. That analysis is refined thanks to the updated planetary mass we derived from the radial-velocity detection using SOPHIE data. We measure an abundance of iron corresponding to 0.07 to 1.62 solar enrichment. The retrievals appear to be biased for the other elements, probably due to the different Kp/Vsys shifts between iron and the other elements, which we demonstrate in the case of VO.</description>

      <title>Lessons learned from the detection of wide companions by radial velocity and astrometry</title>

Abstract: The detection and constraint of the orbits of long-period giant planets is essential for enabling their further study through direct imaging. Recently, it has been highlighted that there are discrepancies between different orbital fitting solutions. We address these concerns by reanalyzing the data for HD 28185, GJ 229, HD 62364, HD 38529, 14 Her, eps Ind A, HD 211847, HD 111031, and GJ 680, offering explanations for these discrepancies. Based on the comparison between our direct modeling of the astrometric catalog data and the orvara code, we find the discrepancies are primarily data-related rather than methodology-related. Our re-analysis of HD 28185 highlights many of the data-related issues and particularly the importance of parallax modeling for year-long companions. The case of eps Ind A b is instructive to emphasize the value of an extended RV baseline for accurately determining orbits of long period companions. Our orbital solutions highlight other causes for discrepancies between solutions including the combination of absolute and relative astrometry, clear definitions of conventions, and efficient posterior sampling for the detection of wide-orbit giant planets.</description>

      <title>From pre-transit to post-eclipse: investigating the impact of 3D temperature, chemistry, and dynamics on high-resolution emission spectra of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b</title>

Abstract: High-resolution spectroscopy has provided a wealth of information about the climate and composition of ultra-hot Jupiters. However, the 3D structure of their atmospheres makes observations more challenging to interpret, necessitating 3D forward-modeling studies. In this work, we model phase-dependent thermal emission spectra of the archetype ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b to understand how the line strengths and Doppler shifts of Fe, CO, H$_2$O, and OH evolve throughout the orbit. We post-process outputs of the SPARC/MITgcm global circulation model with the 3D Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code gCMCRT to simulate emission spectra at 36 orbital phases. We then cross-correlate the spectra with different templates to obtain CCF and $K_{\text{p}}$$-$$V_{\text{sys}}$ maps. For each species, our models produce consistently negative $K_{\text{p}}$ offsets in pre- and post-eclipse, which are driven by planet rotation. The size of these offsets is similar to the equatorial rotation velocity of the planet. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the weak vertical temperature gradient on the nightside of ultra-hot Jupiters mutes the absorption features of CO and H$_2$O, which significantly hampers their detectability in pre- and post-transit. We also show that the $K_{\text{p}}$ and $V_{\text{sys}}$ offsets in pre- and post-transit are not always a measure for the line-of-sight velocities in the atmosphere. This is because the cross-correlation signal is a blend of dayside emission and nightside absorption features. Finally, we highlight that the observational uncertainty in the known orbital velocity of ultra-hot Jupiters can be multiple km/s, which makes it hard for certain targets to meaningfully report absolute $K_{\text{p}}$ offsets.</description>

      <title>Celestial sunflowers -- Survival of rings around small planetary bodies under solar radiation pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: Rings around giant planets are a common feature of the solar system. Even though solar radiation pressure is known to destabilize rings by exciting the orbital eccentricity of its particles, the Centaur Chariklo (and possibly Chiron), the dwarf planet Haumea, and trans-Neptunian object Quaoar also host rings of solid material. Aims: We explore the dynamical evolution of rings around spherical Chariklo and Haumea analogs, assuming different particle sizes and tilt angles with respect to the planetary orbital plane of the ring. Methods: The ring dynamics were studied using a GPU-based N-body integrator with an 8th-order Hermite scheme for several thousand years, corresponding to 10 solar orbits. The simulations took into account the gravitational effects of the planet and the Sun, radiation pressure, and the shadow cast by the planet. Results: Two families of rings have been identified depending on the ring tilt angle. Slightly tilted rings (&lt;=40 deg) are unstable under a critical particle size. Highly tilted rings (&gt;=50 deg), however, show instability only for a range of particle sizes that spans 1-10 times the critical size. The planetary shadow reduces the critical size by a factor of five and extends the instability region to 0.1-10 times this newly identified critical size. Conclusions: The stabilization of highly inclined rings occurs because the plane of the ring is forced to be perpendicular to the Solar radiation. As a result, the plane of the ring rotates as the planetary bodies revolves: always facing the sun, like a celestial sunflower. Rings which are closely aligned to the orbital plane of the host planet, such as Haumea and Quaoar, presumably consist of particles with a size at least 1-4 um. However, particles in the rings which are highly tilted, like that around Chariklo and Chiron, should consist of particles &lt;=2.5-15 um or &gt;=60-300 um.</description>

      <title>Constructing Four-Body Ballistic Lunar Transfers via Analytical Energy Conditions</title>

Abstract: This paper derives and summarizes the analytical conditions for lunar ballistic capture and constructs ballistic lunar transfers based on these conditions. We adopt the Sun-Earth/Moon planar bicircular restricted four-body problem as the dynamical model to construct lunar transfers. First, the analytical conditions for ballistic capture are derived based on the relationship between the Keplerian energy with respect to the Moon and the angular momentum with respect to the Moon, summarized in form of exact ranges of the Jacobi energy at the lunar insertion point. Both sufficient and necessary condition and necessary condition are developed. Then, an optimization method combined with the analytical energy conditions is proposed to construct ballistic lunar transfers. Simulations shows that a high ballistic capture ratio is achieved by our proposed method (100$\%$ for direct insertion and 99.15$\%$ for retrograde insertion). Examining the obtained ballistic lunar transfers, the effectiveness of the analytical energy conditions is verified. Samples of our obtained lunar transfers achieves a lower impulse and shorter time of flight compared to two conventional methods, further strengthening the advantage of our proposed method.</description>
