      <title>Small Term Reachability and Related Problems for Terminating Term Rewriting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by an application where we try to make proofs for Description Logic inferences smaller by rewriting, we consider the following decision problem, which we call the small term reachability problem: given a term rewriting system $R$, a term $s$, and a natural number $n$, decide whether there is a term $t$ of size $\leq n$ reachable from $s$ using the rules of $R$. We investigate the complexity of this problem depending on how termination of $R$ can be established. We show that the problem is in general NP-complete for length-reducing term rewriting systems. Its complexity increases to N2ExpTime-complete (NExpTime-complete) if termination is proved using a (linear) polynomial order and to PSpace-complete for systems whose termination can be shown using a restricted class of Knuth-Bendix orders. Confluence reduces the complexity to P for the length-reducing case, but has no effect on the worst-case complexity in the other two cases. Finally, we consider the large term reachability problem, a variant of the problem where we are interested in reachability of a term of size $\geq n$. It turns out that this seemingly innocuous modification in some cases changes the complexity of the problem, which may also become dependent on whether the number $n$ is is represented in unary or binary encoding, whereas this makes no difference for the complexity of the small term reachability problem.</description>

      <title>A Logic for Paraconsistent Belief Revision based on Epistemic Entrenchment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the integration of \emph{epistemic entrenchment} into paraconsistent belief revision systems based on Logics of Formal Inconsistency (LFIs). While systems like AGMp and AGM$\circ$ adapt AGM principles to paraconsistency, they lack mechanisms to rank beliefs, primarily due to the absence of properties such as the \emph{replacement property} in the underlying logics. We introduce two novel logics, \textbf{Cbr} and \textbf{RCBr}, with the latter extending the former to fully address these limitations given that it is self-extensional. Using \textbf{RCBr}, we define contraction operations via \emph{epistemic entrenchment}, adhering to key rationality principles. Our framework leverages non-deterministic matrix semantics (Nmatrices), providing a robust foundation for paraconsistent reasoning. These contributions advance the theory of paraconsistent belief revision and pave the way for applications in domains such as multi-agent systems and inconsistent knowledge bases.</description>

      <title>Normal Nested Answer Set Programs: Syntactics, Semantics and Logical Calculi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nested answer set programming (NASP; Lifschitz et al., 1999) generalizes answer set programming (ASP) by admitting nested expressions in rule bodies and heads, and thus, NASP aims at exploiting program succinctness. Yet, although NASP expressiveness is undoubtedly superior to ASP one, the former's reasoning capabilities remain unexplored. This reality seems subsequent to the next existing wide-ranging gap: normal nested programs (NNPs) are not known, or in other words, the nested normal-disjunctive boundary is unidentified thus far. Such an unfavorable situation is yet antagonistic to that of ASP as its normal programs (NPs) have been vital for propelling ASP. We will fill such a gap by defining the NNPs, their semantics and their associated nested logical calculi. Besides, while the unique known way to compute nested programs is unfold them back, we propose to do so in their original form.
  Firstly, we give the syntax of NNPs. For that, we initially define the positive-Horn nested-expressions and then an NNP rule as one whose head (resp. body) is a positive-Horn (resp. general) nested-expression. Secondly, we set up the semantics of NNPs by lifting to the nesting level, classical NP notions including: answer set, minimal and least model, closedness, supported-ness, immediate consequence operator and program consistency. We besides show that NNP restricted to ASP coincides with NP. Thirdly, we introduce nested logical calculi, concretely, nested unit-resolution and nested hyper unit-resolution, proving that they recover unit-resolution and hyper unit-resolution in the ASP setting. We also show how both nested logical calculi allow to process the least model of not-free NNP programs. To end, we demonstrate that computing answer sets of (resp. not-free) NNP programs is (resp. P-complete) NP-complete.</description>

      <title>A Program Instrumentation Framework for Automatic Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In deductive verification and software model checking, dealing with certain specification language constructs can be problematic when the back-end solver is not sufficiently powerful or lacks the required theories. One way to deal with this is to transform, for verification purposes, the program to an equivalent one not using the problematic constructs, and to reason about this equivalent program instead. In this article, we propose program instrumentation as a unifying verification paradigm that subsumes various existing ad-hoc approaches, has a clear formal correctness criterion, can be applied automatically, and can transfer back witnesses and counterexamples. We illustrate our approach on the automated verification of programs that involve quantification and aggregation operations over arrays, such as the maximum value or sum of the elements in a given segment of the array, which are known to be difficult to reason about automatically. We implement our approach in the MonoCera tool, which is tailored to the verification of programs with aggregation, and evaluate it on example programs, including SV-COMP programs.</description>

      <title>Reasoning about Strategic Abilities in Stochastic Multi-agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning about strategic abilities is key to AI systems comprising multiple agents, which provide a unified framework for formalizing various problems in game theory, social choice theory, etc. In this work, we propose a probabilistic extension of the alternating-time $\mu$-calculus (AMC), named PAMC, for reasoning about the strategic abilities of agents in stochastic multi-agent systems. We show that PAMC subsumes two existing logics AMC and P$\mu$TL (a probabilistic extension of the modal $\mu$-calculus), but is incomparable with the probabilistic alternating-time temporal logic (PATL). We study the problems of model checking and satisfiability checking for PAMC. We first give a model checking algorithm by leveraging algorithms for solving normal-form games and AMC model checking. We establish that the model checking problem of PAMC remains in UP$\cap$co-UP, the same complexity class as the model checking problem for AMC and P$\mu$TL. We also provide a new reduction from the satisfiability problem of PAMC to solving parity games, by which we obtain an EXPTIME decision procedure, as well as the small model property which allows us to construct a model for each satisfiable PAMC formula. Satisfiability in PAMC has the same complexity as in the modal $\mu$-calculus, unlike PCTL and PATL whose satisfiability checking problems remain open. We have implemented both the model checking and satisfiability checking algorithms as open-source tools. Experimental results are reported, showcasing the practical applications and effectiveness of our approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a version of probabilistic Kleene algebra with angelic nondeterminism and a corresponding class of automata. Our approach implements semantics via distributions over multisets in order to overcome theoretical barriers arising from the lack of a distributive law between the powerset and Giry monads. We produce a full Kleene theorem and a coalgebraic theory, as well as both operational and denotational semantics and equational reasoning principles.</description>

      <title>A Compositional Atlas for Algebraic Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circuits based on sum-product structure have become a ubiquitous representation to compactly encode knowledge, from Boolean functions to probability distributions. By imposing constraints on the structure of such circuits, certain inference queries become tractable, such as model counting and most probable configuration. Recent works have explored analyzing probabilistic and causal inference queries as compositions of basic operators to derive tractability conditions. In this paper, we take an algebraic perspective for compositional inference, and show that a large class of queries - including marginal MAP, probabilistic answer set programming inference, and causal backdoor adjustment - correspond to a combination of basic operators over semirings: aggregation, product, and elementwise mapping. Using this framework, we uncover simple and general sufficient conditions for tractable composition of these operators, in terms of circuit properties (e.g., marginal determinism, compatibility) and conditions on the elementwise mappings. Applying our analysis, we derive novel tractability conditions for many such compositional queries. Our results unify tractability conditions for existing problems on circuits, while providing a blueprint for analysing novel compositional inference queries.</description>

      <title>Permutation clones that preserve relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Permutation clones generalise permutation groups and clone theory. We investigate permutation clones defined by relations, or equivalently, the automorphism groups of powers of relations. We find many structural results on the lattice of all relationally defined permutation clones on a finite set. We find all relationally defined permutation clones on two element set.
  We show that all maximal borrow closed permutation clones are either relationally defined or cancellatively defined.
  Permutation clones generalise clones to permutations of $A^n$. Emil Je\v{r}\'{a}bek found the dual structure to be weight mappings $A^k\rightarrow M$ to a commutative monoid, generalising relations. We investigate the case when the dual object is precisely a relation, equivalently, that $M={\mathbb B}$, calling these relationally defined permutation clones.
  We determine the number of relationally defined permutation clones on two elements (13).
  We note that many infinite classes of clones collapse when looked at as permutation clones.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Agents with Perfect Recall: Model Reductions, Knowledge-Based Construction, and Model Checking for Coalitional Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model checking of strategic abilities for agents with memory is a notoriously hard problem, and very few attempts have been made to tackle it. In this paper, we present two important steps towards this goal. First, we take the partial-order reduction scheme that was recently proved to preserve individual and coalitional abilities of memoryless agents, and show that it also works for agents with memory. Secondly, we take the Knowledge-Based Subset Construction, that was recently studied for synchronous concurrent games, and adapt it to preserve abilities of memoryful agents in asynchronous MAS.
  On the way, we also propose a new execution semantics for strategies in asynchronous MAS, that combines elements of Concurrent Game Structures and Interleaved Interpreted Systems in a natural and intuitive way.</description>

      <title>Linear Arboreal Categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10088v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arboreal categories, introduced by Abramsky and Reggio, axiomatise categories with tree-shaped objects. These categories provide a categorical language for formalising behavioural notions such as simulation, bisimulation, and resource-indexing. In this paper, we strengthen the axioms of an arboreal category to exclude `branching' behaviour, obtaining a notion of `linear arboreal category'. We then demonstrate that every arboreal category satisfying a linearisability condition has an associated linear arboreal subcategory related via an adjunction. This identifies the relationship between the pebble-relation comonad, of Montacute and Shah, and the pebbling comonad, of Abramsky, Dawar, and Wang, and generalises it further. As another outcome of this new framework, we obtain a linear variant of the arboreal category for modal logic. By doing so we recover different linear-time equivalences between transition systems as instances of their categorical definitions. We conclude with new preservation and characterisation theorems relating trace inclusion and trace equivalence with different linear fragments of modal logic.</description>

      <title>Coherent Taylor expansion as a bimonad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the recently introduced setting of coherent differentiation for taking into account not only differentiation, but also Taylor expansion in categories which are not necessarily (left)additive. The main idea consists in extending summability into an infinitary functor which intuitively maps any object to the object of its countable summable families. This functor is endowed with a canonical structure of bimonad. In a linear logical categorical setting, Taylor expansion is then axiomatized as a distributive law between this summability functor and the resource comonad (aka.~exponential), allowing to extend the summability functor into a bimonad on the Kleisli category of the resource comonad: this extended functor computes the Taylor expansion of the (nonlinear) morphisms of the Kleisli category. We also show how this categorical axiomatizations of Taylor expansion can be generalized to arbitrary cartesian categories, leading to a general theory of Taylor expansion formally similar to that of differential cartesian categories, although it does not require the underlying cartesian category to be left additive.We provide several examples of concrete categories which arise in denotational semantics and feature such analytic structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08445v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many important computational structures involve an intricate interplay between algebraic features (given by operations on the underlying set) and relational features (taking account of notions such as order or distance). This paper investigates algebras over relational structures axiomatized by an infinitary Horn theory, which subsume, for example, partial algebras, various incarnations of ordered algebras, quantitative algebras introduced by Mardare, Panangaden, and Plotkin, and their recent extension to generalized metric spaces and lifted algebraic signatures by Mio, Sarkis, and Vignudelli. To this end, we develop the notion of clustered equation, which is inspired by Mardare et al.'s basic conditional equations in the theory of quantitative algebras, at the level of generality of arbitrary relational structures, and we prove that it is equivalent to an abstract categorical form of equation earlier introduced by Milius and Urbat. Our main results are a family of Birkhoff-type variety theorems (classifying the expressive power of clustered equations) and an exactness theorem (classifying abstract equations by a congruence property).</description>

      <title>Parametricity via Cohesion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parametricity is a key metatheoretic property of type systems, which implies strong uniformity &amp; modularity properties of the structure of types within systems possessing it. In recent years, various systems of dependent type theory have emerged with the aim of expressing such parametric reasoning in their internal logic, toward the end of solving various problems arising from the complexity of higher-dimensional coherence conditions in type theory. This paper presents a first step toward the unification, simplification, and extension of these various methods for internalizing parametricity. Specifically, I argue that there is an essentially modal aspect of parametricity, which is intimately connected with the category-theoretic concept of cohesion. On this basis, I describe a general categorical semantics for modal parametricity, develop a corresponding framework of axioms (with computational interpretations) in dependent type theory that can be used to internally represent and reason about such parametricity, and show this in practice by implementing these axioms in Agda and using them to verify parametricity theorems therein. I then demonstrate the utility of these axioms in managing the complexity of higher-dimensional coherence by deriving induction principles for higher inductive types, and in closing, I sketch the outlines of a more general synthetic theory of parametricity, with applications in domains ranging from homotopy type theory to the analysis of program modules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03985v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a characterization of first-order string-to-string transduction via $\lambda$-terms typed in non-commutative affine logic that compute with Church encoding, extending the analogous known characterization of star-free languages. We show that every first-order transduction can be computed by a $\lambda$-term using a known Krohn-Rhodes-style decomposition lemma. The converse direction is given by compiling $\lambda$-terms into two-way reversible planar transducers. The soundness of this translation involves showing that the transition functions of those transducers live in a monoidal closed category of diagrams in which we can interpret purely affine $\lambda$-terms. One challenge is that the unit of the tensor of the category in question is not a terminal object. As a result, our interpretation does not identify $\beta$-equivalent terms, but it does turn $\beta$-reductions into inequalities in a poset-enrichment of the category of diagrams.</description>

Abstract: Categories and categorical structures are increasingly recognized as useful abstractions for modeling in science and engineering. To uniformly implement category-theoretic mathematical models in software, we introduce GATlab, a domain-specific language for algebraic specification embedded in a technical programming language. GATlab is based on generalized algebraic theories (GATs), a logical system extending algebraic theories with dependent types so as to encompass category theory. Using GATlab, the programmer can specify generalized algebraic theories and their models, including both free models, based on symbolic expressions, and computational models, defined by arbitrary code in the host language. Moreover, the programmer can define maps between theories and use them to declaratively migrate models of one theory to models of another. In short, GATlab aims to provide a unified environment for both computer algebra and software interface design with generalized algebraic theories. In this paper, we describe the design, implementation, and applications of GATlab.</description>

      <title>A Semantic Proof of Generalised Cut Elimination for Deep Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiplicative-Additive System Virtual (MAV) is a logic that extends Multiplicative-Additive Linear Logic with a self-dual non-commutative operator expressing the concept of "before" or "sequencing". MAV is also an extenson of the the logic Basic System Virtual (BV) with additives. Formulas in BV have an appealing reading as processes with parallel and sequential composition. MAV adds internal and external choice operators. BV and MAV are also closely related to Concurrent Kleene Algebras.
  Proof systems for MAV and BV are Deep Inference systems, which allow inference rules to be applied anywhere inside a structure. As with any proof system, a key question is whether proofs in MAV can be reduced to a normal form, removing detours and the introduction of structures not present in the original goal. In Sequent Calcluli systems, this property is referred to as Cut Elimination. Deep Inference systems have an analogous Cut rule and other rules that are not present in normalised proofs. Cut Elimination for Deep Inference systems has the same metatheoretic benefits as for Sequent Calculi systems, including consistency and decidability.
  Proofs of Cut Elimination for BV, MAV, and other Deep Inference systems present in the literature have relied on intrincate syntactic reasoning and complex termination measures.
  We present a concise semantic proof that all MAV proofs can be reduced to a normal form avoiding the Cut rule and other "non analytic" rules. We also develop soundness and completeness proofs of MAV (and BV) with respect to a class of models. We have mechanised all our proofs in the Agda proof assistant, which provides both assurance of their correctness as well as yielding an executable normalisation procedure.- Our technique extends to include exponentials and the additive units.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Kripke Semantics II: Stability and Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03578v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the duality between Kripke and algebraic semantics of intuitionistic and intuitionistic modal logic. We find that there is a certain mismatch between the two semantics, which means that not all algebraic models can be embedded into a Kripke model. This leads to an alternative proposal for a relational semantics, the stable semantics. Instead of an arbitrary partial order, the stable semantics requires a distributive lattice of worlds. We constructively show that the stable semantics is exactly as complete as the algebraic semantics. Categorifying these results leads to a 2-duality between two-dimensional stable semantics and categories of product-preserving presheaves, i.e. models of algebraic theories in the style of Lawvere.</description>

      <title>Strong Nominal Semantics for Fixed-Point Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nominal algebra includes $\alpha$-equality and freshness constraints on nominal terms endowed with a nominal set semantics that facilitates reasoning about languages with binders. Nominal unification is decidable and unitary, however, its extension with equational axioms such as Commutativity (which has a finitary first-order unification type) is no longer finitary unless permutation fixed-point constraints are used. In this paper, we extend the notion of nominal algebra by introducing fixed-point constraints and provide a sound semantics using strong nominal sets. We show, by providing a counter-example, that the class of nominal sets is not a sound denotation for this extended nominal algebra. To recover soundness we propose two different formulations of nominal algebra, one obtained by restricting to a class of fixed-point contexts that are in direct correspondence with freshness contexts and another obtained by using a different set of derivation rules.</description>

      <title>Continuous Domains for Function Spaces Using Spectral Compactification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a continuous domain for function spaces over topological spaces which are not core-compact. Notable examples of such topological spaces include the real line with the upper limit topology, which is used in solution of initial value problems with temporal discretization, and various infinite dimensional Banach spaces which are ubiquitous in functional analysis and solution of partial differential equations. If a topological space $\mathbb{X}$ is not core-compact and $\mathbb{D}$ is a non-singleton bounded-complete domain, the function space $[\mathbb{X} \to \mathbb{D}]$ is not a continuous domain. To construct a continuous domain, we consider a spectral compactification $\mathbb{Y}$ of $\mathbb{X}$ and relate $[\mathbb{X} \to \mathbb{D}]$ with the continuous domain $[\mathbb{Y} \to \mathbb{D}]$ via a Galois connection. This allows us to perform computations in the native structure $[\mathbb{X} \to \mathbb{D}]$ while computable analysis is performed in the continuous domain $[\mathbb{Y} \to \mathbb{D}]$, with the left and right adjoints used for moving between the two function spaces.</description>

      <title>Typed Non-determinism in Concurrent Calculi: The Eager Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of designing typed concurrent calculi with non-deterministic choice in which types leverage linearity for controlling resources, thereby ensuring strong correctness properties for processes. This problem is constrained by the delicate tension between non-determinism and linearity. Prior work developed a session-typed {\pi}-calculus with standard non-deterministic choice; well-typed processes enjoy type preservation and deadlock-freedom. Central to this typed calculus is a lazy semantics that gradually discards branches in choices. This lazy semantics, however, is complex: various technical elements are needed to describe the non-deterministic behavior of typed processes. This paper develops an entirely new approach, based on an eager semantics, which more directly represents choices and commitment. We present a {\pi}-calculus in which non-deterministic choices are governed by this eager semantics and session types. We establish its key correctness properties, including deadlock-freedom, and demonstrate its expressivity by correctly translating a typed resource {\lambda}-calculus.</description>

      <title>On Kleisli liftings and decorated trace semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that Kleisli categories provide a natural language to model side effects. For instance, in the theory of coalgebras, behavioural equivalence coincides with language equivalence (instead of bisimilarity) when nondeterministic automata are modelled as coalgebras living in the Kleisli category of the powerset monad. In this paper, our aim is to establish decorated trace semantics based on language and ready equivalences for conditional transition systems (CTSs) with/without upgrades. To this end, we model CTSs as coalgebras living in the Kleisli category of a relative monad. Our results are twofold. First, we reduce the problem of defining a Kleisli lifting for the machine endofunctor in the context of a relative monad to the classical notion of Kleisli lifting. Second, we provide a recipe based on indexed categories to construct a Kleisli lifting for general endofunctors.</description>

      <title>Positive Focusing is Directly Useful</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Miller and Wu introduced the positive $\lambda$-calculus, a call-by-value $\lambda$-calculus with sharing obtained by assigning proof terms to the positively polarized focused proofs for minimal intuitionistic logic. The positive $\lambda$-calculus stands out among $\lambda$-calculi with sharing for a compactness property related to the sharing of variables. We show that -- thanks to compactness -- the positive calculus neatly captures the core of useful sharing, a technique for the study of reasonable time cost models.</description>

      <title>Regular Model Checking Upside-Down: An Invariant-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.03060v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regular model checking is a technique for the verification of infinite-state systems whose configurations can be represented as finite words over a suitable alphabet. The form we are studying applies to systems whose set of initial configurations is regular, and whose transition relation is captured by a length-preserving transducer. To verify safety properties, regular model checking iteratively computes automata recognizing increasingly larger regular sets of reachable configurations, and checks if they contain unsafe configurations. Since this procedure often does not terminate, acceleration, abstraction, and widening techniques have been developed to compute a regular superset of the reachable configurations.
  In this paper, we develop a complementary procedure. Instead of approaching the set of reachable configurations from below, we start with the set of all configurations and approach it from above. We use that the set of reachable configurations is equal to the intersection of all inductive invariants of the system. Since this intersection is non-regular in general, we introduce b-invariants, defined as those representable by CNF-formulas with at most b clauses. We prove that, for every $b\geq0$, the intersection of all inductive b-invariants is regular, and we construct an automaton recognizing it. We show that whether this automaton accepts some unsafe configuration is in EXPSPACE for every $b\geq0$, and PSPACE-complete for b=1. Finally, we study how large must b be to prove safety properties of a number of benchmarks.</description>

      <title>On a fibrational construction for optics, lenses, and Dialectica categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16388v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Categories of lenses/optics and Dialectica categories are both comprised of bidirectional morphisms of basically the same form. In this work we show how they can be considered a special case of an overarching fibrational construction, generalizing Hofstra's construction of Dialectica fibrations and Spivak's construction of generalized lenses. This construction turns a tower of Grothendieck fibrations into another tower of fibrations by iteratively twisting each of the components, using the opposite fibration construction.</description>

      <title>CaTT contexts are finite computads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two novel descriptions of weak {\omega}-categories have been recently proposed, using type-theoretic ideas. The first one is the dependent type theory CaTT whose models are {\omega}-categories. The second is a recursive description of a category of computads together with an adjunction to globular sets, such that the algebras for the induced monad are again {\omega}-categories. We compare the two descriptions by showing that there exits a fully faithful morphism of categories with families from the syntactic category of CaTT to the opposite of the category of computads, which gives an equivalence on the subcategory of finite computads. We derive a more direct connection between the category of models of CaTT and the category of algebras for the monad on globular sets, induced by the adjunction with computads.</description>
