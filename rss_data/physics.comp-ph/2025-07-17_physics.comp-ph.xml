      <title>Shape optimization of metastable states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The definition of metastable states is an ubiquitous task in the design and analysis of molecular simulation, and is a crucial input in a variety of acceleration methods for the sampling of long configurational trajectories.
  Although standard definitions based on local energy minimization procedures can sometimes be used, these definitions are typically suboptimal, or entirely inadequate when entropic effects are significant, or when the lowest energy barriers are quickly overcome by thermal fluctuations.
  In this work, we propose an approach to the definition of metastable states, based on the shape-optimization of a local separation of timescale metric directly linked to the efficiency of a class of accelerated molecular dynamics algorithms.
  To realize this approach, we derive analytic expressions for shape-variations of Dirichlet eigenvalues for a class of operators associated with reversible elliptic diffusions, and use them to construct a local ascent algorithm, explicitly treating the case of multiple eigenvalues.
  We propose two methods to make our method tractable in high-dimensional systems: one based on dynamical coarse-graining, the other on recently obtained low-temperature shape-sensitive spectral asymptotics.
  We validate our method on a benchmark biomolecular system, showcasing a significant improvement over conventional definitions of metastable states.</description>

      <title>TinyDEM: Minimal open granular DEM code with sliding, rolling and twisting friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces TinyDEM, a lightweight implementation of a full-fledged discrete element method (DEM) solver in 3D. Newton's damped equations of motion are solved explicitly for translations and rotations of a polydisperse ensemble of dry, soft, granular spherical particles, using quaternions to represent their orientation in space without gimbal lock. Particle collisions are modeled as inelastic and frictional, including full exchange of torque. With a general particle-mesh collision routine, complex rigid geometries can be simulated. TinyDEM is designed to be a compact standalone program written in simple C++11, devoid of explicit pointer arithmetics and advanced concepts such as manual memory management or polymorphism. It is parallelized with OpenMP and published freely under the 3-clause BSD license. TinyDEM can serve as an entry point into classical DEM simulations or as a foundation for more complex models of particle dynamics.</description>

      <title>Equalized Hyperspin Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliable simulation of spin models is of critical importance to tackle complex optimization problems that are intractable on conventional computing machines. The recently introduced hyperspin machine, which is a network of linearly and nonlinearly coupled parametric oscillators, provides a versatile simulator of general classical vector spin models in arbitrary dimension, finding the minimum of the simulated spin Hamiltonian and implementing novel annealing algorithms. In the hyperspin machine, oscillators evolve in time minimizing a cost function that must resemble the desired spin Hamiltonian in order for the system to reliably simulate the target spin model. This condition is met if the hyperspin amplitudes are equal in the steady state. Currently, no mechanism to enforce equal amplitudes exists. Here, we bridge this gap and introduce a method to simulate the hyperspin machine with equalized amplitudes in the steady state. We employ an additional network of oscillators (named equalizers) that connect to the hyperspin machine via an antisymmetric nonlinear coupling and equalize the hyperspin amplitudes. We demonstrate the performance of such an equalized hyperspin machine by large-scale numerical simulations up to $10000$ hyperspins. Compared to the hyperspin machine without equalization, we find that the equalized hyperspin machine (i) Reaches orders of magnitude lower spin energy, and (ii) Its performance is significantly less sensitive to the system parameters. The equalized hyperspin machine offers a competitive spin Hamiltonian minimizer and opens the possibility to combine amplitude equalization with complex annealing protocols to further boost the performance of spin machines.</description>

      <title>A variationally consistent and asymptotically convergent phase-field model for solute precipitation and dissolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel phase-field model for solute precipitation and dissolution in liquid solutions. Unlike in previous studies with similar scope, in our model the two non-linear coupled governing equations of the problem, which deliver the solute ion concentration and the phase-field variable, are derived in a variationally consistent way starting from a free energy functional of Modica-Mortola type. The phase-field variable is assumed to follow the non-conservative Allen-Cahn evolution law, whereas the solute ion concentration obeys the conservative Cahn-Hilliard equation. We also assess the convergence of the new model to the corresponding sharp-interface model via the method of matched asymptotic expansions, and derive a novel expression of the reaction rate of the sharp-interface model. Through a finite element discretization, we present several numerical examples in two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Inverse Physics-informed neural networks procedure for detecting noise in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of quantum systems is essential for the development of quantum technologies, particularly in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. While traditional methods for Hamiltonian learning and noise characterization often require extensive measurements and scale poorly with system size, machine learning approaches offer promising alternatives. In this work, we extend the inverse physics-informed neural network (referred to as PINNverse) framework to open quantum systems governed by Lindblad master equations. By incorporating both coherent and dissipative dynamics into the neural network training, our method enables simultaneous identification of Hamiltonian parameters and decay rates from noisy experimental data. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the approach through numerical simulations of two-qubit open systems. Our results show that PINNverse provides a scalable and noise-resilient framework for quantum system identification, with potential applications in quantum control and error mitigation.</description>

      <title>Accelerated free energy estimation in ab initio path integral Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a methodology for accelerating the estimation of the free energy from path integral Monte Carlo simulations by considering an intermediate artificial reference system where interactions are inexpensive to evaluate numerically. Using the spherically averaged Ewald interaction as this intermediate reference system for the uniform electron gas, the interaction contribution for the free energy was evaluated up to 18 times faster than the Ewald-only method. Furthermore, a $\xi$-extrapolation technique was tested and applied to alleviate the fermion sign problem and to resolve the sign for large particle numbers. Combining these two techniques enabled the evaluation of the free energy for a system of 1000 electrons, where both finite-size and statistical errors are below chemical accuracy. The general procedure can be applied to systems relevant for planetary and inertial confinement fusion modeling with low to moderate levels of quantum degeneracy.</description>

      <title>State transfer analysis for linear spin chains with non-uniform on-site energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High fidelity state transfer is an important ingredient of distributed quantum information processing. We present and analyse results on perfect and quasi-perfect state transfer with linear spin chains incorporating non-uniform on-site energies. The motivation is maintenance of coupling uniformity, which could be beneficial for some physical implementations. We relate this coupling uniformity to a particle in a discrete potential analogue. Our analysis further considers the statistical variation in couplings and on-site energies, as a function of increasing chain site number N.</description>

      <title>$GW$+2SOSEX self-energy made positive semi-definite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formulation of vertex corrections beyond the $GW$ approximation within the framework of perturbation theory is a subtle and challenging task, which accounts for the wide variety of schemes proposed over the years. Exact self-energies are required to satisfy the mathematical condition of positive semi-definiteness. The $GW$ self-energy fulfills this property, but the vast majority of the vertex-corrected self-energy approximations do not. In this study, we devise a positive semi-definite extension to the $GW$+2SOSEX self-energy that we name $GW$+2SOSEX-psd. To reach this goal, we demonstrate the cancellation of the bare energy poles that are contained in the fully dynamic second-order in $W$ self-energy ($G3W2$). We then demonstrate on molecular examples the correct positive semi-definiteness of the proposed self-energy approximation and its good accuracy in predicting accurate quasiparticle energies for valence and core states.</description>

      <title>Designing quantum chemistry algorithms with Just-In-Time compilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce just-in-time (JIT) compilation to the integral kernels for Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) to enhance the efficiency of electron repulsion integral computations. For Coulomb and exchange (JK) matrices, JIT-based algorithms yield a 2x speedup for the small 6-31G* basis set over GPU4PySCF v1.4 on an NVIDIA A100-80G GPU. By incorporating a novel algorithm designed for orbitals with high angular momentum, the efficiency of JK evaluations with the large def2-TZVPP basis set is improved by up to 4x. The core CUDA implementation is compact, comprising only ~1,000 lines of code, including support for single-precision arithmetic. Furthermore, the single-precision implementation achieves a 3x speedup over the previous state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine Coupling Constants on Quantum Computers: Performance, Errors, and Future Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first implementation and computation of electron spin resonance isotropic hyperfine coupling constants (HFCs) on quantum hardware. As illustrative test cases, we compute the HFCs for the hydroxyl radical (OH$^{\bullet}$), nitric oxide (NO$^{\bullet}$), and the triplet hydroxyl cation (OH$^{+}$). Our approach integrates the qubit-ADAPT method with unrestricted orbital optimization in an active space framework. To accurately measure the necessary spin one-electron reduced density matrices on current hardware, we employ a combination of error mitigation, error suppression, and post-selection, including our in-house developed ansatz-based readout and gate error mitigation. The HFCs obtained from the quantum hardware experiments align with results from unrestricted complete active space self-consistent field calculations on classical hardware. These results mark a significant step towards leveraging quantum computing for chemically relevant molecular properties and highlight the critical role of multi-method error strategies in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</description>

      <title>Dislocations saturation in slip rate-driven processes and initial microstructure effects for large plastic deformation of crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dislocation-density-based crystal plasticity (CP) models are introduced to account for the microstructural changes throughout the deformation process, enabling more quantitative predictions of the deformation process compared to slip-system resistance-based plasticity models. In this work, we present a stability analysis of slip rate-driven processes for some established dislocation density-based models, including the Kocks and Mecking (KM) model and its variants. Our analysis can be generalized to any type of dislocation density model, providing a broader framework for understanding the stability of such systems. We point out the existence of saturation dislocation densities and the role played by the initial dislocation density which significantly influences material hardening or softening responses. Since the initial micro-structure, modeled through the dislocation density, could be related to the size or the sample preparation process, implicit size-dependent effects can also be conjectured.
  To further explore these phenomena, we conduct numerical simulations of pillar compression using an Eulerian crystal plasticity framework. Our results show that dislocation-density-based CP models effectively capture microstructural evolution in small-scale materials, offering critical insights for the design of miniaturized mechanical devices and advanced materials in nanotechnology.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Driven Segregation in Periodically Textured Microfluidic Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transport dynamics of elongated microparticles in microchannel flows. While smooth-walled channels preserve the dependence of particle trajectories on initial orientation and lateral position, we show that introducing periodically textured walls can trigger robust alignment of the particle along the channel centerline. This geometry-driven alignment arises from repeated reorientation torques generated by spatially modulated shear gradients near the textured walls. A resistive force theory-based analysis reveals that the effect stems from the anisotropic hydrodynamic response of the elongated particle to local shear, with maximal alignment torque occurring at intermediate particle orientations. The alignment efficiency depends on particle elongation and the relative texture wavelength, with an optimal range for maximal effect. While the observed alignment behavior is not limited to low Reynolds numbers, the characteristic alignment length scale diverges as the Reynolds number increases toward the turbulent flow regime. These findings offer a predictive framework for designing microfluidic devices that passively sort or focus anisotropic particles, with implications for soft matter transport, biophysical flows, and microfluidic engineering.</description>

      <title>The Integral Decimation Method for Quantum Dynamics and Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The solutions to many problems in the mathematical, computational, and physical sciences often involve multidimensional integrals. A direct numerical evaluation of the integral incurs a computational cost that is exponential in the number of dimensions, a phenomenon called the curse of dimensionality. The problem is so substantial that one usually employs sampling methods, like Monte Carlo, to avoid integration altogether. Here, we derive and implement a quantum algorithm to compress a multidimensional integrand into a product of matrix-valued functions - a spectral tensor train - changing the computational complexity of integration from exponential to polynomial. The algorithm compresses the integrand by applying a sequence of quantum gates to an unentangled quantum state, where each term corresponds to a body-ordered term in the potential. Because it allows for the systematic elimination of small contributions to the integral through decimation, we call the method integral decimation. The functions in the spectral basis are analytically differentiable and integrable, and in applications to the partition function, integral decimation numerically factorizes an interacting system into a product of noninteracting ones. We illustrate integral decimation by evaluating the absolute free energy and entropy of a chiral XY model as a continuous function of temperature. We also compute the nonequilibrium time-dependent reduced density matrix of a quantum chain with between two and forty levels, each coupled to colored noise. When other methods provide numerical solutions to these models, they quantitatively agree with integral decimation. When conventional methods become intractable, integral decimation can be a powerful alternative.</description>
