      <title>Inventory policy for the vaccine of a new pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic showed that stocking and procuring vaccines are different from the inventory holding problems of production. The safety of the supply is more important than cost minimization. The Hungarian inventory model is applied to determine the initial stock if the probability of the non-shortage is given. This initial stock is the function of the procurements. The problem is non-linear as the willingness to be vaccinated is a sigmoid function of the time. The stocking of vaccines is a single-period inventory problem. The cases of three countries are simulated. The countries are Denmark, Hungary, and Mexico. They have different characteristics of willingness to be vaccinated. The numerical results of the simulation show that the prescribed probability of non-shortage can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Tight MIP Formulation for Pipeline Gas Flow with Linepack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In integrated power and gas energy system optimization models (ESOMs), pipeline gas transmission with linepack is a particularly complex problem due to its non-linear and non-convex character. For ESOMs based on mixed-integer linear programing, piecewise linearization is a well-established convexification approach for this problem, which, however, requires binary variables to model feasible combinations of linear gas flow and pressure segments and thus can quickly become computationally challenging. In order to improve computational performance, this paper proposes a piecewise linearization method specifically designed to be tight, resulting in a reduced problem space a solver can explore faster. We provide numerical results comparing the proposed formulation against two piecewise linearizations from the literature, both from a theoretical point of view and in terms of practical computational performance, with results showing an average speed-up of 2.83 times for our case study. Test cases are carried out on a modified 24-bus IEEE Reliability Test System and a 12-node gas system, considering discrete unit commitment decisions.</description>

      <title>Parametric Nonlinear Volterra Series via Machine Learning: Transonic Aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces an approach for modeling unsteady transonic aerodynamics within a parametric space, using Volterra series to capture aerodynamic responses and machine learning to enable interpolation. The first- and second-order Volterra kernels are derived from indicial aerodynamic responses obtained through computational fluid dynamics, with the second-order kernel calculated as a correction to the dominant linear response. Machine learning algorithms, specifically artificial neural network and Gaussian process regression, are used to interpolate kernel coefficients within a parameter space defined by Mach number and angle of attack. The methodology is applied to two and three dimensional test cases in the transonic regime. Results underscore the benefit of including the second-order kernel to address strong nonlinearity and demonstrate the effectiveness of neural networks. The approach achieves a level of accuracy that appears sufficient for use in conceptual design.</description>

      <title>A Multiscale-Multiphysics Framework for Modeling Organ-scale Liver Regrowth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for modeling liver regrowth on the organ scale that is based on three components: (1) a multiscale perfusion model that combines synthetic vascular tree generation with a multi-compartment homogenized flow model, including a homogenization procedure to obtain effective parameters; (2) a poroelastic finite growth model that acts on all compartments and the synthetic vascular tree structure; (3) an evolution equation for the local volumetric growth factor, driven by the homogenized flow rate into the microcirculation as a measure of local hyperperfusion and well-suited for calibration with available data. We apply our modeling framework to a prototypical benchmark and a full-scale patient-specific liver, for which we assume a common surgical cut. Our simulation results demonstrate that our model represents hyperperfusion as a consequence of partial resection and accounts for its reduction towards a homeostatic perfusion state, exhibiting overall regrowth dynamics that correspond well with clinical observations. In addition, our results show that our model also captures local hypoperfusion in the vicinity of orphan vessels, a key requirement for the prediction of ischemia or the preoperative identification of suitable cut patterns.</description>

      <title>A Metric on the Polycrystalline Microstructure State Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Material microstructures are traditionally compared using sets of statistical measures that are incomplete, e.g., two visually distinct microstructures can have identical grain size distributions and phase fractions. While this is not a severe concern for materials fabricated by traditional means, the microstructures produced by advanced manufacturing methods can depend sensitively and unpredictably on the processing conditions. Moreover, the advent of computational materials design has increased the frequency of synthetic microstructure generation, and there is not yet a standard approach in the literature to validate the generated microstructures with experimental ones. This work proposes an idealized distance on the space of single-phase polycrystalline microstructures such that two microstructures that are close with respect to the distance exhibit statistically similar grain geometries in all respects below a user-specified length scale. Given a pair of micrographs, the distance is approximated by sampling windows from the micrographs, defining a distance between pairs of windows, and finding a window matching that minimizes the sum of pairwise window distances. The approach is used to compare a variety of synthetic microstructures and to develop a procedure to query a proof-of-concept database suitable for general single-phase polycrystalline microstructures.</description>

      <title>A Spectral-based Physics-informed Finite Operator Learning for Prediction of Mechanical Behavior of Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel physics-informed operator learning technique based on spectral methods is introduced to model the complex behavior of heterogeneous materials. The Lippmann-Schwinger operator in Fourier space is employed to construct physical constraints with almost no additional overhead, eliminating the need for automatic differentiation. This methodology accelerates the training process by allowing gradient construction on a finite fixed discretization in Fourier space. Later, the spectral physics-informed finite operator learning (SPiFOL) framework is built based on this discretization and trained to map the arbitrary shape of microstructures to their mechanical responses (strain fields) without using any labeled data. The training is done by minimizing equilibrium in Fourier space concerning the macroscopic loading condition, which also guarantees the periodicity. The trained SPiFOL predicts full-field solutions for unseen cases accelerating the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) solvers by two orders of magnitude. The accuracy of the SPiFOL is investigated for a wide range of microstructures from dual-phase to multiphase materials and the homogenized stresses computed by SPiFOL show less than 1% error compared to results obtained by conventional FFT solvers. SPiFOL is further enhanced with a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to map microstructure to mechanical behavior using only physical equations in Fourier space. Compared to the standard data-driven FNO, SPiFOL shows higher accuracy in predicting stress fields and provides nearly resolution-independent results. Furthermore, the zero-shot-super-resolution feature in heterogeneous domains is investigated. Finally, the effectiveness of SPiFOL as a solver for individual microstructures is demonstrated, highlighting the reduction in solving time when utilizing GPUs.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Framework for Multiscale State-Space Modeling with Nested Nonlinear Dynamics: An Application to Bayesian Learning under Switching Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a generalized framework for multiscale state-space modeling that incorporates nested nonlinear dynamics, with a specific focus on Bayesian learning under switching regimes. Our framework captures the complex interactions between fast and slow processes within systems, allowing for the analysis of how these dynamics influence each other across various temporal scales. We model these interactions through a hierarchical structure in which finer time-scale dynamics are nested within coarser ones, while facilitating feedback between the scales. To promote the practical application of our framework, we address the problem of identifying switching regimes and transient dynamics. In particular, we develop a Bayesian learning approach to estimate latent states and indicators corresponding to switching dynamics, enabling the model to adapt effectively to regime changes. We employ Sequential Monte Carlo, or particle filtering, for inference. We illustrate the utility of our framework through simulations. The results demonstrate that our Bayesian learning approach effectively tracks state transitions and achieves accurate identification of switching dynamics in multiscale systems.</description>

      <title>SHAP zero Explains All-order Feature Interactions in Black-box Genomic Models with Near-zero Query Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of black-box models in machine learning, Shapley values have emerged as a popular method for model explanations due to their theoretical guarantees. Shapley values locally explain a model to an input query using additive features. Yet, in genomics, extracting biological knowledge from black-box models hinges on explaining nonlinear feature interactions globally to hundreds to thousands of input query sequences. Herein, we develop SHAP zero, an algorithm that estimates all-order Shapley feature interactions with a near-zero cost per queried sequence after paying a one-time fee for model sketching. SHAP zero achieves this by establishing a surprisingly underexplored connection between the Shapley interactions and the Fourier transform of the model. Explaining two genomic models, one trained to predict guide RNA binding and the other to predict DNA repair outcomes, we demonstrate that SHAP zero achieves orders of magnitude reduction in amortized computational cost compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. SHAP zero reveals all microhomologous motifs that are predictive of DNA repair outcome, a finding previously inaccessible due to the combinatorial space of possible high-order feature interactions.</description>

      <title>Robust Time Series Causal Discovery for Agent-Based Model Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent-Based Model (ABM) validation is crucial as it helps ensuring the reliability of simulations, and causal discovery has become a powerful tool in this context. However, current causal discovery methods often face accuracy and robustness challenges when applied to complex and noisy time series data, which is typical in ABM scenarios. This study addresses these issues by proposing a Robust Cross-Validation (RCV) approach to enhance causal structure learning for ABM validation. We develop RCV-VarLiNGAM and RCV-PCMCI, novel extensions of two prominent causal discovery algorithms. These aim to reduce the impact of noise better and give more reliable causal relation results, even with high-dimensional, time-dependent data. The proposed approach is then integrated into an enhanced ABM validation framework, which is designed to handle diverse data and model structures.
  The approach is evaluated using synthetic datasets and a complex simulated fMRI dataset. The results demonstrate greater reliability in causal structure identification. The study examines how various characteristics of datasets affect the performance of established causal discovery methods. These characteristics include linearity, noise distribution, stationarity, and causal structure density. This analysis is then extended to the RCV method to see how it compares in these different situations. This examination helps confirm whether the results are consistent with existing literature and also reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the novel approaches.
  By tackling key methodological challenges, the study aims to enhance ABM validation with a more resilient valuation framework presented. These improvements increase the reliability of model-driven decision making processes in complex systems analysis.</description>

      <title>Geometric Uncertainty of Patient-Specific Blood Vessels and its Impact on Aortic Hemodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of numerical simulations of the vascular system, local geometric uncertainties have not yet been examined in sufficient detail due to model complexity and the associated large numerical effort. Such uncertainties are related to geometric modeling errors resulting from computed tomography imaging, segmentation and meshing. This work presents a methodology to systematically induce local modifications and perform a sufficient number of blood flow simulations to draw statistically relevant conclusions on the most commonly employed quantities of interest, such as flow rates or wall shear stress. The surface of a structured hexahedral mesh of a patient-specific aorta is perturbed by displacement maps defined via Gaussian random fields to stochastically model the local uncertainty of the boundary. Three different cases are studied, with the mean perturbation magnitude of $0.25$, $0.5$ and $1.0~$mm. Valid, locally perturbed meshes are constructed via an elasticity operator that extends surface perturbations into the interior. Otherwise, identical incompressible flow problems are solved on these meshes, taking physiological boundary conditions and Carreau fluid parameters into account. Roughly $300\,000$ three-dimensional non-stationary blood flow simulations are performed for the three different perturbation cases to estimate the probability distributions of the quantities of interest. Convergence studies justify the spatial resolution of the employed meshes. Overall, the results suggest that moderate geometric perturbations result in reasonable engineering accuracy (relative errors in single-digit percentage range) of the quantities of interest, with higher sensitivity for gradient-related measures, noting that the observed errors are not negligible.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Resilience and Scalability in Travel Booking Systems: A Microservices Approach to Fault Tolerance, Load Balancing, and Service Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the inclusion of microservices architecture in the development of scalable and reliable airline reservation systems. Most of the traditional reservation systems are very rigid and centralized which makes them prone to bottlenecks and a single point of failure. As such, systems do not meet the requirements of modern airlines which are dynamic. Microservices offer better resiliency and scalability because the services do not depend on one another and can be deployed independently. The approach is grounded on the Circuit Breaker Pattern to maintain fault tolerance while consuming foreign resources such as flight APIs and payment systems. This avoided the failure propagation to the systems by 60% enabling the systems to function under external failures. Traffic rerouting also bolstered this with a guarantee of above 99.95% uptime in systems where high availability was demanded. To address this, load balancing was used, particularly the Round-Robin method which managed to enhance performance by 35% through the equal distribution of user requests among the service instances. Health checks, as well as monitoring in real-time, helped as well with failure management as they helped to contain failures before the users of the system were affected. The results suggest that the use of microservices led to a 40% increase in system scalability, a 50% decrease in downtime and a support for 30% more concurrent users than the use of monolithic architectures. These findings affirm the capability of microservices in the development of robust and flexible airline ticket booking systems that are responsive to change and recover from external system unavailability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research has made significant progress in optimizing diffusion models for downstream objectives, which is an important pursuit in fields such as graph generation for drug design. However, directly applying these models to graph presents challenges, resulting in suboptimal performance. This paper introduces graph diffusion policy optimization (GDPO), a novel approach to optimize graph diffusion models for arbitrary (e.g., non-differentiable) objectives using reinforcement learning. GDPO is based on an eager policy gradient tailored for graph diffusion models, developed through meticulous analysis and promising improved performance. Experimental results show that GDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance in various graph generation tasks with complex and diverse objectives.

      <description>arXiv:2408.10368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Deep-MacroFin, a comprehensive framework designed to solve partial differential equations, with a particular focus on models in continuous time economics. This framework leverages deep learning methodologies, including conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons and the newly developed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. It is optimized using economic information encapsulated by Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations and coupled algebraic equations. The application of neural networks holds the promise of accurately resolving high-dimensional problems with fewer computational demands and limitations compared to standard numerical methods. This versatile framework can be readily adapted for elementary differential equations, and systems of differential equations, even in cases where the solutions may exhibit discontinuities. Importantly, it offers a more straightforward and user-friendly implementation than existing libraries.</description>
