      <title>Towards Robust Legal Reasoning: Harnessing Logical LLMs in Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legal services rely heavily on text processing. While large language models (LLMs) show promise, their application in legal contexts demands higher accuracy, repeatability, and transparency. Logic programs, by encoding legal concepts as structured rules and facts, offer reliable automation, but require sophisticated text extraction. We propose a neuro-symbolic approach that integrates LLMs' natural language understanding with logic-based reasoning to address these limitations.
  As a legal document case study, we applied neuro-symbolic AI to coverage-related queries in insurance contracts using both closed and open-source LLMs. While LLMs have improved in legal reasoning, they still lack the accuracy and consistency required for complex contract analysis. In our analysis, we tested three methodologies to evaluate whether a specific claim is covered under a contract: a vanilla LLM, an unguided approach that leverages LLMs to encode both the contract and the claim, and a guided approach that uses a framework for the LLM to encode the contract. We demonstrated the promising capabilities of LLM + Logic in the guided approach.</description>

      <title>Requirements for Quality Assurance of AI Models for Early Detection of Lung Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Survival largely depends on tumor stage at diagnosis, and early detection with low-dose CT can significantly reduce mortality in high-risk patients. AI can improve the detection, measurement, and characterization of pulmonary nodules while reducing assessment time. However, the training data, functionality, and performance of available AI systems vary considerably, complicating software selection and regulatory evaluation. Manufacturers must specify intended use and provide test statistics, but they can choose their training and test data, limiting standardization and comparability. Under the EU AI Act, consistent quality assurance is required for AI-based nodule detection, measurement, and characterization.
  This position paper proposes systematic quality assurance grounded in a validated reference dataset, including real screening cases plus phantom data to verify volume and growth rate measurements. Regular updates shall reflect demographic shifts and technological advances, ensuring ongoing relevance. Consequently, ongoing AI quality assurance is vital. Regulatory challenges are also adressed. While the MDR and the EU AI Act set baseline requirements, they do not adequately address self-learning algorithms or their updates. A standardized, transparent quality assessment - based on sensitivity, specificity, and volumetric accuracy - enables an objective evaluation of each AI solution's strengths and weaknesses. Establishing clear testing criteria and systematically using updated reference data lay the groundwork for comparable performance metrics, informing tenders, guidelines, and recommendations.</description>

      <title>Gender Bias in Perception of Human Managers Extends to AI Managers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI becomes more embedded in workplaces, it is shifting from a tool for efficiency to an active force in organizational decision-making. Whether due to anthropomorphism or intentional design choices, people often assign human-like qualities - including gender - to AI systems. However, how AI managers are perceived in comparison to human managers and how gender influences these perceptions remains uncertain. To investigate this, we conducted randomized controlled trials (RCTs) where teams of three participants worked together under a randomly assigned manager - either human or AI - who was presented as male, female, or gender-neutral. The manager's role was to select the best-performing team member for an additional award. Our findings reveal that while participants initially showed no strong preference based on manager type or gender, their perceptions changed significantly after experiencing the award process. As expected, those who received awards rated their managers as more fair, competent, and trustworthy, while those who were not selected viewed them less favorably. However, male managers - both human and AI - were more positively received by awarded participants, whereas female managers, especially female AI managers, faced greater skepticism and negative judgments when they denied rewards. These results suggest that gender bias in leadership extends beyond human managers and towards AI-driven decision-makers. As AI takes on greater managerial roles, understanding and addressing these biases will be crucial for designing fair and effective AI management systems.</description>

      <title>Escaping the Subprime Trap in Algorithmic Lending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disparities in lending to minority applicants persist even as algorithmic lending practices proliferate. Further, disparities in interest rates charged can remain large even when loan applicants from different groups are equally creditworthy. We study the role of risk-management constraints, specifically Value-at-Risk (VaR) constraints, in the persistence of segregation in loan approval decisions. We develop a formal model in which a mainstream (low-interest) bank is more sensitive to variance risk than a subprime (high-interest) bank. If the mainstream bank has an inflated prior belief about the variance of the minority group, it may deny that group credit indefinitely, thus never learning the true risk of lending to that group, while the subprime lender serves this population at higher rates. We formalize this as a "subprime trap" equilibrium. Finally, we show that a small, finite subsidy (or partial guarantee) can help minority groups escape the trap by covering enough of the mainstream bank's downside so that it can afford to lend and learn the minority group's true risk. Once it has sufficiently many data points, it meets its VaR requirement with no further assistance, minority groups are approved for loans by the mainstream bank, and competition drives down the interest rates of subprime lenders.</description>

      <title>FRT Regulation in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper first introduces China's legal framework regulating facial recognition technology (FRT) and analyzes the underlying problems. Although current laws and regulations have restricted the development of FRT under some circumstances, these restrictions may function poorly when the technology is installed by the government or when it is deployed for the purpose of protecting public security. We use two cases to illustrate this asymmetric regulatory model, which can be traced to systematic preferences that existed prior to recent legislative efforts advancing personal data protection. Based on these case studies and evaluation of relevant regulations, this paper explains why China has developed this distinctive asymmetric regulatory model towards FRT specifically and personally data generally.</description>

      <title>To Deepfake or Not to Deepfake: Higher Education Stakeholders' Perceptions and Intentions towards Synthetic Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in deepfake technologies, which use generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to mimic a person's likeness or voice, have led to growing interest in their use in educational contexts. However, little is known about how key stakeholders perceive and intend to use these tools. This study investigated higher education stakeholder perceptions and intentions regarding deepfakes through the lens of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2).
  Using a mixed-methods approach combining survey data (n=174) with qualitative interviews, we found that academic stakeholders demonstrated a relatively low intention to adopt these technologies (M=41.55, SD=34.14) and held complex views about their implementation. Quantitative analysis revealed adoption intentions were primarily driven by hedonic motivation, with a gender-specific interaction in price-value evaluations. Qualitative findings highlighted potential benefits of enhanced student engagement, improved accessibility, and reduced workload in content creation, but concerns regarding the exploitation of academic labour, institutional cost-cutting leading to automation, degradation of relationships in education, and broader societal impacts.
  Based on these findings, we propose a framework for implementing deepfake technologies in higher education that addresses institutional policies, professional development, and equitable resource allocation to thoughtfully integrate AI while maintaining academic integrity and professional autonomy.</description>

      <title>From ChatGPT to DeepSeek: Can LLMs Simulate Humanity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a promising method for exploring complex human social behaviors. However, the application of LLMs in simulations presents significant challenges, particularly regarding their capacity to accurately replicate the complexities of human behaviors and societal dynamics, as evidenced by recent studies highlighting discrepancies between simulated and real-world interactions. We rethink LLM-based simulations by emphasizing both their limitations and the necessities for advancing LLM simulations. By critically examining these challenges, we aim to offer actionable insights and strategies for enhancing the applicability of LLM simulations in human society in the future.</description>

      <title>Responsible AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to advances in large language models, a new type of software agent, the artificial intelligence (AI) agent, has entered the marketplace. Companies such as OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and Salesforce promise their AI Agents will go from generating passive text to executing tasks. Instead of a travel itinerary, an AI Agent would book all aspects of your trip. Instead of generating text or images for social media post, an AI Agent would post the content across a host of social media outlets. The potential power of AI Agents has fueled legal scholars' fears that AI Agents will enable rogue commerce, human manipulation, rampant defamation, and intellectual property harms. These scholars are calling for regulation before AI Agents cause havoc.
  This Article addresses the concerns around AI Agents head on. It shows that core aspects of how one piece of software interacts with another creates ways to discipline AI Agents so that rogue, undesired actions are unlikely, perhaps more so than rules designed to govern human agents. It also develops a way to leverage the computer-science approach to value-alignment to improve a user's ability to take action to prevent or correct AI Agent operations. That approach offers and added benefit of helping AI Agents align with norms around user-AI Agent interactions. These practices will enable desired economic outcomes and mitigate perceived risks. The Article also argues that no matter how much AI Agents seem like human agents, they need not, and should not, be given legal personhood status. In short, humans are responsible for AI Agents' actions, and this Article provides a guide for how humans can build and maintain responsible AI Agents.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Maturity of Cybersecurity Education in Virginia and the Impact of State Level Investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a global shortage of cybersecurity students with the education and experience necessary to fill more than 3 million jobs, cybersecurity education is an international problem. Significant research within this field has explored this problem in depth, identifying a variety of shortcomings in the cybersecurity educational pipeline including lack of certifications, security clearances, and appropriate educational opportunities within institutions of higher education. Additional research has built on this, exploring specific gaps within what cybersecurity opportunities are provided within institutions of higher education. We build an ordinal scale for assessing this, the cybersecurity education maturity model scale (CEMMs), and provide evidence of reliability and validity. We then calculate the CEMMs score for all public four-year universities in the state of Virginia between 2017 and 2025, with 2017 marking a year in which the state started the Commonwealth Cyber Initiative (CCI). We find that the scale proposed provides a consistent and reliable way to compare the cybersecurity offerings available between universities. When comparing year to year average CEMMs score, we find that public four year universities in Virginia are increasing their program offerings in the area of cybersecurity, with potential to make an impact on the cybersecurity jobs gap.</description>

      <title>Teleology-Driven Affective Computing: A Causal Framework for Sustained Well-Being</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Affective computing has made significant strides in emotion recognition and generation, yet current approaches mainly focus on short-term pattern recognition and lack a comprehensive framework to guide affective agents toward long-term human well-being. To address this, we propose a teleology-driven affective computing framework that unifies major emotion theories (basic emotion, appraisal, and constructivist approaches) under the premise that affect is an adaptive, goal-directed process that facilitates survival and development. Our framework emphasizes aligning agent responses with both personal/individual and group/collective well-being over extended timescales. We advocate for creating a "dataverse" of personal affective events, capturing the interplay between beliefs, goals, actions, and outcomes through real-world experience sampling and immersive virtual reality. By leveraging causal modeling, this "dataverse" enables AI systems to infer individuals' unique affective concerns and provide tailored interventions for sustained well-being. Additionally, we introduce a meta-reinforcement learning paradigm to train agents in simulated environments, allowing them to adapt to evolving affective concerns and balance hierarchical goals - from immediate emotional needs to long-term self-actualization. This framework shifts the focus from statistical correlations to causal reasoning, enhancing agents' ability to predict and respond proactively to emotional challenges, and offers a foundation for developing personalized, ethically aligned affective systems that promote meaningful human-AI interactions and societal well-being.</description>

      <title>User Intent to Use DeekSeep for Healthcare Purposes and their Trust in the Large Language Model: Multinational Survey Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as interactive healthcare resources, yet user acceptance remains underexplored. This study examines how ease of use, perceived usefulness, trust, and risk perception interact to shape intentions to adopt DeepSeek, an emerging LLM-based platform, for healthcare purposes. A cross-sectional survey of 556 participants from India, the United Kingdom, and the United States was conducted to measure perceptions and usage patterns. Structural equation modeling assessed both direct and indirect effects, including potential quadratic relationships. Results revealed that trust plays a pivotal mediating role: ease of use exerts a significant indirect effect on usage intentions through trust, while perceived usefulness contributes to both trust development and direct adoption. By contrast, risk perception negatively affects usage intent, emphasizing the importance of robust data governance and transparency. Notably, significant non-linear paths were observed for ease of use and risk, indicating threshold or plateau effects. The measurement model demonstrated strong reliability and validity, supported by high composite reliabilities, average variance extracted, and discriminant validity measures. These findings extend technology acceptance and health informatics research by illuminating the multifaceted nature of user adoption in sensitive domains. Stakeholders should invest in trust-building strategies, user-centric design, and risk mitigation measures to encourage sustained and safe uptake of LLMs in healthcare. Future work can employ longitudinal designs or examine culture-specific variables to further clarify how user perceptions evolve over time and across different regulatory environments. Such insights are critical for harnessing AI to enhance outcomes.</description>

      <title>Discovering Ideologies of the Open Source Software Movement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Encompassing a diverse population of developers, non-technical users, and other stakeholders, open source software (OSS) development has expanded to broader social movements from the initial product development aims. Ideology, as a coherent system of ideas, offers value commitments and normative implications for any social movement, so do OSS ideologies for the open source movement. However, SE literature on OSS ideology is often fragmented or lacks empirical evidence. We thus developed a comprehensive empirical framework of OSS ideology. Following a grounded theory procedure, we collected and analyzed data from 22 OSS practitioners and 41 video recordings of Open Source Initiative (OSI) board members' public narratives. A framework of OSS ideology emerged with six key categories: membership, norms/values, goals, activities, resources, and positions/group relations; each consists of several themes. With this ideological lens, we discussed the implications and insights into the research and practice of open source.</description>

      <title>Data Voids and Warning Banners on Google Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The content moderation systems used by social media sites are a topic of widespread interest and research, but less is known about the use of similar systems by web search engines. For example, Google Search attempts to help its users navigate three distinct types of data voids--when the available search results are deemed low-quality, low-relevance, or rapidly-changing--by placing one of three corresponding warning banners at the top of the search page. Here we collected 1.4M unique search queries shared on social media to surface Google's warning banners, examine when and why those banners were applied, and train deep learning models to identify data voids beyond Google's classifications. Across three data collection waves (Oct 2023, Mar 2024, Sept 2024), we found that Google returned a warning banner for about 1% of our search queries, with substantial churn in the set of queries that received a banner across waves. The low-quality banners, which warn users that their results "may not have reliable information on this topic," were especially rare, and their presence was associated with low-quality domains in the search results and conspiracy-related keywords in the search query. Low-quality banner presence was also inconsistent over short time spans, even when returning highly similar search results. In August 2024, low-quality banners stopped appearing on the SERPs we collected, but average search result quality remained largely unchanged, suggesting they may have been discontinued by Google. Using our deep learning models to analyze both queries and search results in context, we identify 29 to 58 times more low-quality data voids than there were low-quality banners, and find a similar number after the banners had disappeared. Our findings point to the need for greater transparency on search engines' content moderation practices, especially around important events like elections.</description>

      <title>From Perceptions to Decisions: Wildfire Evacuation Decision Prediction with Behavioral Theory-informed LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evacuation decision prediction is critical for efficient and effective wildfire response by helping emergency management anticipate traffic congestion and bottlenecks, allocate resources, and minimize negative impacts. Traditional statistical methods for evacuation decision prediction fail to capture the complex and diverse behavioral logic of different individuals. In this work, for the first time, we introduce FLARE, short for facilitating LLM for advanced reasoning on wildfire evacuation decision prediction, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework that integrates behavioral theories and models to streamline the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and subsequently integrate with memory-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) module to provide accurate evacuation decision prediction and understanding. Our proposed method addresses the limitations of using existing LLMs for evacuation behavioral predictions, such as limited survey data, mismatching with behavioral theory, conflicting individual preferences, implicit and complex mental states, and intractable mental state-behavior mapping. Experiments on three post-wildfire survey datasets show an average of 20.47% performance improvement over traditional theory-informed behavioral models, with strong cross-event generalizability.

      <title>To Patch or Not to Patch: Motivations, Challenges, and Implications for Cybersecurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As technology has become more embedded into our society, the security of modern-day systems is paramount. One topic which is constantly under discussion is that of patching, or more specifically, the installation of updates that remediate security vulnerabilities in software or hardware systems. This continued deliberation is motivated by complexities involved with patching; in particular, the various incentives and disincentives for organizations and their cybersecurity teams when deciding whether to patch. In this paper, we take a fresh look at the question of patching and critically explore why organizations and IT/security teams choose to patch or decide against it (either explicitly or due to inaction). We tackle this question by aggregating and synthesizing prominent research and industry literature on the incentives and disincentives for patching, specifically considering the human aspects in the context of these motives. Through this research, this study identifies key motivators such as organizational needs, the IT/security team's relationship with vendors, and legal and regulatory requirements placed on the business and its staff. There are also numerous significant reasons discovered for why the decision is taken not to patch, including limited resources (e.g., person-power), challenges with manual patch management tasks, human error, bad patches, unreliable patch management tools, and the perception that related vulnerabilities would not be exploited. These disincentives, in combination with the motivators above, highlight the difficult balance that organizations and their security teams need to maintain on a daily basis. Finally, we conclude by discussing implications of these findings and important future considerations.</description>

      <title>Unmasking Gender Bias in Recommendation Systems and Enhancing Category-Aware Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommendation systems are now an integral part of our daily lives. We rely on them for tasks such as discovering new movies, finding friends on social media, and connecting job seekers with relevant opportunities. Given their vital role, we must ensure these recommendations are free from societal stereotypes. Therefore, evaluating and addressing such biases in recommendation systems is crucial. Previous work evaluating the fairness of recommended items fails to capture certain nuances as they mainly focus on comparing performance metrics for different sensitive groups. In this paper, we introduce a set of comprehensive metrics for quantifying gender bias in recommendations. Specifically, we show the importance of evaluating fairness on a more granular level, which can be achieved using our metrics to capture gender bias using categories of recommended items like genres for movies. Furthermore, we show that employing a category-aware fairness metric as a regularization term along with the main recommendation loss during training can help effectively minimize bias in the models' output. We experiment on three real-world datasets, using five baseline models alongside two popular fairness-aware models, to show the effectiveness of our metrics in evaluating gender bias. Our metrics help provide an enhanced insight into bias in recommended items compared to previous metrics. Additionally, our results demonstrate how incorporating our regularization term significantly improves the fairness in recommendations for different categories without substantial degradation in overall recommendation performance.</description>

      <title>FediverseSharing: A Novel Dataset on Cross-Platform Interaction Dynamics between Threads and Mastodon Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional social media platforms, once envisioned as digital town squares, face growing criticism over corporate control, content moderation, and privacy concerns. Events such as Twitter's acquisition(now X) and major policy changes have driven users toward alternative platforms like Mastodon and Threads. However, this diversification has led to user dispersion and fragmented discussions across isolated social media platforms. To address these issues, federation protocols like ActivityPub have been adopted, with Mastodon leading efforts to build decentralized yet interconnected networks. In March 2024, Threads joined this federation by introducing its Fediverse Sharing service, which enables interactions such as posts, replies, and likes between Threads and Mastodon users as if on a unified platform. Building on this development, we introduce FediverseSharing, the first dataset capturing interactions between 20,000+ Threads users and 20,000+ Mastodon users over a ten-month period. This dataset serves as a foundation for studying cross-platform interactions and the impact of federation as previously two separate platforms integrate.</description>

      <title>Defining bias in AI-systems: Biased models are fair models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The debate around bias in AI systems is central to discussions on algorithmic fairness. However, the term bias often lacks a clear definition, despite frequently being contrasted with fairness, implying that an unbiased model is inherently fair. In this paper, we challenge this assumption and argue that a precise conceptualization of bias is necessary to effectively address fairness concerns. Rather than viewing bias as inherently negative or unfair, we highlight the importance of distinguishing between bias and discrimination. We further explore how this shift in focus can foster a more constructive discourse within academic debates on fairness in AI systems.</description>

      <title>Which Contributions Deserve Credit? Perceptions of Attribution in Human-AI Co-Creation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI systems powered by large language models can act as capable assistants for writing and editing. In these tasks, the AI system acts as a co-creative partner, making novel contributions to an artifact-under-creation alongside its human partner(s). One question that arises in these scenarios is the extent to which AI should be credited for its contributions. We examined knowledge workers' views of attribution through a survey study (N=155) and found that they assigned different levels of credit across different contribution types, amounts, and initiative. Compared to a human partner, we observed a consistent pattern in which AI was assigned less credit for equivalent contributions. Participants felt that disclosing AI involvement was important and used a variety of criteria to make attribution judgments, including the quality of contributions, personal values, and technology considerations. Our results motivate and inform new approaches for crediting AI contributions to co-created work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technologies in higher education has raised concerns about academic integrity, assessment practices, and student learning. Banning or blocking GenAI tools has proven ineffective, and punitive approaches ignore the potential benefits of these technologies. This paper presents the findings of a pilot study conducted at British University Vietnam (BUV) exploring the implementation of the Artificial Intelligence Assessment Scale (AIAS), a flexible framework for incorporating GenAI into educational assessments. The AIAS consists of five levels, ranging from 'No AI' to 'Full AI', enabling educators to design assessments that focus on areas requiring human input and critical thinking.
  Following the implementation of the AIAS, the pilot study results indicate a significant reduction in academic misconduct cases related to GenAI, a 5.9% increase in student attainment across the university, and a 33.3% increase in module passing rates. The AIAS facilitated a shift in pedagogical practices, with faculty members incorporating GenAI tools into their modules and students producing innovative multimodal submissions. The findings suggest that the AIAS can support the effective integration of GenAI in HE, promoting academic integrity while leveraging the technology's potential to enhance learning experiences.

      <description>arXiv:2411.11853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have renewed concerns about AI alignment - the consistency between human and AI goals and values. As various jurisdictions enact legislation on AI safety, the concept of alignment must be defined and measured across different domains. This paper proposes an experimental framework to assess whether LLMs adhere to ethical and legal standards in the relatively unexplored context of finance. We prompt twelve LLMs to impersonate the CEO of a financial institution and test their willingness to misuse customer assets to repay outstanding corporate debt. Beginning with a baseline configuration, we adjust preferences, incentives and constraints, analyzing the impact of each adjustment with logistic regression. Our findings reveal significant heterogeneity in the baseline propensity for unethical behavior of LLMs. Factors such as risk aversion, profit expectations, and regulatory environment consistently influence misalignment in ways predicted by economic theory, although the magnitude of these effects varies across LLMs. This paper highlights both the benefits and limitations of simulation-based, ex post safety testing. While it can inform financial authorities and institutions aiming to ensure LLM safety, there is a clear trade-off between generality and cost.</description>

      <title>Unpacking Political Bias in Large Language Models: A Cross-Model Comparison on U.S. Politics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used to generate responses on social topics due to their world knowledge and generative capabilities. Beyond reasoning and generation performance, political bias is an essential issue that warrants attention. Political bias, as a universal phenomenon in human society, may be transferred to LLMs and distort LLMs' behaviors of information acquisition and dissemination with humans, leading to unequal access among different groups of people. To prevent LLMs from reproducing and reinforcing political biases, and to encourage fairer LLM-human interactions, comprehensively examining political bias in popular LLMs becomes urgent and crucial.
  In this study, we systematically measure the political biases in a wide range of LLMs, using a curated set of questions addressing political bias in various contexts. Our findings reveal distinct patterns in how LLMs respond to political topics. For highly polarized topics, most LLMs exhibit a pronounced left-leaning bias. Conversely, less polarized topics elicit greater consensus, with similar response patterns across different LLMs. Additionally, we analyze how LLM characteristics, including release date, model scale, and region of origin affect political bias. The results indicate political biases evolve with model scale and release date, and are also influenced by regional factors of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Pitfalls of Evidence-Based AI Policy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nations across the world are working to govern AI. However, from a technical perspective, there is uncertainty and disagreement on the best way to do this. Meanwhile, recent debates over AI regulation have led to calls for "evidence-based AI policy" which emphasize holding regulatory action to a high evidentiary standard. Evidence is of irreplaceable value to policymaking. However, holding regulatory action to too high an evidentiary standard can lead to systematic neglect of certain risks. In historical policy debates (e.g., over tobacco ca. 1965 and fossil fuels ca. 1985) "evidence-based policy" rhetoric is also a well-precedented strategy to downplay the urgency of action, delay regulation, and protect industry interests. Here, we argue that if the goal is evidence-based AI policy, the first regulatory objective must be to actively facilitate the process of identifying, studying, and deliberating about AI risks. We discuss a set of 15 regulatory goals to facilitate this and show that Brazil, Canada, China, the EU, South Korea, the UK, and the USA all have substantial opportunities to adopt further evidence-seeking policies.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Risks of Large Reasoning Models: A Safety Assessment of R1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid development of large reasoning models, such as OpenAI-o3 and DeepSeek-R1, has led to significant improvements in complex reasoning over non-reasoning large language models~(LLMs). However, their enhanced capabilities, combined with the open-source access of models like DeepSeek-R1, raise serious safety concerns, particularly regarding their potential for misuse. In this work, we present a comprehensive safety assessment of these reasoning models, leveraging established safety benchmarks to evaluate their compliance with safety regulations. Furthermore, we investigate their susceptibility to adversarial attacks, such as jailbreaking and prompt injection, to assess their robustness in real-world applications. Through our multi-faceted analysis, we uncover four key findings: (1) There is a significant safety gap between the open-source R1 models and the o3-mini model, on both safety benchmark and attack, suggesting more safety effort on R1 is needed. (2) The distilled reasoning model shows poorer safety performance compared to its safety-aligned base models. (3) The stronger the model's reasoning ability, the greater the potential harm it may cause when answering unsafe questions. (4) The thinking process in R1 models pose greater safety concerns than their final answers. Our study provides insights into the security implications of reasoning models and highlights the need for further advancements in R1 models' safety to close the gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.00539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The latest pandemic COVID-19 brought governments worldwide to use various containment measures to control its spread, such as contact tracing, social distance regulations, and curfews. Epidemiological simulations are commonly used to assess the impact of those policies before they are implemented. Unfortunately, the scarcity of relevant empirical data, specifically detailed social contact graphs, hampered their predictive accuracy. As this data is inherently privacy-critical, a method is urgently needed to perform powerful epidemiological simulations on real-world contact graphs without disclosing any sensitive~information.
  In this work, we present RIPPLE, a privacy-preserving epidemiological modeling framework enabling standard models for infectious disease on a population's real contact graph while keeping all contact information locally on the participants' devices. As a building block of independent interest, we present PIR-SUM, a novel extension to private information retrieval for secure download of element sums from a database. Our protocols are supported by a proof-of-concept implementation, demonstrating a 2-week simulation over half a million participants completed in 7 minutes, with each participant communicating less than 50 KB.</description>

Abstract: The global economy relies on the flow of goods over supply chain networks, with nodes as firms and edges as transactions between firms. While we may observe these external transactions, they are governed by unseen production functions, which determine how firms internally transform the input products they receive into output products that they sell. In this setting, it can be extremely valuable to infer these production functions, to improve supply chain visibility and to forecast future transactions more accurately. However, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) cannot capture these hidden relationships between nodes' inputs and outputs. Here, we introduce a new class of models for this setting by combining temporal GNNs with a novel inventory module, which learns production functions via attention weights and a special loss function. We evaluate our models extensively on real supply chains data and data generated from our new open-source simulator, SupplySim. Our models successfully infer production functions, outperforming the strongest baseline by 6%-50% (across datasets), and forecast future transactions, outperforming the strongest baseline by 11%-62%</description>

      <title>Identifying Features that Shape Perceived Consciousness in Large Language Model-based AI: A Quantitative Study of Human Responses</title>

Abstract: This study quantitively examines which features of AI-generated text lead humans to perceive subjective consciousness in large language model (LLM)-based AI systems. Drawing on 99 passages from conversations with Claude 3 Opus and focusing on eight features -- metacognitive self-reflection, logical reasoning, empathy, emotionality, knowledge, fluency, unexpectedness, and subjective expressiveness -- we conducted a survey with 123 participants. Using regression and clustering analyses, we investigated how these features influence participants' perceptions of AI consciousness. The results reveal that metacognitive self-reflection and the AI's expression of its own emotions significantly increased perceived consciousness, while a heavy emphasis on knowledge reduced it. Participants clustered into seven subgroups, each showing distinct feature-weighting patterns. Additionally, higher prior knowledge of LLMs and more frequent usage of LLM-based chatbots were associated with greater overall likelihood assessments of AI consciousness. This study underscores the multidimensional and individualized nature of perceived AI consciousness and provides a foundation for better understanding the psychosocial implications of human-AI interaction.</description>

      <title>SOTOPIA-{\Omega}: Dynamic Strategy Injection Learning and Social Instruction Following Evaluation for Social Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the abundance of prior social strategies possessed by humans, there remains a paucity of research dedicated to their transfer and integration into social agents. Our proposed SOTOPIA-{\Omega} framework aims to address and bridge this gap, with a particular focus on enhancing the social capabilities of language agents. This framework dynamically injects multi-step reasoning strategies inspired by negotiation theory and two simple direct strategies into expert agents, thereby automating the construction of a high-quality social dialogue training corpus. Additionally, we introduce the concept of Social Instruction Following (S-IF) and propose two new S-IF evaluation metrics that complement social capability. We demonstrate that several 7B models trained on high-quality corpus not only significantly surpass the expert agent (GPT-4) in achieving social goals but also enhance S-IF performance. Analysis and variant experiments validate the advantages of dynamic construction, which can especially break the agent's prolonged deadlock.</description>
