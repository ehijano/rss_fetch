      <title>COOL Research DAO Whitepaper -- Towards community-owned astrophysics for everyone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysics forms a cornerstone of human curiosity and has revolutionised our understanding of the Universe. However, conventional academic structures often hinder collaboration, transparency, and discovery. We present COOL Research DAO, a next-generation framework for cosmic origins astrophysics research that uses decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) principles to make astrophysics research globally accessible, economically fair, and intellectually open. COOL Research DAO is designed to address four key systemic problems and their manifestations in traditional academic research: general inaccessibility, hierarchical organisation, unfair economic structures, and inefficient knowledge transfer. We describe how these inefficiencies can be addressed using blockchain-based tools and token systems. By fostering bottom-up governance, open-access knowledge networks, and transparent rewards, COOL Research DAO reshapes economic, organisational, and educational paradigms in astrophysics research. Our approach leverages the data-rich and inherently international nature of astrophysics, ensuring a scalable, collaborative platform that welcomes contributions ranging from computational analyses to public outreach. In doing so, we highlight a path toward realising our vision of a truly open research ecosystem, driven by community ownership, intellectual freedom, and shared fascination with our cosmic origins.</description>

      <title>The BVRcIc sky brightness of the Caucasian Mountain Observatory of MSU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyse the measurements of the brightness of the night sky above the CMO SAI MSU in the visible and near-infrared range made in 2019-2014. In 2023-2024 the median zenith brightness of the moonless night sky was 21.31 mag in the B band, 20.63 mag in the V band, 20.15 mag in the Rc band, and 19.11 mag in the Ic band. In 5 years the sky brightness had increased by 0.7 mag in B and V, by 0.45 mag in Rc, and ~0.1 mag in Ic. We found that the brightness growth is mostly (up to ~85%) due to the increasing light pollution from nearby cities, while the remainder can be attributed to the increase of solar activity after the 2019 minimum. We discuss how the sky brightness is influenced by such factors as the airmass and the location of the Sun and the Moon in the sky. A qualitative analysis of the sky emission spectrum has demonstrated the growing role of LED lamps in light pollution. These changes in sky brightness which are only going to get harder favour observations that are less sensitive to the degree of light pollution - IR photometry and spectroscopy and high-resolution optical spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Galaxy infall models for arbitrary velocity directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For most galaxies in the cosmos, our knowledge of their motion is limited to line-of-sight velocities from redshift observations. Peculiar motions on the sky are only measured for a few cases. With increasingly detailed observations, the assumption that line-of-sight velocities suffice for an accurate and precise reconstruction of galaxy kinematics needs to be re-investigated and the impact of perpendicular velocities to be quantified. We analyse the motion of two galaxies with arbitrary velocities, determine their mutual velocity on an arbitrary background, and compare this general relative velocity to the one from line-of-sight components only. The latter are known as ``minor and major infall models'' established by Karachentsev and Kashibadze (2006). Our derivations reveal that the infall models approximate the radial velocity between two galaxies by two different projections employing different information about the system. For galaxies with small angular separations, all infall models agree that the radial velocity is the difference of their line-of-sight velocities. For larger angles, the minor infall model is mostly suitable when perpendicular velocity components are negligible and there is no information about the tangential velocity of the binary. The major infall model is best suitable when the motion is mainly radial and symmetry assumptions cancel the tangential and one perpendicular component. The latter often requires to transition from galaxy binaries to groups or clusters, as we show quantitatively. We give an encompassing overview how the infall models over- and under-estimate general binary or $N$-body motions. We quantify the impact of perpendicular velocity components, sparse sampling, and deviations of the tracer-galaxies from the motion in an embedding gravitational potential which are related to the angular momentum of the structure.

      <title>Incorporating Magnetic Field Characteristics into EUV-Based Automated Segmentation of Coronal Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronal holes (CH) are magnetically open regions that allow hot coronal plasma to escape from the Sun and form the high-speed solar wind. This wind can interact with Earth's magnetic field. For this reason, developing an accurate understanding of CH regions is vital for understanding space weather and its effects on Earth. The process of identifying CH regions typically relies on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imagery, leveraging the fact that CHs appear dark at these wavelengths. Accurate identification of CHs in EUV, however, can be difficult due to a variety of factors, including stray light from nearby regions, limb brightening, and the presence of filaments (which also appear dark, but are not sources of solar wind). In order to overcome these issues, this work incorporates photospheric magnetic field data into a classical EUV-based segmentation algorithm based on the active contours without edges (ACWE) segmentation method. In this work magnetic field data are incorporated directly into the segmentation process, serving both as a method for removing non-CH regions in advance, and as a method to constrain evolution of the boundary which identifies the CH boundary. This reduces the presence of filaments while simultaneously allowing the segmentation to include CH regions that may be difficult to identify due to the aforementioned inconsistent intensities.</description>

      <title>Systematic opacity calculations for kilonovae -- II. Improved atomic data for singly ionized lanthanides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lanthanides play most important roles in the opacities for kilonova, ultraviolet-optical-infrared emission from neutron star mergers. Although several efforts have been made to construct atomic data, the accuracy in the opacity is not fully assessed and understood. In this paper, we perform atomic calculations for singly ionized lanthanides with improved strategies, aiming at understanding the physics of the lanthanide opacities in kilonova ejecta and necessary accuracy in atomic data. Our results show systematically lower energy level distributions as compared with our previous study (Paper I). As a result, the opacities evaluated with our new results are higher by a factor of up to 3 - 10, depending on the element and wavelength range. For a lanthanide-rich element mixture, our results give a higher opacity than that in Paper I by a factor of about 1.5. We also present opacities by using the results of ab-initio atomic calculations by using Grasp2K code. In general, our new opacities show good agreements with those with ab-initio calculations. We identify that structure of the lanthanide opacities are controlled by transition arrays among several configurations, for which derivation of accurate energy level distribution is important to obtain reliable opacities.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Mitigating Machine Learning Biases for the Gravitational-wave Detection Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matched-filtering is a long-standing technique for the optimal detection of known signals in stationary Gaussian noise. However, it has known departures from optimality when operating on unknown signals in real noise and suffers from computational inefficiencies in its pursuit to near-optimality. A compelling alternative that has emerged in recent years to address this problem is deep learning. Although it has shown significant promise when applied to the search for gravitational-waves in detector noise, we demonstrate the existence of a multitude of learning biases that hinder generalisation and detection performance. Our work identifies the sources of a set of 11 interconnected biases present in the supervised learning of the gravitational-wave detection problem, and contributes mitigation tactics and training strategies to concurrently address them. We introduce, Sage, a machine-learning based binary black hole search pipeline. We evaluate our pipeline on the injection study presented in the Machine Learning Gravitational-Wave Search Challenge and show that Sage detects ~11.2% more signals than the benchmark PyCBC analysis at a false alarm rate of one per month in O3a noise. Moreover, we also show that it can detect ~48.29% more signals than the previous best performing machine-learning pipeline on the same dataset. We empirically prove that our pipeline has the capability to effectively handle out-of-distribution noise power spectral densities and reject non-Gaussian transient noise artefacts. By studying machine-learning biases and conducting empirical investigations to understand the reasons for performance improvement/degradation, we aim to address the need for interpretability of machine-learning methods for gravitational-wave detection.

      <title>Neural network method to search for long transient gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02391v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new method to search for long transient gravitational waves signals, like those expected from fast spinning newborn magnetars, in interferometric detector data. Standard search techniques are computationally unfeasible (matched filtering) or very demanding (sub-optimal semi-coherent methods). We explored a different approach by means of machine learning paradigms, to define a fast and inexpensive procedure. We used convolutional neural networks to develop a classifier that is able to discriminate between the presence or the absence of a signal. To complement the classification and enhance its effectiveness, we also developed a denoiser. We studied the performance of both networks with simulated colored noise, according to the design noise curve of LIGO interferometers. We show that the combination of the two models is crucial to increase the chance of detection. Indeed, as we decreased the signal initial amplitude (from $10^{-22}$ down to $10^{-23}$) the classification task became more difficult. In particular, we could not correctly tag signals with an initial amplitude of $2 \times 10^{-23}$ without using the denoiser. By studying the performance of the combined networks, we found a good compromise between the search false alarm rate (2$\%$) and efficiency (90$\%$) for a single interferometer. In addition, we demonstrated that our method is robust with respect to changes in the power law describing the time evolution of the signal frequency. Our results highlight the computationally low cost of this method to generate triggers for long transient signals. The study carried out in this work lays the foundations for further improvements, with the purpose of developing a pipeline able to perform systematic searches of long transient signals.</description>

      <title>Multi-Point Hermite Methods for the N-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical integration methods are central to the study of self-gravitating systems, particularly those comprised of many bodies or otherwise beyond the reach of analytical methods. Predictor-corrector schemes, both multi-step methods and those based on 2-point Hermite interpolation, have found great success in the simulation of star clusters and other collisional systems. Higher-order methods, such as those based on Gaussian quadratures and Richardson extrapolation, have also proven popular for high-accuracy integrations of few-body systems, particularly those that may undergo close encounters. This work presents a family of high-order schemes based on multi-point Hermite interpolation. When applied as a multi-step multi-derivative schemes, these can be seen as generalizing both Adams-Bashforth-Moulton methods and 2-point Hermite methods; I present results for the 6th-, 9th-, and 12th-order 3-point schemes applied in this manner using variable time steps. In a cluster-like test problem, the 3-point 6th-order predictor-corrector scheme matches or outperforms the standard 2-point 4th-order Hermite scheme at negligible O(N) cost. I also present a number of high-order time-symmetric schemes up to 18th order, which have the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of long-duration simulations.</description>

      <title>Multi-Target Spacecraft Mission Design using Convex Optimization and Binary Integer Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimal design of multi-target rendezvous and flyby missions is challenging due to the combination of traditional spacecraft trajectory optimization and high-dimensional combinatorial problems. This often requires large-scale global search techniques or simplified approximations that rely on manual tuning to be performant. While global search techniques are typically computationally expensive, limiting their use in time- or cost-constrained scenarios, this work proposes a computationally efficient nested-loop approach. The problem is split into separate combinatorial and optimal control subproblems: the combinatorial problem is solved using Binary Integer Programming (BIP) with a fixed rendezvous time schedule, while the optimal control problem is handled with adaptive-mesh Sequential Convex Programming (SCP), which also optimizes the time schedule. By iterating these processes in a nested-loop structure, the approach can efficiently find high-quality solutions. When, applied to the Global Trajectory Optimization Competition 12 (GTOC 12) problem, this method results in several new best-known solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to an intrinsic geometrical classification of three-mirror telescopes. The problem is formulated as the study of the connected components of a semi-algebraic set. Under first order approximation, we give the general expression of the transfer matrix of a reflexive optical system. Thanks to this representation, we express the semi-algebraic set for focal telescopes and afocal telescopes as the set of non-degenerate real solutions of first order optical conditions. Then, in order to study the topology of these sets, we address the problem of counting and describe their connected components. In a same time, we introduce a topological invariant which encodes the topological features of the solutions. For systems composed of three mirrors, we give the semi-algebraic description of the connected components of the set and show that the topological invariant is exact.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fault Diagnosis in GWAC: A Monitoring System for Telescope Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ground-based Wide-Angle Cameras array (GWAC) necessitates the integration of over 100 hardware devices, more than 100 servers, and upwards of 2500 software modules, all synchronized within a 3-second imaging cycle. However, the complexity of real-time and high concurrency processing of big data have historically resulted in a substantial failure rate, with estimated observation efficiency of less than 50% in 2023. To address these challenges, we developed a monitoring system aimed at enhancing fault diagnosis efficiency. The system features two innovative monitoring views: state evolution monitoring and transient lifecycle monitoring. These, combined with instantaneous state monitoring and key parameter monitoring views, create a comprehensive and holistic monitoring strategy. This paper details the system's architecture, data collection methods, and the design philosophy of monitoring views. After a year of practical fault diagnostics, the system has demonstrated the ability to identify and localize faults within minutes, achieving fault localization speeds nearly ten times faster than traditional methods. Additionally, the system's design exhibits high generalizability, making them applicable to other telescope array systems.</description>

      <title>Large-kernel Convolutional Neural Networks for Wide Parameter-Space Searches of Continuous Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity of wide-parameter-space searches for continuous gravitational waves (CWs) is limited by their high computational cost. Deep learning is being studied as an alternative method to replace various aspects of a CW search. In previous work arXiv:2305.01057[gr-qc], new design principles were presented for deep neural network (DNN) search of CWs and such DNNs were trained to perform a targeted search with matched filtering sensitivity. In this paper, we adapt these design principles to build a DNN architecture for wide parameter-space searches in 10 days of data from two detectors (H1 and L1). We train a DNN for each of the benchmark cases: six all-sky searches and eight directed searches at different frequencies in the search band of 20 - 1000 Hz. We compare our results to the DNN sensitivity achieved from Dreissigacker and Prix arXiv:2005.04140[gr-qc] and find that our trained DNNs are more sensitive in all the cases. The absolute improvement in detection probability ranges from 6.5% at 20 Hz to 38% at 1000 Hz in the all-sky cases and from 1.5% at 20 Hz to 59.4% at 500 Hz in the directed cases. An all-sky DNN trained on the entire search band of 20 - 1000 Hz shows a high sensitivity at all frequencies providing a proof of concept for training a single DNN to perform the entire search. We also study the generalization of the DNN performance to signals with different signal amplitude, frequency and the dependence of the DNN sensitivity on sky position.</description>

      <title>An automated occultation network for gravitational mapping of the trans-neptunian solar system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of an array of O(100) small fixed telescopes, aligned along a meridian and automated to measure millions of occultations of Gaia stars by minor planets, to constrain gravitational signatures from a "Planet X" mass in the outer solar system. The accuracy of center-of-mass tracking for the occulters is limited by photon noise, uncertainties in asteroid shapes, and Gaia's astrometry of the occulted stars. Using both parametric calculations and survey simulations, we assess the total information obtainable from occultation measurements of main-belt asteroids (MBAs), Jovian Trojans and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). We find that MBAs are the optimal target population due to their higher occultation rates and abundance of objects above LSST detection thresholds. A 10-year survey of occultations by MBAs and Trojans using an array of 200 40 cm telescopes at 5 km separation would achieve $5\sigma$ sensitivity to the gravitational tidal field of a $5M_\oplus$ Planet X at 800 AU for $&gt;90\%$ of potential sky locations. This configuration corresponds to an initial cost of $\approx $15 million. While the occultation survey's sensitivity to tidal forces improves rapidly with increasing number of telescopes, sensitivity to a Planet X becomes limited by degeneracy with the uncertain masses of large moonless TNOs. The 200-telescope survey would additionally detect $\approx $1800 TNO occultations, providing detailed shape, size, and albedo information. The survey would also measure the Yarkovski effect on many individual MBAs, measure the masses of many asteroids involved in mutual gravitational deflections, and enable better searches for primordial black holes and departures from General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Evolutionary Fits for Jupiter and Saturn Incorporating Fuzzy Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the recent realization that there likely are stably-stratified regions in the interiors of both Jupiter and Saturn, we construct new non-adiabatic, inhomogeneous evolutionary models with the same microphysics for each that result at the present time in respectable fits for all major bulk observables for both planets. These include the effective temperature, radius, atmospheric heavy-element and helium abundances (including helium rain), and the lower-order gravity moments J2 and J4. The models preserve from birth most of an extended "fuzzy" heavy-element core. Our predicted atmospheric helium mass fraction for Saturn is ~0.2, close to some measured estimates, but in disagreement with some published predictions. To preserve a fuzzy core from birth, the interiors of both planets must start out at lower entropies than would be used for traditional "hot start" adiabatic models, though the initial exterior mantle entropies can range from hot to warm start values. We do not see a helium ocean in Saturn's interior, and both models have inner envelopes with significant Brunt-Vaisala frequencies; this region for Saturn at the current epoch is more extended and in it, the Brunt is larger. The total heavy-element mass fraction in Jupiter and in Saturn is determined to be ~14% and ~26%, respectively, though there is some play in these determinations.</description>

      <title>The PLATO field selection process. II. Characterization of LOPS2, the first long-pointing field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) is an ESA M-class mission to be launched by the end of 2026 to discover and characterize transiting planets around bright and nearby stars, and in particular habitable rocky planets hosted by solar-like stars. Over the mission lifetime, an average of 8% of the science data rate will be allocated to Guest Observer programs (GOs) selected by ESA through public calls, hence it is essential for the community to know in advance where the observing fields will be located. In a previous paper, we identified two preliminary long-pointing fields (LOPN1 and LOPS1) for PLATO, respectively in the northern and southern hemisphere. Here we present LOPS2, a slightly adjusted version of the southern field that has recently been selected by the PLATO Science Working Team as the first field to be observed by PLATO for at least two continuous years, following the scientific requirements. In this paper, we describe the astrophysical content of LOPS2 in detail, including known planetary systems, bright/variable/binary stars, clusters and synergies with other current and future facilities.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Approach to Inferring Accretion Signatures in Young Stellar Objects: A Case Study with VIRUS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mass accretion rates of young stellar objects (YSOs) are key to understanding how stars form, how their circumstellar disks evolve, and even how planets form. We develop a Bayesian framework to determine the accretion rates of a sample of 15 YSOs using archival data from the VIRUS spectrograph ($R \sim 800$, 3500-5500\r{A}) on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. We are publicly releasing our developed tool, dubbed nuts-for-ysos, as a Python package which can also be applied to other spectroscopic datasets. The nuts-for-ysos code fits a simple accretion model to the near-UV and optical continuum of each VIRUS spectrum. Our Bayesian approach aims to identify correlations between model parameters using the No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). Moreover, this approach self-consistently incorporates all parameter uncertainties, allowing for a thorough estimation of the probability distribution for accretion rate not accomplished in previous works. Using nuts-for-ysos, we derive accretion rates of each YSO. We then verify the reliability of our method by comparing to results separately derived from only the spectral emission lines, and to results from earlier studies of the Lupus, Chamaeleon I, and NGC1333 regions. Finally, we discuss what qualitative trends, covariances, and degeneracies were found among model parameters. The technique developed in this paper is a useful improvement that can be applied in the future to larger samples of YSOs observed by VIRUS or other spectrographs.</description>
