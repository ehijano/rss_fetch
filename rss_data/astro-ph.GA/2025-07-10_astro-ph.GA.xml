      <title>Empirical Calibration of Na I D and Other Absorption Lines as Tracers of High-Redshift Neutral Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations of massive galaxies at z &gt; 2 have detected blueshifted absorption in Na I D and other resonant absorption lines, indicative of strong gas outflows in the neutral phase. However, the measured mass outflow rates are highly uncertain because JWST observations can only probe the column density of trace elements such as sodium, while most of the gas is in the form of hydrogen. The conversion between the column density of sodium and that of hydrogen is based on observations of gas clouds within the Milky Way, and has not been directly tested for massive galaxies at high redshift. In order to test this conversion, we study a unique system consisting of a massive quiescent galaxy (J1439B) at z = 2.4189 located at a projected distance of 38 physical kpc from the bright background quasar QSO J1439. The neutral outflow from the galaxy is observed as a sub-damped Lyman-alpha absorber in the spectrum of the background quasar, which enables a direct measurement of the hydrogen column density from Lyman transitions. We obtain new near-infrared spectroscopy with Magellan/FIRE and detect Na I D and other resonant absorption lines from Mg II, Mg I, and Fe II. We are thus able to derive new, empirical calibrations between the column density of trace elements and the hydrogen column density, that can be used to estimate the mass and the rate of neutral gas outflows in other massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift. The calibration we derive for Na I is only 30% lower than the local relation that is typically assumed at high redshift, confirming that the neutral outflows observed with JWST at z &gt; 2 are able to remove a large amount of gas and are thus likely to play a key role in galaxy quenching. However, using the local calibration for Mg II yields an order-of-magnitude discrepancy compared to the empirical calibration, possibly because of variations in the dust depletion.</description>

      <title>Correlations between Dust Extinction Features across All Wavelength Scales: From Diffuse Interstellar Bands to R(V)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding variations in the dust extinction curve is imperative for using dust as a tracer of local structure in the interstellar medium, understanding dust chemistry, and observational color corrections where dust is a nuisance parameter. However, the extinction curve is complicated and exhibits features across a wide range of wavelength scales, from narrow atomic lines and diffuse interstellar bands ("DIBs"), to intermediate-scale and very broad structures ("ISS" and "VBS"), and the overall slope of the optical extinction curve, parameterized by R(V). Robust, population-level studies of variations in these features are only now possible with large, all-sky, spectroscopic surveys. However, these features are often studied independently because they require drastically different spectral resolution. In this work, we couple features with disparate wavelength scales by cross-matching precision catalogs of DIB measurements from APOGEE and Gaia RVS with low-resolution extinction-curve measurements from Gaia XP. Using this combination, we show that there are meaningful correlations between the strengths of extinction-curve features across all wavelength scales. We present a model that statistically explains part of the excess scatter in DIB strength versus extinction, and we show variation in line shapes of two DIBs as a function of R(V). We find that most DIBs increase in strength with increasing R(V) and/or increasing strength of the ISS, though we found one DIB that anomalously decreases in strength with increasing R(V). Using the behavior of the ensemble of DIBs in APOGEE, we present this as the first evidence of systematic chemical variation accompanying R(V) variation.</description>

      <title>The Balmer Break and Optical Continuum of Little Red Dots From Super-Eddington Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical origin of Little Red Dots (LRDs)--compact extragalactic sources with red rest-optical continua and broad Balmer lines--remains elusive. The redness of LRDs is likely intrinsic, suggesting optically thick gas emitting at a characteristic effective temperature of $\sim5000{\rm~K}$. Meanwhile, many LRD spectra exhibit a Balmer break, often attributed to absorption by a dense gas shell surrounding an AGN. Using semi-analytical atmosphere models and radiation transport calculations, we show that a super-Eddington accretion system can give rise to a Balmer break and a red optical color simultaneously, without invoking external gas absorption for the break or dust reddening. The break originates from a discontinuity in opacity across the Balmer limit, similar to that of early-type stars, but the lower photosphere density of super-Eddington systems, $\rho&lt;10^{-9}{\rm~g~cm^{-3}}$, implies a significant opacity contrast even at a cool photosphere temperature of $\sim5000{\rm~K}$. Furthermore, while accretion in the form of a standard thin disk requires fine tuning to match the optical color of LRDs, an alternative scenario of a geometrically thick, roughly spherical accretion flow implies an effective temperature $4000{\rm~K}\lesssim T_{\rm eff}\lesssim6000{\rm~K}$ that is very insensitive to the accretion rate (analogous to the Hayashi line in stellar models). The continuum spectra from the latter scenario align with the Balmer break and optical color of currently known LRDs. We discuss predictions of our model and the prospects for more realistic spectra based on super-Eddington accretion simulations.</description>

      <title>B-fields And dust in interstelLar fiLAments using Dust POLarization (BALLAD-POL): IV. Grain alignment mechanisms in Cocoon Nebula (IC 5146) using polarization observations from JCMT/POL-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarization of starlight and thermal dust emission from aligned non-spherical grains provides a powerful tool for tracing magnetic field morphologies and strengths in diffuse interstellar medium to star-forming regions, and constraining dust grain properties and their alignment mechanisms. However, the physics of grain alignment is not yet fully understood. The alignment based on RAdiative Torques (RATs), known as RAT Alignment or RAT-A mechanism is the most acceptable mechanism. In this work, we investigate the grain alignment mechanisms in F13 (F13N and F13C) and F13S filamentary regions of the Cocoon Nebula (IC 5146) using polarized thermal dust emission observations from JCMT/POL-2 at 850 $\mu$m. We find that the polarization fraction decreases with increasing total intensity and gas column density in each region, termed as polarization hole. We investigate for any role of magnetic field tangling on the observed polarization hole by estimating the polarization angle dispersion function. Our study finds that the polarization hole is not significantly influenced by magnetic field tangling, but majorly due to decrease in RAT alignment efficiency of grains in denser regions. To test whether RAT-A mechanism can reproduce the observational results, we estimate minimum alignment size of grains using RAT theory. Our study finds strong evidence for RAT-A mechanism that can explain the polarization hole. We also find potential hints that the observed higher polarization fractions in some regions of F13 filament can be due to combined effects of both suprathermal rotation by RATs and enhanced magnetic relaxation, supporting the Magnetically-Enhanced RAT (M-RAT) mechanism.</description>

      <title>The Open Cluster Chemical Abundances and Mapping Survey: VIII. Galactic Chemical Gradient and Azimuthal Analysis from SDSS/MWM DR19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Open Cluster Chemical Abundances and Mapping (OCCAM) survey seeks to curate a large, comprehensive, uniform dataset of open clusters and member stars to constrain key Galactic parameters. This eighth entry from the OCCAM survey, based on the newly released SDSS-V/MWM Data Release 19 (DR19), has established a sample of 164 high quality open clusters that are used to constrain the radial and azimuthal gradients of the Milky Way. The DR19 cluster sample [Fe/H] abundances are roughly consistent with measurements from other large-scale spectroscopic surveys. However, the gradients we calculate deviate considerably for some elements. We find an overall linear Galactic radial [Fe/H] gradient of $-0.075 \pm 0.006$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ using the cluster's current Galactocentric Radius ($R_{GC}$) and a gradient of $-0.068 \pm 0.005$ dex kpc$^-1$ with respect to the cluster's guiding center radius. We do not find strong evidence for significant evolution of the differential element gradients ([X/Fe]) investigated here (O, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Na, Al, K, Ce, Nd). For the first time using the OCCAM sample we have sufficient numbers of clusters to investigate Galactic azimuthal variations. In this work, we do find evidence of azimuthal variations in the measured radial abundance gradient in the Galactic disk using our open cluster sample.</description>

      <title>Orientation of galaxy spins relative to filaments of the large-scale structure of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of galaxy formation posits a clear correlation between the spin of galaxies and the orientation of the elements of the large-scale structure of the Universe, particularly cosmic filaments. A substantial number of observational and modelling studies have been undertaken with the aim of identifying the dependence of spin orientation on the components of the large-scale structure. However, the findings of these studies remain contradictory. In this paper, we present an analysis of the orientation of the spins of 2 861 galaxies with respect to the filaments of the large-scale structure of the Universe. All galaxies in our sample have an inclination to the line of sight greater than 85 degrees, enabling an unambiguous determination of the spin axis direction in space. We investigate the alignment of galaxy spin axes relative to cosmic web filaments as a function of various properties for galaxies. Our results reveal a statistically significant tendency for the galaxy spin axes to align along the filament axes of the large-scale structure.</description>

      <title>The Peculiar Mini-Halo in the Shapley Supercluster Member Abell 3558</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-band study of the diffuse emission in the galaxy cluster Abell 3558, located in the core of the Shapley Supercluster. Using new MeerKAT UHF-Band and uGMRT Band-3 observations, and published MeerKAT L-band and ASKAP 887 MHz data, we perform a detailed analysis of the diffuse emission in the cluster centre. We complement with XMM-Newton X-ray information for a thorough study of the connection between the thermal and non-thermal properties of the cluster. We find that the diffuse radio emission in the cluster centre is more extended than published earlier, with a previously undetected extension spanning 100 kpc towards the north beyond the innermost cold front, increasing the total size of the emission to 550 kpc, and shows a clear spatial correlation with the X-ray features. The overall radio spectrum is steep ($\alpha_{\rm 400\,MHz}^{\rm 1569\,MHz}=1.18\pm0.10$), with local fluctuations which show several connections with the X-ray surface brightness, cold fronts, and residual emission. The point-to-point correlation between the radio and X-ray surface brightness is sub-linear, and steepens with increasing frequency. We discuss the classification of the diffuse emission considering its overall properties, those of the ICM, and the existing scaling laws between the radio and X-ray quantities in galaxy clusters. We conclude that it is a mini-halo, powered by turbulent (re)-acceleration induced by sloshing motions within the cluster region delimited by the cold fronts, and it supports the picture of a known minor merger between A\,3558 and the group SC\,1327--312 with mass ratio 5:1.</description>

      <title>Detecting Galactic Rings in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys with Semi-Supervised Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ring structures of disk galaxies are vital for understanding galaxy evolution and dynamics. However, due to the scarcity of ringed galaxies and challenges in their identification, traditional methods often struggle to efficiently obtain statistically significant samples. To address this, this study employs a novel semi-supervised deep learning model, GC-SWGAN, aimed at identifying galaxy rings from high-resolution images of the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. We selected over 5,000 confirmed ringed galaxies from the Catalog of Southern Ringed Galaxies (CSRG) and the Northern Ringed Galaxies from the GZ2 catalog (GZ2-CNRG), both verified by morphology expert R. J. Buta, to create an annotated training set. Additionally, we incorporated strictly selected non-ringed galaxy samples from the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset and utilized unlabelled data from DESI Legacy Surveys to train our model. Through semi-supervised learning, the model significantly reduced reliance on extensive annotated data while enhancing robustness and generalization. On the test set, it demonstrated exceptional performance in identifying ringed galaxies. With a probability threshold of 0.5, the classification accuracy reached 97\%, with precision and recall for ringed galaxies at 94\% and 93\%, respectively. Building on these results, we predicted 750,000 galaxy images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys with r-band apparent magnitudes less than 17.0 and redshifts in the range 0.0005 &lt; z &lt; 0.25, compiling the largest catalog of ringed galaxies to date, containing 62,962 galaxies with ring structures. This catalog provides essential data for subsequent research on the formation mechanisms and evolutionary history of galaxy rings.</description>

      <title>The Gaia RVS Benchmark Stars. III . Confirmed and New High Radial Velocity Stars From Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-velocity stars are interesting targets to unveil the formation of the Milky Way. In fact they can be recently accreted from an infalling dwarf galaxies or they can be the result of a turbulent merging of galaxies. Gaia is providing the community a way to select stars for their kinematics and the radial velocity, one of the speed components, is derived from the Gaia RVS spectrum. High absolute radial velocity values are sensitive to be false positive. They are rare and as such they are more easily impacted than lower velocity stars, by contamination by very low SNR spurious measures. We here investigate a sample of 26 stars with Gaia absolute radial velocity in excess of 500___km/s with spectroscopic follow-up observations with UVES. For all but one star the extreme radial velocity is confirmed and these stars are all metal-poor and, as expected, enhanced in the elements. The complete chemical inventory confirm the large star-to-star scatter for the heavy elements and their on average larger ratio over iron with respect to the Sun, in agreement with the literature.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fields and cosmic rays in M31. II. Strength and distribution of the magnetic field components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intensities of total, linearly polarized, and unpolarized synchrotron emission are measures for the strengths of total, ordered, and isotropic turbulent fields in the sky plane. Faraday rotation measures (RMs) provide a model of the regular field. The quadratic difference between ordered and regular field strengths yields the strength of the anisotropic turbulent field. - Based on observations of M31 at 3.6 cm, 6.2 cm, and 20.5 cm wavelengths and assuming equipartition between the energy densities of total magnetic fields and total cosmic rays, we measured average equipartition strengths of the magnetic field in the emission torus of M31 of 6.3\pm\0.2 \muG for the total, 5.4\pm0.2 \muG for the isotropic turbulent, and 3.2\pm0.3 \muG for the ordered field in the sky plane. The average strength of the axisymmetric regular field, Breg, is 2.0\pm0.5 \muG and remains almost constant between 7 kpc and 12 kpc radius. Quadratic subtraction of the component Breg,perp in the sky plane from the ordered field Bord,perp yields the strength of the anisotropic turbulent field Ban,perp, which is 2.7\pm0.7 \muG. - The average strength of the regular field is about 40% smaller than the equipartition strength of the ordered field, which is consistent with the assumption of equipartition. The almost constant ratio between regular and isotropic turbulent fields of about 0.39 is consistent with present-day dynamo models. The almost constant ratio between anisotropic and isotropic turbulent fields of about 0.57 indicates that anisotropic turbulent fields are generated by the shearing of isotropic turbulent fields. - The average magnetic energy density is about five times larger than the thermal energy density of the diffuse warm ionized gas, while the magnetic energy density is similar to the kinetic energy density of turbulent motions of the neutral gas.</description>

      <title>Why Jet Power and Star Formation Are Uncorrelated in Active Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet luminosity from active galaxies and the rate of star formation have recently been found to be uncorrelated observationally. We show how to understand this in the context of a model in which powerful AGN jets enhance star formation for up to hundreds of millions of years while jet power decreases in time, followed by a longer phase in which star formation is suppressed but coupled to jet power increasing with time. We also highlight characteristic differences depending on environment richness in a way that is also compatible with the observed SEDs of high redshift radio galaxies. While the absence of a direct correlation between jet power and star formation rate emerges naturally, our framework allows us to also predict the environment richness, range of excitation and redshift values of radio AGN in the jet power-star formation rate plane.</description>

      <title>CO desorption from interstellar icy grains induced by IR excitation of superhydrogenated PAHs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) radiation dominates dense, interstellar clouds, yet its effect on icy grains remains largely unexplored. Its potential role in driving the photodesorption of volatile species from such grains has recently been demonstrated, providing a crucial link between the solid state reservoir of molecules and the gas phase. In this work, we investigate IR-induced photodesorption of CO for astrophysically relevant ice systems containing perhydropyrene (PHP). This fully superhydrogenated version of pyrene is used as an analogue for large carbonaceous molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and related species, as well as hydrogenated carbonaceous grains. The abundance and range of strong IR absorption bands of these carbonaceous species make them interesting candidates for IR-induced effects. We present IR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric measurements probing the effects of IR radiation on two ice systems: a layered ice with CO on top of PHP, and a CO:PHP mixed ice. These ices were irradiated with IR radiation from the FELIX IR Free Electron Laser (FEL) FEL-2. In accordance with previous studies, we confirm that direct excitation of CO is not an efficient pathway to CO desorption, indicating that another energy dissipation mechanism exists. We demonstrate that vibrational excitation of the PHP CH stretching modes leads to efficient CO photodesorption. The derived photodesorption yields are an order of magnitude higher for the layered than the mixed system and comparable to those previously obtained for CO photodesorption from CO on amorphous solid water upon excitation of H$_2$O vibrational modes. Our results indicate that IR excitation of carbonaceous molecules and grains in dense clouds could potentially play an important role in the desorption of volatile species such as CO from icy grains.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots from Small-Scale Primordial Black Hole Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have identified a class of compact galaxies at high redshifts ($4 \lesssim z \lesssim 11$), dubbed "little red dots" (LRDs). The supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of $10^{5-8}{\rm\,M}_{\odot}$ in LRDs favor a heavy-seed origin. We propose a mechanism for their formation: Clusters of primordial black holes, formed through long-short mode coupling on small scales in the early Universe, undergo sequential mergers over extended timescales. This mechanism can evade cosmic microwave background distortions and result in heavy-seed SMBHs via runaway mergers. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to solve the Smoluchowski coagulation equation and determine the runaway merging timescale. The resulting stochastic gravitational wave background offers a distinct signature of this process, and the forming SMBHs can be highly spinning at their formation due to the spin residual of the cluster from tidal fields. This mechanism may explain the rapidly spinning SMBHs in LRDs under the assumption of obscured active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Mass Distribution of Binary Black Hole Mergers from Young and Old Dense Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense star clusters are thought to contribute significantly to the merger rates of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. We combine $N$-body dynamic models of realistic dense star clusters with cluster formation histories to estimate the merger rate distribution as a function of primary mass for merging BBHs formed in these environments. It has been argued that dense star clusters -- most notably old globular clusters -- predominantly produce BBH mergers with primary masses $M_p\approx30\,M_{\odot}$. We show that dense star clusters forming at lower redshifts -- and thus having higher metallicities -- naturally produce lower-mass BBH mergers. We find that cluster BBH mergers span a wide range of primary mass, from about $6\,M_{\odot}$ to above $100\,M_{\odot}$, with a peak near $8\,M_{\odot}$, reproducing the overall merger rate distribution inferred from gravitational wave detections. Our results show that most low-mass BBH mergers (about $95\%$ with $M_p\lesssim 20\,M_{\odot}$) originate in metal-rich ($Z \sim Z_{\odot}$) dense star clusters, while more massive BBH mergers form predominately in metal-poor globular clusters. We also discuss the role of hierarchical mergers in shaping the BBH mass distribution. Gravitational wave detection of dynamically-formed low-mass BBH mergers -- potentially identifiable by features such as isotropic spin distributions -- may serve as probes of cluster formation histories in metal-rich environments at low redshifts.</description>

      <title>IXPE Observations of the Blazar Mrk 501 in 2022: A Multiwavelength View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The blazar Markarian 501 (Mrk 501) was observed on three occasions over a 4-month period between 2022 March and 2022 July with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). In this paper, we report for the first time on the third IXPE observation, performed between 2022 July 9 and 12, during which IXPE detected a linear polarization degree of $\Pi_X=6\pm2$ per cent at a polarization angle, measured east of north, of $\Psi_X=143^\circ\pm11^\circ$ within the 2-8 keV X-ray band. The X-ray polarization angle and degree during this observation are consistent with those obtained during the first two observations. The chromaticity of the polarization across radio, optical, and X-ray bands is likewise consistent with the result from the simultaneous campaigns during the first two observations. Furthermore, we present two types of models to explain the observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and energy-resolved polarization: a synchrotron self-Compton model with an anisotropic magnetic field probability distribution in the emitting volume, as well as an energy-stratified shock model. Our results support both the shock scenario as well as support that small levels of magnetic field anisotropy can explain the observed polarization.</description>

      <title>X-SHOOTER Spectrum of Comet C/2025 N1: Insights into a Distant Interstellar Visitor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comets are primitive remnants of the early Solar System whose composition offers fundamental clues to their formation and evolution. High-resolution, broad-wavelength spectroscopy is crucial for identifying volatile species and constraining the physical conditions within the coma. We aim to characterize the gas composition and physical environment of the newly discovered comet C/2025 N1 through optical and near-infrared spectroscopy. We used a medium-resolution spectrum of comet C/2025 N1 with X-shooter at the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT), covering the 300-2500 nm wavelength range. Standard data reduction and flux calibration were applied. It corresponds to a spectral slope at least a factor of $\sim1.86$ higher than that of 2I/Borisov. Although the object clearly shows activity, only upper limits to the production rates of OH and CN can be estimated: $8.0\times10^{24}$ s$^{-1}$ and $4.9\times10^{23}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively. We obtained red spectral slopes consistent with those of typical D-type asteroids and outer Solar System objects.</description>

      <title>KMT-2024-BLG-0404L: A triple microlensing system consisting of a star, a brown dwarf, and a planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the lensing event KMT-2024-BLG-0404. The light curve of the event exhibited a complex structure with multiple distinct features, including two prominent caustic spikes, two cusp bumps, and a brief discontinuous feature between the caustic spikes. While a binary-lens model captured the general anomaly pattern, it could not account for a discontinuous anomaly feature between the two caustic spikes. To explore the origin of the unexplained feature, we conducted more advanced modeling beyond the standard binary-lens framework. This investigation demonstrated that the previously unexplained anomaly was resolved by introducing an additional lens component with planetary mass. The estimated masses of the lens components are $M_{\rm p}= 17.3^{+25.5}_{-8.8}~M_{\rm E}$ for the planet, and $M_{\rm h,A}=0.090^{+0.133}_{-0.046}~M_\odot$ and $M_{\rm h,B}=0.026^{+0.038}_{-0.013}~M_\odot$ for the binary host stars. Based on these mass estimates, the lens system is identified as a planetary system where a Uranus-mass planet orbits a binary consisting of a late M dwarf and a brown dwarf. The distance to the planetary system is estimated to be $D_{\rm L} = 7.21^{+0.93}_{-0.97}$~kpc, with an 82\% probability that it resides in the Galactic bulge. This discovery represents the ninth planetary system found through microlensing with a planet orbiting a binary host. Notably, it is the first case where the host consists of both a star and a brown dwarf.</description>

      <title>The z=1.03 Merging Cluster SPT-CL J0356-5337: New Strong Lensing Analysis with HST and MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a strong lensing analysis and reconstruct the mass distribution of SPT-CL J0356-5337, a galaxy cluster at redshift z = 1.034. Our model supersedes previous models by making use of new multi-band HST data and MUSE spectroscopy. We identify two additional lensed galaxies to inform a more well-constrained model using 12 sets of multiple images in 5 separate lensed sources. The three previously-known sources were spectroscopically confirmed by Mahler et al. (2020) at redshifts of z = 2.363, z = 2.364, and z = 3.048. We measured the spectroscopic redshifts of two of the newly-discovered arcs using MUSE data, at z = 3.0205 and z = 5.3288. We increase the number of cluster member galaxies by a factor of three compared to previous work. We also report the detection of extended Lya emission from several background galaxies. We measure the total projected mass density of the two major sub-cluster components, one dominated by the BCG, and the other by a compact group of luminous red galaxies. We find M_BCG(&lt; 80kpc) = 3.93+0.21-0.14 * 10^13Msun and M_LRG(&lt; 80kpc) = 2.92+0.16 -0.23 * 10^13Msun, yielding a mass ratio of 1.35+0.16 -0.08. The strong lensing constraints offer a robust estimate of the projected mass density regardless of modelling assumptions; allowing more substructure in this line of sight does not change the results or conclusions. Our results corroborate the conclusion that SPT-CL J0356-5337 is dominated by two mass components, and is likely undergoing a major merger on the plane of the sky</description>

      <title>Imaging-Spectroscopic diagnosis of the Giant Sloshing Spiral in the Virgo Cluster with the Einstein Probe Follow-up X-ray Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed deep X-ray observations of the Virgo cluster using the Einstein Probe Follow-up X-ray Telescope (EP-FXT) with a total exposure of 295 ks. Leveraging the large field of view (FoV) and low particle background of EP-FXT, the image reveals a giant spiral feature connecting the cold fronts in the northwest and southeast, forming a coherent structure consistent with earlier results from XMM-Newton and Suzaku. We also present two-dimensional maps of temperature, metallicity, and entropy across the Virgo Cluster, covering a FoV of approximately 28.5 arcmin. These maps clearly show a spiral structure with high density, low temperature, high metallicity, and low entropy. The results support a scenario where the spiral morphology arises from gas sloshing driven by a minor merger. Additionally, EP-FXT temperature measurements agree well with XMM-Newton data within uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Binary-Single Interactions in AGN Disks II: Merger Probability of Binary Black Holes during Chaotic Triple Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar-mass binary black hole\,(BBH) mergers resulting from binary-single interactions\,(BSIs) in active galactic nucleus\,(AGN) disks are a potential source of gravitational wave\,(GW) events with measurable eccentricities. Previous hydrodynamical simulations have shown that ambient gas can significantly influence the dynamics of BSIs. However, due to limitations such as the use of purely Newtonian dynamics and small sample sizes, a direct estimation of the BBH merger probability during BSI has remained elusive. In this work, we directly quantify the merger probability, based on a suite of 1800 two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations coupled with post-Newtonian \emph{N}-body calculations. Our results demonstrate that dense gas can enhance the merger probability by both shrinking the spatial scale of the triple system and increasing the number of binary-single encounters. These two effects together boost the merger probability by a factor of $\sim$5, from 4\% to as high as 20\%. Among the two effects, our analysis suggests that the increase in encounter frequency plays a slightly more significant role in driving the enhancement. Moreover, this enhancement becomes more significant at larger radial distances from the central SMBH, since the total gas mass enclosed within the Hill sphere of the triple system increases with radius. Finally, the BSI process in AGN disks can naturally produce double GW merger events within a timescale of $\sim$year, which may serve as potential observational signatures of BSI occurring in AGN disk environments.</description>

      <title>Are compact groups of galaxies special?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20357v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is often believed that isolated compact groups (CGs) of galaxies are special systems, but only a few studies have compared CGs to regular groups. We study the global properties and internal correlations of a volume- and luminosity-complete subsample of 78 groups of four members (CG4s) within the HMCG Hickson-like sample of compact groups. We compared these CGs to those of a similarly built subsample (including the three-magnitude range of CG4s) of the Lim regular groups. The latter were split into three control samples: one with the four brightest members (Control4Bs), one with the four closest members to the brightest group galaxy (BGG; Control4Cs), and one with exactly four members (RG4s). The vast majority of CG4s are located within regular groups, and a large preponderance of the BGGs of these CG4s are the same as those of their host groups. CG4s are smaller than the groups of all other samples and more luminous than RG4s. Both results are a consequence of their selection as high surface brightness systems. However, CG4s (especially those split among several regular groups) have luminosities similar to Control4Cs. The CG4s also have higher velocity dispersions, probably because of a too-permissive redshift accordance criterion. The BGGs of the CG4s are not any more dominant in luminosity than those of RG4s, but they are significantly more offset relative to the group size because the Lim groups are built around their BGGs. In summary, compact groups have similar properties to regular groups of four galaxies and to the cores of regular groups once the selection criteria of CGs are considered. A large fraction of CGs are the cores of regular groups, which are isolated on the sky by construction but rarely isolated in real space (from simulations), indicating that they are often plagued by chance alignments of host group galaxies along the line of sight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua, Borisov, and IM1, were discovered over the past decade. We follow the trajectories of known interstellar objects in the gravitational potential of the Milky Way galaxy to constrain their possible origin. By initiating the trajectories based on their measured velocities relative to the Local Standard of Rest and considering their vertical excursion from the Milky Way's disk mid-plane, we estimate their likely ages. We find that 'Oumuamua likely originated near the mid-plane of the thin disk, suggesting a younger age. Comet Borisov's trajectory suggests an age similar to the Sun, while IM1's larger excursions suggest an older source. Finally, we project that human-made probes like Voyager 1 and Pioneer 10 will reach the opposite side of the Milky Way disk in approximately 2 Gyr and return to the Solar vicinity before the Sun becomes a red giant.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the rapid formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early universe requires insight into stellar mass growth in host galaxies. Here, we present NIRSpec rest-frame optical spectra and NIRCam imaging from JWST of two galaxies at z&gt;6, both hosting moderate-luminosity quasars. These galaxies exhibit Balmer absorption lines, similar to low-redshift post-starburst galaxies. Our analyses of the medium-resolution spectra and multiband photometry show bulk of the stellar mass (log (M_* / M_sun) &gt; 10.6) formed in starburst episodes at redshift 9 and 7. One of the galaxies shows a clear Balmer break and lacks spatially resolved H alpha emission. It falls well below the star formation main sequence at z = 6, indicating quiescence. The other is transitioning to quiescence; together, these massive galaxies are among the most distant post-starburst systems known. The blueshifted wings of the quasar [O III] emission lines suggest quasar-driven outflow possibly influencing star formation. Direct stellar velocity dispersion measurements reveal one galaxy follows the local black hole mass-sigma_* relation while the other is overmassive. The existence of massive post-starburst galaxies hosting billion-solar-mass BHs in short-lived quasar phases suggests SMBHs and host galaxies played a major role in each other's rapid early formation.</description>

      <title>The catalogue of virtual early-type galaxies from IllustrisTNG: validation and real observation consistency</title>

Abstract: Early-type galaxies (ETGs) are reference systems to understand galaxy formation and evolution processes. The physics of their formation and internal dynamics are codified in well-known scaling relations. In this context, cosmological hydrodynamical simulations play an important role in probing the physical origins of scaling relations by providing a controlled environment to study the formation and evolution of galaxies, linking their internal dynamics to underlying physical processes, and testing the robustness of observational inference methods. In this work, we present the closest-to-reality sample of ETGs from the IllustrisTNG100-1 simulation, dubbed "virtual-ETGs", based on an observational-like algorithm that combines standard projected and three-dimensional galaxy structural parameters. We extract 2D photometric information by projecting the galaxies' light into three planes and modelling them via S\'ersic profiles. Aperture velocity dispersions, corrected for softened central dynamics, are calculated along the line-of-sight orthogonal to the photometric projection plane. Central mass density profiles assume a power-law model, while 3D masses remain unmodified from the IllustrisTNG catalogue. The final catalogue includes $10121$ galaxies at redshifts $z \leq 0.1$. By comparing the virtual properties with observations, we find that the virtual-ETG scaling relations (e.g., size-mass, size-central surface brightness, and Faber-Jackson), central density slopes, and scaling relations among total density slopes and galaxy structural parameters are generally consistent with observations. We make the virtual-ETG publicly available for galaxy formation studies and plan to use this sample as a training set for machine learning tools to infer galaxy properties in future imaging and spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Differential virial analysis: a new technique to determine the dynamical state of molecular clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since molecular clouds form stars, at least some parts of them must be in a state of collapse. However, there is a long-standing debate as to whether that collapse is local, involving only a small fraction of the cloud mass, or global, with most mass in a state of collapse up to the moment when it is dispersed by stellar feedback. In principle it is possible to distinguish these possibilities from clouds' virial ratios, which should be a factor of two larger for collapse than for equilibrium, but systematic uncertainties have thus far prevented such measurements. Here we propose a new analysis method to overcome this limitation: while the absolute value of a cloud's virial ratio is too uncertain to distinguish global from local collapse, the differential change in virial ratio as a function of surface density is also diagnostic of clouds' dynamical state, and can be measured with far fewer systematic uncertainties. We demonstrate the basic principles of the method using simple analytic models of supported and collapsing clouds, validate it from full 3D simulations, and discuss possible challenges in applying the method to real data. We then provide a preliminary application of the technique to recent observations of the molecular clouds in Andromeda, showing that most of them are inconsistent with being in a state of global collapse.</description>

      <title>CASCO: Cosmological and AStrophysical parameters from Cosmological simulations and Observations III. The physics behind the emergence of the golden mass scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the origin and evolution of the "golden mass" (halo mass $\sim10^{12} \, \rm M_{\odot}$, stellar mass $\sim5 \times 10^{10} \, \rm M_{\odot}$), linked to peak star formation efficiency, using \textsc{camels} simulations based on IllustrisTNG. Exploring a range of SN/AGN feedback strengths and cosmologies ($\Omega_{\rm m}, \sigma_8$), we find a U-shaped relation between dark-to-stellar mass ratio and stellar mass, with a minimum at the golden mass, in line with observations. Cosmology affects the normalization of this relation, while feedback shapes its form and the emergence of the golden mass. Stronger SN feedback lowers its value; AGN feedback, especially radiative efficiency, alters the high-mass slope and shifts the golden mass. The golden mass appears earlier with stronger feedback, which quenches star formation more rapidly. Passive galaxies retain the U-shape; star-forming ones show decreasing dark matter fraction with stellar mass, with possible reversal at low redshift. Global stellar fractions also exhibit a U-shaped trend: in passive galaxies, the golden mass shifts to lower masses or vanishes; in star-forming ones, it emerges only at low redshift. Feedback governs the golden mass up to $z \sim 1.5-2$, with a secondary role from cold streams and virial shocks. We speculate that at $z \gtrsim 1.5-2$, a single stream-regulated scale governs galaxy growth, which later bifurcates into two: a low-mass scale tied to gas richness and a higher-mass golden mass regulating efficiency and quenching.

      <title>CO Emission and Absorption-line Survey of the M87 Nucleus Using Archival ALMA Imaging</title>

Abstract: We present an M87 molecular line search from archival Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) imaging, covering the circumnuclear disk (CND) as well as ionized gas filaments and dusty cloud regions. We find no evidence for CO emission in the central $\sim$kpc and place an upper limit of $M_\mathrm{H_2} &lt; 2.3\times 10^5$ $M_\odot$ in the atomic gas CND region, a factor of 20$\times$ lower than previous surveys. During this search, we discovered extragalactic CO absorption lines in the $J$ = 1$-$0, 2$-$1, and 3$-$2 transitions against the bright (Jy-scale) active nucleus. These CO lines are narrow ($\sim$5 km s$^{-1}$) and blueshifted with respect to the galaxy's systemic velocity by $-$75 to $-$84 \kms. This CO absorber appears to be kinematically distinct from outflowing atomic gas seen in absorption. Low integrated opacities ranging from $\tau_\mathrm{CO} \sim 0.02-0.06$ \kms\ and a column density $N_\mathrm{CO} \approx (1.2\pm0.2)\times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ translate to $N_\mathrm{H_2} \sim (1-2) \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$. CO excitation temperatures spanning $T_\mathrm{ex} \sim 8$ K to $\sim$30 K do not follow local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) expectations, and non-LTE radex radiative transfer modeling of the CO absorber is consistent with a number density $n_\mathrm{H_2} \sim 5000$ cm$^{-3}$ embedded in a $\sim$60 K environment. Taken together, the observed CO absorption lines are most consistent with a thin, pressure-confined filament seen slightly off-center from the M87 nucleus. We also explore the impact of residual telluric lines and atmospheric variability on narrow extragalactic line identification and demonstrate how bandpass calibration limitations may introduce broad but very low S/N and spurious absorption and emission signatures.</description>

      <title>Tidal phenomena in the Galactic Center: The curious case of X7</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several enigmatic dusty sources have been detected in the central parsec of the Galactic Center. Among them is X7, located at only $\sim$0.02 pc from the central super-massive black hole, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Recent observations have shown that it is becoming elongated due to the tidal forces of Sgr A*. X7 is expected to be fully disrupted during its pericenter passage around 2035 which might impact the accretion rate of Sgr A*. However, its origin and nature are still unknown. We investigated the tidal interaction of X7 with Sgr A* in order to constrain its origin. We tested the hypothesis that X7 was produced by one of the observed stars with constrained dynamical properties in the vicinity of Sgr A*. We employed a set of test-particle simulations to reproduce the observed structure and dynamics of X7. The initial conditions of the models were obtained by extrapolating the observationally constrained orbits of X7 and the known stars into the past, making it possible to find the time and source of origin by minimizing the three-dimensional separation and velocity difference between them. Our results show that ejecta from the star S33/S0-30, launched in $\sim$1950, can to a large extent, replicate the observed dynamics and structure of X7, provided that it is initially elongated with a velocity gradient across it, and with an initial maximum speed of $\sim$600~km~s$^{-1}$. Our results show that a grazing collision between the star S33/S0-30 and a field object such as a stellar mass black hole or a Jupiter-mass object is a viable scenario to explain the origin of X7. Nevertheless, such encounters are rare based on the observed stellar dynamics within the central parsec.</description>

      <title>A Wide Field Map of Ultra-Compact Dwarfs in the Coma Cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dataset of 23,351 globular clusters (GCs) and ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs) in the Coma cluster of galaxies was built using Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys data. Based on the standard magnitude cut of $M_V \leq -11$, a total of 523 UCD candidates are found within this dataset of Compact Stellar Systems (CSS). From a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) analysis built using this catalog, we find a clear mass-magnitude relation extending marginally into the UCD parameter space. The luminosity function defined by this dataset, shows an excess of sources at bright magnitudes, suggesting a bimodal formation scenario for UCDs. We estimate the number of UCDs with a different origin than GC to be $N_{UCD} \geq 32 \pm 1$. We derive the total number of CSS within the core (1 Mpc) of Coma to be $N_{CSS} \approx 69,400 \pm 1400$. The radial distribution of UCDs in Coma shows that, like GCs, UCDs agglomerate around three giant ellipticals: NGC 4874, NGC 4889, and IC 4051. We find UCDs are more centrally concentrated around these three ellipticals than GCs. IC 4051 has a satellite population of UCDs similar to NGC 4874 and NGC 4889. We estimate only ~14% of UCDs, inhabit the intracluster space (ICUCD) between galaxies in the region, in comparison to ~24% for GCs (ICGC). We find red (metal-rich) UCDs are more likely located closer to a host galaxy, with blue (metal-poor) UCDs showing a greater dispersion and lower average density in the region.</description>

      <title>PDRs4All XV: CH radical and H$_3^+$ molecular ion in the irradiated protoplanetary disk d203-506</title>

Abstract: Most protoplanetary disks experience a phase in which they are subjected to strong ultraviolet radiation from nearby massive stars. This UV radiation can substantially alter their chemistry by producing numerous radicals and molecular ions. In this Letter we present detailed analysis of the JWST-NIRSpec spectrum of the d203-506 obtained as part of the PDRs4All Early Release Science program. Using state-of-the-art spectroscopic data, we searched for species using a multi-molecule fitting tool, PAHTATmol, that we developed for this purpose. Based on this analysis, we report the clear detection of ro-vibrational emission of the CH radical and likely detection of the H$_3^+$ molecular ion, with estimated abundances of a few times 10$^{-7}$ and approximately 10$^{-8}$, respectively. The presence of CH is predicted by gas-phase models and well explained by hydrocarbon photochemistry. H$_3^+$ is usually formed through reactions of H$_2$ with H$_2^+$ originating from cosmic ray ionization of H$_2$. However, recent theoretical studies suggest that H$_3^+$ also forms through UV-driven chemistry in strongly irradiated ($G_0&gt;$10$^3$), dense ($n_{\rm H} &gt;10^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$) gas. The latter is favored as an explanation for the presence of ``hot'' H$_3^+$ ($T_{\rm ex}\gtrsim$1000 K) in the outer disk layers of d203-506, coinciding with the emission of FUV-pumped H$_2$ and other ``PDR species'', such as CH$^+$, CH$_3^+$, and OH. Our detection of infrared emission from vibrationally excited H$_3^+$ and CH raises questions about their excitation mechanisms and, underscore that UV radiation can have a profound impact on the chemistry of planet forming disks. They also demonstrate the power of JWST pushing the limit for the detection of elusive species in protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Cool Gas in the Circumgalactic Medium of Massive Post Starburst Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observing the interplay between galaxies and their gaseous surroundings is crucial for understanding how galaxies form and evolve, including the roles of long-lived cool gas reservoirs, starburst and AGN driven outflows. We use stacked Mg II absorption lines in the spectra of background quasars to study the cool gas out to 9Mpc from massive quiescent, star-forming and post-starburst galaxies with stellar masses $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{gal}}/M_\odot) \gtrsim 11.4$ and $0.4 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.8$ selected from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) CMASS galaxies. Consistent with previous studies, we observe a decline in absorption strength indicating a decrease in cool gas content with increasing distance from the galaxies, as well as decreasing star formation rate of the galaxies. Beyond 1Mpc, this decline levels off to the same absorption strength in all galaxy types, suggesting a transition from the circumgalactic medium (CGM) to the intergalactic medium (IGM) at approximately the virial radius of the host dark matter haloes. We find that post-starburst galaxies, that have experienced a recent burst of star formation that has rapidly quenched, exhibit significantly stronger Mg II absorption within 1Mpc than star-forming or quiescent galaxies of the same stellar mass. Because post-starburst galaxies are a potentially significant pathway for the formation of quiescent elliptical galaxies, our results have wide reaching implications for understanding the mechanisms involved in quenching star formation in galaxies. We speculate that the excess cool gas absorption out to 1Mpc around post-starburst galaxies is related to their observed high velocity ($\sim$1000\,km/s) cool gas outflows. Thus, strong, short-lived bursts of star formation impact the CGM around galaxies on Mpc distances and Gyr timescales.</description>

      <title>Formation of Complex Organic Molecules in Prestellar Cores: The Role of Non-Diffusive Grain Chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of astrochemical modeling of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the ice and gas of the prestellar core L1544 with the recently updated MONACO rate equations-based model. The model includes, in particular, non-diffusive processes, new laboratory verified chemical routes for acetaldehyde and methane ice formation and variation of H and $\rm H_2$ desorption energies depending on the surface coverage by $\rm H_2$ molecules. For the first time, we simultaneously reproduce the abundances of several oxygen-bearing COMs in the gas phase, the approximate location of the peak of methanol emission, as well as the abundance of methanol in the icy mantles of L1544. Radical-radical reactions on grains surface between species such as $\rm CH_3$, $\rm CH_3O$ and $\rm HCO$ efficiently proceed non-diffusively. COMs are delivered to the gas phase via chemical desorption amplified by the loops of H-addition/abstraction surface reactions. However, gas-phase chemical reactions as well provide a noticeable input to the formation of COMs in the gas, but not to the COMs solid-state abundances. This particularly applies for CH$_3$CHO and CH$_3$OCH$_3$. The simulated abundances of COMs in the ice are in the range 1\%--2\% (for methyl formate ice) or $\sim$~0.1\% (for CH$_3$CHO and CH$_3$OCH$_3$) with respect to the abundance of H$_2$O ice. We stress a similarity between the simulated abundances of icy COMs in L1544 and the abundances of COMs in the gas phase of hot cores/corinos. We compare our non-diffusive model with the diffusive model and provide constraints for the species' diffusion-to-desorption energy ratios.</description>

      <title>The Distribution of Atomic Hydrogen in the Host Galaxies of FRBs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We probe the atomic hydrogen (HI) emission from the host galaxies of fast radio bursts (FRBs) to investigate the emerging trend of disturbance and asymmetry in the population. Quadrupling the sample size, we detect 13 of 14 new hosts in HI, with the only non-detection arising in a galaxy known to be transitioning towards quiescence. With respect to typical local Universe galaxies, FRB hosts are generally massive in HI ($M_{HI}&gt;10^9 M_\odot$), which aligns with previous studies showing that FRB hosts also tend to have high stellar masses and are star-forming. However, they span a broad range of other HI derived properties. In our independent sample of repeater hosts, we observe a statistically insignificant preference towards lower HI masses compared to non-repeater hosts, similar to the low-significance trend toward lower stellar masses previously reported. Using visual inspection alongside various asymmetry metrics, we identify four unambiguously settled host galaxies, demonstrating for the first time that a disturbed HI morphology is not a universal feature of FRB host galaxies. However, we find another six that show clear signs of disturbance, and three which require deeper, more targeted observations to reach a conclusion; this brings the confirmed ratio of disturbed-to-settled FRB hosts to 11:4. Given that roughly a 1:1 ratio is expected for random background galaxies of similar type, our observed ratio yields a p-value of 0.065. Unlike earlier indications based on smaller samples, this no longer crosses the conventional threshold for statistical significance, though is still near enough to hint at a legitimate excess of disturbance among FRB hosts. Thus, an even larger sample size of FRB hosts observed in HI is required to fully clarify whether the trend is genuine or still a consequence of low-number statistics - a sample that upcoming data releases are well positioned to provide.</description>

      <title>Blowing Star Formation Away in AGN Hosts (BAH) -- IV. Serendipitous discovery of a $z\sim2.9$ star-forming galaxy lensed by the galactic bulge of CGCG 012-070 using JWST NIRSpec</title>

Abstract: We report the detection of a gravitationally lensed galaxy by the nearby spiral galaxy CGCG 012-070 ($z = 0.048$) using Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The lensed galaxy is identified through the flux distributions of emission lines in the rest-frame optical, consistent with a source located at a redshift of $z\sim2.89$. The system is detected in [O III]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$, H$\beta$, and H$\alpha$ emission lines, exhibiting line ratios typical of a star-forming galaxy. The emission-line flux distributions reveal three distinct components, which are modeled using an elliptical power-law (EPL) mass profile for the lens galaxy. This model provides a good characterization of the source and reveals a disturbed star-forming morphology consistent with those of galaxies at cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>Numerical Challenges in Modeling Gravothermal Collapse in Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When dark matter has a large cross section for self scattering, halos can undergo a process known as gravothermal core collapse, where the inner core rapidly increases in density and temperature. To date, several methods have been used to implement Self-Interacting Dark Matter~(SIDM) in N-body codes, but there has been no systematic study of these different methods or their accuracy in the core-collapse phase. In this paper, we compare three different numerical implementations of SIDM, including the standard methods from the GIZMO and Arepo codes, by simulating idealized dwarf halos undergoing significant dark matter self interactions ($\sigma/m = 50$~cm$^2$/g). When simulating these halos, we also vary the mass resolution, time-stepping criteria, and gravitational force-softening scheme. The various SIDM methods lead to distinct differences in a halo's evolution during the core-collapse phase, as each results in spurious scattering rate differences and energy gains/losses. The use of adaptive force softening for gravity can lead to numerical heating that artificially accelerates core collapse, while an insufficiently small simulation time step can cause core evolution to stall or completely reverse. Additionally, particle numbers must be large enough to ensure that the simulated halos are not sensitive to noise in the initial conditions. Even for the highest-resolution simulations tested in this study ($10^6$ particles per halo), we find that variations of order $10\%$ in collapse time are still present. The results of this work underscore the sensitivity of SIDM modeling on the choice of numerical implementation and motivate a careful study of how these results generalize to halos in a cosmological context.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation of Dense Rotation-Dominated Structures Fed by Collapsing Gravomagneto-Sheetlets and Origin of Misaligned 100 au-Scale Binaries and Multiple Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The majority of stars are in binary/multiple systems. How such systems form in turbulent, magnetized cores of molecular clouds in the presence of non-ideal MHD effects remains relatively under-explored. Through ATHENA++-based non-ideal MHD AMR simulations with ambipolar diffusion, we show that the collapsing protostellar envelope is dominated by dense gravo-magneto-sheetlets, a turbulence-warped version of the classic pseudodisk produced by anisotropic magnetic resistance to the gravitational collapse, in agreement with previous simulations of turbulent, magnetized single-star formation. The sheetlets feed mass, magnetic fields, and angular momentum to a Dense ROtation-Dominated (DROD) structure, which fragments into binary/multiple systems. This DROD fragmentation scenario is a more dynamic variant of the traditional disk fragmentation scenario for binary/multiple formation, with dense spiral filaments created by inhomogeneous feeding from the highly structured larger-scale sheetlets rather than the need for angular momentum transport, which is dominated by magnetic braking. Provided that the local material is sufficiently demagnetized, with a plasma-$\beta$ of 10 or more, collisions between the dense spiraling filaments play a key role in facilitating gravitational collapse and stellar companion formation by pushing the local magnetic Toomre parameter $Q_\mathrm{m}$ below unity. This mechanism can naturally produce {\it in situ} misaligned systems on the 100-au scale, often detected with high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. Our simulations also highlight the importance of non-ideal MHD effects, which affect whether fragmentation occurs and, if so, the masses and orbital parameters of the stellar companions formed.</description>

      <title>He awa whiria: the tidal streams of interstellar objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Upcoming surveys are likely to discover a new sample of interstellar objects (ISOs) within the Solar System, but questions remain about the origin and distribution of this population within the Galaxy. ISOs are ejected from their host systems with a range of velocities, spreading out into tidal streams - analogous to the stellar streams routinely observed from the disruption of star clusters and dwarf galaxies. We create a simulation of ISO streams orbiting in the Galaxy, deriving a simple model for their density distribution over time. We then construct a population model to predict the properties of the streams in which the Sun is currently embedded. We find that the number of streams encountered by the Sun is quite large, ~ 10^6 or more. However, the wide range of stream properties means that for reasonable future samples of ISOs observed in the Solar System, we may see ISOs from the same star ("siblings"), and we are likely to see ISOs from the same star cluster ("cousins"). We also find that ISOs are typically not traceable to their parent star, though this may be possible for ISO siblings. Any ISOs observed with a common origin will come from younger, dynamically colder streams.</description>

      <title>Probing the origins. II. Unravelling lithium depletion and stellar motion: Intrinsic stellar properties drive depletion, not kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Paper I, we classified a stellar sample from the thin disc with a broad range in metallicity as being churned outward or inward, or blurred/undisturbed. In this paper (Paper II), we delve deeper by analysing our entire metallicity-stratified sample along with their dynamic properties, focusing on the connection between radial migration and Li depletion. We analyse the chemo-dynamics of a set of 1188 thin disc dwarf stars observed by the \textit{Gaia}-ESO survey, previously classified into six metallicity-stratified groups via Hierarchical Clustering (HC). We examine several features, such as effective temperatures, masses, and dynamic properties. We also implement a parametric survival analysis using penalised splines (logistic distribution) to quantify how stellar properties and motion (or migration) direction jointly influence Li depletion patterns. We find that stars in our sample that appear to have churned outward are predominantly Li-depleted, regardless of their metallicities. These stars are also the oldest, coldest, and least massive compared to those in the same HC group that have either churned inward or kept their orbital radii. Our survival analysis confirms temperature as the primary driver of Li depletion, followed by metallicity and age, while migration direction shows negligible influence. The increasing proportion of outward-churned stars with higher metallicity (and older ages) indicates their dominant influence on the overall trend observed in the [Fe/H]-A(Li) space for stellar groups with [Fe/H]&gt;0. The survival model reinforces that the observed Li depletion stems primarily from intrinsic stellar properties (cool temperatures, higher metallicity, old ages) rather than migration history. This suggests the metallicity-dependent depletion pattern emerges through stellar evolution rather than Galactic dynamical processes.</description>

      <title>Snapshot of a new interstellar comet: 3I/ATLAS has a red and featureless spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object to be discovered. Pre-perihelion measurements provide a unique opportunity to study its activity and composition, which may alter as it is heated in the coming months. We provide an initial baseline from optical spectroscopic observations obtained only two days after discovery, using the MUSE instrument on the VLT on 2025 July 3, while 3I was at 4.47 au from the Sun and 3.46 au from the Earth. These observations confirm the cometary nature of 3I, and reveal a red coma with a spectral slope of $(18\pm4)\%/1000$~\AA, redder than most Solar System comets but similar to the surface colour of some Solar System Trans-Neptunian Objects or Centaurs. We searched for but did not detect gas emission from C$_2$, NH$_2$, CN, and [OI], which is consistent with volatile non-detections for Solar System comets at this heliocentric distance. At present, the coma appears entirely dusty. Future observations of 3I as it comes closer to the Sun will provide an invaluable opportunity to witness the evolution of its activity, study its composition, test predictions of interstellar object population models, and compare 3I to Solar System comets.</description>
