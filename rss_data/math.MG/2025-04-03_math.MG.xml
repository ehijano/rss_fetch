      <title>On the number of defects in optimal quantizers on closed surfaces: the hexagonal torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a strategy for proving an asymptotic upper bound on the number of defects (non-hexagonal Voronoi cells) in the $n$ generator optimal quantizer on a closed surface (i.e., compact 2-manifold without boundary). The program is based upon a general lower bound on the optimal quantization error and related upper bounds for the L\"oschian numbers $n$ (the norms of the Eisenstein integers) arising from the Goldberg-Coxeter construction. A gap lemma is used to reduce the asymptotics of the number of defects to precisely the asymptotics for the gaps between L\"oschian numbers. We apply this strategy on the hexagonal torus and prove that the number of defects is at most $O(n^{1/4})$ -- strictly fewer than surfaces with boundary -- and conjecture (based upon the number-theoretic L\"oschian gap conjecture) that it is in fact $O(\log n)$. Incidentally, the method also yields a related upper bound on the variance of the areas of the Voronoi cells. We show further that the bound on the number of defects holds in a neighborhood of the optimizers. Finally, we remark on the remaining issues for implementation on the 2-sphere.</description>

      <title>Exact d'Alembertian for Lorentz distance functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We refine a recent distributional notion of d'Alembertian of a signed Lorentz distance function to an achronal set in a metric measure spacetime obeying the timelike measure contraction property. We show precise representation formulas and comparison estimates (both upper and lower bounds). Under a condition we call "infinitesimally strict concavity" (known for infinitesimally Minkowskian structures and established here for Finsler spacetimes), we prove the associated distribution is a signed measure certifying the integration by parts formula. This treatment of the d'Alembertian using techniques from metric geometry expands upon its recent nonlinear yet elliptic interpretation; even in the smooth case, our formulas seem to pioneer its exact shape across the timelike cut locus. Two central ingredients our contribution unifies are the localization paradigm of Cavalletti-Mondino and the Sobolev calculus of Beran-Braun-Calisti-Gigli-McCann-Ohanyan-Rott-S\"amann.
  In the second part of our work, we present several applications of these insights. First, we show the equivalence of the timelike curvature-dimension condition with a Bochner-type inequality. Second, we set up synthetic mean curvature (as well as barriers for CMC sets) exactly. Third, we prove synthetic volume and area estimates of Heintze-Karcher-type, which enable us to show several synthetic volume singularity theorems.</description>
