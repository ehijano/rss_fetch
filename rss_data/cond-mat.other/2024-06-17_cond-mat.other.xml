      <title>Predicting quantum learnability from landscape fluctuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tradeoff between trainability and expressibility is a central challenge faced by today's variational quantum computing. Recent studies indicate that resolving this dilemma necessitates designing specific parametrized quantum circuits (PQC) tailored for specific problems, which urgently needs a general and efficient method to assess the learnability of PQCs regarding a given target. In this Letter, we demonstrate a simple and efficient metric for learnability by comparing the fluctuations of the given training landscape with standard learnable landscapes. This metric shows surprising effectiveness in predicting learnability as it unifies the effects of insufficient expressibility, barren plateaus, bad local minima, and overparametrization. Importantly, it does not require actual training and can be estimated efficiently on classical computers via Clifford sampling. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to validate its effectiveness regarding both physical and random Hamiltonians. We also prove a compact lower bound for the metric in locally scrambled circuits as analytical guidance. Our findings enable efficient predictions of learnability, allowing fast selection of suitable PQCs for a given problem without training, which can improve the efficiency of variational quantum computing especially when access to quantum devices is limited.</description>

      <title>Geodesic nature and quantization of shift vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the geodesic nature and quantization of geometric shift vector in quantum systems, with the parameter space defined by the Bloch momentum, using the Wilson loop approach. Our analysis extends to include bosonic phonon drag shift vectors with non-vertical transitions. We demonstrate that the gauge invariant shift vector can be quantized as integer values, analogous to the Euler characteristic based on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for a manifold with a smooth boundary. We reveal intricate relationships among geometric quantities such as the shift vector, Berry curvature, and quantum metric. Our findings demonstrate that the loop integral of the shift vector in the quantized interband formula contributes to the non-quantized component of the trace of conductivity in the circular photogalvanic effect. The Wilson loop method facilitates first-principles calculations, providing insights in the geometric underpinnings of these interband gauge invariant quantities and shedding light on their nonlinear optical manifestations in real materials.</description>
