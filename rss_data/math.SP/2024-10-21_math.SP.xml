      <title>A complete characterization of graphs for which $m_G(-1) = n-d-1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple connected graph of order $n$ with diameter $d$. Let $m_G(-1)$ denote the multiplicity of the eigenvalue $-1$ of the adjacency matrix of $G$, and let $P = P_{d+1}$ be the diameter path of $G$. If $-1$ is not an eigenvalue of $P$, then by the interlacing theorem, we have $m_G(-1)\leq n - d - 1$. In this article, we characterize the extremal graphs where equality holds. Moreover, for the completeness of the results, we also characterize the graphs $G$ that achieve $m_G(-1) = n - d - 1$ when $-1$ is an eigenvalue of $P$. Thus, we provide a complete characterization of the graphs $G$ for which $m_G(-1) = n - d - 1$.</description>

      <title>Random acoustic boundary conditions and Weyl's law for Laplace-Beltrami operators on non-smooth boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by engineering and photonics research on resonators in random or uncertain environments, we study rigorous randomizations of boundary conditions for wave equations of the acoustic-type in Lipschitz domains $\mathcal{O}$. First, a parametrization of essentially all m-dissipative boundary condition by contraction operators in the boundary $L^2$-space is constructed with the use of m-boundary tuples (boundary value spaces). We consider randomizations of these contraction operators that lead to acoustic operators random in the resolvent sense. To this end, the use of Neumann-to-Dirichlet maps and Krein-type resolvent formulae is crucial. We give a description of random m-dissipative boundary conditions that produce acoustic operators with almost surely (a.s.) compact resolvents, and so, also with a.s. discrete spectra. For each particular applied model, one can choose a specific boundary condition from the constructed class either by means of optimization, or on the base of empirical observations. A mathematically convenient randomization is constructed in terms of eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta^{\partial \mathcal{O}}$ on the boundary $\mathcal{O}$ of the domain. We show that for this randomization the compactness of the resolvent is connected with the Weyl-type asymptotics for the eigenvalues of $\Delta^{\partial \mathcal{O}}$.</description>

      <title>Hallucination Detox: Sensitive Neuron Dropout (SeND) for Large Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed across various industries, concerns regarding their reliability, particularly due to hallucinations-outputs that are factually inaccurate or irrelevant to user input-have grown. Our research investigates the relationship between the training process and the emergence of hallucinations to address a key gap in existing research that focuses primarily on post hoc detection and mitigation strategies. Using models from the Pythia suite (70M-12B parameters) and several hallucination detection metrics, we analyze hallucination trends throughout training and explore LLM internal dynamics. We introduce SEnsitive Neuron Dropout (SeND), a novel training protocol designed to mitigate hallucinations by reducing variance during training. SeND achieves this by deterministically dropping neurons with significant variability on a dataset, referred to as Sensitive Neurons. In addition, we develop an unsupervised hallucination detection metric, Efficient EigenScore (EES), which approximates the traditional EigenScore in 2x speed. This efficient metric is integrated into our protocol, allowing SeND to be both computationally scalable and effective at reducing hallucinations. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our approach improves LLM reliability at test time by up to 40% compared to normal training while also providing an efficient method to improve factual accuracy when adapting LLMs to domains such as Wikipedia and Medical datasets.</description>

      <title>Log H\"older continuity of the rotation number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider one-parameter families of smooth circle cocycles over an ergodic transformation in the base, and show that their rotation numbers must be log-H\"older regular with respect to the parameter. As an immediate application, we get a dynamical proof of 1D version of the Craig-Simon theorem that establishes that the integrated density of states of an ergodic Schr\"odinger operator must be log-H\"older.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Rumin differentials of the 5-dimensional graded nilpotent Lie group that appears as osculating group of generic rank two distributions in dimension five. In irreducible unitary representations of this group, the Rumin differentials provide intriguing generalizations of the classical quantum harmonic oscillator. For the Schrodinger representations, we compute the spectrum and the zeta regularized determinant of each Rumin differential. In the generic representations, we evaluate their alternating product, i.e., the analytic torsion of the Rumin complex.</description>

      <title>Stability of the second non trivial eigenvalue of the Neumann Laplacian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, building on the ideas of Brasco and Pratelli (Geom. Funct. Anal., 22 (2012), 107-135), we establish a stability estimate for Bucur and Henrot's inequality (Acta Math., 222 (2019), 337-361). Their inequality asserts that, among regular sets of given measure, the disjoint union of two balls with the same radius maximizes the second non trivial eigenvalue of the Neumann Laplacian. Last week I was informed of the same result of this paper has been published by Wang K, Wu H. A quantitative Bucur Henrot inequality. Mathematische Nachrichten, 2022, 295(12): 2436-2451. So thearticle has been deprecated.</description>

      <title>The Eigenvalue Problem for the Laplacian via Conformal Mapping and the Gohberg--Sigal Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.11026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of the Laplacian for a planar, simply connected domain. The eigenvalues admit a characterization in terms of a layer potential of the Helmholtz equation. Using the exterior conformal mapping associated with the given domain, we reformulate the layer potential as an infinite-dimensional matrix. Based on this matrix representation, we develop a finite section approach for approximating the Laplacian eigenvalues and provide a convergence analysis by applying the Gohberg--Sigal theory for operator-valued functions. Moreover, we derive an asymptotic formula for the Laplacian eigenvalues on deformed domains that results from the changes in the conformal mapping coefficients.</description>

      <title>On the surface area of graphs, related connectivity measures and spectral estimates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we elaborate on some notions of surface area for discrete graphs which are closely related to the inverse degree. These notions then naturally lead to associated connectivity measures of graphs and to the definition of a special class of large graphs, called social graphs, that might prove interesting for applications. In addition, we derive spectral estimates involving the surface area and, as a main result, present an upper bound on the second eigenvalue for planar graphs which in some cases improves upon existing bounds from D. A. Spielman and S.-H. Teng, Spectral partitioning works: Planar graphs and finite element meshes, and M. Pl\"umer, Upper eigenvalue bounds for the Kirchhoff Laplacian on embedded metric graphs.</description>

      <title>The Fermionic Entanglement Entropy and Area Law for the Relativistic Dirac Vacuum State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03493v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the fermionic entanglement entropy for the free Dirac field in a bounded spatial region of Minkowski spacetime. In order to make the system ultraviolet finite, a regularization is introduced. An area law is proven in the limiting cases where the volume tends to infinity and/or the regularization length tends to zero. The technical core of the paper is to generalize a theorem of Harold Widom to pseudo-differential operators whose principal symbols develop a specific discontinuity at a single point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a graph theoretic approach to determine trace of product of two permutation matrices through a weighted digraph representation of the permutation matrices. Consequently, we derive trace-zero doubly stochastic (DS) matrices of order $5$ whose $k$-th power is also a trace-zero DS matrix for $k\in\{2,3,4,5\}$. Then, we determine necessary conditions for the coefficients of a generic polynomial of degree $5$ to be realizable as the characteristic polynomial of a trace-zero DS matrix of order $5$. Finally, we approximate the eigenvalue region of trace-zero DS matrices of order $5.$</description>

      <title>Gradient-flow adaptive importance sampling for Bayesian leave one out cross-validation with application to sigmoidal classification models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce gradient-flow-guided adaptive importance sampling (IS) transformations for stabilizing Monte-Carlo approximations of leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validated predictions for Bayesian models. After defining two variational problems, we derive corresponding simple nonlinear transformations that utilize gradient information to shift a model's pre-trained full-data posterior closer to the target LOO posterior predictive distributions. In doing so, the transformations stabilize importance weights. The resulting Monte Carlo integrals depend on Jacobian determinants with respect to the model Hessian. We derive closed-form exact formulae for these Jacobian determinants in the cases of logistic regression and shallow ReLU-activated artificial neural networks, and provide a simple approximation that sidesteps the need to compute full Hessian matrices and their spectra. We test the methodology on an $n\ll p$ dataset that is known to produce unstable LOO IS weights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central object in the analysis of the water wave problem is the Dirichlet-Neumann operator. This paper is devoted to the study of its spectrum in the context of the water wave system linearized near equilibrium in a domain with a variable bottom, assumed to be a $C^2$ periodic function. We use the analyticity of the Dirichlet-Neumann operator with respect to the bottom variation and combine it with general properties of elliptic systems and spectral theory for self-adjoint operators to develop a Bloch-Floquet theory and describe the structure of its spectrum. We find that under some conditions on the bottom variations, the spectrum is composed of bands separated by gaps, with explicit formulas for their sizes and locations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a study of the inherent structural properties of Krylov subspaces, in particular for the self-adjoint class of operators, and how they relate with the important phenomenon of `Krylov solvability' of linear inverse problems. Owing to the complexity of the problem in the unbounded setting, recently developed perturbative techniques are used that exploit the use of the weak topology on $\mathcal{H}$. We also make a strong connection between the approximation properties of the Krylov subspace and the famous Hamburger problem of moments, in particular the determinacy condition.</description>

      <title>Prescribed mean curvature problems on homogeneous vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a detailed and systematic study of weak (singular) Hermite-Einstein structures on homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles over rational homogeneous varieties. We use standard tools from spectral geometry, Harmonic analysis, and Cartan's highest weight theory to provide a sufficient condition in terms of Fourier series and intersection numbers under which an $L^{2}$-function can be realized as mean curvature of a singular Hermitian structure on an irreducible homogeneous holomorphic vector bundle. We prove that the condition provided is necessary and sufficient for functions that belong to certain interpolation spaces. In the particular case of line bundles over irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type, we describe explicitly in terms of representation theory the solutions of the underlying geometric PDE. Also, we establish a sufficient condition in terms of Fourier coefficients and intersection numbers for solvability and convergence of the weak Hermite-Einstein flow on irreducible homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles. As an application of our methods, we describe the first explicit examples in the literature of solutions to several geometric flows, including Donaldson's heat flow, Yang-Mills heat flow, and the gradient flow of Donaldson's Lagrangian, on line bundles over irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type. Additionally, we show that every polynomial central charge function gives rise to a weak Donaldson's Lagrangian $\mathcal{M}$. In the particular case of irreducible homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles, we prove that the gradient flow of $\mathcal{M}$ converges to a Hermitian structure which is, up to a gauge transformation, a $Z$-critical Hermitian structure in the large volume limit.</description>

      <title>Complex analysis of symmetric operators, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the relationship of symmetric operators with Hermitian symmetric spaces, we introduce the notion of \emph{Weyl curve} for a symmetric operator $T$, which is the geometric abstraction and generalization of the well-known Weyl functions. We prove that there is a one-to-one correspondence between unitary equivalence classes of simple symmetric operators and congruence classes of Nevanlinna curves (the geometric analogue of operator-valued Nevanlinna functions). To prove this result, we introduce a \emph{canonical} functional model for $T$ in terms of its \emph{characteristic vector bundles}. In this geometric formalism, when the deficiency indices are $(n,n)$ ($n\leq +\infty$) we also introduce the notion of \emph{entire operators}, whose Weyl curves are entire in the Grassmannian $Gr(n,2n)$. If $n$ is finite, this makes it possible to introduce modern value distribution theory of entire curves into the picture and to demonstrate that the distribution of eigenvalues of a \emph{generic} abstract boundary value problem is the same thing as the value distribution of the Weyl curve with respect to the Cartier divisor induced by the corresponding boundary condition. Many other new concepts are introduced and many new results are obtained as well.</description>

      <title>On reduced basis methods for eigenvalue problems, and on its coupling with perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study eigenvalue problems and their approximation obtained by subspace projection, as in the reduced basis method. We provide bounds on the error between the exact eigenmodes and the approximated ones. Self-adjoint operators and degenerate cases are treated. We apply the bounds to the setting where the reduced space contains the vectors extracted from perturbation theory.</description>
