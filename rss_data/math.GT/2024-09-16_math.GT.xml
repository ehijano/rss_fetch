      <title>Two curious strongly invertible L-space knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two examples of strongly invertible L-space knots whose surgeries are never the double branched cover of a Khovanov thin link in the 3-sphere. Consequently, these knots provide counterexamples to a conjectural characterization of strongly invertible L-space knots due to Watson. We also discuss other exceptional properties of these two knots, for example, these two L-space knots have formal semigroups that are actual semigroups.</description>

      <title>Quasi-alternating surgeries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we explore phenomena relating to quasi-alternating surgeries on knots, where a quasi-alternating surgery on a knot is a Dehn surgery yielding the double branched cover of a quasi-alternating link. Since the double branched cover of a quasi-alternating link is an L-space, quasi-alternating surgeries are special examples of L-space surgeries.
  We show that all SnapPy census L-space knots admit quasi-alternating surgeries except for the knots t09847 and o9_30634 which both do not have any quasi-alternating surgeries. In particular, this finishes Dunfield's classification of the L-space knots among all SnapPy census knots. In addition, we show that all asymmetric census L-space knots have exactly two quasi-alternating slopes that are consecutive integers. Similar behavior is observed for some of the Baker-Luecke asymmetric L-space knots.
  We also classify the quasi-alternating surgeries on torus knots and explore briefly the notion of formal L-space surgeries. This allows us to give examples of asymmetric formal L-spaces.</description>

      <title>The search for alternating surgeries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surgery on a knot in $S^3$ is said to be an alternating surgery if it yields the double branched cover of an alternating link. The main theoretical contribution is to show that the set of alternating surgery slopes is algorithmically computable and to establish several structural results. Furthermore, we calculate the set of alternating surgery slopes for many examples of knots, including all hyperbolic knots in the SnapPy census. These examples exhibit several interesting phenomena including strongly invertible knots with a unique alternating surgery and asymmetric knots with two alternating surgery slopes. We also establish upper bounds on the set of alternating surgeries, showing that an alternating surgery slope on a hyperbolic knot satisfies $|p/q| \leq 3g(K)+4$. Notably, this bound applies to lens space surgeries, thereby strengthening the known genus bounds from the conjecture of Goda and Teragaito.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Hantzsche Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A closed 3-manifold $M$ may be described up to some indeterminacy by a Heegaard diagram $\mathcal{D}$. The question "Does $M$ smoothly embed in $\mathbb{R}^4$?'' is equivalent to a property of $\mathcal{D}$ which we call $\textit{doubly unlinked}$ (DU). This perspective leads to an enhancement of Hantzsche's embedding obstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a generalization of the Bers' simultaneous uniformization theorem in the world of algebraic correspondences. More precisely, we construct algebraic correspondences that simultaneously uniformize a pair of non-homeomorphic genus zero orbifolds. We also present a complex-analytic realization of the Teichm\"uller space of a punctured sphere in the space of correspondences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1989, B. White conjectured that every Riemannian 3-sphere has at least 5 embedded minimal tori. We confirm this conjecture for 3-spheres of positive Ricci curvature. While our proof uses min-max theory, the underlying heuristics are largely inspired by mean curvature flow.</description>

      <title>Geometry and dynamics of the extension graph of graph product of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the extension graph of graph product of groups and study its geometry. This enables us to study properties of graph products of groups by exploiting large scale geometry of its defining graph. In particular, we show that the extension graph exhibits the same phenomenon about asymptotic dimension as quasi-trees of metric spaces studied by Bestvina-Bromberg-Fujiwara. Moreover, we present three applications of the extension graph of graph product when a defining graph is hyperbolic. First, we provide a new class of convergence groups by considering the action of graph product of finite groups on a compactification of the extension graph and identify the if and only if condition for this action to be geometrically finite. Secondly, we prove relative hyperbolicity of the semi-direct product of groups that interpolates between wreath product and free product. Finally, we provide a new class of graph product of finite groups whose group von Neumnann algebra is strongly solid.</description>

      <title>Howson groups which are not strongly Howson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A group $G$ is called a Howson group if the intersection $H\cap K$ of any two finitely generated subgroups $H, K&lt;G$ is again finitely generated, and called a strongly Howson group when a uniform bound for the rank of $H\cap K$ can be obtained from the ranks of $H$ and $K$. Clearly, every strongly Howson group is a Howson group, but it is unclear in the literature whether the converse is true. In this note, we show that the converse is not true by constructing the first Howson groups which are not strongly Howson.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Burnside laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct novel examples of finitely generated groups that exhibit seemingly-contradicting probabilistic behaviors with respect to Burnside laws. We construct a finitely generated group that satisfies a Burnside law, namely a law of the form $x^n=1$, with limit probability 1 with respect to uniform measures on balls in its Cayley graph and under every lazy non-degenerate random walk, while containing a free subgroup. We show that the limit probability of satisfying a Burnside law is highly sensitive to the choice of generating set, by providing a group for which this probability is $0$ for one generating set and $1$ for another. Furthermore, we construct groups that satisfy Burnside laws of two co-prime exponents with probability 1. Finally, we present a finitely generated group for which every real number in the interval $[0,1]$ appears as a partial limit of the probability sequence of Burnside law satisfaction, both for uniform measures on Cayley balls and for random walks.
  Our results resolve several open questions posed by Amir, Blachar, Gerasimova, and Kozma. The techniques employed in this work draw upon geometric analysis of relations in groups, information-theoretic coding theory on groups, and combinatorial and probabilistic methods.</description>

Abstract: We fully describe all horocycle orbit closures in $ \mathbb{Z} $-covers of compact hyperbolic surfaces. Our results rely on a careful analysis of the efficiency of all distance minimizing geodesic rays in the cover. As a corollary we obtain in this setting that all non-maximal horocycle orbit closures, while fractal, have integer Hausdorff dimension.</description>

      <title>The horocyclic metric on Teichm{\"u}ller spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his paper Minimal stretch maps between hyperbolic surfaces, William Thurston defined a norm on the tangent space to Teichm{\"u}ller space of a hyperbolic surface, which he called the earthquake norm. This norm is obtained by assigning a length to a tangent vector after such a vector is considered as an infinitesimal earthquake deformation of the surface. This induces a Finsler metric on the Teichm{\"u}ller space, called the earthquake metric. This theory was recently investigated by Huang, Ohshika, Pan and Papadopoulos. In the present paper, we study this metric from the conformal viewpoint and we adapt Thurston's theory to the case of Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus with marked points. A complex version of the Legendre transform defined for Finsler manifolds gives an analogue of the Wolpert duality for the Weil-Petersson symplectic form, which establishes a complete analogue of Thurston's theory of the earthquake norm in the conformal setting.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Lambda$ be a subfamily of the moduli space of degree $D\ge2$ polynomials defined by a finite number of parabolic relations. Let $\Omega$ be a bounded stable component of $\Lambda$ with the property that all critical points are attracted by either the persistent parabolic cycles or by attracting cycles in $\mathbb C$. We construct a positive semi-definite pressure form on $\Omega$ and show that it defines a path metric on $\Omega$. This provides a counterpart in complex dynamics of the pressure metric on cusped Hitchin components recently studied by Kao and Bray-Canary-Kao-Martone.</description>

      <title>Invariants of links and 3-manifolds from graph configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.09929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this self-contained book, following Edward Witten, Maxim Kontsevich, Greg Kuperberg and Dylan Thurston, we define an invariant Z of framed links in rational homology 3-spheres, and we study its properties. The invariant Z, which is often called the perturbative expansion of the Chern-Simons theory, is valued in a graded space generated by Jacobi diagrams. It counts embeddings of this kind of unitrivalent graphs in the ambient manifold, in a sense that is explained in the book, using integrals over configuration spaces, or, in a dual way, algebraic intersections in the same configuration spaces. When the ambient manifold is the standard 3-sphere, the invariant Z is a universal Vassiliev link invariant studied by many authors including Guadagnini, Martellini and Mintchev, Bar-Natan, Bott and Taubes, Altsch\"uler and Freidel, Thurston and Poirier... This book contains a more flexible definition of this invariant. We extend Z to a functor on a category of framed tangles in rational homology cylinders and we describe the behaviour of this functor under various operations including some cabling operations. We also compute iterated derivatives of our extended invariant with respect to the discrete derivatives associated to the main theories of finite type invariants. Together with recent results of Massuyeau and Moussard, our computations imply that the restriction of Z to rational homology 3-spheres (equipped with empty links) contains the same information as the Le-Murakami-Ohtsuki LMO invariant for these manifolds. They also imply that the degree one part of Z is the Casson-Walker invariant.</description>

      <title>Knot surgery formulae for instanton Floer homology I: the main theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.10077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an integral surgery formula for framed instanton homology $I^\sharp(Y_m(K))$ for any knot $K$ in a $3$-manifold $Y$ with $[K]=0\in H_1(Y;\mathbb{Q})$ and $m\neq 0$. Though the statement is similar to Ozsv\'ath-Szab\'o's integral surgery formula for Heegaard Floer homology, the proof is new and based on sutured instanton homology $SHI$ and the octahedral lemma in the derived category. As a corollary, we obtain an exact triangle between $I^\sharp(Y_m(K))$, $I^\sharp(Y_{m+k}(K))$ and $k$ copies of $I^\sharp(Y)$ for any $m\neq 0$ and large $k$. In the proof of the formula, we discover many new exact triangles for sutured instanton homology and relate some surgery cobordism map to the sum of bypass maps, which are of independent interest. In a companion paper, we derive many applications and computations based on the integral surgery formula.</description>

      <title>On quasi-arithmeticity of hyperbolic hybrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a more general version of the hybrid construction of Gromov and Piatetski--Shapiro, where the building blocks are no longer assumed to be arithmetic. We show that if such a general hyberbolic hybrid of dimension $\geqslant 3$ is quasi-arithmetic (a notion which is a broader notion than that of arithmeticity) then each building block must be quasi-arithmetic as well and, moreover, must with the same ambient group and adjoint trace field. On the other hand, we provide an example of a nonarithmetic but quasi-arithmetic orbifold such that a specific gluing of this orbifold with itself along the boundary gives rise to an arithmetic hyperbolic orbifold. We also note that if the building blocks are incommensurable, then the hybrid is not arithmetic. Together with the above, this implies that if a hyperbolic hybrid is arithmetic, then it is glued from commensurable quasi-arithmetic blocks.
  We illustrate the above results in the setting of reflection groups and hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedra and apply them to rule out the (quasi-)arithmeticity of a family of ideal hyperbolic right-angled $3$-polyhedra, namely, certain ``twisted'' ideal right-angled antiprisms.</description>

      <title>Vector bundle automorphisms preserving Morse-Bott foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and $\mathcal{F}$ a Morse-Bott foliation on $M$ with a compact critical manifold $\Sigma$. Denote by $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})$ the group of diffeomorphisms of $M$ leaving invariant each leaf of $\mathcal{F}$. Under certain assumptions on $\mathcal{F}$ it is shown that the computation of the homotopy type of $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})$ reduces to three rather independent groups: the group of diffeomorphisms of $\Sigma$, the group of vector bundle automorphisms of some regular neighborhood of $\Sigma$, and the subgroup of $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})$ consisting of diffeomorphisms fixed near $\Sigma$. Examples of computations of homotopy types of groups $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})$ for such foliations are also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the homeomorphism types of certain covers of (always orientable) surfaces, usually of infinite-type. We show that every surface with non-abelian fundamental group is covered by every noncompact surface, we identify the universal abelian covers and the $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$-homology covers of surfaces, and we show that non-locally finite characteristic covers of surfaces have four possible homeomorphism types.</description>

      <title>On Character Variety of Anosov Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be the free group $F_k$ of $k$ generators, $k \geq 2$, resp. the fundamental group $\pi_1(\Sigma_g)$ of a closed, connnected, orientatble surface of genus $g \geq 2$. We show that the charater variety of irreducible, resp. Zariski dense, Anosov representations of $\Gamma$ into $\SL(n, \C)$ is a complex manifold of (complex) dimension $(k-1)(n^2-1)$, resp. $(2g-2) (n^2-1)$. For $\Gamma=\pi_1(\Sigma_g)$, we also show that these character varieties are holomorphic symplectic manifolds.</description>

      <title>Preludes to the Eilenberg-Moore and the Leray-Serre spectral sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.10209v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Leray-Serre and the Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequences are fundamental tools for computing the cohomology of a group or, more generally, of a space. We describe the relationship between these two spectral sequences when both of them share the same abutment. There exists a joint tri-graded refinement of the Leray--Serre and the Eilenberg--Moore spectral sequence. This refinement involves two more spectral sequences, the preludes from the title, which abut to the initial terms of the Leray--Serre and the Eilenberg--Moore spectral sequence, respectively. We show that one of these always degenerates from its second page on and that the other one satisfies a local-to-global property: It degenerates for all possible base spaces if and only if it does so when the base space is contractible.</description>

      <title>Homotopy theoretic properties of open books</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.07063v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the homotopy groups of open books in terms of those of their pages and bindings. Under homotopy theoretic conditions on the monodromy we prove an integral decomposition result for the based loop space on an open book, and under more relaxed conditions prove a rational loop space decomposition. The latter case allows for a rational dichotomy theorem for open books, as an extension of the classical dichotomy in rational homotopy theory. As a direct application, we show that for Milnor's open book decomposition of an odd sphere with monodromy of finite order the induced action of the monodromy on the homology groups of its page cannot be nilpotent.</description>

      <title>K-differentials with prescribed singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.11654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the local invariants that a meromorphic $k$-differential on a Riemann surface of genus $g \geq 0$ can have for $k \geq 3$. These local invariants include the orders of zeros and poles, as well as the $k$-residues at the poles. We show that for a given pattern of orders of zeros, there exists, with a few exceptions, a primitive holomorphic $k$-differential having zeros of these orders. In the meromorphic case, for genus $g \geq 1$, every expected tuple appears as a configuration of $k$-residues. On the other hand, for certain strata in genus zero, finitely many tuples (up to simultaneous scaling) do not occur as configurations of $k$-residues for a $k$-differential.</description>

      <title>Bounded pluriharmonic functions and holomorphic functions on Teichm\"uller space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13535v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the boundary behavior of bounded pluriharmonic functions on the Teichm\"uller space. We will show a version of the Fatou theorem that every bounded pluriharmonic function admits the radial limits along the Teichm\"uller geodesic rays, and a version of the F. and M. Riesz theorem that the radial limit of a non-constant bounded holomorphic function is not constant on any non-null measurable set on the Bers boundary in terms of the pluriharmonic measure. As a corollary, we obtain the non-ergodicity of the action of the Torelli group for a closed surface of genus $g\ge 2$ on the space of projective measured foliations.</description>
