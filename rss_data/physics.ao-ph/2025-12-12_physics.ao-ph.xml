      <title>Impact of Background Conditions on the Structure and Propagation of the Boreal Summer Quasi-Biweekly Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the westward-propagating quasi-biweekly oscillation (QBWO) during boreal summer, with a focus on how background moisture and winds shape its structure and propagation. In dry regions, convection lags the circulation by nearly a quarter cycle, whereas in very moist regions it becomes nearly in-phase and extends across the QBWO gyre. As the background moistens, moisture anomalies increasingly align with the QBWO circulation. Despite differences in environmental moisture and wind conditions, several structural features remain robust: outgoing longwave radiation and moisture anomalies stay collocated, moisture and pressure-velocity anomalies remain vertically upright, and the filtered winds retain a first-baroclinic mode structure. A vorticity budget shows that, although the planetary vorticity-gradient term is important, both planetary stretching and horizontal advection are needed to explain the vorticity tendency- and their relative importance shifts with the moisture regime. In dry and moderately moist regions with easterly mean flow, mean winds primarily advect vorticity anomalies. In contrast, in very moist regions with westerly flow, anomalous winds instead advect the background vorticity. An analogous transition occurs in the moisture budget: in dry and moderately moist environments, zonal mean flow advection dominates, but in very moist regions, strong background moisture gradients allow eddy advection of the mean moisture field to become the leading term. In the moist regime, vertical advection, precipitation, and evaporation also contribute substantially to the moisture tendency. Overall, the QBWO behaves like a mean-flow-driven linear mode in dry and moderately moist regions with easterly background winds, but shifts toward a regime dominated by eddy advection of background vorticity and moisture in very moist regions characterized by westerly flow.</description>

      <title>Convective and non-convective nature of Balearic meteotsunamis:a 50-year historical review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meteotsunamis, locally known as rissaga in the Balearic Islands, are significant sea-level oscillations induced by atmospheric disturbances, with amplitudes and frequencies comparable to seismic tsunamis. The port of Ciutadella (Menorca), is a recognized hotspot for meteotsunami occurrence. This study presents a 50-year analysis of 191 meteotsunami events recorded in Ciutadella between 1975 and 2025, focusing on the distinction between the convective and non-convective nature of the pressure disturbances that triggered the meteotsunami event and their implications for predictability and risk assessment. Events were classified using historical records, in-situ barographic and sea-level observations, satellite imagery, and lightning data. Results show that non-convective meteotsunamis are typically triggered by internal gravity waves, producing relatively regular and moderate pressure fluctuations. In contrast, convective events are associated with abrupt pressure jumps and tend to produce the most extreme sea-level oscillations, exceeding 3-4 meters in some cases, such as the catastrophic events of June 1984 and June 2006. Forecasting skill varied by event type: A full-realistic high-resolution ocean-atmosphere modelling system (BRIFS) performed better for convective cases, whereas a targeted reduced-physics method (TRAM) was more accurate for non-convective scenarios. This study provides the most extensive meteotsunami dataset for the Balearic Islands to date and offers a novel framework for understanding the contrasting dynamics and characteristics of both types of events. The results support the development of improved early-warning systems and more effective coastal risk mitigation strategies in vulnerable regions.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of preCICE (version 3.3.0) in an Earth System Model Regridding Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Earth System Modeling (ESM), meshes of different models usually do not match, requiring data mapping algorithms implemented in coupling software. Valcke et al. recently introduced a benchmark to evaluate such algorithms and compared implementations in four specialized ESM couplers. In this paper, we assess preCICE, a general-purpose coupling library not limited to ESM, using this benchmark and compare our results to the original study. The generality of preCICE with its larger community offers potential benefits to ESM applications, but the software naturally lacks ESM-specific solutions. We describe necessary pre- and postprocessing steps to make the benchmark tangible for preCICE. Overall, preCICE achieves comparable results; using its radial basis function mapping yields significantly lower errors.</description>

      <title>An analytical framework for atmospheric tides on rocky planets. I. Formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric thermal tides arise from the diurnal contrast in stellar irradiation. They exert a significant influence on the long-term rotational evolution of rocky planets because they can accelerate the planetary spin, thereby counteracting the decelerating effect of classical gravitational tides. Consequently, equilibrium tide-locked states may emerge, as exemplified by Venus and hypothesised for Precambrian Earth. Quantifying the atmospheric thermal torque and elucidating its dependence on tidal frequency -- both in the low- and high-frequency regimes -- is therefore essential. In particular, we focus here on the resonance that affected early Earth, which is associated with a forced Lamb wave. Within the framework of linear theory, we develop a new analytical model of the atmospheric response to both gravitational an thermal tidal forcings for two representative vertical temperature profiles that bracket the atmospheres of rocky planets: (i) an isothermal profile (uniform temperature) and (ii) an isentropic profile (uniform potential temperature). Dissipative processes are incorporated via Newtonian cooling. We demonstrate that the isothermal and isentropic cases are governed by the same general closed-form solution, and we derive explicit expressions for the three-dimensional tidal fields (pressure, temperature, density and wind velocities) throughout the spherical atmospheric shell. These results constitute the foundation for two forthcoming papers, in which analytical formulae for the thermotidal torque will be presented and compared with numerical solutions obtained from General Circulation Models (GCMs).</description>

      <title>Impact of geometry on 1D molecular-kinetics simulations of acoustic-gravity wave propagation into the exosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) calculations of acoustic gravity wave propagation into the exobase region of a Mars-like atmosphere reveal that radial geometry can reduce wave-driven heating compared to a Cartesian model. We examine two acoustic wave (AW) modes with periods of 11 minutes (AW1) and 5.5 minutes (AW2) propagating from 100 to 320 km altitude using a radial molecular kinetics model. The wave-driven heating was reduced by 40-56% with cycle-averaged temperature gradient $\langle dT/dr \rangle$ decreasing from 9.4 K per scale height H0 to 5.6 K/H$_0$ for AW1 and from 4.4 K/H$_0$ to 1.9 K/H$_0$ for AW2 when accounting for planetary curvature. While the growth in wave density amplitude was attenuated for the 1D radial geometry as well, the heating differences are more pronounced, with both effects driven by geometric spreading accumulating as waves propagate into increasingly rarefied regions. These findings suggest that accounting for curvature effects is crucial when conducting DSMC estimates of acoustic wave contributions to thermospheric heating and atmospheric escape, as Cartesian-based derived counterparts may be overestimated by factors of 1.7-2.3 for these frequencies.</description>

      <title>ERF: Energy Research and Forecasting Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High performance computing (HPC) architectures have undergone rapid development in recent years. As a result, established software suites face an ever increasing challenge to remain performant on and portable across modern systems. Many of the widely adopted atmospheric modeling codes cannot fully (or in some cases, at all) leverage the acceleration provided by General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs), leaving users of those codes constrained to increasingly limited HPC resources. Energy Research and Forecasting (ERF) is a regional atmospheric modeling code that leverages the latest HPC architectures, whether composed of only Central Processing Units (CPUs) or incorporating GPUs. ERF contains many of the standard discretizations and basic features needed to model general atmospheric dynamics as well as flows relevant to renewable energy. The modular design of ERF provides a flexible platform for exploring different physics parameterizations and numerical strategies. ERF is built on a state-of-the-art, well-supported, software framework (AMReX) that provides a performance portable interface and ensures ERF's long-term sustainability on next generation computing systems. This paper details the numerical methodology of ERF and presents results for a series of verification and validation cases.</description>

      <title>AI-Informed Model Analogs for Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subseasonal-to-seasonal forecasting is crucial for public health, disaster preparedness, and agriculture, and yet it remains a particularly challenging timescale to predict. We explore the use of an interpretable AI-informed model analog forecasting approach, previously employed on longer timescales, to improve S2S predictions. Using an artificial neural network, we learn a mask of weights to optimize analog selection and showcase its versatility across three varied prediction tasks: 1) classification of Week 3-4 Southern California summer temperatures; 2) regional regression of Month 1 midwestern U.S. summer temperatures; and 3) classification of Month 1-2 North Atlantic wintertime upper atmospheric winds. The AI-informed analogs outperform traditional analog forecasting approaches, as well as climatology and persistence baselines, for deterministic and probabilistic skill metrics on both climate model and reanalysis data. We find the analog ensembles built using the AI-informed approach also produce better predictions of temperature extremes and improve representation of forecast uncertainty. Finally, by using an interpretable-AI framework, we analyze the learned masks of weights to better understand S2S sources of predictability.</description>
