      <title>The Scale for the Expansion of the Universe: From Local Structures to Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study tackles the impact dark energy in different systems by a simple unifying formalism. We introduce a parameter space to compare gravity tests across all cosmic scales, using the McVittie spacetime (MCV), that connect spherically symmetric solutions with cosmological solutions. By analyzing invariant scalars, the Ricci, Weyl, and Kretschmann scalars, we develop a phase-space description that predicts the dominance of the Cosmological Constant. We explore three cases: (1) the local Hubble flow around galaxy groups and clusters, (2) spherical density distributions and (3) binary motion. Our results show that galaxy groups and clusters exhibit Kretschmann scalar values consistent with the Cosmological Constant curvature, indicating where dark energy dominates.</description>

      <title>Predictions of Stochastic Composite Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this essay I describe some new results of a framework for composite gravity coupled to matter. These include the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula, modifications to the low-$\ell$ moments of the CMB power spectrum, and new perspectives on the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal and the initial conditions for inflation. We conclude with suggestions for experimental tests of the framework.</description>

      <title>Probing loop quantum effects through solar system experiments: observational signatures and parameter constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates quantum gravity effects within the framework of an effective loop quantum gravity (LQG) black hole model parameterized by $\zeta$, utilizing precision measurements from solar system experiments and astrophysical observations. We analyze three classical tests of general relativity (GR): (1) Light deflection constrained by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of quasar radio signals, (2) Shapiro time delay measurements from the Cassini mission, and (3) Mercury's perihelion precession determined by MESSENGER mission data. Additionally, we extend our analysis to Earth-orbiting LAGEOS satellites and the relativistic trajectory of the S2 star orbiting the Galactic Center supermassive black hole Sagittarius $\rm{A}^*$ (Sgr $\rm{A}^{*}$). Our multi-probe approach reveals that the tightest constraint on the LQG parameter comes from Mercury's perihelion precession, yielding an upper bound $\zeta \lesssim 10^{-2}$. These results establish new observational benchmarks for probing quantum gravity effects.</description>

      <title>Reconciling the Weak Gravity and Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjectures in Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg-AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential conflict between the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) and the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) poses a significant challenge in general relativity. The WCCC serves as a fundamental assumption ensuring the coherence of gravitational theory. This study investigates the reconciliation of the WGC and the WCCC by examining Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg-AdS black holes in four-dimensional spacetime. By imposing specific constraints on the metric parameters, we demonstrate that the WGC and the WCCC can coexist harmoniously. Detailed analyses of Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg-AdS black holes for \( Q &gt; M \) validate the simultaneous fulfillment of the two conjectures, particularly in scenarios where \( q^2/m^2 \geq \left(Q^2 / M^2\right)_{\text{e}} \). The electromagnetic self-interaction parameter \( \mu \) plays a crucial role in achieving this compatibility. Our findings establish that Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg-AdS black holes provide a robust framework for harmonizing the WGC and the WCCC. In particular, for exceedingly small values of ($\mu$)-or, equivalently, when the condition ($\mu \ll \ell$) is satisfied-the structure of our black hole transitions in a way that distinctly reveals its compatibility with the WGC. This study also explores the compatibility of the WGC and the WCCC with photon spheres. It examines parameter spaces that satisfy both conjectures, ensuring event horizons and photon spheres while maintaining black hole properties. Key results demonstrate that small \( \mu \) values preserve WCCC adherence and validate WGC through photon sphere characteristics.</description>

      <title>Generalized entropic dark energy with spatial curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of thermodynamics of apparent horizon, we construct a dark energy (DE) model from 4-parameter generalized entropy of apparent horizon in a spatially non-flat universe. In particular, considering a non-zero spatial curvature of the universe, we determine the dark energy fractional density and the dark energy equation of state (EoS) parameter (corresponding to the 4-parameter generalized entropy) in closed analytic forms. It turns out that the scenario can describe the correct thermal history of the universe, with the sequence of matter and dark energy epochs. Comparing with the $\Lambda$CDM model, the proposed generalized entropic DE model provides a higher value of the present Hubble parameter for a certain range of entropic parameter(s) leading to a possible resolution of the Hubble tension issue. This in turn leads to a positive spatial curvature of the universe. We confront the scenario with CC \&amp; BAO, Pantheon+ \&amp; SH0ES and joint analysis of the CC \&amp; BAO \&amp; Pantheon+ \&amp; SH0ES datasets, which clearly depicts the phenomenological viability of the present model for some best fitted values of entropic parameter(s) that are indeed consistent with the resolution of Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Higgs-Modular Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of the Higgs field as a fundamental scalar in the Standard Model within the framework of modular inflation models, where a modulus field acts as the inflaton and its interactions are governed by an underlying modular symmetry. In general, the Higgs field can participate in the dynamics of modular inflation, leading to a two-field inflationary system-termed \emph{Higgs-Modular inflation}-which exhibits non-trivial dynamics and interesting phenomenological implications. We analyze Higgs-Modular inflation both analytically and numerically, highlighting its attractor behavior and the resulting observational constraints. In particular, we find that Higgs-Modular inflation is favored by the latest data release from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in certain regions of parameter space. This is in contrast to both pure Higgs inflation and pure modular inflation with a Starobinsky-type potential, which tend to predict a relatively low spectral index. Additionally, we discuss the cutoff scale of this inflationary model and the reheating processes induced by the decays of the modulus and the Higgs field.</description>

      <title>On the Original Derivation of the Cosmological Gurzadyan's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cosmology, the Gurzadyan's theorem identifies the most general force law consistent with the finding of Newton's first shell theorem -- that a spherical symmetric mass exerts the same gravitational force as a point mass at its center. This theorem has found important applications in cosmological modeling, particularly in the context of MoND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics), which has recently gained renewed attention as a potential alternative to dark matter. The original derivation is written in an extremely concise and dense style, making it difficult to follow. Recent proofs of the theorem based on power-series methods offer valuable perspectives, though they differ from the original derivation, which is based on perturbation analysis. Our note aims to clarify the underlying logic in a pedagogical way -- accessible to advanced high school or undergraduate students -- while preserving conceptual clarity and mathematical elegance of the original insight.</description>

      <title>On the presence of a fifth force at the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims: The presence of a Yukawa-like correction to Newtonian gravity is investigated at the Galactic Center, leading to a new upper limit for the intensity of such a correction. Methods: We perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis using the astrometric and spectroscopic data of star S$2$ collected at the Very Large Telescope by GRAVITY, NACO and SINFONI instruments, covering the period from $1992$ to $2022$. Results: The precision of the GRAVITY instrument allows us to derive the most stringent upper limit at the Galactic Center for the intensity of the Yukawa contribution ($\propto \, \alpha e^{- \lambda r}$) to be $|\alpha| &lt; 0.003$ for a scale length $\lambda = 3 \cdot 10^{13}\, \rm m\, (\sim 200 \, \rm AU)$. This improves by roughly one order of magnitude all estimates obtained in previous works.</description>

      <title>No Dark Matter Axion During Minimal Higgs Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study minimal versions of Higgs inflation in the presence of a massless QCD axion. While the inflationary energy scale of the metric variant is too high to accommodate isocurvature bounds, it was argued that Palatini Higgs inflation could evade these constraints. We show, however, that an energy-dependent decay constant enhances isocurvature perturbations, implying that axions can at most constitute a tiny fraction $&lt; 10^{-5}$ of dark matter. This conclusion can be avoided in Einstein-Cartan gravity by an additional coupling of the axion to torsion, albeit for a very specific choice of parameters. Analogous constraints as well as the possibility to alleviate them are relevant for all inflationary models with a non-minimal coupling to gravity.</description>

      <title>Probing Gauged $U(1)$ Sub-GeV Dark Matter via Cosmic Ray Cooling in Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) traversing the dark matter (DM) spike surrounding active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can be cooled through interactions with DM particles. In this study, we investigated constraints on sub-GeV DM particles charged under various $U(1)$ gauge symmetries by exploiting the cooling effect of CRs in AGNs. We find that for low DM and mediator masses, the CR cooling rate is higher compared to the standard model cooling process. Furthermore, by utilizing constraints from the CR cooling effect in NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056, we explore the bounds on the DM-electron and DM-proton elastic scattering cross-sections. Our results indicate that in the sub-GeV DM mass range, these constraints are more stringent than those from certain boosted DM mechanisms and current direct detection limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The It from Qubit paradigm proposes that gravitational spacetimes emerge from quantum entanglement. So far, the main evidence for this involves holographic dualities, where the entangled qubits live in a dual nongravitational theory. In this essay, we argue that string theory provides the mechanism to define these entangled qubits in the bulk gravitating theory. This involves a local form of geometric transition, which is the stringy mechanism that underlies \emph{local} holography. We illustrate how this works in the A model topological string,</description>

      <title>Wave-particle duality of gravitational radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the continuous quantum measurement of gravitational radiation. This is typically done by coupling the radiation to a meter, such as a resonant mass detector or an interferometer, which is subsequently read out by a detector. We find that the detector employed determines whether the gravitational field exhibits wave or particle characteristics. A linear detector, such as a homodyne detector, yields no signal for a field in a Fock state and a signal proportional to the amplitude of a field in a coherent state. Such a linear detector thus supports a wave-like interpretation. By contrast, the signal from a detector coupled to the meter's energy is non-zero only when the incident radiation contains at least a single graviton, resulting in a quantum jump in energy equal to the energy of the absorbed graviton. Our results extend the principle of complementarity to quantized gravitational radiation, demonstrating the detector dependence of the graviton, and indicates that conceptually simple modifications to gravitational-wave detectors can make them graviton counters.</description>

      <title>Initial data on big bang singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.04919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this article is to parametrise solutions to Einstein's equations with big bang singularities and quiescent asymptotics. To this end, we introduce a notion of initial data on big bang singularities and conjecture that it can be used to parametrise quiescent solutions. A mathematical statement of the conjecture presupposes a precise definition of the class of quiescent solutions as well as a proof of existence and uniqueness of developments corresponding to initial data on a big bang singularity. We provide one definition of quiescence here. We also appeal to existing results in order to illustrate that, in certain cases, there are unique developments corresponding to initial data on the singularity. However, our perspective leads to a large class of open problems corresponding to the general conjecture. An additional benefit of the notion of initial data developed here is that it can be used to give a unified perspective on the existing results concerning quiescent singularities. In fact, we provide several examples of how existing results can be considered to be special cases of the framework developed here. A second, potential, application is to oscillatory and spatially inhomogeneous big bang singularities. Considering the existing arguments in the spatially homogeneous setting, a crucial first step in the study of oscillatory behaviour is to understand how solutions approach the Kasner circle along a stable manifold, and then depart via an unstable manifold. In order to carry out a similar analysis in the spatially inhomogeneous setting, it is of central importance to first identify the stable manifold. Building on the work of Fournodavlos and Luk, we here propose such an identification.</description>

Abstract: We present a covariant description of non-vacuum static spherically symmetric spacetimes in $f(R)$ gravity applying the (1+1+2) covariant formalism. The propagation equations are then used to derive a covariant and dimensionless form of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations. We then give a solution strategy to these equations and obtain some new exact solutions for the particular case $f(R)=R+\alpha R^{2}$, which have the correct thermodynamic properties for standard matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The path integral approach to a quantum theory of gravity is widely regarded as an indispensable strategy. However, determining what additional elements, beyond black hole or AdS spacetime, should be incorporated into the path integral remains crucial yet perplexing. We argue that the spacetime with a conical singularity in its Euclidean counterpart should be the most important ingredient to append to the path integral. Therefore, physical quantities should be ensemble-averaged over all geometries since they are described by the same Lorentzian metric. When the ensemble average is introduced, the Hawking-Page transition for the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole and the small-large black hole transition for the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-AdS black hole naturally arise as semi-classical approximations, when the size of the black hole system is much larger than the Planck length. Away from the semi-classical limit, the system is a superposition of different geometries, and the averaged quantities would deviate from the black hole thermodynamics. Expanding around the classical saddles, the subleading order of the Newton constant contributions can be derived, which are half of the Hawking temperature both for the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black holes. The result may imply a universal structure. The subsubleading terms and more intriguing physics that diverge from black hole thermodynamics are revealed. The ensemble-averaged theory provides a new way of studying subleading effects and extending the traditional AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the three most general cases of progressive de Sitter spacetime. The charged and magnetic particles tunnel into the magnetically charged Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m de Sitter black hole (the most general case of a static black hole), the Kerr-Newman-Kasuya de Sitter black hole (the most general case of a rotating black hole), and Bardeen de Sitter black hole (black hole without singularities). We use Parikh-Wilczek method to calculate the radiation spectra of these black holes respectively, and find that they deviate from the pure thermal spectra, satisfying the unitary principle. Our results support the conservation of information and are generally true for all asymptotic de Sitter space-times.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Collapse in Scale-Dependent Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study an Oppenheimer-Snyder (OS)-like gravitational collapse in the general framework of scale-dependent gravity. We explore the collapse in spherically symmetric solutions suggested both by asymptotically safe gravity (characterized by a positive $\om$-parameter) and by scale-dependent gravity (negative $\om$-parameter), when a singularity at a finite positive radial coordinate is developed. The inner geometry of the collapsing star is described, as usual, by a spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, and matter is uniformly distributed without any assumptions about its equation of state. The outer asymptotically-safe/scale-dependent black hole metric is smoothly matched to the inner geometry, and this yields the equation of motion of the star surface, the energy density, pressure, and equation of state of the collapsing matter. We study in detail the proper-time evolution of the event and apparent horizons. Finally, the constraints of the energy conditions on the equation of state, and its properties, are considered and discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze existence and properties of solutions of two-dimensional general relativistic initial data sets with a negative cosmological constant, both on spacelike and characteristic surfaces. A new family of such vacuum, spacelike data parameterised by poles at the conformal boundary at infinity is constructed. We review the notions of global Hamiltonian charges, emphasising the difficulties arising in this dimension, both in a spacelike and characteristic setting. One or two, depending upon the topology, lower bounds for energy in terms of angular momentum, linear momentum, and center of mass are established.</description>

      <title>The Trinity of black hole correspondences: Shadows-quasinormal modes-graybody factors and cautionary remarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correspondences between apparently distant concepts are ubiquitous in theoretical physics. In the context of Black Holes (BHs), Quasi-Normal Modes (QNMs) were shown to be linked to both shadows, in the so-called eikonal limit, and Gray-Body Factors (GBFs), using the WKB approximation. We test the accuracy of the QNM-GBF correspondence in the context of the Hawking radiation for static and rotating black hole configurations, with particular attention to the superradiant regime. Our analysis reveals the correspondence failure to accurately reproduce the Hawking spectrum due to divergences. Furthermore, we bridge the gap between BH shadows and GBFs by drawing a correspondence between such quantities in the case of generic static and spherically symmetric spacetime configurations. The shadow-GBF correspondence is tested for some case studies, including regular BHs, and its limitations and applicability are discussed. This study opens new perspectives by introducing a new correspondence and remarking on the caution needed when considering these connections.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on dark energy parametrizations after DESI 2024: Persistent deviation from standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a study on cosmological constraints of dark energy (DE) parametrizations after the observations of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instruments (DESI) for Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in 2024, suggesting potential deviations from the standard flat-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This study aims to put observational constraints on equation of state (EoS) parametrizations beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model using DESI BAO 2024 data, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy observations 2018, and various Supernovae type Ia (SNIa) compilations: PantheonPlus, Union3, and Dark Energy Survey 5-year photometrically classified SNIa (DES-SN5YR). Our main goal is to validate the result of DESI collaborations \cite{DESI:2024mwx} in the context of some parametrizations beyond the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) approximation known as Barboza-Alcaniz (BA) and Pad\'e parametrizations. These investigations allow us to examine the potential biases in the results presented by DESI collaborations with respect to CPL parametrization. By comparing our findings using BA and Pad\'e parametrizations to the CPL case, we indicate that the deviation from $w_{\Lambda} = -1.0$, observed in the CPL parametrization, is also evident in the BA and Pad\'e parametrizations.</description>

      <title>Polarization Patterns of the Hotspots Plunging into a Kerr Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multi-wavelength polarized light signals from supermassive black holes have sparked many studies on polarized images of accretion disks and hotspots. However, the polarization patterns within the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) region remain to be explored. In this study, we focus on two specific types of orbits, namely the plunging geodesics inward from the ISCO and homoclinic geodesics, to uncover the polarization features associated with non-circular motion in a Kerr spacetime. For an on-axis observer, we specifically develop an approximate function to describe gravitational lensing along the azimuthal direction and establish a simplified synchrotron emission model. Based on these, we analyze the time-integrated polarized images of hotspots and their Stokes parameters. Moreover, we explore the polarized image of the plunging region within a thin accretion disk.</description>

      <title>IR finite correlation functions in de Sitter space, a smooth massless limit, and an autonomous equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16226v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore two-point and four-point correlation functions of a massive scalar field on the flat de Sitter background in the long-wavelength approximation. By employing the Yang-Feldman-type equation, we compute the two-point correlation function up to the $\lambda^3$ order and the four-point correlation function up to the $\lambda^2$ one. In contrast to the standard theory of a massive scalar field based on the de Sitter-invariant vacuum, we develop the vacuum-independent reasoning that may not possess de Sitter invariance but results in a smooth massless limit of the correlation function's infrared part. Our elaboration affords to calculate correlation functions of a free massive scalar field and to proceed with quantum corrections, relying only on the known two-point correlation function's infrared part of a free massless one. Remarkably, the two-point correlation function of a free massive scalar field coincides with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process's one and has a clear physical interpretation. We compared our results with those obtained with the Schwinger-Keldysh diagrammatic technique, Starobinsky's stochastic approach, and the Hartree-Fock approximation. At last, we have constructed a renormalization group-inspired autonomous equation for the two-point correlation function. Integrating its approximate version, one obtains the non-analytic expression with respect to a self-interaction coupling constant $\lambda$. That solution reproduces the correct perturbative series up to the two-loop level. At the late-time limit, it almost coincides with the result of Starobinsky's stochastic approach in the whole interval of a new dimensionless parameter $0 \leq \tfrac{\pi^2 m^4}{3\lambda H^4} &lt; \infty$.</description>

      <title>The effect of curvature on local observables in quantum field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the leading order corrections to the expected value of the squared field amplitude of a massless real scalar quantum field due to curvature in a localized region of spacetime. We use Riemann normal coordinates to define localized field operators in a curved spacetime that are analogous to their flat space counterparts, and the Hadamard condition to find the leading order curvature corrections to the field correlations. We then apply our results to particle detector models, quantifying the effect of spacetime curvature in localized field probes.</description>

      <title>Standardizing reverberation-mapped H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ active galactic nuclei using radius--luminosity relations involving monochromatic and broad H$\alpha$ luminosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We test the standardizability of a homogeneous sample of 41 lower-redshift ($0.00415\leq z \leq 0.474$) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reverberation-mapped (RM) using the broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines. We find that these sources can be standardized using four radius$-$luminosity ($R-L$) relations incorporating H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ time delays and monochromatic and broad H$\alpha$ luminosities. Although the $R-L$ relation parameters are well constrained and independent of the six cosmological models considered, the resulting cosmological constraints are weak. The measured $R-L$ relations exhibit slightly steeper slopes than predicted by a simple photoionization model and steeper than those from previous higher-redshift H$\beta$ analyses based on larger datasets. These differences likely reflect the absence of high-accreting sources in our smaller, lower-redshift sample, which primarily comprises lower-accreting AGNs. The inferred cosmological parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ (or better) with those from better-established cosmological probes. This contrasts with our earlier findings using a larger, heterogeneous sample of 118 H$\beta$ AGNs, which yielded cosmological constraints differing by $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ from better-established cosmological probes. Our analysis demonstrates that sample homogeneity$-$specifically, the use of a consistent time-lag determination method$-$is crucial for developing RM AGNs as a cosmological probe.</description>

      <title>Bubble wall velocity for first-order QCD phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although the QCD phase transition is a crossover in the standard model, nonstandard effects such as a large lepton asymmetry are known to make it first order, with possible applications to gravitational wave production. This process is sensitive to the speed of the bubble walls during the phase transition, which is difficult to compute from first principles. We take advantage of recent progress on wall speed determinations to provide a simple estimate valid in the small supercooling regime which constrains the wall speed to be significantly lower than what has been used in previous literature. This in turn strongly suppresses the production of gravitational waves, to a level that is just out of reach of the most sensitive projected experiment for this signal, $\mu$Ares. While our analysis approximates the equation of state using the template model, we demonstrate that our conclusions remain robust when incorporating state-of-the-art QCD equation of state data.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Constraints on SIGW with Future Pulsar Timing Array Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays are playing a crucial role in the ongoing gravitational wave astronomy revolution. The current evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nHz frequencies offers an opportunity to discover cosmological signals and threatens the observability of other subdominant GWs. We explore prospects to constrain second-order scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs) associated with enhanced curvature perturbations in the primordial universe, forecasting realistic future PTA datasets. We assess how the currently observed signal could eventually limit future capabilities to search for GW relics of primordial phenomena and associated phenomenological consequences such as primordial black hole (PBH) formation. Given the sensitivity of PBH abundance to spectral parameters, measuring it remains a challenge for realistic signals. However, future observation could still rule out nearly subsolar mass PBHs formed through standard formation scenarios in some cases. Future progress in constraining PBH models is expected to stem from theoretical advancements in PBH computations, which should help resolve the tension between different computational methods. The analysis is based on and extends the Python code $\texttt{fastPTA}$.</description>
