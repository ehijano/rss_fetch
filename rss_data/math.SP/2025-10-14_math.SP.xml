      <title>Spectrum of the wave equation with Dirac damping on a compact star graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the wave equation with a distributional Dirac damping and Dirichlet boundary conditions on a compact interval. It is shown that the spectrum of the corresponding wave operator is fully determined by zeroes of an entire function. Consequently, a considerable change of spectral properties is shown for certain critical values of the damping parameter. We also derive a definitive criterion for the Riesz basis property of the root vectors for an arbitrary placement of a complex-valued Dirac damping. Finally, we consider a generalisation of the problem for compact star graphs and provide insight into the essence of the critical damping constant.</description>

      <title>The Spectral Edges Conjecture via Corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Spectral Edges Conjecture is a well-known and widely believed conjecture in the theory of discrete periodic operators. It states that the extrema of the dispersion relation are isolated, non-degenerate, and occur in a single band. We present two infinite families of periodic graphs which satisfy the Spectral Edges Conjecture. For each, every extremum of the dispersion relation is a corner point (point of symmetry). In fact, each spectral band function is a perfect Morse function. We also give a construction that increases dimension, while preserving that each spectral band function is a perfect Morse function.</description>

      <title>Spectral and Dynamical Analysis of Fractional Discrete Laplacians on the Half-Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate discrete fractional Laplacians defined on the half-lattice in several dimensions, allowing possibly different fractional orders along each coordinate direction. By expressing the half-lattice operator as a boundary restriction of the full-lattice one plus a bounded correction that is relatively compact with respect to it, we show that both operators share the same essential spectrum and the same interior threshold structure. For perturbations by a decaying potential, the conjugate-operator method provides a strict Mourre estimate on any compact energy window inside the continuous spectrum, excluding threshold points. As a consequence, a localized Limiting Absorption Principle holds, ensuring the absence of singular continuous spectrum, the finiteness of eigenvalues, and weighted propagation (transport) bounds. The form-theoretic construction also extends naturally to negative fractional orders. Overall, the relative compactness of the boundary correction guarantees that the interior-energy spectral and dynamical results obtained on the full lattice remain valid on the half-lattice without modification.</description>

      <title>Weyl asymptotics for pseudodifferential operators in a discrete setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a sharp Weyl estimate for the number of eigenvalues belonging to a fixed interval of energy of a self-adjoint difference operator acting on $\ell^2(\epsilon\mathbb{Z}^d)$ if the associated symplectic volume of phase space in ${\mathbb R}^d \times {\mathbb T}^d$ accessible for the Hamiltonian flow of the principal symbol is finite. Here $\epsilon$ is a semiclassical parameter. Our proof depends crucially on the construction of a good semiclassical approximation for the time evolution induced by the self-adjoint operator on $\ell^2(\epsilon \mathbb{Z}^d)$. This extends previous semiclassical results to a broad class of difference operators on a scaled lattice.</description>

      <title>Sparse graphs and their Benjamini-Schramm limits: a spectral tour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse graphs with bounded average degree form a rich class of discrete structures where local geometry strongly influences global behavior. The Benjamini-Schramm (BS) convergence offers a natural framework to describe their asymptotic local structure. In this note, we survey spectral aspects of BS convergence and their applications, with a focus on random Schreier graphs and covering graphs. We review some recent progress on the spectral decomposition of the local operators on graphs. We discuss the behavior of extreme eigenvalues and the growing role of strong convergence in distribution, which rules out spectral outliers. We also give a new application of strong convergence to the typical graph distance between vertices in Schreier graphs</description>

      <title>Area Law for the entanglement entropy of free fermions in nonrandom ergodic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with the asymptotic behavior of one of the widely used characteristics of correlations in large quantum systems. The correlations are known as quantum entanglement, the characteristic is called the entanglement entropy, and as large systems we consider an ideal gas of spinless lattice fermions. The system is determined by its one-body Hamiltonian. As shown in \cite{EPS}, if the Hamiltonian is an ergodic finite difference operator with exponentially decaying spectral projection, then the asymptotic form of the entanglement entropy is the so-called Area Law. However, the only one-body Hamiltonian for which this spectral condition is verified is the $d$-dimensional discrete Schr\"odinger operators with random potential. In the present paper, we prove that the same asymptotic form of the entanglement entropy holds for a wide class of Schr\"odinger operators whose potentials are ergodic but nonrandom. We start with the quasiperiodic and limit periodic operators, and then pass to the interesting and highly non-trivial case of the potentials generated by subshifts of finite type. They arose in the theory of dynamical systems in the study of non-random chaotic phenomena. As it turns out, obtaining the asymptotics of the entanglement entropy of free fermions requires a quite involved spectral analysis of the corresponding Schr\"odinger operator. Specifically, we prove for this class two important and interesting in itself spectral properties, known as exponential dynamic localisation in expectation and the exponential decay of the eigenfunction correlator, implying the Area Law for the entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Marked Poincar\'e rigidity near hyperbolic metrics and injectivity of the Lichnerowicz Laplacian in dimension 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact manifold without boundary equipped with a Riemannian metric $g$ of negative curvature. In this paper, we introduce the marked Poincar\'e determinant (MPD), a homothety invariant of $g$ depending on differentiable periodic data of its geodesic flow. The MPD associates to each free homotopy class of closed curves in $M$ a number which measures the unstable volume expansion of the geodesic flow along the associated closed geodesic. We prove a local MPD rigidity result in dimension 3: if $g$ is sufficiently close to a hyperbolic metric $g_0$ and both metrics have the same MPD, then they are homothetic. As a by-product of our proof, we show the Lichnerowicz Laplacian of $g_0$ is injective on the space of trace-free divergence-free symmetric 2-tensors, which, to our knowledge, is the first result of its kind in negative curvature.</description>

      <title>On the Hausdorff measure of sets of non-Lyapunov behaviour, and a Jarnik-type theorem for random Schroedinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the growth of the norms of transfer matrices of ergodic discrete Schr\"odinger operators in one dimension. It is known that the set of energies at which the rate of exponential growth is slower than prescribed by the Lyapunov exponent is residual in the part of the spectrum at which the Lyapunov exponent is positive. On the other hand, this exceptional set is of vanishing Hausdorff measure with respect to any gauge function $\rho(t)$ such that $\rho(t)/t$ is integrable at zero. Here we show that this condition on $\rho(t)$ can not in general be improved: for operators with independent, identically distributed potentials of sufficiently regular distribution, the set of energies at which the rate of exponential growth is arbitrarily slow has infinite Hausdorff measure with respect to any gauge function $\rho(t)$ such that $\rho(t)/t$ is non-increasing and not integrable at zero. The main technical ingredient, possibly of independent interest, is a Jarn\'ik-type theorem describing the Hausdorff measure of the set of real numbers well approximated by the eigenvalues of the Schr\"odinger operator. The proof of this result relies on the theory of Anderson localisation and on the mass transference principle of Beresnevich--Velani.</description>

      <title>Various form closures associated with a fixed non-semibounded self-adjoint operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If $T$ is a semibounded self-adjoint operator in a Hilbert space $(H, \, (\cdot , \cdot))$ then the closure of the sesquilinear form $(T \cdot , \cdot)$ is a unique Hilbert space completion. In the non-semibounded case a closure is a Kre\u{\i}n space completion and generally, it is not unique. Here, all such closures are studied. A one-to-one correspondence between all closed symmetric forms (with ``gap point'' $0$) and all J-non-negative, J-self-adjoint and boundedly invertible Kre\u{\i}n space operators is observed. Their eigenspectral functions are investigated, in particular near the critical point infinity. An example for infinitely many closures of a fixed form $(T \cdot , \cdot)$ is discussed in detail using a non-semibounded self-adjoint multiplication operator $T$ in a model Hilbert space. These observations indicate that closed symmetric forms may carry more information than self-adjoint Hilbert space operators.</description>

      <title>On the open TS/ST correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topological string/spectral theory correspondence establishes a precise, non-perturbative duality between topological strings on local Calabi-Yau threefolds and the spectral theory of quantized mirror curves. While this duality has been rigorously formulated for the closed topological string sector, the open string sector remains less understood. Building on the results of [1-3], we make further progress in this direction by constructing entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the quantized mirror curve from open topological string partition functions. We focus on local $\mathbb{F}_0$, whose mirror curve corresponds to the Baxter equation of the two-particle, relativistic Toda lattice. We then study the standard and dual four-dimensional limits, where the quantum mirror curve for local $\mathbb{F}_0$ degenerates into the modified Mathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, respectively. In these limits, our framework provides a way to construct entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the difference equations associated with these operators. Furthermore, we find a simple relation between the on-shell eigenfunctions of the modified Mathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, leading to a functional relation between the operators themselves.</description>

Abstract: Given a compact subgroup K of the orthogonal group acting on the Euclidean space Rn, Gerald Schwarz proved that every smooth K-invariant function on Rn can be expressed as a smooth function of a generating set of $K$-invariant polynomials on n variables. The goal of this work is to provide an alternative and more straightforward proof of this result, based on Gelfand theory, with a particular focus on spherical functions.</description>
