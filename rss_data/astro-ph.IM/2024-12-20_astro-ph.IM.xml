      <title>Primary Beam Calibration for Commensal Telescopes Utilizing Offset Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate primary beam calibration is essential for precise brightness measurements in radio astronomy. The VLA Low-band Ionosphere and Transient Experiment (VLITE) faces challenges in calibration due to the offset Cassegrain optics used in its commensal observing system. This study aims to develop a novel calibration method to improve accuracy with no impact on the Very Large Array (VLA) primary science observations. We used the apparent brightness of standard candles identified in VLITE's commensal data to develop 1D and 2D primary beam response models. These models accounted for operational changes and asymmetries caused by the subreflector and were validated against holographic methods and compact source light curves. The models achieved calibration accuracy within 3 percent across the field of view, significantly improving the precision of brightness measurements. The results were consistent with holography-derived solutions and performed reliably under different operational conditions. This improved calibration technique expands VLITE's capabilities for studying active galactic nuclei, transients, and pulsars. It offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional holographic methods, facilitating broader use in commensal observing systems.</description>

      <title>Energy and polarization based on-line interference mitigation in radio interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency interference (RFI) is a persistent contaminant in terrestrial radio astronomy. While new radio interferometers are becoming operational, novel sources of RFI are also emerging. In order to strengthen the mitigation of RFI in modern radio interferometers, we propose an on-line RFI mitigation scheme that can be run in the correlator of such interferometers. We combine statistics based on the energy as well as the polarization alignment of the correlated signal to develop an on-line RFI mitigation scheme that can be applied to a data stream produced by the correlator in real-time, especially targeted at low duty-cycle or transient RFI detection. In order to improve the computational efficiency, we explore the use of both single precision and half precision floating point operations in implementing the RFI mitigation algorithm. This ideally suits its deployment in accelerator computing devices such as graphics processing units (GPUs) as used by the LOFAR correlator. We provide results based on real data to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Long-term stability of scientific X-ray CMOS detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) sensors have been demonstrated to have significant potential in X-ray astronomy, where long-term reliability is crucial for space X-ray telescopes. This study examines the long-term stability of a scientific CMOS sensor, focusing on its bias, dark current, readout noise, and X-ray spectral performance. The sensor was initially tested at -30 $^\circ$C for 16 months, followed by accelerated aging at 20 $^\circ$C. After a total aging period of 610 days, the bias map, dark current, readout noise, gain, and energy resolution exhibited no observable degradation. There are less than 50 pixels within the 4 k $\times$ 4 k array which show a decrease of the bias under 50 ms integration time by over 10 digital numbers (DNs). First-order kinetic fitting of the gain evolution predicts a gain degeneration of 0.73% over 3 years and 2.41% over 10 years. These results underscore the long-term reliability of CMOS sensors for application in space missions.</description>

      <title>Optimal design of interpolation methods for time-delay interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-delay interferometry (TDI) suppresses laser frequency noise by forming linear combinations of time-shifted interferometric measurements. The time-shift operation is implemented by interpolating discretely sampled data. To enable in-band laser noise reduction by eight to nine orders of magnitude, interpolation has to be performed with high accuracy. Optimizing the design of those interpolation methods is the focus of this work. Previous research that studied constant time-shifts suggested Lagrange interpolation as the interpolation method for TDI. Its transfer function performs well at low frequency but requires a high number of coefficients. Furthermore, when applied in TDI we observed prominent time-domain features when a time-varying shift scanned over a pure integer sample shift. To limit this effect we identify an additional requirement for the interpolation kernel: when considering time-varying shifts the interpolation kernel must be sufficiently smooth to avoid unwanted time-domain transitions that produce glitch-like features in power spectral density estimates. The Lagrange interpolation kernel exhibits a discontinuous first derivative by construction, which is insufficient for the application to LISA or other space-based GW observatories. As a solution we propose a novel design method for interpolation kernels that respect a predefined requirement on in-band interpolation residuals and that possess continuous derivatives up to a prescribed order. Using this method we show that an interpolation kernel with 22 coefficients is sufficient to respect LISA's picometre-requirement and to allow for a continuous first derivative which suppresses the magnitude of the time-domain transition adequately. The reduction from 42 (Lagrange interpolation) to 22 coefficients enables us to save computational cost and increases robustness against artefacts in the data.</description>

      <title>Tests for model misspecification in simulation-based inference: from local distortions to global model checks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model misspecification analysis strategies, such as anomaly detection, model validation, and model comparison are a key component of scientific model development. Over the last few years, there has been a rapid rise in the use of simulation-based inference (SBI) techniques for Bayesian parameter estimation, applied to increasingly complex forward models. To move towards fully simulation-based analysis pipelines, however, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive simulation-based framework for model misspecification analysis. In this work, we provide a solid and flexible foundation for a wide range of model discrepancy analysis tasks, using distortion-driven model misspecification tests. From a theoretical perspective, we introduce the statistical framework built around performing many hypothesis tests for distortions of the simulation model. We also make explicit analytic connections to classical techniques: anomaly detection, model validation, and goodness-of-fit residual analysis. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient self-calibrating training algorithm that is useful for practitioners. We demonstrate the performance of the framework in multiple scenarios, making the connection to classical results where they are valid. Finally, we show how to conduct such a distortion-driven model misspecification test for real gravitational wave data, specifically on the event GW150914.</description>

      <title>Pointing Accuracy Improvements for the South Pole Telescope with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present improvements to the pointing accuracy of the South Pole Telescope (SPT) using machine learning. The ability of the SPT to point accurately at the sky is limited by its structural imperfections, which are impacted by the extreme weather at the South Pole. Pointing accuracy is particularly important during SPT participation in observing campaigns with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), which requires stricter accuracy than typical observations with the SPT. We compile a training dataset of historical observations of astronomical sources made with the SPT-3G and EHT receivers on the SPT. We train two XGBoost models to learn a mapping from current weather conditions to two telescope drive control arguments -- one which corrects for errors in azimuth and the other for errors in elevation. Our trained models achieve root mean squared errors on withheld test data of $2.14''$ in cross-elevation and $3.57''$ in elevation, well below our goal of $5''$ along each axis. We deploy our models on the telescope control system and perform further in situ test observations during the EHT observing campaign in 2024 April. Our models result in significantly improved pointing accuracy: for sources within the range of input variables where the models are best trained, average combined pointing error improved 33%, from $15.9''$ to $10.6''$. These improvements, while significant, fall shy of our ultimate goal, but they serve as a proof of concept for the development of future models. Planned upgrades to the EHT receiver on the SPT will necessitate even stricter pointing accuracy which will be achievable with our methods.</description>

      <title>Testing a proposed "planarity" tool for studying satellite systems: On the alleged consistency of Milky Way satellite galaxy planes with $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of planes of satellite galaxies has been identified as a long-standing challenge to $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, due to the rarity of satellite systems in cosmological simulations that are as extremely flattened and as strongly kinematically correlated as observed structures. Here we investigate a recently proposed new metric to measure the overall degree of ''planarity'' of a satellite system, which was used to claim consistency between the Milky Way satellite plane and $\Lambda$CDM. We study the behavior of the ''planarity'' metric under several features of anisotropy present in $\Lambda$CDM satellite systems but unrelated to satellite planes. Specifically, we consider the impact of oblate or prolate distributions, the number of satellites, clustering of satellites, and radial and asymmetric distributions ('lopsidedness'). We also investigate whether the metric is independent of the orientation of the studied satellite system. We find that all of these features of anisotropy result in the metric inferring an increased degree of ''planarity'', despite none of them having any direct relation to satellite planes. The metric is also highly sensitive to the orientation of the studied system (or chosen coordinate system): there is almost no correlation between the metric's reported degrees of ''planarity'' for identical random systems rotated by 90{\deg}. Our results demonstrate that the new proposed metric is unsuitable to measure overall ''planarity'' in satellite systems. Consequently, no consistency of the observed Milky Way satellite plane with $\Lambda$CDM can be inferred using this metric.</description>

      <title>Enhanced detection and identification of satellites using an all-sky multi-frequency survey with prototype SKA-Low stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the low Earth orbit environment becoming increasingly populated with artificial satellites, rockets, and debris, it is important to understand the effects they have on radio astronomy. In this work, we undertake a multi-frequency, multi-epoch survey with two SKA-Low station prototypes located at the SKA-Low site, to identify and characterise radio frequency emission from orbiting objects and consider their impact on radio astronomy observations. We identified 152 unique satellites across multiple passes in low and medium Earth orbits from 1.6 million full-sky images across 13 selected ${\approx}1$ MHz frequency bands in the SKA-Low frequency range, acquired over almost 20 days of data collection. Our algorithms significantly reduce the rate of satellite misidentification, compared to previous work, validated through simulations to be $&lt;1\%$. Notably, multiple satellites were detected transmitting unintended electromagnetic radiation, as well as several decommissioned satellites likely transmitting when the Sun illuminates their solar panels. We test alternative methods of processing data, which will be deployed for a larger, more systematic survey at SKA-Low frequencies in the near future. The current work establishes a baseline for monitoring satellite transmissions, which will be repeated in future years to assess their evolving impact on radio astronomy observations.</description>

      <title>Lessons learned from the detection of wide companions by radial velocity and astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection and constraint of the orbits of long-period giant planets is essential for enabling their further study through direct imaging. Recently, Venner et al. (2024) highlighted discrepancies between the solutions presented by Feng et al. (2022) and those from other studies, which primarily use orvara. We address these concerns by reanalyzing the data for HD 28185, GJ 229, HD 211847, GJ 680, HD 111031, and eps Ind A, offering explanations for these discrepancies. Based on a comparison between the methods used by Feng et al. (2022) and orvara, we find the discrepancies are primarily data-related rather than methodology-related. Our re-analysis of HD 28185 highlights many of the data-related issues and particularly the importance of parallax modeling for year-long companions. The case of eps Ind A b is instructive to emphasize the value of an extended RV baseline for accurately determining orbits of long period companions. Our orbital solutions highlight other causes for discrepancies between solutions including the combination of absolute and relative astrometry, clear definitions of conventions, and efficient posterior sampling for the detection of wide-orbit giant planets.</description>

Abstract: The Tibet AS$\gamma$ experiment successfully detected sub-PeV $\gamma$-rays from the Crab nebula using a Surface Array and underground muon detector. Considering this, we are building in Bolivia a new experiment to explore the Southern Hemisphere, looking for the origins of cosmic rays in our Galaxy. The name of this project is Andes Large area PArticle detector for Cosmic ray physics and Astronomy (ALPACA). A prototype array called ALPAQUITA, with $1/4$ the total area of the full ALPACA, started observations in September $2022$. In this paper we introduce the status of ALPAQUITA and the plans to extend the array. We also report the results of the observation of the moon shadow in cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Recalibration of SDSS and DESI BAO Alleviates Hubble and Clustering Tensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional calibration of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data relies on estimation of the sound horizon at drag epoch $r_d$ from early universe observations by assuming a cosmological model. We present a recalibration of two independent BAO datasets, SDSS and DESI, by employing deep learning techniques for model-independent estimation of $r_d$, and explore the impacts on $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters. Significant reductions in both Hubble ($H_0$) and clustering ($S_8$) tensions are observed for both the recalibrated datasets. Moderate shifts in some other parameters hint towards further exploration of such data-driven approaches.</description>

      <title>Astrometry-Only Detection of Microlensing Events with Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometric microlensing events occur when a massive object passes between a distant source and the observer, causing a shift of the light centroid. The precise astrometric measurements of the Gaia mission provide an unprecedented opportunity to detect and analyze these events, revealing properties of lensing objects such as their mass and distance. We develop and test the Gaia Astrometric Microlensing Events (GAME) Filter, a software tool to identify astrometric microlensing events and derive lensing object properties. We generated mock Gaia observations for different magnitudes, number of Gaia visits, and events extending beyond Gaia's observational run. We applied GAME Filter to these datasets and validated its performance. We also assessed the rate of false positives where binary astrometric systems are misidentified as microlensing events. GAME Filter successfully recovers microlensing parameters for strong events. Parameters are more difficult to recover for short events and those extending beyond Gaia's run, where only a fraction of the events is observed. The astrometric effect breaks the degeneracy in the microlensing parallax present in photometric microlensing. For fainter sources, the observed signal weakens, reducing recovered events and increasing parameter errors. However, even for Gaia G-band magnitude 19, parameters can be recovered for Einstein radii above two mas. Observing regions with varying numbers of Gaia visits has minimal impact on filter accuracy when the number of visits exceeds 90. Additionally, even if the peak of a microlensing event lies outside Gaia's run, microlensing parameters can still be recovered. We also tested the sensitivity to contamination and found that 5 percent of binary systems were misclassified. GAME Filter characterizes lenses with astrometry-only data for lens masses from approximately 1 to 20 solar masses and distances up to 6 kpc.</description>

      <title>Applications of machine learning in gravitational wave research with current interferometric detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article provides an overview of the current state of machine learning in gravitational-wave research with interferometric detectors. Such applications are often still in their early days, but have reached sufficient popularity to warrant an assessment of their impact across various domains, including detector studies, noise and signal simulations, and the detection and interpretation of astrophysical signals.
  In detector studies, machine learning could be useful to optimize instruments like LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and future detectors. Algorithms could predict and help in mitigating environmental disturbances in real time, ensuring detectors operate at peak performance. Furthermore, machine-learning tools for characterizing and cleaning data after it is taken have already become crucial tools for achieving the best sensitivity of the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA network.
  In data analysis, machine learning has already been applied as an alternative to traditional methods for signal detection, source localization, noise reduction, and parameter estimation. For some signal types, it can already yield improved efficiency and robustness, though in many other areas traditional methods remain dominant.
  As the field evolves, the role of machine learning in advancing gravitational-wave research is expected to become increasingly prominent. This report highlights recent advancements, challenges, and perspectives for the current detector generation, with a brief outlook to the next generation of gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Status of the CORSIKA 8 particle-shower simulation code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For over two decades, CORSIKA 7 and its previous versions have been the leading Monte Carlo code for simulating extensive air showers. However, its monolithic Fortran-based software design and hand-optimized code has created challenges for maintenance, adaptation to new computing paradigms, and extensions for more complex simulations. Addressing these limitations, the CORSIKA 8 project represents a comprehensive rewrite of CORSIKA 7, seeing its core functionality re-envisioned in a modern and modular C++ framework. CORSIKA 8 has now reached a "physics-complete" state, offering a robust platform that encourages expert development for specialized applications. It supports high-energy hadronic interactions using models such as Sibyll 2.3d, QGSJet-II.04, EPOS-LHC, and Pythia 8.3, alongside the treatment of electromagnetic cascades with PROPOSAL 7.6.2. Key highlights are the support for multiple interaction media, including cross-media particle showers, and an enhanced calculation of radio emissions from particle showers. This contribution provides an overview of the current functionalities, showcases validation results of its simulations, and discusses future development plans.</description>

      <title>Phase consistency test to identify type II strongly lensed gravitational wave signals using a single event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For gravitationally lensed type II signals, the phase of the dominant (2, 2) mode and the higher order (3, 3) mode is offset by $-\pi/12$. Using this, we develop a test for type II imagery by allowing the phases of the (2,2) and (3,3) modes to vary separately and introducing a new waveform parameter to represent the phase offset between the two. We use simulated, low mass ratio, precessing signals to show that the test can reproduce the $-\pi/12$ phase offset when detected by three detectors for H-L optimal SNR $\gtrsim$ 40 and $\mathcal{M} \leq 30$. We analyze GW190412 and GW190814 using this parameterization, measuring the offset to be $0.13^{+0.22}_{-0.17}$ for GW190412 and $-0.05^{+0.20}_{-0.22}$ for GW190814. We also measure the Bayes Factor in support of no phase offset, $\log_{10} \mathcal{B}_{\Delta \varphi = 0}$, to be $-0.14$ for GW190412 and $0.21$ for GW190814.</description>

      <title>Improving Early Detection of Gravitational Waves from Binary Neutron Stars Using CNNs and FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron stars (BNSs) with possible telescope follow-ups opens a window to ground-breaking discoveries in the field of multi-messenger astronomy. With the improved sensitivity of current and future GW detectors, more BNS detections are expected in the future. Therefore, enhancing low-latency GW search algorithms to achieve rapid speed, high accuracy, and low computational cost is essential. One innovative solution to reduce latency is the use of machine learning (ML) methods embedded in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In this work, we present a novel \texttt{WaveNet}-based method, leveraging the state-of-the-art ML model, to produce early-warning alerts for BNS systems. Using simulated GW signals embedded in Gaussian noise from the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors' third observing run (O3) as a proof-of-concept dataset, we demonstrate significant performance improvements. Compared to the current leading ML-based early-warning system, our approach enhances detection accuracy from 66.81\% to 76.22\% at a 1\% false alarm probability. Furthermore, we evaluate the time, energy, and economical cost of our model across CPU, GPU, and FPGA platforms, showcasing its potential for deployment in real-time gravitational wave detection pipelines.</description>

      <title>Merging L-shaped resonator with Michelson configuration for kilohertz gravitational-wave detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection of gravitational waves in kilohertz frequency range is crucial for understanding the physical processes of binary neutron star mergers. In Ref. [Phys. Rev. X {\bf 13}, 021019 (2023)], a new interferometric configuration has been proposed, employing an L-shaped optical resonant cavity as arm cavity. This alteration enhances the detector's response to kHz signals. However, the departure from conventional Michelson configuration necessitates a redesign of its sensing and control scheme, which is currently under study. In this article, we propose replacing linear arm cavities in the conventional Michelson by the L-shaped resonator. This hybrid configuration features an enhanced response at kHz while retaining the same sensing and control scheme as the Michelson setup. At the conceptual level, it exhibits higher sensitivity in the 2-4 kHz range compared to existing configurations.</description>
