      <title>Nuclear correlation functions using first-principle calculations of lattice quantum chromodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring nuclear physics through the fundamental constituents of the strong force -- quarks and gluons -- is a formidable challenge. While numerical calculations using lattice quantum chromodynamics offer the most promising approach for this pursuit, practical implementation is arduous, especially due to the uncontrollable growth of quark-combinatorics, the so-called Wick-contraction problem of nuclei. We present here two novel methods providing a state-of-the-art solution to this problem. In the first, we exploit randomized algorithms inspired from computational number theory to detect and eliminate redundancies that arise in Wick contraction computations. Our second method explores facilities for automation of tensor computations -- in terms of efficient utilization of specialized hardware, algorithmic optimizations, as well as ease of programming and the potential for automatic code generation -- that are offered by new programming models inspired by applications in machine learning (e.g., TensorFlow). We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods by computing two-point correlation functions for Deuteron, Helium-3, Helium-4 and Lithium-7, achieving at least an order of magnitude improvement over existing algorithms with efficient implementation on GPU-accelerators. Additionally, we discover an intriguing characteristic shared by all the nuclei we study: specific spin-color combinations dominate the correlation functions, hinting at a potential connection to an as-yet-unidentified symmetry in nuclei. Moreover finding them beforehand can reduce the computing time further and substantially. Our results, with the efficiency that we achieved, suggest the possibility of extending the applicability of our methods for calculating properties of light nuclei, potentially up to A ~12 and beyond.</description>

      <title>Hadronic vacuum polarization for the muon $g-2$ from lattice QCD: Complete short and intermediate windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present complete results for the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $a_\mu$ in the short- and intermediate-distance window regions, which account for roughly 10% and 35% of the total HVP contribution to $a_\mu$, respectively. In particular, we perform lattice-QCD calculations for the isospin-symmetric connected and disconnected contributions, as well as corrections due to strong isospin-breaking. For the short-distance window observables, we investigate the so-called log-enhancement effects as well as the significant oscillations associated with staggered quarks in this region. For the dominant, isospin-symmetric light-quark connected contribution, we obtain $a^{ll,\,{\mathrm{SD}}}_{\mu}(\mathrm{conn.}) = 48.116(16)(94)[96] \times 10^{-10}$ and $a^{ll,\,{\mathrm{W}}}_{\mu}(\mathrm{conn.}) = 207.06(17)(63)[66] \times 10^{-10}$. We use Bayesian model averaging combined with a global bootstrap to fully estimate the covariance matrix between the individual contributions. Our determinations of the complete window contributions are $a^{{\mathrm{SD}}}_{\mu} = 69.01(2)(21)[21] \times 10^{-10}$ and $a^{{\mathrm{W}}}_{\mu} = 236.57(20)(94)[96] \times 10^{-10}$. This work is part of our ongoing effort to compute all contributions to HVP with an overall uncertainty at the few permille level.</description>

      <title>Magnetic dipole moments of the singly-heavy baryons with spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ and spin-$\frac{3}{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic characteristics of singly-heavy baryons at low energies are responsive to their internal composition, structural configuration, and the associated chiral dynamics of light diquarks. To gain further insight, experimentalists are attempting to measure the magnetic and electric dipole moments of charm baryons at the LHC. In view of these developments, we conducted an extensive analysis of the magnetic dipole moments of both $\rm{J^P}=\frac{1}{2}^+$ and $\rm{J^P}=\frac{3}{2}^+$ singly-heavy baryons by means of the QCD light-cone sum rules. Our findings have been compared with other phenomenological estimations that could prove a valuable supplementary resource for interpreting the singly-heavy baryon sector. To shed light on the internal structure of these baryons we study the contributions of the individual quark sectors to the magnetic dipole moments. It was observed that the magnetic dipole moments of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ sextet singly-heavy baryons are governed by the light quarks. Conversely, the role of the heavy quark is significantly enhanced for the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ anti-triplet and spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ sextet singly-heavy baryons. The contribution of light and heavy quarks is observed to have an inverse relationship. The signs of the magnetic dipole moments demonstrate the interaction of the spin degrees of freedom of the quarks. The opposing signs of the light and heavy-quark magnetic dipole moments imply that the spins of these quarks are anti-aligned with respect to each other in the baryon. As a byproduct, the electric quadrupole and magnetic octupole moments of spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ singly-heavy baryons are also calculated. We ascertained the existence of non-zero values for the electric quadrupole and magnetic octupole moments of these baryons, indicative of a non-spherical charge distribution.</description>
