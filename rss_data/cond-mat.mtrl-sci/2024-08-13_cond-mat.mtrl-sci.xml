      <title>A New Spin on Material Properties: Local Magnetic Structure in Functional and Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The past few decades have made clear that the properties and performances of emerging functional and quantum materials can depend strongly on their local atomic and/or magnetic structure, particularly when details of the local structure deviate from the long-range structure averaged over space and time. Traditional methods of structural refinement (e.g. Rietveld) are typically sensitive only to the average structure, creating a need for more advanced structural probes suitable for extracting information about structural correlations on short length- and time-scales. In this Perspective, we describe the importance of local magnetic structure in several classes of emerging materials and present the magnetic pair distribution function (mPDF) technique as a powerful tool for studying short-range magnetism from neutron total-scattering data. We then provide a selection of examples of mPDF analysis applied to magnetic materials of recent technological and fundamental interest, including the antiferromagnetic semiconductor MnTe, geometrically frustrated magnets, and iron-oxide magnetic nanoparticles. The rapid development of mPDF analysis since its formalization a decade ago puts this technique in a strong position for making continued impact in the study of local magnetism in emerging materials.</description>

      <title>Tuning the spin dynamics and magnetic phase transitions of the Cantor alloy via composition and sample processing protocols: A muon spin relaxation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CrMnFeCoNi, also called the Cantor alloy, is a well-known high-entropy alloy whose magnetic properties have recently become a focus of attention. We present a detailed muon spin relaxation study of the influence of chemical composition and sample processing protocols on the magnetic phase transitions and spin dynamics of several different Cantor alloy samples. Specific samples studied include a pristine equiatomic sample, samples with deficient and excess Mn content, and equiatomic samples magnetized in a field of 9 T or plastically deformed in pressures up to 0.5 GPa. The results confirm the sensitive dependence of the transition temperature on composition and demonstrate that post-synthesis pressure treatments cause the transition to become significantly less homogeneous throughout the sample volume. In addition, we observe critical spin dynamics in the vicinity of the transition in all samples, reminiscent of canonical spin glasses and magnetic materials with ideal continuous phase transitions. Application of an external magnetic field suppresses the critical dynamics in the Mn-deficient sample, while the equiatomic and Mn-rich samples show more robust critical dynamics. The spin-flip thermal activation energy in the paramagnetic phase increases with Mn content, ranging from $3.1(3) \times 10^{-21}$ J for 0% Mn to $1.2(2) \times 10^{-20}$ J for 30% Mn content. These results shed light on critical magnetic behavior in environments of extreme chemical disorder and demonstrate the tunability of spin dynamics in the Cantor alloy via chemical composition and sample processing.</description>

      <title>Towards Verifying Exact Conditions of Density Functional Theory Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05316v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is used extensively in the computation of electronic properties of matter, with various applications. Approximating the exchange-correlation (XC) functional is the key to the Kohn-Sham DFT approach, the basis of most DFT calculations. The choice of this density functional approximation (DFA) depends crucially on the particular system under study, which has resulted in the development of hundreds of DFAs. Though the exact density functional is not known, researchers have discovered analytical properties of this exact functional. Furthermore, these exact conditions are used when designing DFAs. We present XCVerifier, the first approach for verifying whether a DFA implementation satisfies the DFT exact conditions. XCVerifier was evaluated on five DFAs from the popular Libxc library and seven exact conditions from recent work. XCVerifier was able to verify or find violations for a majority of the DFA/condition pairs, demonstrating the feasibility of using formal methods to verify DFA implementations.</description>

      <title>Controllable Weyl Nodes and Fermi Arcs from Floquet Engineering Triple Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet engineering with periodic driving as a powerful tool for designing desirable topological states has been the subject of intense recent studies. Here, we present the application of Floquet engineering to investigate evolution of topological triple fermions under irradiation of circularly polarized light (CPL), a phenomenon that currently remains a mystery. By using first-principles calculations and Floquet theorem, we demonstrate that WC-type TiO and its analogues are promising candidates for Floquet engineering of triple fermions. The symmetry analysis reveals that the electric field of CPL can break the specific symmetries, such as the time-reversal symmetry and its combination of spatial symmetries, inducing a transition to a flexibly controllable Weyl semimetallic phase. The survived spatial symmetry, controlled by light, guarantees that the Weyl nodes are located along the high-symmetry line or in high-symmetry planes in momentum space. Our findings focusing on Floquet engineering in realistic materials featured by triple fermions would facilitate both theoretical and experimental interest.</description>

      <title>On how to determine surface roughness power spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytical contact mechanics theories depend on surface roughness through the surface roughness power spectrum. In the present study, we evaluated the usability of various experimental methods for studying surface roughness. Our findings indicated that height data obtained from optical methods often lack accuracy and should not be utilized for calculating surface roughness power spectra. Conversely, engineering stylus instruments and atomic force microscopy (AFM) typically yield reliable results that are consistent across the overlapping roughness length scale region. For surfaces with isotropic roughness, the two-dimensional (2D) power spectrum can be derived from the one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum using several approaches, which we explored in this paper.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of de-icing by surface Rayleigh and plate Lamb acoustic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic waves (AW) have recently emerged as an energy-efficient ice removal procedure compatible with functional and industrial-relevant substrates. However, critical aspects at fundamental and experimental levels have yet to be disclosed to optimize their operational conditions. Identifying the processes and mechanisms by which different types of AWs induce de-icing are some of these issues. Herein, using model LiNbO3 systems and two types of interdigitated transducers, we analyze the de-icing and anti-icing efficiencies and mechanisms driven by Rayleigh surface acoustic waves (R-SAW) and Lamb waves with 120 and 510 um wavelengths, respectively. Through the experimental analysis of de-icing and active anti-icing processes and the finite element simulation of the AW generation, propagation, and interaction with small ice aggregates, we disclose that Lamb waves are more favorable than R-SAWs to induce de-icing and/or prevent the freezing of droplets. Prospects for applications of this study are supported by proof of concept experiments, including de-icing in an ice wind tunnel, demonstrating that Lamb waves can efficiently remove ice layers covering large LN substrates. Results indicate that the de-icing mechanism may differ for Lamb waves or R-SAWs and that the wavelength must be considered as an important parameter for controlling the efficiency.</description>

      <title>Efficient generation of out-of-plane polarized spin current in polycrystalline heavy metal devices with broken electric symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin currents of perpendicularly polarized spins (z spins) by an in-plane charge current have received blooming interest for the potential in energy-efficient spin-orbit torque switching of perpendicular magnetization in the absence of a magnetic field. However, generation of z spins is limited mainly to magnetically or crystallographically low-symmetry single crystals (such as non-colinear antiferromagnets) that are hardly compatible with the integration to semiconductor circuits. Here, we report efficient generation of z spins in sputter-deposited polycrystalline heavy metal devices via a new mechanism of broken electric symmetries in both the transverse and perpendicular directions. Both the dampinglike and fieldlike spin-orbit torques of z spins can be tuned significantly by varying the degree of the electric asymmetries via the length, width, and thickness of devices as well as by varying the type of the heavy metals. We also show that the presence of z spins enables deterministic, nearly-full, external-magnetic-field-free switching of a uniform perpendicularly magnetized FeCoB layer, the core structure of magnetic tunnel junctions, with high coercivity at a low current density. These results establish the first universal, energy-efficient, integration-friendly approach to generate z-spin current by electric asymmetry design for dense and low-power spin-torque memory and computing technologies and will stimulate investigation of z-spin currents in various polycrystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of relativistic field-derivative torque in nonlinear THz response of magnetization dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the complete light-spin interactions in magnetic systems is the key to manipulating the magnetization using optical means at ultrafast timescales. The selective addressing of spins by terahertz (THz) electromagnetic fields via Zeeman torque is, by far, one of the most successful ultrafast means of controlling magnetic excitations. Here we show that this traditional Zeeman torque on the spins is not sufficient, rather an additional relativistic field-derivative torque is essential to realize the observed magnetization dynamics. We accomplish this by exploring the ultrafast nonlinear magnetization dynamics of rare-earth, Bi-doped iron garnet when excited by two co-propagating THz pulses. By non-thermal optical pump-probe technique, we, first, find the collective exchange resonance mode between rare-earth and transition metal sublattices at 0.48 THz. We further explore the magnetization dynamics via a rather direct and efficient THz time-domain spectroscopic means. We find that the observed nonlinear trace of the magnetic response cannot be mapped to the magnetization precession induced by the Zeeman torque, while the Zeeman torque supplemented by an additional field-derivative torque follows the experimental evidences. This breakthrough not only enhances our comprehension of ultra-relativistic effects but also paves the way for the development of novel technologies harnessing light-induced control over magnetic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate perovskite oxides from different aspects, namely their pseudoharmonic dynamical properties, their dynamical properties when strong anharmonicity exists and the intriguing functionalities arising from domain walls. Taking these viewpoints together yields a rather complex picture of this material class which was not anticipated in previous approaches. It opens pathways to novel applications and reveals the rich ground states beyond the fictitious belief in simplicity of perovskites and such structures.</description>

      <title>Development and Characterization of a Novel BaTiO3-Based Material for Medium Temperature Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positive temperature coefficient (PTC) materials are extensively utilized in self-regulating temperature applications. Nonetheless, their applicability is typically constrained to low-temperature ranges, rendering them ineffective in medium temperature environments. This study presents a methodology for the fabrication of an innovative PTC material operational at approximately 353~{\deg}C, with a thorough investigation of its Curie temperature and resistivity properties. The material formulation incorporates 4~wt\% carbon black (CB), 0.5~wt\% NBT, and 5~wt\% DOP into a BaTiO$_3$-based matrix. The empirical findings reveal that this material exhibits a notably high PTC strength of 5.8 and a comparatively low resistivity of 590~$\Omega\cdot$cm at room temperature. Furthermore, the material demonstrated excellent repeatability in PTC strength after thirty cycles of heating and cooling near the Curie temperature. Consequently, this PTC material is deemed highly effective for applications in cold environments, notably for the preheating and initiation of aircraft engines and auxiliary power units (APUs).</description>

      <title>Emission Spectrum of Doped Graphene Quantum Dots: A high-throughput TDDFT Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations of fluorescence emission energies for 284 distinct graphene quantum dots (GQDs) of varying shapes (square, hexagonal, and amorphous) and sizes ($\sim$1-2 nm). These GQDs are doped with one or two elements from B, N, O, S, and P at dopant percentages of 1.5%, 3%, 5%, and 7%. Our study systematically investigates the trends and patterns in emission energies as a function of shape, size, dopant type and dopant percentage. Twelve structures are identified to have emission wavelengths in the visible spectrum. The emission energies derived from our calculations can guide the formulation of specific GQD mixtures to achieve desired emission spectra within and beyond the visible range for industrial applications. Furthermore, the extensive dataset, including emission energies along with molecular structures generated in this work, creates a DFT dateset for further machine learning studies.</description>

      <title>AC thermal conductivity as a tool for solution mapping from diffusive to ballistic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) has been exploited to investigate non-diffusive phonon transport for decades, due to the challenges of solving this integro-differential equation, most standard techniques for thermal measurements still rely on solutions to the diffusion equation, causing inconsistency between measured non-diffusive effects and the diffusion equation based techniques. With the AC thermal conductivity, an analogous concept of the AC electrical conductivity in solid state physics, we transform BTE under the relaxation time approximation into the form of the diffusion equation. This transformation maps any analytical solution of the diffusion equation under periodic heating to that of the BTE, with the nonlocal effect captured by the jump boundary condition. After investigating the validity of this framework, we apply it to generalize the 3{\omega} method from diffusive to quasi-ballistic, and propose an experimental scheme to address the inconsistency problem above.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the nucleation of quasicrystals from liquid or periodic crystals by developing an efficient order-order phase transition algorithm, namely the nullspace-preserving saddle search method. Specifically, we focus on nucleation and phase transitions of the decagonal quasicrystal (DQC) based on the Lifshitz-Petrich model. We present the nucleation path of DQC from the liquid and demonstrate one- and two-stage transition paths between DQC and periodic crystals. We provide a perspective of the group-subgroup phase transition and nucleation rates to understand the nucleation and phase transition mechanisms involving DQC. These results reveal the one-step and stepwise modes of symmetry breaking or recovery in the phase transition from DQC, where the stepwise modes are more probable.</description>

      <title>Anaysis of the validity of P2D models for solid-state batteries in a large parameter range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation models are nowadays indispensable to efficiently assess or optimize novel battery cell concepts during the development process. Electro-chemo-mechano models are widely used to investigate solid-state batteries during cycling and allow the prediction of the dependence of design parameters like material properties, geometric properties, or operating conditions on output quantities like the state of charge. One possibility of classification of these physics-based models is their level of geometric resolution, including three-dimensionally resolved models and geometrically homogenized models, known as Doyle-Fuller-Newman or pseudo two-dimensional models. Within this study, the advantages and drawbacks of these two types of models are identified within a wide range of the design parameter values. Therefore, the sensitivity of an output quantity of the models on one or a combination of parameters is compared. In particular, the global sensitivity, i.e., the sensitivity in a wide range of parameter values, is computed by using the Sobol indices as a measure. Furthermore, the local sensitivity of the difference in the output quantities of both models is evaluated to identify regions of parameter values in which they contain significant deviations. Finally, remarks on the potential interplay between both models to obtain fast and reliable results are given.</description>

      <title>Accurate prediction of structural and mechanical properties on amorphous materials enabled through machine-learning potentials: a case study of silicon nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous silicon nitride (a-SiN) is a material which has found wide application due to its excellent mechanical and electrical properties. Despite the significant effort devoted in understanding how the microscopic structure influences the material performance, many aspects still remain elusive. If on the one hand \textit{ab initio} calculations respresent the technique of election to study such a system, they present severe limitations in terms of the size of the system that can be simulated. Such an aspect plays a determinant role, particularly when amorphous structure are to be investigated, as often results depend dramatically on the size of the system. Here, we overcome this limitation by training a machine-learning (ML) interatomic model to \textit{ab initio} data. We show that molecular dynamics simulations using the ML model on much larger systems can reproduce experimental measurements of elastic properties, including elastic isotropy. Our study demonstrates the broader impact of machine-learning potentials for predicting structural and mechanical properties, even for complex amorphous structures.</description>

      <title>Boosting the quality factor of Tamm structures to millions by quantum inspired classical annealer with factorization machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tamm structures show high quality (Q) factor property with simple photonic Bragg reflectors composed of alternative high/low refractive index layers and metal reflectors. However, the Q-factor of Tamm structures is inherently limited by the periodic constraints and fixed thicknesses of the Bragg reflector pairs. Removing periodic constraints and adopting aperiodic designs can lead to significantly higher Q-factors. Nevertheless, to fully exploit the potential of Tamm structures, it is essential to thoroughly explore the extensive search space introduced by these aperiodic designs. Herein, we introduce a novel approach that utilizes the quantum-inspired classical annealer combined with a factorization machine to facilitate the design of photonic Bragg reflectors with the aim of achieving ultrahigh Q-factor properties. Our investigation begins by establishing the effectiveness of global optimization in a 15-bit problem setting, showcasing a remarkable efficiency improvement of nearly one order of magnitude compared to random search strategies. Subsequently, we expand our analysis to a 20-bit problem, demonstrating comparable efficiency to state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization methods. Moreover, the proposed method proves its capability in handling extremely large search spaces, exemplified by a 40-bit problem, where we successfully uncover a Tamm structure design exhibiting an extraordinary ultrahigh Q-factor surpassing millions. The designed aperiodic Tamm structure exhibits exceptional high localization and enhancement of electric field, and the power loss is concentrated in the low loss dielectric layer. Hence, the decay rate of power dissipation significantly decreases and light-matter interaction time increases, resulting in ultrahigh Q-factor.</description>

      <title>In-situ Patterned Damage-Free Etching of 3-Dimensional Structures in \b{eta}-Ga2O3 using Triethylgallium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we report on the anisotropic etching characteristics of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 using triethylgallium (TEGa) performed in-situ within an MOCVD chamber. At sufficiently high substrate temperature, TEGa can act as a strong etchant for \b{eta}-Ga2O3 utilizing the suboxide reaction between Ga and Ga2O3. We observe that due to monoclinic crystal structure of \b{eta}-Ga2O3, TEGa etching on both (010) and (001) substrates is highly anisotropic in nature, both in terms of sidewall roughness and lateral etch rate. Smooth sidewalls are only obtained along crystal orientations that minimize sidewall surface energy. Utilizing this technique we also demonstrate deep sub-micron fins with smooth sidewalls and high aspect ratios. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the damage free nature of TEGa etching by fabricating Schottky diodes on the etched surface which display no change in net donor concentration.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for characterizing uncertain elastic properties of fused filament fabricated materials for topology optimization applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layering approach used in fused filament fabrication (FFF) enables creation of complex designs generated by topology optimization. Defects associated with the layer-by-layer process, introduce considerable random variability to the local elastic modulus of the print. The elastic modulus along the fusion layers connecting bulk materials differs from that of the bulk areas. Accurate quantitative measurements of variations in both areas are essential to achieve robust optimized designs. This study aims to quantify the parameters of the random distributions given the surface strain field of the print measured by digital image correlation (DIC). Two statistical properties, mean and standard deviation, are sufficient to characterize the stochastic elastic modulus fields in each region. An efficient neural network model is developed to estimate spatial variations in the local elastic modulus within both bulk and fusion layers. This model is trained on a dataset of synthetic strain fields with known distributions in the elastic modulus fields. It performs well in correlating the elastic modulus with the input strain, as long as the standard deviation is below 60% of the mean of the random field. The predictive accuracy of the model on testing data, measured by the R2 score, is 0.99 and 0.95 for mean and standard deviation in the fusion material. The scores for the bulk material are 0.97 each. The trained model is implemented to predict the elastic modulus distribution of an FFF-printed material at a print speed of 30 mm/s and an extrusion temperature of 493.15 K, based on its DIC-measured surface strain data. The model predicts a mean and standard deviation of 1.2 GPa and 1 GPa for the bulk material and 400 MPa and 430 MPa for the fusion region. Validation of predictions confirms the reliability of this approach in measuring uncertainty in the local properties of the prints.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the Fermi surface of 1T-VSe$_2$ across a structural phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic origin of the structural transition in 1T-VSe$_2$ is re-evaluated through an extensive angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiment. The components of the band structure, missing in previous reports, are revealed. Earlier observations, shown to be temperature independent and therefore not correlated with the phase transition, are explained in terms of the increased complexity of the band structure close to the Fermi level. Only the overall size of the Fermi surface is found to be positively correlated with the phase transition at 110 K. These observations, quite distant from the charge density wave scenario commonly considered for 1T-VSe$_2$, bring fresh perspectives toward the correct description of structural transitions in dichalcogenides materials.</description>

      <title>Exciton diffusion in two-dimensional chiral perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05946v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites emerged as a versatile platform for light-emitting and photovol-taic applications due to their unique structural design and chemical flexibility. Their properties depend heavily on both the choice of the inorganic lead halide framework and the surrounding organic layers. Recently, the introduction of chiral cations into 2D perovskites has attracted major interest due to their potential for introducing chirality and tuning the chiro-optical response. Importantly, the optical properties in these materials are dominated by tightly bound excitons that also serve as primary carriers for the energy transport. The mobility of photoinjected excitons is thus important from the perspectives of fundamental material properties and optoelectronic applications, yet remains an open question. Here, we demonstrate exciton propagation in a 2D chiral perovskite methylbenzylammonium lead iodide (MBA2PbI4) using transient photoluminescence microscopy and reveal density-dependent transport over more than 100 nanometers at room temperature with diffusion coeffi-cients as high as 2 cm2/s. We observe two distinct regimes of initially rapid diffusive propagation and subsequent localiza-tion. Moreover, perovskites with enantiomer pure cations are found to exhibit faster exciton diffusion compared to the race-mic mixture, correlated with the impact of the material composition on disorder. Altogether, the observations of efficient exciton diffusion at room temperature highlight the potential of 2D chiral perovskites to merge chiro-optical properties with strong light-matter interaction and efficient energy transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tunability of the mechanical properties of refractory multi-principal-element alloys (RMPEAs) make them attractive for numerous high-temperature applications. It is well-established that the phase stability of RMPEAs control their mechanical properties. In this study, we develop a deep learning framework that is trained on a CALPHAD-derived database that is predictive of RMPEAs phases with high accuracy up to eight phases within the elemental space of Ti, Fe, Al, V, Ni, Nb, and Zr with an accuracy of approximately 90%. We further investigate the causes for the low out of domain performance of the deep learning models in predicting phases of RMPEA with new elemental sets and propose a strategy to mitigate this performance shortfall.</description>

      <title>Efficient Soft-Chemical Synthesis of Large van-der-Waals Crystals of the Room-Temperature Ferromagnet 1T-CrTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We herein report on a fast and convenient soft-chemical synthesis approach towards large 1T-CrTe2 van-der-Waals crystals. This compound is formed X-ray diffraction pure, with a complete conversion within just over 2 h from flux-grown LiCrTe2 crystals using diluted acids. Due to the availability of high-quality single crystals, we have confirmed the crystal structure for the first time by single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments. For the acid deintercalated 1T-CrTe2 crystals, we find long-range ferromagnetic order with a Curie temperature of $T_{\rm C}$ = 318 K. We further revealed the magnetic structure of 1T-CrTe2 using low-temperature neutron powder diffraction experiments and determine the magnetic Hamiltonian using density functional theory. X-ray diffraction experiments of post-annealed crystals suggest a thermal stability of 1T-CrTe2 up to at least 100 {\deg}C. Our findings expand the synthesis methods for 1T-CrTe2 crystals, which hold promise for integrated room-temperature spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Inverse designing metamaterials with programmable nonlinear functional responses in graph space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Material responses to static and dynamic stimuli, represented as nonlinear curves, are design targets for engineering functionalities like structural support, impact protection, and acoustic and photonic bandgaps. Three-dimensional metamaterials offer significant tunability due to their internal structure, yet existing methods struggle to capture their complex behavior-to-structure relationships. We present GraphMetaMat, a graph-based framework capable of designing three-dimensional metamaterials with programmable responses and arbitrary manufacturing constraints. Integrating graph networks, physics biases, reinforcement learning, and tree search, GraphMetaMat can target stress-strain curves spanning four orders of magnitude and complex behaviors, as well as viscoelastic transmission responses with varying attenuation gaps. GraphMetaMat can create cushioning materials for protective equipment and vibration-damping panels for electric vehicles, outperforming commercial materials, and enabling the automatic design of materials with on-demand functionalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy materials shift the traditional materials discovery paradigm to one that leverages disorder, enabling access to unique chemistries unreachable through enthalpy alone. We present a self-consistent approach integrating computation and experiment to understand and explore single-phase rock salt high-entropy oxides. By leveraging a machine-learning interatomic potential, we rapidly and accurately map high-entropy composition space using our two descriptors: bond length distribution and mixing enthalpy. The single-phase stabilities for all experimentally stabilized rock salt compositions are correctly resolved, with dozens more compositions awaiting discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orbital Hall effect (OHE) typically is evaluated using an intuitive approach based on semiclassical considerations. Here we provide a full quantum mechanical evaluation of the orbital current, including all matrix elements of the position operator. We recover previous results and find an additional quantum correction due to the non-commutativity of the position and velocity operators. We evaluate the full OHE for the topological antiferromagnet CuMnAs showing that the quantum correction dominates the response and changes its sign. We discuss implications for experiment.</description>

Abstract: This study proposes a simple and novel class of stretch-limiting constitutive relations for perfectly flexible elastic strings drawing from modern advances in constitutive theory for elastic bodies. We investigate strings governed by constitutive relations where stretch is a bounded, piecewise linear function of tension, extending beyond the traditional Cauchy elasticity framework. Our analysis includes explicit solutions for both catenaries and longitudinal, piecewise constant stretched motions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experiments on van der Waals heterostructures involving metallic and Mott insulating layers, we construct a moir\'e extension of the Kondo-Heisenberg model and study its phase diagram via Abrikosov fermion mean field theory in one and two dimensions. Our analysis indicates that the stacking dependent Kondo interaction can lead to a variety of new phases. In particular, we show that magnetic order and heavy quasiparticles can nucleate at different regions in the moir\'e unit cell leading to a macroscopic real space phase separation. We observe that these factors can lead to a metal to Kondo insulator percolation transition in two dimensions. Our results highlight the rich physics that can arise in moir\'e superlattices that are composed of inherently strongly correlated layers.</description>

      <title>Spin dynamics in itinerant antiferromagnet ${\rm\bf SrCr_2As_2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SrCr$_2$As$_2$ is an itinerant antiferromagnet in the same structural family as the SrFe2As2 high-temperature superconductors. We report our calculations of exchange coupling parameters $J_{ij}$ for SrCr$_2$As$_2$ using a static linear-response method based on first-principles electronic structure calculations. We find that the dominant nearest neighbor exchange coupling $J_{\rm{1}} &gt; 0$ is antiferromagnetic whereas the next-nearest neighbor interaction $J_{\rm{2}} &lt; 0$ is ferromagnetic with $J_{\rm{2}}$/$J_{\rm{1}}$~=~$-0.68$, reinforcing the checkerboard in-plane structure. Thus, unlike other transition-metal arsenides based on Mn, Fe, or Co, we find no competing magnetic interactions in SrCr$_2$As$_2$, which aligns with experimental findings. Moreover, the orbital resolution of exchange interactions shows that $J_1$ and $J_2$ are dominated by direct exchange mediated by the Cr $d$ orbitals. To validate the calculations we conduct inelastic neutron-scattering measurements on powder samples that show steeply dispersive magnetic excitations arising from the magnetic $\Gamma$ points and persisting up to energies of at least 175 meV. The spin-wave spectra are then modeled using the Heisenberg Hamiltonian with the theoretically calculated exchange couplings. The calculated neutron scattering spectra are in good agreement with the experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a milestone in achieving large-scale, ultrathin (~5 nm) superconducting NbN thin films on 300 mm Si wafers using a high-volume manufacturing (HVM) industrial physical vapor deposition (PVD) system. The NbN thin films possess remarkable structural uniformity and consistently high superconducting quality across the entire 300 mm Si wafer, by incorporating an AlN buffer layer. High-resolution X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy analyses unveiled enhanced crystallinity of (111)-oriented {\delta}-phase NbN with the AlN buffer layer. Notably, NbN films deposited on AlN-buffered Si substrates exhibited a significantly elevated superconducting critical temperature (~2 K higher for the 10 nm NbN) and a higher upper critical magnetic field or Hc2 (34.06 T boost in Hc2 for the 50 nm NbN) in comparison with those without AlN. These findings present a promising pathway for the integration of quantum-grade superconducting NbN films with the existing 300 mm CMOS Si platform for quantum information applications.</description>

      <title>Tunable atomically enhanced moir\'e Berry curvatures in twisted triple bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a twisted triple bilayer graphene platform consisting of three units of Bernal bilayer graphene (BLG) consecutively twisted at 1.49{\deg} and 1.68{\deg}. We observe inter-moir\'e Hofstadter butterflies from two co-existing moir\'e superlattices and a Hofstadter butterfly from reconstructed moir\'e-of-moir\'e lattice, and show that their Brown-Zak (BZ) oscillations quantitatively agree with each other, both evidencing strong atomic reconstruction with a lattice constant of 18.1 nm. We further demonstrate such atomic reconstruction strongly enhances the Berry curvature of each moir\'e and moir\'e-of-moir\'e band-insulator state, characterized by measured strong non-local valley Hall effect (VHE) that sensitively depends on the inter-moir\'e competition strength, tunable by manipulating the out-of-the-plane carrier distribution which controls the magnitude of the valley currents. Our study sheds new light on the microscopic mechanism of atomic and electronic reconstruction in twisted-multilayer systems, by investigating novel emergent quantum phenomena of reconstructed quasi-crystalline moir\'e-of-moir\'e superlattice, including a new type of moir\'e-of-moir\'e band-insulator states and atomically enhanced moir\'e Berry curvature. We show that the reconstructed electronic band can be versatilely tuned by electrostatics, providing an approach towards engineering the band structure and its topology for a novel quantum material platform with designer electrical and optical properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Niobium polyhydride was synthesized at high pressure and high temperature conditions by using diamond anvil cell combined with in situ high pressure laser heating techniques. High pressure electric transport experiments demonstrate that superconducting transition occurs with critical temperature(Tc) 42 K at 187 GPa. The shift of Tc as function of external applied magnetic field is in consistent to the nature of superconductivity while the upper critical field at zero temperature Hc2(0) is estimated to~16.8 Tesla while the GL coherent length ~57 angstrom is estimated. The structure investigation using synchrotron radiation implies that the observed superconductivity may come from Fm-3m phase of NbH3.</description>

      <title>Terahertz-induced tunnel ionization drives coherent Raman-active phonon in Bismuth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driving coherent lattice motion with THz pulses has emerged as a novel pathway for achieving dynamic stabilization of exotic phases that are inaccessible in equilibrium quantum materials. In this work, we present a previously unexplored mechanism for THz excitation of Raman-active phonons in semimetals. We show that intense THz pulses centered at 1 THz can excite the Raman-active $A_{1g}$ phonon mode at 2.9 THz in a bismuth film. We rule out the possibilities of the phonon being excited through conventional anharmonic coupling to other modes or via a THz sum frequency process. Instead, we demonstrate that the THz-driven tunnel ionization provides a plausible means of creating a displacive driving force to initiate the phonon oscillations. Our work highlights a new mechanism for exciting coherent phonons, offering potential for dynamic control over the electronic and structural properties of semimetals and narrow-band semiconductors on ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As humankind prepares to establish outposts and infrastructure on the Moon, the ability to manufacture parts and buildings on-site is crucial. While transporting raw materials from Earth can be costly and time-consuming, in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) presents an attractive alternative. This review paper aims to provide a thorough examination of the current state and future potential of Lunar-based manufacturing and construction (LBMC), with a particular focus on the prospect of utilizing in-situ resources and additive manufacturing. The paper analyzes existing research on LBMC from various perspectives, including different manufacturing techniques and compositions, the potential of ISRU for LBMC, characterization of built parts and structures, the role of energy sources and efficiency, the impact of low-gravity and vacuum conditions, and the feasibility of using artificial intelligence, automation, and robotics. By synthesizing these findings, this review offers valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for LBMC.</description>

      <title>Surface Termination and Band Alignment in 2D Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterostructures are ubiquitous in many optoelectronic devices and as photocatalysts. One of the key features of a heterojunction is the proper band alignment between the two materials. Estimation of the correct relative band positions with density functional theory (DFT) based electronic structure calculations is often constrained by the accuracy and cost associated with the various DFT functionals. In this study, we introduce a novel computational approach that achieves band alignments closely matching experimental results with the widely used PBE functional. We specifically examine the well-documented MoO3/MoS2 system, a type-II heterojunction. In our setup, the MoS2 layers are kept as it is but for MoO3 the individual layers are chosen differently. These alternative layers have higher surface energy, and hence, the band edges are higher than the conventional layers. This shift in band edges of the alternative MoO3 layers changes the band alignment in MoO3/MoS2 heterojunction from type-III to the experimentally observed type-II character. We also extend this computational strategy to additional systems, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Inconsistencies between experimental and theoretical band structure of TiSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renew interest in the charge density wave phase of TiSe$_2$ stems from the realization of its unique driving mechanism, the so called excitonic insulator phase. Existing claims are motivated by model calculations of the band structure. In this study, angle resolved photoemsision spectroscopy and density functional theory for TiSe$_2$ are directly compared. The substantial discrepancies found between the two descriptions cast serious doubts on the exitonic insulator scenario as the correct physical mechanism underlying the periodic lattice distortion at low temperature. In particular, the formation of a valence-conduction hybridization gap in the bulk band structure is not present in the experimental data. Therefore, the origin of the structural transition in TiSe$_2$ cannot be fully explained within the existing theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Effect of low-temperature compression on superconductivity and crystal structure in strontium metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconducting and structural properties of elemental strontium metal were investigated under pressures up to 60 GPa while maintaining cryogenic conditions during pressure application. Applying pressure at low temperatures reveals differences in superconducting and structural phases compared to previous reports obtained at room temperatures. Notably, the superconducting critical temperature exhibits a twofold increase under compression after cryogenic cooling within the pressure range of 35-42 GPa, compared to cryogenic cooling after room-temperature compression. Subsequently, the transition width becomes significantly sharper above 42 GPa. Low-temperature X-ray diffraction measurements under pressure reveal that this change corresponds to the Sr-III to Sr-IV transition, with no evidence of any metastable structure. Furthermore, the monoclinic Sr-IV structure was observed to remain stable to much higher pressures - at least up to 60 GPa, without the appearance of the incommensurate Sr-V phase present at room temperature. This implies that thermal activation energy plays an important role in overcoming the presence of a kinetic barrier to the Sr-V phase at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Enhancement in neuromorphic NbO2 memristive device switching at cryogenic temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electrical properties and performance characteristics of niobium dioxide (NbO$_\mathrm{2}$)-based memristive devices are examined at cryogenic temperatures. Sub-stoichiometric Nb$_\mathrm{2}$O$_\mathrm{5}$ was deposited via magnetron sputtering and patterned in microscale (2$\times$2 - 15$\times$15 $\mu$m$^2$) cross-bar Au/Ru/NbO$_\mathrm{x}$/Pt devices and electroformed at 3-5 V to make NbO$_\mathrm{2}$ filaments. At cryogenic temperatures, the threshold voltage ($V_\mathrm{th}$) increased by more than a factor of 3. The hold voltage ($V_\mathrm{h}$) was significantly lower than the threshold voltage for fast voltage sweeps (200 ms per measurement). If the sample is allowed to cool between voltage measurements, the hold voltage increases, but never reaches the threshold voltage, indicating the presence of non-volatile Nb$_\mathrm{2}$O$_\mathrm{5}$ in the filament. The devices have an activation energy of $E_a \approx 1.4$ eV, lower than other NbO$_\mathrm{2}$ devices reported. Our works shows that even nominally ``bad" memristive devices can be improved by reducing the leakage current and increases the sample resistance at cryogenic temperatures.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the geometric formulation of continuum defects consisting of dislocations and disclinations. After reviewing the metric affine geometry and the present geometric formulation of dislocation and disclination written in terms of torsion and full curvature (together with vanishing non-metricity), we give a new theory of them in a novel way in terms of torsion and non-metricity (together with vanishing full curvature), the so-called general teleparallel geometry. All calculations are performed by using the exterior algebra. We obtain continuity equations explicitly for dislocation density and disclination density.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit coupling effects in single-layer phosphorene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic band structure of monolayer phosphorene is thoroughly studied by considering the presence of spin-orbit interaction. We employ a multiorbital Slater-Koster tight-binding approach to derive effective k.p-type Hamiltonians that describes the dominant spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects of the Rashba and intrinsic origin at the high {\Gamma} and S high symmetry points in phosphorene. In the absence of SOC effects a minimal admixture of pz and py atomic orbitals suffices to reproduce the well known anisotropy of highest valence and the lowest conduction bands at the {\Gamma}-point, consistent with density functional theory (DFT) and k.p methods. In contrast, the inclusion of the px and s atomic orbitals are rather crucial for an adequate description of the SOC effects in phosphorene at low energies, particularly at the S-point. We introduce useful analytical expressions for the Rashba and intrinsic SOC parameters in terms of the relevant Slater-Koster integrals. In addition, we report simple formulas for the interband dipole-strenghts, revealing the nature of the strong anisotropic behavior of its lower bands. Our findings can be useful for further studies of electronic and spin transport properties in monolayer phosphorene and its nanoribbons.</description>

      <title>$^{19}$F NMR and defect spins in vacuum-annealed LaO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report results of magnetization and $^{19}$F NMR measurements in the normal state of as-grown LaO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_2$. The magnetization is dominated by a temperature-independent diamagnetic component and a field- and temperature-dependent paramagnetic contribution $M_\mu(H,T)$ from a $\sim$1000~ppm concentration of local moments, an order of magnitude higher than can be accounted for by measured rare-earth impurity concentrations. $M_\mu(H,T)$ can be fit by the Brillouin function $B_J(x)$ or, perhaps more realistically, a two-level $\tanh(x)$ model for magnetic Bi $6p$ ions in defect crystal fields. Both fits require a phenomenological Curie-Weiss argument $x = \mu_\mathrm{eff}H/(T + T_W)$, $T_W \approx 1.7$ K. There is no evidence for magnetic order down to 2 K, and the origin of $T_W$ is not clear. $^{19}$F frequency shifts, linewidths, and spin-lattice relaxation rates are consistent with purely dipolar $^{19}$F/defect-spin interactions. The defect-spin correlation time $\tau_c(T)$ obtained from $^{19}$F spin-lattice relaxation rates obeys the Korringa relation $\tau_cT = \text{const.}$, indicating the relaxation is dominated by conduction-band fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) have attracted a lot of attention because they can host a number of novel phases, including charge density wave and topological superconductivity. This class of compounds is significant from application and fundamental standpoints. Here we report on the synthesis and characterization of Janus TMD compound TiSeS, which is a subclass of TMDs. We observe characters of filamentary superconductivity in TiSeS, which was not reported in earlier studies. Magnetization measurements (ZFCW&amp; FCW) as well as isothermal magnetization indicates towards type-II superconductivity whereas transport measurements lacks of zero resistivity due to possible weak inter-grain connectivity. The observed behavior can be safely attributed to filamentary superconductivity in TiSeS. Further studies need to be carried out to determine the origin of this superconducting phase.</description>

Abstract: First principles real-time time dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) calculations reveal the existence of ballistic photocurrents generated by Coulomb scattering, a form of photocurrent that has not previously been considered as a mechanism for the bulk photovoltaic effect. With monolayer GeS as an example, it is predicted that ballistic currents can exceed shift currents under experimentally accessible conditions. Moreover, these simulations reveal recombination pathways that work to modify shift current magnitudes beyond perturbation theory predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the shrinking of dimensionality, Coulomb interactions play a distinct role in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors owing to the reduced dielectric screening in the out-of-plane direction. Apart from dielectric screening, free charge carriers and/or dipoles can also make a non-negligible contribution to Coulomb interaction. While the Thomas-Fermi model is effective in describing charge carrier screening in three dimensions, the extent of screening to two dimensions resulting from charge carriers and charge-neutral dipoles remains quantitatively unclear. Herein, we present an analytical solution based on linear response theory, offering a comprehensive depiction of the Coulomb screened potential in both 2D and 3D systems, where screening effects from both charge carriers and charge-neutral dipoles are addressed. Our work provides a useful and handy tool for directly analysing and evaluating Coulomb interaction strength in atomically thin materials, particularly in the context of electronic and optoelectronic engineering. As a demonstration, we utilized the derived modified Coulomb potential for the exciton system in 2D semiconductors to estimate the exciton binding energy variation arising from the exciton density fluctuation and temperature-dependent exciton polarizability, yielding excellent agreement with the computational and experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya inducing weak ferromagnetism in centrosymmetric altermagnets and weak ferrimagnetism in noncentrosymmetric altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) has explained successfully the weak ferromagnetism in {\it some} centrosymmetric antiferromagnets. However, in the last years, it was generally claimed that the DMI is not effective in such systems. We reconciled these views by separating the conventional antiferromagnets from altermagnets. Altermagnets are collinear magnets having zero magnetization preserved by crystal symmetries in the non-relativistic limit. The spin-up and spin-down sublattices can be connected either by a proper rotation or by a combination of a rotation and a mirror or an inversion symmetry. Consequently, the system shows even-parity wave spin order in the k-space lifting the Kramer's degeneracy in the non-relativistic band structure leading to unconventional magnetism. The DMI can create weak ferromagnetism or weak ferrimagnetism in centrosymmetric and in noncentrosymmetric altermagnets while it is not effective in conventional antiferromagnets. Once the spin-orbit coupling is included in an altermagnetic system (where the time-reversal symmetry is broken), the components of spin moments of the two sublattices along the N\'eel vector are antiparallel but the other two spin components orthogonal to the N\'eel vector can be null, parallel or antiparallel. In cases where we have different bands showing parallel and antiparallel spin components at the same time, the magnetic order results in weak ferrimagnetism. If we restrain to high-symmetry directions for the N\'eel vector, we find weak ferrimagnetism only in the noncentrosymmetric compound MnSe among the examined cases.</description>

      <title>Efficient Generation of Grids and Traversal Graphs in Compositional Spaces towards Exploration and Path Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many disciplines of science and engineering deal with problems related to compositions, ranging from chemical compositions in materials science to portfolio compositions in economics. They exist in non-Euclidean simplex spaces, causing many standard tools to be incorrect or inefficient, which is significant in combinatorically or structurally challenging spaces exemplified by Compositionally Complex Materials (CCMs) and Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs). Here, we explore them conceptually in terms of problem spaces and quantitatively in terms of computational feasibility.
  This work implements several essential methods specific to the compositional (simplex) spaces through a high-performance open-source library nimplex. Most significantly, we derive and implement an algorithm for constructing a novel n-dimensional simplex graph data structure, which contains all discretized compositions and all possible neighbor-to-neighbor transitions as pointer arrays. Critically, no distance or neighborhood calculations are performed, instead leveraging pure combinatorics and the ordering in procedurally generated simplex grids, keeping the algorithm $\mathcal{O}(N)$, so that graphs with billions of transitions take seconds to construct on a laptop. Furthermore, we demonstrate how such graph representations can be combined to express path-planning problem spaces and to incorporate prior knowledge while keeping the problem space homogeneous. This allows for efficient deployment of existing high-performance gradient descent, graph traversal search, and other path optimization algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning generative models (GMs) have created high capabilities in accessing and assessing complex high-dimensional data, allowing superior efficiency in navigating vast material configuration space in search of viable structures. Coupling such capabilities with physically significant data to construct trained models for materials discovery is crucial to moving this emerging field forward. Here, we present a universal GM for crystal structure prediction (CSP) via a conditional crystal diffusion variational autoencoder (Cond-CDVAE) approach, which is tailored to allow user-defined material and physical parameters such as composition and pressure. This model is trained on an expansive dataset containing over 670,000 local minimum structures, including a rich spectrum of high-pressure structures, along with ambient-pressure structures in Materials Project database. We demonstrate that the Cond-CDVAE model can generate physically plausible structures with high fidelity under diverse pressure conditions without necessitating local optimization, accurately predicting 59.3% of the 3,547 unseen ambient-pressure experimental structures within 800 structure samplings, with the accuracy rate climbing to 83.2% for structures comprising fewer than 20 atoms per unit cell. These results meet or exceed those achieved via conventional CSP methods based on global optimization. The present findings showcase substantial potential of GMs in the realm of CSP.</description>

      <title>Towards an information-based theory of structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We call for a theory of the particle-scale structure of materials that is based on the general notion of information rather than its special case of symmetry. An inherent limitation to the symmetry-based understanding of structure is described. The rapid decay in interaction strength with interparticle distance is used to argue for the representability of a system locally through the neighbourhoods of its constituent particles. The extracopularity coefficient E is presented as a local quantifier of information and compared to point group order |G|, a local quantifier of symmetry. The former is found to have nearly double the resolution of the latter for a set of commonly encountered coordination geometries. A proof is given for the generality of extracopularity over point symmetry. Some practical challenges and future perspectives are discussed.</description>

      <title>Magnetization dynamics in skyrmions due to high-speed carrier injections from Dirac half-metals</title>

Abstract: Recent developments in the magnetization dynamics in spin textures, particularly skyrmions, offer promising new directions for magnetic storage technologies and spintronics. Skyrmions, characterized by their topological protection and efficient mobility at low current density, are increasingly recognized for their potential applications in next-generation logic and memory devices. This study investigates the dynamics of skyrmion magnetization, focusing on the manipulation of their topological states as a basis for bitwise data storage through a modified Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation (LLG). We introduce spin-polarized electrons from a topological ferromagnet that induce an electric dipole moment that interacts with the electric gauge field within the skyrmion domain. This interaction creates an effective magnetic field that results in a torque that can dynamically change the topological state of the skyrmion. In particular, we show that these torques can selectively destroy and create skyrmions, effectively writing and erasing bits, highlighting the potential of using controlled electron injection for robust and scalable skyrmion-based data storage solutions.</description>

      <title>Dissociative Electron Attachment on Metal Surfaces: The Case of HCl$^-$ on Au(111)</title>

Abstract: The transfer of charges, including electrons and holes, is a key step in heterogeneous catalysis, taking part in the reduction and oxidation of adsorbate species on catalyst surfaces. In plasmonic catalysis, electrons can transfer from photo-excited metal nanoparticles to molecular adsorbates, forming transient negative ions that can easily undergo reactions such as dissociation, desorption, or other chemical transformations. However, ab initio characterization of these anionic states has proven challenging, and little is known about the topology of their potential energy surfaces. In this work, we investigate the dissociative adsorption of HCl on Au(111) as a representative catalytic process with relatively low reaction probabilities, which could potentially be enhanced by electron transfer from photo-excited gold nanoparticles to HCl. We employ projection-based density embedding that combines the equation-of-motion electron-attachment coupled-cluster singles and doubles (EOM-EA-CCSD) method with density functional theory (DFT), and build dissociation curves of HCl$^-$ on Au(111) along the H-Cl bond distance. The HCl anion in the gas phase is unbound at equilibrium distances and only becomes bound as the bond stretches. However, our results show that, upon adsorption on Au(111), HCl$^-$ remains a stable, bound anion at all bond lengths due to charge delocalization to the metal. Forming bound anions is easier, and dissociation of HCl$^-$ on Au(111) is further facilitated, with its dissociation energy reduced by 0.61 eV compared to its neutral counterpart on Au(111), and by 1.16 eV relative to HCl. These results underscore the efficacy of embedded EOM-CCSD methods in addressing surface science challenges and highlight the potential of plasmonic catalysis proceeding via bound, rather than transient, anionic states.</description>

      <title>Hard superconducting gap in InSb nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02578</link>

Abstract: Topological superconductivity is a state of matter that can host Majorana modes, the building blocks of a topological quantum computer. Many experimental platforms predicted to show such a topological state rely on proximity-induced superconductivity. However, accessing the topological properties requires an induced hard superconducting gap, which is challenging to achieve for most material systems. We have systematically studied how the interface between an InSb semiconductor nanowire and a NbTiN superconductor affects the induced superconducting properties. Step by step, we improve the homogeneity of the interface while ensuring a barrier-free electrical contact to the superconductor, and obtain a hard gap in the InSb nanowire. The magnetic field stability of NbTiN allows the InSb nanowire to maintain a hard gap and a supercurrent in the presence of magnetic fields (~ 0.5 Tesla), a requirement for topological superconductivity in one-dimensional systems. Our study provides a guideline to induce superconductivity in various experimental platforms such as semiconductor nanowires, two dimensional electron gases and topological insulators, and holds relevance for topological superconductivity and quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Two-gap superconductivity and decisive role of rare-earth $d$ electrons in infinite-layer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical prediction of a phonon-mediated two-gap superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates Nd$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ by performing $\textit{ab initio}$ $GW$ and $GW$ perturbation theory calculations. Electron $GW$ self-energy effects significantly alter the characters of the two-band Fermi surface and enhance the electron-phonon coupling, compared with results based on density functional theory. Solutions of the fully $\textbf{k}$-dependent anisotropic Eliashberg equations yield two dominant $s$-wave superconducting gaps - a large gap on a band of rare-earth Nd $d$ and interstitial orbital characters and a small gap on a band of transition-metal Ni $d$ character. Increasing hole doping induces a non-rigid-band response in the electronic structure, leading to a rapid drop of the superconducting $T_c$ in the overdoped regime in agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the magnetic noise power spectrum of dark spins in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherence times of spin qubits in solid-state platforms are often limited by the presence of a spin bath. While some properties of these typically dark bath spins can be indirectly characterized via the central qubit, it is important to characterize their properties by direct measurement. Here we use pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (pEPR) based Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) dynamical decoupling to measure the magnetic noise power spectra for ensembles of P1 (substitutional nitrogen) centers in diamond that typically form the bath for NV (nitrogen-vacancy) centers. The experiments on the P1 centers were performed on a low [N] CVD (chemical vapor deposition) sample and a high [N] HPHT (high-temperature, high-pressure) sample at 89 mT. We characterize the NV centers of the latter sample using the same 2.5 GHz pEPR spectrometer. All power spectra show two distinct features, a broad component that is observed to scale as approximately $1/\omega^{0.7-1.0}$, and a prominent peak at the $^{13}$C Larmor frequency. The behavior of the broad component is consistent with an inhomogeneous distribution of Lorentzian spectra due to clustering of P1 centers, which has recently been shown to be prevalent in HPHT diamond. It is unknown if such clustering occurs in CVD diamond. We develop techniques utilizing harmonics of the CPMG filter function to improve characterization of high-frequency signals, which we demonstrate on the $^{13}$C nuclear Larmor frequency. At 190 mT this is 2.04 MHz, 5.7 times higher than the CPMG modulation frequency ($&lt;357$ kHz, hardware-limited). We assess the robustness of our methods in the presence of finite pulse widths and flip angle errors. Understanding the interactions of dark spins will inform methods of diamond fabrication for quantum technology. These techniques are applicable to ac magnetometry for nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance and chemical sensing.</description>

      <title>Considerations on free-surface detachment and bed entrainment of fluvial plastics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, fluvial plastics have been identified as major threat to aquatic environments and human health. In order to develop adequate mitigation strategies for plastic pollution, a fundamental process understanding of riverine plastic transport is of significant importance. In this context, the implementation of research findings into numerical simulation environments is anticipated to enhance modelling capabilities and to support a rigorous decision making. Recent experimental research has focused on the incipient motion of plastic particles, as well as on the effects of surface tension on plastic concentration profiles. While these investigations have advanced the state-of-the-art knowledge, current literature still displays a lack of basic insights into layer-specific plastic transport physics. In this study, first principles are applied to advance knowledge on free-surface detachment and bed entrainment of fluvial plastics. A novel relationship for the critical surface detachment velocity is derived, followed by the development of a framework that allows to relate plastic Shields parameters to those of natural sediments. Overall, it is anticipated that these developments will trigger new research within the plastics community, and it is hoped that present findings will be implemented into Lagrangian particle tracking software.</description>
