      <title>First Proof of Principle Experiment for Muon Production with Ultrashort High Intensity Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muons, which play a crucial role in both fundamental and applied physics, have traditionally been generated through proton accelerators or from cosmic rays. With the advent of ultra-short high-intensity lasers capable of accelerating electrons to GeV levels, it has become possible to generate muons in laser laboratories. In this work, we show the first proof of principle experiment for novel muon production with an ultra-short, high-intensity laser device through GeV electron beam bombardment on a lead converter target. The muon physical signal is confirmed by measuring its lifetime which is the first clear demonstration of laser-produced muons. Geant4 simulations were employed to investigate the photo-production, electro-production, and Bethe-Heitler processes response for muon generation and their subsequent detection. The results show that the dominant contributions of muons are attributed to the photo-production/electro-production and a significant yield of muons up to 0.01 $\mu$/$e^-$ out of the converter target could be achieved. This laser muon source features compact, ultra-short pulse and high flux. Moreover, its implementation in a small laser laboratory is relatively straightforward, significantly reducing the barriers to entry for research in areas such as muonic X-ray elemental analysis, muon spin spectroscopy and so on.</description>

      <title>Acceleration and Focusing Electron/Positron Bunches in Plasma-Dielectric Wakefield Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To mitigate the BBU instability and improve characteristics of accelerated bunches in Dielectric Wakefield Accelerator one can be used the isotropic plasma filling of the transport channel. Here we present the results of analytical and numerical studies of the dynamics of accelerated electron/positron and drive electron bunches under wake acceleration in a plasma DWA (PDWA) with a vacuum channel. The wake field is excited by an electron bunch in a quartz dielectric tube inserted into a cylindrical metal waveguide. The inner region of the dielectric tube is filled with plasma with a vacuum channel along the waveguide axis. At the numerical simulations the energy and spatial characteristics, efficiency, emittance, and energy spread for accelerated positron and electron bunches is studied for different radii of the vacuum channel.
  The transverse instability of the drive bunch in PDWA is studied analytically and numerically. The analytical studies have discovered the presence of one surface and one bulk eigenwaves, which are absent in corresponding dielectric-loaded waveguide without plasma filling. The main contribution to amplitude of transverse wakefield, responsible for stabilization of transverse motion of bunches, brings the bulk plasma eigenwave. The comparative analysis of the data resulting from analytical studies and the ones obtained by numerical simulation has demonstrated qualitative agreement between the results.</description>

      <title>Optics tuning simulations for FCC-ee using Python Accelerator Toolbox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of ultra-low emittance storage rings, such as the e+/e- Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee) with a circumference of about 90 km, aims to achieve unprecedented luminosity and beam size. One significant challenge is correcting the optics, which becomes increasingly difficult as we target lower emittances. In this paper, we investigate optics correction methods to address these challenges. We examined the impact of arc region magnet alignment errors in the baseline optics for the FCC-ee lattice at Z energy. To establish realistic alignment tolerances, we developed a sequence of correction steps using the Python Accelerator Toolbox (PyAT) to correct the lattice optics, achieve the nominal emittance, Dynamic Aperture (DA), and in the end, the design luminosity. The correction scheme has been recently optimized and better machine performance demonstrated. A comparison was conducted between two optics correction approaches: Linear Optics from Closed Orbits (LOCO) with phase advance + $\eta_x$ and coupling Resonance Driving Terms (RDTs) + $\eta_y$. The latter method demonstrated better performance in achieving the target emittance and enhancing the DA.</description>

      <title>Plasma Light As Diagnostic For Wakefields Driven By Developing Self-Modulation Of A Long Particle Bunch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We outline plans to use plasma light emitted as atomic lines radiation as a diagnostic for wakefields driven in plasma by a self-modulating, long proton bunch. This diagnostic is built into the design of a new vapor/plasma source that will also allow for imposing a plasma density step of various height at various locations. Such a step of a few percent in relative density placed at a location where the self-modulation process grows is predicted by numerical simulations to make the bunch drive wakefields with GV/m amplitude over hundreds of meters of plasma.</description>

      <title>Four-dimensional phase space tomography from one-dimensional measurements of a hadron beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we use one-dimensional measurements to infer the four-dimensional phase space density of an accumulated proton beam in the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) accelerator. The reconstruction was performed by maximizing the distribution's entropy subject to the measurement constraints, and thus represents the most conservative inference from the data. The reconstructed distribution reproduces the measured profiles down to the noise level, and simulations indicate that the problem is reasonably well-constrained. Similar measurements could serve as benchmarks for beam dynamics simulations in the SNS or hadron accelerators.</description>

      <title>Time Slicing of Neutrino Fluxes in Oscillation Experiments at Fermilab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long and short baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, such as DUNE, ANNIE, SBND, demand high precision in reducing systematic errors, particularly those related to neutrino-nucleus interaction cross-sections. The stroboscopic approach offers a method to capture distinct neutrino energy spectra, aiding in the separation of flux and cross-section uncertainties. This report outlines the creation of short proton bunch lengths and the transport of a narrow beam down the Booster Neutrino Beamline, essential steps for the successful implementation of the stroboscopic approach.</description>
