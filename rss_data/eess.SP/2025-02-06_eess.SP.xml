      <title>Three-dimensional signal processing: a new approach in dynamical sampling via tensor products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical sampling problem is centered around reconstructing signals that evolve over time according to a dynamical process, from spatial-temporal samples that may be noisy. This topic has been thoroughly explored for one-dimensional signals. Multidimensional signal recovery has also been studied, but primarily in scenarios where the driving operator is a convolution operator. In this work, we shift our focus to the dynamical sampling problem in the context of three-dimensional signal recovery, where the evolution system can be characterized by tensor products. Specifically, we provide a necessary condition for the sampling set that ensures successful recovery of the three-dimensional signal. Furthermore, we reformulate the reconstruction problem as an optimization task, which can be solved efficiently. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we include some straightforward numerical simulations that showcase the reconstruction performance.</description>

      <title>LUCAS: A CMOS-Based Fast Readout ASIC for Silicon Photomultipliers -- Measurement and Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of LUCAS, a low-power, ultra-low jitter ASIC optimized for SiPM readout in Time-of-Flight Computed Tomography (ToF-CT) applications. Leveraging a novel preamplifier design with low input impedance and current-mode operation, LUCAS addresses challenges such as parasitic capacitance of SiPMs and high-speed detection requirements. The ASIC, fabricated in TSMC 65nm CMOS technology, features eight channels with an integrated preamplifier and comparator, achieving an SPTR of 201 ps FWHM at 3.2 mW/ch. Experimental validation includes input impedance measurements, SPTR testing with a pulsed laser source, and energy-to-Time-over-Threshold calibration using monoenergetic X-ray sources. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of LUCAS in enhancing timing resolution while minimizing power consumption, offering significant advancements for high-resolution ToF-CT imaging.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey on Feature Extraction Techniques Using I/Q Imbalance in RFFI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has increased the need for secure authentication. While traditional encryption-based solutions can be robust, they often impose high computational and energy overhead on resource-limited IoT nodes. As an alternative, radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) leverages hardware-induced imperfections-such as Inphase/Quadrature (I/Q) imbalance-in Radio Frequency (RF) front-end components as unique identifiers that are inherently difficult to clone or spoof. Despite recent advances, significant challenges remain in standardizing feature extraction methods, maintaining high accuracy across diverse environments, and efficiently handling large-scale IoT deployments. This paper addresses these gaps by providing a comprehensive review of feature extraction techniques that utilize I/Q imbalance for RFFI. We also discuss other hardware-based RF fingerprinting sources, including power amplifier nonlinearity and oscillator imperfections, and examine modern machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches that enhance device identification performance.</description>

      <title>Optimal No-Fly Zone Design for the Coexistence of Drone and Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing a no-fly zone (NFZ) is a straightforward and effective way to facilitate the coexistence of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) and existing systems (typically satellite systems). However, there has been little work on understanding the optimal design of such NFZs. In the absence of this design, one invariably ends up overestimating this region, hence significantly limiting the allowed airspace for the drones. To optimize the volume of the NFZ, we formulate this task as a variational problem and utilize the calculus of variations to rigorously obtain the NFZ as a function of the antenna pattern of victim receivers and the spatial distribution of drones. This approach parallels the matched filter design in the sense that the NFZ extends in directions where the antenna gain and/or the density of drones is high. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimal design compared to the known baselines in reducing the volume of the NFZ without compromising the protective performance.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of One-bit Quantized Box-Constrained Precoding in Large-Scale Multi-User Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the design of multi-antenna precoding strategies, considering hardware limitations such as low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs), which necessitate the quantization of transmitted signals. The typical approach starts with optimizing a precoder, followed by a quantization step to meet hardware requirements. This study analyzes the performance of a quantization scheme applied to the box-constrained regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoder in the asymptotic regime, where the number of antennas and users grows proportionally. The box constraint, initially designed to cope with low-dynamic range amplifiers, is used here to control quantization noise rather than for amplifier compatibility. A significant challenge in analyzing the quantized precoder is that the input to the quantization operation does not follow a Gaussian distribution, making traditional methods such as Bussgang's decomposition unsuitable. To overcome this, the paper extends the Gordon's inequality and introduces a novel Gaussian Min-Max Theorem to model the distribution of the channel-distorted precoded signal. The analysis derives the tight lower bound for the signal-to-distortion-plus-noise ratio (SDNR) and the bit error rate (BER), showing that optimal tuning of the amplitude constraint improves performance.</description>

      <title>A Corrugated All-Metal Vivaldi Antenna for 5G Phased Array Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a corrugated Vivaldi phased array antenna in the 28 GHz frequency band is proposed for 5G communication applications. The presented configuration features an all-metal antipodal antenna structure with a broad bandwidth ranging from 26 to 30 GHz and beam steering capabilities from -30 to +30 degrees. The proposed antenna consists of a 4x4 array configuration, where each element has dimensions of 6.46x6.46x14.25 mm, resulting in an overall antenna structure with dimensions of 25.84x25.84x14.25 mm. The corrugation method is applied to minimize surface currents, resulting in a reduction in interelement mutual couplings. Therefore, the return loss in the array structure for central elements is decreased, and the antenna gain and radiation efficiency are improved. Moreover, the improved radiation efficiency allows for higher power transmission and reception from an antenna, resulting in potentially higher data rates and better performance.</description>

      <title>Perfect matching of reactive loads through complex frequencies: from circuital analysis to experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental evidence of purely reactive loads impedance matching is here provided by exploiting the special scattering response under complex excitations. The study starts with a theoretical analysis of the reflection properties of an arbitrary reactive load and identifies the proper excitation able to transform the purely reactive load into a virtual resistive load during the time the signal is applied. To minimize reflections between the load and the transmission line, the excitation must have a complex frequency, leading to a propagating signal with a tailored temporal envelope. The aim of this work is to design and, for the first time,experimentally demonstrate this anomalous scattering behavior in microwave circuits, showing that the time-modulated signals can be exploited as a new degree of freedom for achieving impedance matching without introducing neither a matching network nor resistive elements, that are typically used for ensuring power dissipation and, thus, zero reflection. The proposed matching strategy does not alter the reactive load that is still lossless, enabling an anomalous termination condition where the energy is not dissipated nor reflected, but indefinitely accumulated in the reactive load. The stored energy leaks out the load as soon as the applied signal changes or stops.</description>

      <title>Dual-Polarized Intelligent Omni-Surfaces for Independent Reflective-Refractive Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent omni-surface (IOS), which are capable of providing service coverage to mobile users (MUs) in a reflective and a refractive manner, has recently attracted widespread attention. However, the performance of traditionally IOS-aid systems is limited by the intimate coupling between the refraction and reflection behavior of IOS elements. In this letter, to overcome this challenge, we introduce the concept of dual-polarized IOS-assisted communication. More precisely, by employing the polarization domain in the design of IOS, full independent refraction and reflection modes can be delivered. We consider a downlink dual-polarized IOS-aided system, while also accounting for the leakage between different polarizations. To maximize the sum rate, we formulate a joint IOS phase shift and BS beamforming problem and proposed an iterative algorithm to solve the non-convex program. Simulation results validate that dual-polarized IOS significantly enhances the performance than the traditional one.</description>

      <title>Antenna Position Optimization for Movable Antenna-Empowered Near-Field Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) show great promise for enhancing the sensing capabilities of future sixth-generation (6G) networks. With the growing prevalence of near-field propagation at ultra-high frequencies, this paper focuses on the application of MAs for near-field sensing to jointly estimate the angle and distance information of a target. First, to gain essential insights into MA-enhanced near-field sensing, we investigate two simplified cases with only the spatial angle-of-arrival (AoA) or distance estimation, respectively, assuming that the other information is already known. We derive the worst-case Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) on the mean square errors (MSEs) of the AoA estimation and the distance estimation via the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm in these two cases. Then, we jointly optimize the positions of the MAs within a linear array to minimize these CRBs and derive their closed-form solutions, which yield an identical array geometry to MA-aided far-field sensing. Furthermore, we proceed to the more challenging case with the joint AoA and distance estimation and derive the worst-case CRB under the two-dimensional (2D) MUSIC algorithm. The corresponding CRB minimization problem is efficiently solved by adopting a discrete sampling-based approach. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MA-enhanced near-field sensing significantly outperforms conventional sensing with fixed-position antennas (FPAs). Moreover, the joint angle and distance estimation results in a different array geometry from that in the individual estimation of angle or distance.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Near-Field and Far-Field Localization with Multiple Holographic MIMO Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization methods based on holographic multiple input multiple output (HMIMO) have gained much attention for its potential to achieve high accuracy. By deploying multiple HMIMOs, we can improve the link quality and system coverage. As the scale of HMIMO increases to improve beam control capability, the near-field (NF) region of each HMIMO expands. However, existing multiple HMIMO-enabled methods mainly focus on the far-field (FF) of each HMIMO, which leads to low localization accuracy when applied in the NF. In this paper, a hybrid NF and FF localization method aided by multiple RISs, a low cost implementation of HMIMO, is proposed. In such a scenario, it is difficult to achieve user localization and RIS optimization since the equivalent NF of all RISs expands, which results in high complexity, and we need to handle the interference caused by multiple RISs. To tackle this challenge, we propose a two-phase RIS-enabled localization method that first estimate the relative locations of the user to each RIS and fuse the results to obtain the global estimation. In this way, the algorithm complexity is reduced. We formulate the RIS optimization problem to keep the RIS sidelobe as low as possible to minimize the interference. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive wireless sensors are crucial in modern medical and industrial settings to monitor procedures and conditions. We demonstrate a circuit to inductively excite passive resonators and to conduct their decaying signal response to a low noise amplifier. Two design variations of a generic transmit-receive signal chain are proposed, measured, and described in detail for the purpose of facilitating replication. Instrumentation and design aim to be scalable for multi-channel array configurations, using either off-the-shelf class-D audio amplifiers or a custom full H-bridge. Measurements are conducted on miniature magneto-mechanical resonators in the ultra low frequency range to enable sensing and tracking applications of such devices in different environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern communication systems, having an accurate channel estimator is crucial. However, when there is mobility, it becomes difficult to estimate the channel and the pilot signals, which are used for channel estimation, become insufficient. In this paper, we introduce the use of Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) with data pilot-aided (DPA) channel estimation and temporal averaging (TA) to estimate vehicle-to-vehicle same direction with Wall (VTV-SDWW) channels. The TCN-DPA-TA estimator showed an improvement in Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of up to 1 order of magnitude. Furthermore, the BER performance of the TCN-DPA without TA also improved by up to 0.7 magnitude compared to the best classical estimator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a novel physical-layer secure communications scheme based on the recently discovered chirp-permuted affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) waveform, which results in a completely different received signal to the eavesdropper with the incorrect chirp-permutation order, even under co-located eavesdropping with perfect channel information. The security of the proposed scheme is studied in terms of the complexity required to find the correct permutation via classical and quantum search algorithms, which are shown to be infeasible due the factorially-scaling search space, as well as theoretical and simulated analyses of a random-guess approach, indicating an infeasible probability of breach by chance.</description>

      <title>Single Antenna Terahertz Sensing using Preconfigured Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of mobile terahertz (THz) sensing and localization with minimal infrastructure has garnered significant attention due to its substantial practical implications. Single-antenna radar systems are a favored choice for mobile platforms, as they offer notable advantages in terms of cost, weight, and simplicity. However, these systems face a critical limitation: the inability to extract angular information using a single antenna, which consequently prevents the achievement of complete localization. This paper proposes an angular estimation method for a single-antenna radar augmented with a pair of preconfigured metasurfaces. The metasurface pair is used for creating an interference pattern in the scene, which depends on the target angles and operating frequency. Moreover, the beam squint effects caused by the wide frequency range in the THz band provides suitable conditions for using sparse reconstruction techniques to obtain angular estimates. We utilize these properties to perform angular estimation with a single antenna. The simulation results show that with this method it is possible to perform fast and accurate multi-target estimation for a broad operating range.</description>

      <title>ScNeuGM: Scalable Neural Graph Modeling for Coloring-Based Contention and Interference Management in Wi-Fi 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance in Wi-Fi often leads to contention and interference, thereby increasing packet losses. These challenges have traditionally been modeled as a graph, with stations (STAs) represented as vertices and contention or interference as edges. Graph coloring assigns orthogonal transmission slots to STAs, managing contention and interference, e.g., using the restricted target wake time (RTWT) mechanism introduced in Wi-Fi 7 standards. However, legacy graph models lack flexibility in optimizing these assignments, often failing to minimize slot usage while maintaining reliable transmissions. To address this issue, we propose ScNeuGM, a neural graph modeling (NGM) framework that flexibly trains a neural network (NN) to construct optimal graph models whose coloring corresponds to optimal slot assignments. ScNeuGM is highly scalable to large Wi-Fi networks with massive STA pairs: 1) it utilizes an evolution strategy (ES) to directly optimize the NN parameters based on one network-wise reward signal, avoiding exhaustive edge-wise feedback estimations in all STA pairs; 2) ScNeuGM also leverages a deep hashing function (DHF) to group contending or interfering STA pairs and restricts NGM NN training and inference to pairs within these groups, significantly reducing complexity. Simulations show that the ES-trained NN in ScNeuGM returns near-optimal graphs 4-10 times more often than algorithms requiring edge-wise feedback and reduces 25\% slots than legacy graph constructions. Furthermore, the DHF in ScNeuGM reduces the training and the inference time of NGM by 4 and 8 times, respectively, and the online slot assignment time by 3 times in large networks, and up to 30\% fewer packet losses in dynamic scenarios due to the timely assignments.</description>

      <title>On the Conditional Phase Distribution of the TWDP Multipath Fading Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the conditional phase distribution of the two-wave with diffuse power (TWDP) process is derived as a closed-form and as an infinite-series expression. For the obtained infinite series expression, a truncation analysis is performed and the truncated expression is used to examine the influence of different channel conditions on the behavior of the TWDP phase. All the results are verified through Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>On the Simulation and Correlation Properties of TWDP Fading Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel statistical simulator designed to model propagation in two-way diffuse power (TWDP) fading channels. The simulator employs two zero-mean stochastic sinusoids to simulate specular components, while a sum of sinusoids is used to model the diffuse one. Using the developed simulator, the autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions of the quadrature components, as well as the autocorrelation of the complex and squared envelope, are derived for the first time in literature for channels experiencing TWDP fading. The statistical properties of the proposed simulator are thoroughly validated through extensive simulations, which closely align with the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Covert Communications in Active-IOS Aided Uplink NOMA Systems With Full-Duplex Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, an active intelligent omni-surface (A-IOS) is deployed to aid uplink transmissions in a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system. In order to shelter the covert signal embedded in the superposition transmissions, a multi-antenna full-duplex (FD) receiver is utilized at the base-station to recover signal in addition to jamming the warden. With the aim of maximizing the covert rate, the FD transmit and receive beamforming, A-IOS refraction and reflection beamforming, NOMA transmit power, and FD jamming power are jointly optimized. To tackle the non-convex covert rate maximization problem subject to the highly coupled system parameters, an alternating optimization algorithm is designed to iteratively solve the decoupled sub-problems of optimizing the system parameters. The optimal solutions for the sub-problems of the NOMA transmit power and FD jamming power optimizations are derived in closed-form. To tackle the rank-one constrained non-convex fractional programming of the A-IOS beamforming and FD beamforming, a penalized Dinkelbach transformation approach is proposed to resort to the optimal solutions via semidefinite programming. Numerical results clarify that the deployment of the A-IOS significantly improves the covert rate compared with the passive-IOS aided uplink NOMA system. It is also found that the proposed scheme provides better covert communication performance with the optimized NOMA transmit power and FD jamming power compared with the benchmark schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in next-generation wireless communication systems has become a cornerstone for advancing intelligent, adaptive, and scalable networks. This reading report examines key innovations in dynamic spectrum sensing (DSS), beginning with the foundational DeepSense framework, which uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and spectrogram-based analysis for real-time wideband spectrum monitoring. Building on this groundwork, it highlights advancements such as DeepSweep and Wideband Signal Stitching, which address the challenges of scalability, latency, and dataset diversity through parallel processing, semantic segmentation, and robust data augmentation strategies. The report then explores Open Radio Access Networks (ORAN), focusing on AI/ML-driven enhancements for UAV experimentation, digital twin-based optimization, network slicing, and self-healing xApp development. By bridging AI-based DSS methodologies with ORAN's open, vendor-neutral architecture, these studies underscore the potential of software-defined, intelligent infrastructures in enabling efficient, resilient, and self-optimizing networks for 5G/6G ecosystems. Through this synthesis, the report highlights AI's transformative role in shaping the future of wireless communication and autonomous systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the approximation error of functions with continuous and piecewise-linear (CPWL) representations. We focus on the CPWL search spaces generated by translates of box splines on two-dimensional regular lattices. We compute the approximation error in terms of the stepsize and angles that define the lattice. Our results show that hexagonal lattices are optimal, in the sense that they minimize the asymptotic approximation error.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning-Based People Counting and Localization Models Employing CSI from Commodity WiFi NICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider people counting and localization systems exploiting channel state information (CSI) measured from commodity WiFi network interface cards (NICs). While CSI has useful information of amplitude and phase to describe signal propagation in a measurement environment of interest, CSI measurement suffers from offsets due to various uncertainties. Moreover, an uncontrollable external environment where other WiFi devices communicate each other induces interfering signals, resulting in erroneous CSI captured at a receiver. In this paper, preprocessing of CSI is first proposed for offset removal, and it guarantees low-latency operation without any filtering process. Afterwards, we design people counting and localization models based on pre-training. To be adaptive to different measurement environments, meta-learning-based people counting and localization models are also proposed. Numerical results show that the proposed meta-learning-based people counting and localization models can achieve high sensing accuracy, compared to other learning schemes that follow simple training and test procedures.</description>

      <title>Metis: A Foundation Speech Generation Model with Masked Generative Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Metis, a foundation model for unified speech generation. Unlike previous task-specific or multi-task models, Metis follows a pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. It is pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled speech data using masked generative modeling and then fine-tuned to adapt to diverse speech generation tasks. Specifically, 1) Metis utilizes two discrete speech representations: SSL tokens derived from speech self-supervised learning (SSL) features, and acoustic tokens directly quantized from waveforms. 2) Metis performs masked generative pre-training on SSL tokens, utilizing 300K hours of diverse speech data, without any additional condition. 3) Through fine-tuning with task-specific conditions, Metis achieves efficient adaptation to various speech generation tasks while supporting multimodal input, even when using limited data and trainable parameters. Experiments demonstrate that Metis can serve as a foundation model for unified speech generation: Metis outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific or multi-task systems across five speech generation tasks, including zero-shot text-to-speech, voice conversion, target speaker extraction, speech enhancement, and lip-to-speech, even with fewer than 20M trainable parameters or 300 times less training data.

      <title>Low-Complexity Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound and Sum Rate Optimization in ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Cram\'er-Rao lower bound is an important metric in sensing functions in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) designs, its optimization usually involves a computationally expensive solution such as semidefinite relaxation. In this paper, we aim to develop a low-complexity yet efficient algorithm for CRLB optimization. We focus on a beamforming design that maximizes the weighted sum between the communications sum rate and the sensing CRLB, subject to a transmit power constraint. Given the non-convexity of this problem, we propose a novel method that combines successive convex approximation (SCA) with a shifted generalized power iteration (SGPI) approach, termed SCA-SGPI. The SCA technique is utilized to approximate the non-convex objective function with convex surrogates, while the SGPI efficiently solves the resulting quadratic subproblems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SCA-SGPI algorithm not only achieves superior tradeoff performance compared to existing method but also significantly reduces computational time, making it a promising solution for practical ISAC applications.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time-series using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates unsupervised anomaly detection in multivariate time-series data using reinforcement learning (RL) in the latent space of an autoencoder. A significant challenge is the limited availability of anomalous data, often leading to misclassifying anomalies as normal events, thus raising false negatives. RL can help overcome this limitation by promoting exploration and balancing exploitation during training, effectively preventing overfitting. Wavelet analysis is also utilized to enhance anomaly detection, enabling time-series data decomposition into both time and frequency domains. This approach captures anomalies at multiple resolutions, with wavelet coefficients extracted to detect both sudden and subtle shifts in the data, thereby refining the anomaly detection process. We calibrate the decision boundary by generating synthetic anomalies and embedding a supervised framework within the model. This supervised element aids the unsupervised learning process by fine-tuning the decision boundary and increasing the model's capacity to distinguish between normal and anomalous patterns effectively.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of 5G FR2 (mmWave) Downlink 256QAM on Commercial 5G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 5G New Radio (NR) standard introduces new frequency bands allocated in Frequency Range 2 (FR2) to support enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) in congested environments and enables new use cases such as Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC). The 3GPP introduced 256QAM support for FR2 frequency bands to further enhance downlink capacity. However, sustaining 256QAM on FR2 in practical environments is challenging due to strong path loss and susceptibility to distortion. While 256QAM can improve theoretical throughput by 33%, compared to 64QAM, and is widely adopted in FR1, its real-world impact when utilized in FR2 is questionable, given the significant path loss and distortions experienced in the FR2 range. Additionally, using higher modulation correlates to higher BLER, increased instability, and retransmission. Moreover, 256QAM also utilizes a different MCS table defining the modulation and code rate at different Channel Quality Indexes (CQI), affecting the UE's link adaptation behavior. This paper investigates the real-world performance of 256QAM utilization on FR2 bands in two countries, across three RAN manufacturers, and in both NSA (EN-DC) and SA (NR-DC) configurations, under various scenarios, including open-air plazas, city centers, footbridges, train station platforms, and stationary environments. The results show that 256QAM provides a reasonable throughput gain when stationary but marginal improvements when there is UE mobility while increasing the probability of NACK responses, increasing BLER, and the number of retransmissions. Finally, MATLAB simulations are run to validate the findings as well as explore the effect of the recently introduced 1024QAM on FR2.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce GeXSe (Generative Explanatory Sensor System), a novel framework designed to extract interpretable sensor-based and vision domain features from non-invasive smart space sensors. We combine these to provide a comprehensive explanation of sensor-activation patterns in activity recognition tasks. This system leverages advanced machine learning architectures, including transformer blocks, Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC), and diffusion models, to provide a more detailed understanding of sensor-based human activity data. A standout feature of GeXSe is our unique Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with linear, ReLU, and normalization layers, specially devised for optimal performance on small datasets. It also yields meaningful activation maps to explain sensor-based activation patterns. The standard approach is based on a CNN model, which our MLP model outperforms.GeXSe offers two types of explanations: sensor-based activation maps and visual domain explanations using short videos. These methods offer a comprehensive interpretation of the output from non-interpretable sensor data, thereby augmenting the interpretability of our model. Utilizing the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for evaluation, it outperforms established methods, improving baseline performance by about 6\%. GeXSe also achieves a high F1 score of up to 0.85, demonstrating precision, recall, and noise resistance, marking significant progress in reliable and explainable smart space sensing systems.</description>

      <title>User Equipment Assisted Localization for 6G Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates user equipment (UE) assisted device-free networked sensing in the sixth-generation (6G) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where one base station (BS) and multiple UEs, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), serve as anchors to cooperatively localize multiple passive targets based on the range information. Three challenges arise from the above scheme. First, the UEs are not perfectly synchronized with the BSs. Second, the UE (anchor) positions are usually estimated by the Global Positioning System (GPS) and subject to unknown errors. Third, data association is challenging, since it is hard for each anchor to associate each rang estimation to the right target under device-free sensing. We first tackle the above three challenges under a passive UE based sensing mode, where UEs only passively hear the signals over the BS-target-UE paths. A two-phase UE assisted localization protocol is proposed. In Phase I, we design an efficient method to accurately estimate the ranges from the BS to the targets and those from the BS to the targets to the UEs in the presence of synchronization errors between the BS and the UEs. In Phase II, an efficient algorithm is proposed to localize the targets via jointly removing the UEs with quite inaccurate position information from the anchor set and matching the estimated ranges at the BS and the remaining UEs with the targets. Next, we also consider an active UE based sensing mode, where the UEs can actively emit signals to obtain additional range information from them to the targets. We show that this additional range information can be utilized to significantly reduce the complexity of Phase II in the aforementioned two-phase localization protocol. Numerical results show that our proposed UE assisted networked sensing scheme can achieve very high localization accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed gradient descent algorithms have come to the fore in modern machine learning, especially in parallelizing the handling of large datasets that are distributed across several workers. However, scant attention has been paid to analyzing the behavior of distributed gradient descent algorithms in the presence of adversarial corruptions instead of random noise. In this paper, we formulate a novel problem in which adversarial corruptions are present in a distributed learning system. We show how to use ideas from (lazy) mirror descent to design a corruption-tolerant distributed optimization algorithm. Extensive convergence analysis for (strongly) convex loss functions is provided for different choices of the stepsize. We carefully optimize the stepsize schedule to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm, while at the same time amortizing the effect of the corruption over time. Experiments based on linear regression, support vector classification, and softmax classification on the MNIST dataset corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Digital and Hybrid Precoding Designs in Massive MIMO with Low-Resolution ADCs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) have emerged as an efficient solution for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to reap high data rates with reasonable power consumption and hardware complexity. In this paper, we study precoding designs for digital, fully connected (FC) hybrid, and partially connected (PC) hybrid beamforming architectures in massive MIMO systems with low-resolution ADCs at the receiver. We aim to maximize the spectral efficiency (SE) subject to a transmit power budget and hardware constraints on the analog components. The resulting problems are nonconvex and the quantization distortion introduces additional challenges. To address them, we first derive a tight lower bound for the SE, based on which we optimize the precoders for the three beamforming architectures under the majorization-minorization framework. Numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed precoding designs over their state-of-the-art counterparts in systems with low-resolution ADCs, particularly those with 1-bit resolution. The results show that the PC hybrid precoding design can achieve an SE close to those of the digital and FC hybrid precoding designs in 1-bit systems, highlighting the potential of the PC hybrid beamforming architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed phased Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (phased-MIMO) radar systems have attracted wide attention in target detection and tracking. However, the phase-shifting circuits in phased subarrays contribute to high power consumption and hardware cost. To address this issue, an energy-efficient and cost-efficient metamaterial antenna array, i.e., reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS), has been developed. In this letter, we propose RHS-aided distributed MIMO radar systems to achieve more accurate multi-target detection under equivalent power consumption and hardware cost as that of distributed phased-MIMO radar systems. Different from phased arrays, the RHS achieves beam steering by regulating the radiation amplitude of its elements, and thus conventional beamforming schemes designed for phased arrays are no longer applicable. Aiming to maximize detection accuracy, we design an amplitude-controlled beamforming scheme for multiple RHS transceiver subarrays. The simulations validate the superiority of the proposed scheme over the distributed phased-MIMO radar scheme and reveal the optimal allocation of spatial diversity and coherent processing gain that leads to the best system performance when hardware resources are fixed.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Wideband Near-Field Communications With Reconfigurable Refractive Surfaces</title>

Abstract: To meet the growing demand for high data rates, cellular systems are expected to evolve towards higher carrier frequencies and larger antenna arrays, but conventional phased arrays face challenges in supporting such a prospection due to their excessive power consumption induced by numerous phase shifters required. Reconfigurable Refractive Surface (RRS) is an energy efficient solution to address this issue without relying on phase shifters. However, the increased radiation aperture size extends the range of the Fresnel region, leading the users to lie in the near-field zone. Moreover, given the wideband communications in higher frequency bands, we cannot ignore the frequency selectivity of the RRS. These two effects collectively exacerbate the beam-split issue, where different frequency components fail to converge on the user simultaneously, and finally result in a degradation of the data rate. In this paper, we investigate an RRS-based wideband near-field multi-user communication system. Unlike most existing studies on wideband communications, which consider the beam-split effect only with the near-field condition, we study the beam-split effect under the influence of both the near-field condition and the frequency selectivity of the RRS. To mitigate the beam-split effect, we propose a Delayed-RRS structure, based on which a beamforming scheme is proposed to optimize the user's data rate. Through theoretical analysis and simulation results, we analyze the influence of the RRS's frequency selectivity, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed beamforming scheme, and reveal the importance of jointly considering the near-field condition and the frequency selectivity of RRS.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Wireless AI via Meta-Learned Context-Dependent Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern software-defined networks, such as Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) systems, rely on artificial intelligence (AI)-powered applications running on controllers interfaced with the radio access network. To ensure that these AI applications operate reliably at runtime, they must be properly calibrated before deployment. A promising and theoretically grounded approach to calibration is conformal prediction (CP), which enhances any AI model by transforming it into a provably reliable set predictor that provides error bars for estimates and decisions. CP requires calibration data that matches the distribution of the environment encountered during runtime. However, in practical scenarios, network controllers often have access only to data collected under different contexts -- such as varying traffic patterns and network conditions -- leading to a mismatch between the calibration and runtime distributions. This paper introduces a novel methodology to address this calibration-test distribution shift. The approach leverages meta-learning to develop a zero-shot estimator of distribution shifts, relying solely on contextual information. The proposed method, called meta-learned context-dependent weighted conformal prediction (ML-WCP), enables effective calibration of AI applications without requiring data from the current context. Additionally, it can incorporate data from multiple contexts to further enhance calibration reliability.</description>

      <title>Detection Schemes with Low-Resolution ADCs and Spatial Oversampling for Transmission with Higher-Order Constellations in the Terahertz Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04728</link>

Abstract: In this work, we consider Terahertz (THz) communications with low-resolution uniform quantization and spatial oversampling at the receiver side, corresponding to a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) transmission. We fairly compare different analog-to-digital converter (ADC) parametrizations by keeping the ADC power consumption constant. Here, 1-, 2-, and 3-bit quantization is investigated with different oversampling factors. We analytically compute the statistics of the detection variable, and we propose the optimal and several suboptimal detection schemes for arbitrary quantization resolutions. Then, we evaluate the symbol error rate (SER) of the different detectors for 16- and 64-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). The results indicate that there is a noticeable performance degradation of the suboptimal detectors compared to the optimal detector when the constellation size is larger than the number of quantization levels. Furthermore, at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), 1-bit quantization outperforms 2- and 3-bit quantization, respectively, even when employing higher-order constellations. We confirm our analytical results by Monte Carlo simulations. Both a pure line-of-sight (LoS) and a more realistically modeled indoor THz channel are considered. Then, we optimize the input signal constellation with respect to SER for 1- and 2-bit quantization. The results give insights for optimizing higher-order constellations for arbitrary quantization resolutions and show that the minimum SER can be lowered significantly by appropriately placing the constellation points.</description>

      <title>PaPaGei: Open Foundation Models for Optical Physiological Signals</title>

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is the leading non-invasive technique for monitoring biosignals and cardiovascular health, with widespread adoption in both clinical settings and consumer wearable devices. While machine learning models trained on PPG signals have shown promise, they tend to be task-specific and struggle with generalization. Current research is limited by the use of single-device datasets, insufficient exploration of out-of-domain generalization, and a lack of publicly available models, which hampers reproducibility. To address these limitations, we present PaPaGei, the first open foundation model for PPG signals. The model is pre-trained on over 57,000 hours of data, comprising 20 million unlabeled PPG segments from publicly available datasets. We introduce a novel representation learning approach that leverages domain knowledge of PPG signal morphology across individuals, enabling the capture of richer representations compared to traditional contrastive learning methods. We evaluate PaPaGei against state-of-the-art time-series foundation models and self-supervised learning benchmarks across 20 tasks from 10 diverse datasets, spanning cardiovascular health, sleep disorders, pregnancy monitoring, and wellbeing assessment. Our model demonstrates superior performance, improving classification and regression metrics by 6.3% and 2.9% respectively in at least 14 tasks. Notably, PaPaGei achieves these results while being more data- and parameter-efficient, outperforming models that are 70x larger. Beyond accuracy, we examine model robustness across different skin tones, establishing a benchmark for bias evaluation in future models. PaPaGei can serve as both a feature extractor and an encoder for multimodal models, opening up new opportunities for multimodal health monitoring.</description>
