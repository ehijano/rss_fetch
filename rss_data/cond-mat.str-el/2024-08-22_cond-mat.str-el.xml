      <title>Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid and quantum criticality in spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain C14H18CuN4O10 via Wilson ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ground state of a one-dimensional spin-1/2 uniform antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain (AfHc) is a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid which is quantum-critical with respect to applied magnetic fields upto a saturation field Hs beyond which it transforms to a fully polarised state. Wilson ratio has been predicted to be a good indicator for demarcating these phases [Phys. Rev. B 96, 220401 (2017)]. From detailed temperature and magnetic field dependent magnetisation, magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements in a metalorganic complex and comparisons with field theory and quantum transfer matrix method calculations, the complex was found to be a very good realisation of a spin-1/2 AfHc. Wilson ratio obtained from experimentally obtained magnetic susceptibility and magnetic contribution of specific heat values was used to map the magnetic phase diagram of the uniform spin-1/2 AfHc over large regions of phase space demarcating Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, saturation field quantum critical, and fully polarised states. Luttinger parameter and spinon velocity were found to match very well with the values predicted from conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Stabilization mechanisms of magnetic skyrmion crystal and multiple-$Q$ states based on momentum-resolved spin interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple-$Q$ states as represented by a magnetic skyrmion crystal and hedgehog crystal have been extensively studied in recent years owing to their unconventional physical properties. The materials hosting multiple-$Q$ states have been so far observed in a variety of lattice structures and chemical compositions, which indicates rich stabilization mechanisms inducing the multiple-$Q$ states. We review recent developments in the research of the stabilization mechanisms of such multiple-$Q$ states with an emphasis on the microscopic spin interactions in momentum space. We show that an effective momentum-resolved spin model is a canonical model for not only understanding the microscopic origin of various multiple-$Q$ states but also exploring further exotic multiple-$Q$ states with topological properties. We introduce several key ingredients to realize the magnetic skyrmion crystal with the skyrmion numbers of one and two, hedgehog crystal, meron-antimeron crystal, bubble crystal, and other multiple-$Q$ states. We also review that the effective spin model can be used to reproduce the magnetic phase diagram in experiments efficiently.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional bond-order formation in kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K) analyzed by the density-wave equation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanism of CDW and its 3D structure are important fundamental issues in kagome metals. We have previously shown that, based on a 2D model, $2\times 2$ bond order (BO) emerges due to the paramagnon-interference (PMI) mechanism and that its fluctuations lead to $s$-wave superconductivity. This paper studies these issues based on realistic 3D models for kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K). We reveal that a commensurate 3D $2\times 2\times 2$ BO is caused by the PMI mechanism, by performing the 3D density-wave (DW) equation analysis for all A=Cs, Rb, K models in detail. Our results indicate a BO transition temperature $T_{\rm BO}\sim 100$K within the regime of moderate electron correlation. The 3D structure of BO is attributed to the three-dimensionality of the Fermi surface, while the 3D structure of BO is sensitively changed since the Fermi surface is quasi-2D. In the DW equation analysis, the most favorable 3D structure is (i) the alternating vertical stacking BO, where star-of-David (SoD) and tri-hexagonal (TrH) patterns stack alternatively. Other candidate is (ii) the shift-stacking BO composed of either SoD or TrH pattern. We find that the 3D structure of BO can be determined by the 3rd-order Ginzburg-Landau free energy $b\phi_1\phi_2\phi_3$. Since $b$ depends sensitively on the band structure, both (i) and (ii) can be realized. The present study enhances our understanding of the rich variety of BOs observed experimentally. It is confirmed that the PMI mechanism is the essential origin of the 3D CDW of kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Competition between dimerization and vector chirality in the spin-$3/2$ $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg chain with uniaxial single-ion anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-$3/2$ chain is a versatile prototypical platform for the study of competition between different kinds of magnetic orders, with the objective of obtaining a deeper understanding of the corresponding quantum phase transitions. In this work, we investigate the spin-$3/2$ chain with nearest-neighbor $J_1$, next-nearest-neighbor $J_2$, and uniaxial single-ion anisotropy $D$ terms in the absence of a magnetic field. For positive values of $J_2/J_1$ and $D/J_1$, we find seven different phases in a rich phase diagram. Without frustration $J_2=0$, a gapless Luttinger liquid phase remains stable for all $D&gt;0$. As $J_2$ increases, we observe three phases with distinct dimerized valence bond orders, which show an intricate competition with vector chiral order and incommensurate correlations. For large $J_2$, regions of phase coexistence between the dimerized and vector chiral orders emerge. We present large-scale numerical data for the determination of transition lines, order parameters, and the nature of the phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg ladder with a chirality-chirality interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with a chirality-chirality interaction (CCI) on a two-leg ladder offers a minimal setup to study an interplay between spin and chirality degrees of freedom. This model is potentially relevant to understanding the effects of a four-spin ring exchange and a phonon-mediated interaction on a ladder. By applying the Abelian bosonization and two types of spin-chirality duality, we derive a rich phase diagram of this model that includes previously unexplored cases of a ferromagnetic rung exchange $J_\perp&lt;0$ or a negative CCI $K_{\rm ch}&lt;0$. The phase diagram consists of the rung singlet (RS) phase, the Haldane phase, and three non-magnetic ordered phases. Furthermore, the RS and Haldane phases consist of several regions with different dominant correlations in terms of spin, dimer, or chirality. We perform numerical simulations to confirm the predicted phase structure and critical properties.</description>

      <title>Extended quantum anomalous Hall effect in moir\'e structures: phase transitions and transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments on multilayer rhombohedral graphene have unearthed a number of interesting phenomena in the regime where Integer and Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall phenomena were previously reported. Specifically at low temperature ($T$) and low applied currents, an "Extended" Integer Quantum Anomalous Hall (EIQAH) is seen over a wide range of the phase diagram. As the current is increased, at low $T$, the EIQAH undergoes a phase transition to a metallic state at generic fillings, and to the fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) state at the Jain fillings. Increasing temperature at the Jain fillings also leads to an evolution out of the EIQAH to the Jain state. Here we provide an interpretation of these observations. We describe the EIQAH as a crystalline state (either of holes doped into the $\nu = 1$ state, or an Anomalous Hall Crystal of electrons) that breaks moir\'e translation symmetry. At generic fillings, we show how an electric current-induced depinning transition of the crystalline order leads to peculiar non-linear current-voltage curves consistent with the experiment. At Jain fillings, we propose that the depinning transition is pre-empted by an equilibrium transition between EIQAH and Jain FQAH states. This transition occurs due to the large polarizability of the Jain FQAH states which enables them to lower their energy effectively in an applied electric field compared to the crystal states. We also discuss the finite temperature evolution in terms of the relative entropies of the crystalline and FQAH states.</description>

      <title>Surface Tension of a Topological Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metastable phases, in general, are unstable to nucleating droplets of the order defining the global free energy minima. However, whether such a droplet grows or shrinks relies on a competition between the surface tension and bulk energy density. We study the role of coupling a topological fermionic field to a scalar field undergoing such nucleation processes. We find that existence of non-trivial fermionic boundary modes on the nucleating droplets leads to substantial quantum corrections to the surface tension thereby modifying the size of the critical nucleus beyond which unrestricted droplet growth happens. To illustrate the phenomena we devise a minimal model of fermions in a Chern insulating system coupled to a classical Ising field in two spatial dimensions. Using a combination of analytic and numerical methods we conclusively show that topological phases can lead to characteristic quantum surface tension. Apart from material systems, our work has implications on the interplay of physics of statistical classical fields and quantum topological order.</description>

      <title>Towards a theory of phase transitions in quantum control landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control landscape phase transitions (CLPTs) occur as abrupt changes in the cost function landscape upon varying a control parameter, and can be revealed by non-analytic points in statistical order parameters. A prime example are quantum speed limits (QSL) which mark the onset of controllability as the protocol duration is increased. Here we lay the foundations of an analytical theory for CLPTs by developing Dyson, Magnus, and cumulant expansions for the cost function that capture the behavior of CLPTs with a controlled precision. Using linear and quadratic stability analysis, we reveal that CLPTs can be associated with different types of instabilities of the optimal protocol. This allows us to explicitly relate CLPTs to critical structural rearrangements in the extrema of the control landscape: utilizing path integral methods from statistical field theory, we trace back the critical scaling of the order parameter at the QSL to the topological and geometric properties of the set of optimal protocols, such as the number of connected components and its dimensionality. We verify our predictions by introducing a numerical sampling algorithm designed to explore this optimal set via a homotopic stochastic update rule. We apply this new toolbox explicitly to analyze CLPTs in the single- and two-qubit control problems whose landscapes are analytically tractable, and compare the landscapes for bang-bang and continuous protocols. Our work provides the first steps towards a systematic theory of CLPTs and paves the way for utilizing statistical field theory techniques for generic complex control landscapes.</description>

      <title>Parallel-Field Hall effect in ZrTe$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallel-field Hall effect is the appearance of a Hall voltage $V_{\rm H}$ that is transverse to the current $I$ when the magnetic field $B$ is applied parallel to $I$ (i.e. $B \parallel I \perp V_{\rm H}$). Such an effect is symmetry forbidden in most cases and hence is very unusual. Interestingly, the existence of a finite parallel-field Hall effect was reported for the layered topological semimetal ZrTe$_5$ and was proposed to be due to Berry curvature. However, it is forbidden for the known symmetry of ZrTe$_5$ and the possible existence of a misaligned out-of-plane magnetic field was not completely ruled out. Here, we elucidate the existence of the parallel-field Hall effect in ZrTe$_5$ with careful magnetic-field alignment. We interpret this result to originate from symmetry breaking and quantitatively explain the observed parallel-field Hall signal by considering a tilting of the Fermi surface allowed by broken symmetry.</description>

      <title>Notes on solvable models of many-body quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of many body chaotic models related to the Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. An emergent symmetry maps the quantum dynamics into a classical stochastic process. Thus we are able to study many dynamical properties at finite N on an arbitrary graph structure. A comprehensive study of operator size growth with or without spatial locality is presented. We will show universal behaviors emerge at large N limit, and compare them with field theory method. We also design simple stochastic processes as an intuitive way of thinking about many-body chaotic behaviors. Other properties including entanglement growth and other variants of this solvable models are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a short topical review, this article reports progress on the generalization and applications of entanglement in non-Hermitian quantum systems. We begin by examining the realization of non-Hermitian quantum systems through the Lindblad master equation, alongside a review of typical non-Hermitian free-fermion systems that exhibit unique features. A pedagogical discussion is provided on the relationship between entanglement quantities and the correlation matrix in Hermitian systems. Building on this foundation, we focus on how entanglement concepts are extended to non-Hermitian systems from their Hermitian free-fermion counterparts, with a review of the general properties that emerge. Finally, we highlight various applications, demonstrating that entanglement entropy remains a powerful diagnostic tool for characterizing non-Hermitian physics. The entanglement spectrum also reflects the topological characteristics of non-Hermitian topological systems, while unique non-Hermitian entanglement behaviors are also discussed. The review is concluded with several future directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical development in the Quantum Hall effect in monolayer graphene showed that the previous model of the valley-anisotropy interaction is incomplete, as it was assumed to be ultra-short range (USR). In this work, we use exact diagonalization to go beyond the ultra-short range to find the different phases for $\nu=2/3$. We model the interaction as Yukawa so that we can control the range as a proof of concept. Even in this simple setting, we discovered how dropping the USR condition shifts the transition borders in favour of certain phases, leads to a new bond-ordered phase appearing, and breaks the ferromagnetic phase in two competing states as a result of lifting the USR-driven degeneracy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05307v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Novel critical phenomena beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm have been long sought after. Among many candidate scenarios, the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) constitutes the most fascinating one, and its lattice model realization has been debated over the past two decades. Here we apply the spherical Landau level regularization upon the exact (2+1)D SO(5) non-linear sigma model with a topological term to study the potential DQCP therein. We perform density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulation with SU(2)$_\mathrm{spin}\times$U(1)$_\mathrm{charge}\times$U(1)$_\mathrm{angular-momentum}$ symmetries explicitly implemented. Using crossing point analysis for the critical properties of the DMRG data, accompanied by quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we accurately obtain the comprehensive phase diagram of the model and find various novel quantum phases, including N\'eel, ferromagnet (FM), valence bond solid (VBS), valley polarized (VP) states and a gapless quantum disordered phase occupying extended area of the phase diagram. The VBS-Disorder and N\'eel-Disorder transitions are continuous with non-Wilson-Fisher exponents. Our results show the VBS and N\'eel states are separated by either a weakly first-order transition or the disordered region with a multicritical point in between, thus opening up more interesting questions on the two-decade long debate on the nature of DQCP.</description>

      <title>Universal collective Larmor-Silin mode emerging in magnetized correlated Dirac fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we find in magnetized interacting Dirac fermion model, there emerges a new and universal collective Larmor-Silin spin wave mode in the transverse dynamical spin susceptibility. Such mode purely originates from the interaction among Dirac fermions and distinguishes itself from the usual particle-hole continuum with finite lifetime and clear dispersion, both at small and large momenta in a large portion of the Brillouin zone. Our unbiased numerical results offer the dynamic signature of this new collective excitations in interacting Dirac fermion systems, and provide experimental guidance for inelastic neutron scattering, electron spin resonance and other spectroscopic approaches in the investigation of such universal collective modes in quantum Moire materials, topological insulators and quantum spin liquid materials under magnetic field, with quintessential interaction nature beyond the commonly assumed noninteracting Dirac fermion or spinon approximations.</description>

      <title>Continuum excitations in a spin-supersolid on a triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic, thermodynamic, neutron diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering are used to study spin correlations in the easy-axis XXZ triangular lattice magnet K2Co(SeO3)2. Despite the presence of quasi-2D "supersolid" magnetic order, the low-energy excitation spectrum contains no sharp modes and is instead a broad and structured multi-particle continuum. Applying a weak magnetic field drives the system into an m = 1/3 fractional magnetization plateau phase and restores sharp spin wave modes. To some extent, the behavior at zero field can be understood in terms of spin wave decay. However, the presence of clear excitation minima at the M-points of the Brillouin zone suggest that the spinon language may provide a more adequate description, and signals a possible proximity to a Dirac spin liquid state.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall Crystals in Rhombohedral Multilayer Graphene II: General Mechanism and a Minimal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05522v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a minimal "three-patch model" for the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC), a topological electronic state that spontaneously breaks both time-reversal symmetry and continuous translation symmetry. The proposal for this state is inspired by the recently observed integer and fractional quantum Hall states in rhombohedral multilayer graphene at zero magnetic field. There, interaction effects appear to amplify the effects of a weak moir\'e potential, leading to the formation of stable, isolated Chern bands. It has been further shown that Chern bands are stabilized in mean field calculations even without a moir\'e potential, enabling a realization of the AHC state. Our model is built upon the dissection of the Brillouin zone into patches centered around high symmetry points. Within this model, the wavefunctions at high symmetry points fully determine the topology and energetics of the state. We extract two quantum geometrical phases of the non-interacting wavefunctions that control the stability of the topologically nontrivial AHC state. The model predicts that the AHC state wins over the topological trivial Wigner crystal in a wide range of parameters, and agrees very well with the results of full self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations of the rhombohedral multilayer graphene Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Entanglement of Anyonic Systems using the Anyonic Partial Transpose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement of mixed quantum states can be quantified using the partial transpose and its corresponding entanglement measure, the logarithmic negativity. Recently, the notion of partial transpose has been extended to systems of anyons, which are exotic quasiparticles whose exchange statistics go beyond the bosonic and fermionic case. Studying the fundamental properties of this anyonic partial transpose, we first reveal that when applied to the special case of fermionic systems, it can be reduced to the fermionic partial transpose or its twisted variant depending on whether or not a boundary Majorana fermion is present. Focusing on ground state properties, we find that the anyonic partial transpose captures both the correct entanglement scaling for gapless systems, as predicted by conformal field theory, and the phase transition between a topologically trivial and a nontrivial phase. For non-abelian anyons and the bipartition geometry, we find a rich multiplet structure in the eigenvalues of the partial transpose, the so-called negativity spectrum, and reveal the possibility of defining both a charge- and an imbalance-resolved negativity.</description>

      <title>High temperature series expansions of S = 1/2 Heisenberg spin models: algorithm to include the magnetic field with optimized complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents an algorithm for calculating high temperature series expansions (HTSE) of Heisenberg spin models with spin $S=1/2$ in the thermodynamic limit. This algorithm accounts for the presence of a magnetic field. The paper begins with a comprehensive introduction to HTSE and then focuses on identifying the bottlenecks that limit the computation of higher order coefficients. HTSE calculations involve two key steps: graph enumeration on the lattice and trace calculations for each graph. The introduction of a non-zero magnetic field adds complexity to the expansion because previously irrelevant graphs must now be considered: bridged graphs. We present an efficient method to deduce the contribution of these graphs from the contribution of sub-graphs, that drastically reduces the time of calculation for the last order coefficient (in practice increasing by one the order of the series at almost no cost). Previous articles of the authors have utilized HTSE calculations based on this algorithm, but without providing detailed explanations. The complete algorithm is publicly available, as well as the series on many lattice and for various interactions.</description>

      <title>Inelastic neutron scattering on Ce pyrochlores: Signatures of electric monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the pyrochlore spin liquid materials Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ by examining the existing experiments. We continue to rely on the special properties of the dipole-octupole nature of the Ce$^{3+}$ moment. The inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurement in the octupolar U(1) spin liquid selects the (gapped) spinon continuum, and thus has suppressed spectral weights below the energy threshold of two spinon gaps. This measurement, however, includes all other emergent excitations at lower energies in the dipolar U(1) spin liquid, in particular, the gapless photon and the continuum of the electric monopoles. Although the electric monopole continuum is weakly gapped (compared to the larger spinon gap), the energy scale is actually close to the gauge photons, and the spectrum largely overlaps with the photons. Due to the background dual $\pi$ flux for the electric monopoles, the density of states is enhanced at lower energies, creating peak structures. This can be contrasted with the linearly suppressed spectral weight of the gauge photons at low energies. We propose that the electric monopole continuum should be mostly responsible for the low-energy spectrum in the INS measurement in the dipolar U(1) spin liquid. With these understanding and calculation, we discuss the available experimental results and predict further experiments for Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Real and Reciprocal Space Characterization of the 3-Dimensional Charge Density Wave in Quasi-1-Dimensional CuTe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-dimensional materials are susceptible to electronic instabilities such as charge density waves (CDWs), originating from a divergence in the Lindhard electron response function, combined with a finite electron-phonon coupling strength. In this report, we present a detailed characterisation of the CDW in the quasi-one-dimensional material CuTe, including (1) direct visualization of lattice distortion seen with non-contact atomic force microscopy in real space, (2) the out-of-plane momentum dependency of the CDW gap size of the quasi-1-dimensional bands, by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, (3) coherent dynamics of a photoexcited phonon mode seen by time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, with frequency and wavevector q_CDW corresponding to the soft phonon modes predicted by theory. Furthermore, we find that the CDW gap closes through a transient band renormalisation. We thus confirm that, despite the quasi-1D characteristics of CuTe, it hosts inherently 3-dimensional CDWs.</description>

      <title>A tensorial approach to 'altermagnetism'</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I present a tensorial approach to the description of $\vec{k}/-\vec{k}$-symmetric, time-reversal-odd splitting of electronic bands in magnetic materials, which can be of non-relativistic origin and was recently given the name of `altermagnetism'. I demonstrate that tensors provide a general framework to discuss magnetic symmetry using both spin groups and magnetic point groups, which have often been contrasted in recent literature. I also provide a natural classification of altermagnets in terms of the lowest-order tensorial forms that are permitted in each of the 69 altermagnetic point groups. This approach clarifies the connection between altermagnetism and well-known bulk properties, establishing that the vast majority of altermagnetic materials must also be piezomagnetic and MOKE-active, and provides a rational criterion to search for potential altermagnets among known materials and to test them when the magnetic structure is unknown or ambiguous.</description>

      <title>Electric and thermoelectric response for Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals in planar Hall configurations including the effects of strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02318v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the response tensors in planar Hall (or planar thermal Hall) configurations such that a three-dimensional Weyl or multi-Weyl semimetal is subjected to the influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and an effective magnetic field $\mathbf B^{\rm tot}$, which are oriented at a generic angle with respect to each other. The effective magnetic field consists of two parts: (a) an actual/physical magnetic field $\mathbf B $, and (b) an emergent magnetic field $\mathbf B_5 $ which quantifies the elastic deformations of the sample. $\mathbf B_5 $ is an axial pseudomagnetic field because it couples to conjugate nodal points with opposite chiralities with opposite signs. We study the interplay of the orientations of these two components of $\mathbf B^{\rm tot}$ with respect to the direction of the electric field (or temperature gradient) and elucidate how it affects the characteristics involving the chirality of the node. Additionally, we show that the magnitude and sharpness of the conductivity tensor profiles strongly depend on the value of the topological charge at the node in question.</description>

      <title>Exactly Solvable Floquet Dynamics for Conformal Field Theories in Dimensions Greater than Two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find classes of driven conformal field theories (CFT) in d + 1 dimensions with d &gt; 1, whose quench and Floquet dynamics can be computed exactly. The setup is suitable for studying periodic drives, consisting of square pulse protocols for which Hamiltonian evolution takes place with different deformations of the original CFT Hamiltonian in successive time intervals. These deformations are realized by specific combinations of conformal generators with a deformation parameter $\beta$; the $\beta &lt; 1$ ($\beta &gt; 1$) Hamiltonians can be unitarily related to the standard (Luscher-Mack) CFT Hamiltonian. The resulting time evolution can be then calculated by conformal transformations. For $d\leq 3$ we show that the transformations can be obtained in a quaternion formalism. Evolution with such a single Hamiltonian yields qualitatively different time dependences of observables depending on the value of $\beta$, ranging from exponential decays characteristic of heating to oscillations and power law decays. This manifests in the behavior of the fidelity, unequal-time correlator, and the energy density at the end of a single cycle of a square pulse protocol with different hamiltonians in successive time intervals. When the Hamiltonians in a cycle involve generators of a single SU(1, 1) subalgebra we calculate the Floquet Hamiltonian. We show that one can get dynamical phase transitions by varying the time period of a cycle, where the system can go from a non-heating phase which is oscillatory as a function of the time period to a heating phase with an exponentially damped behavior. Our methods can be generalized to other discrete and continuous protocols. We also point out that our results are expected to hold for a broader class of QFTs that possesses an SL(2, C) symmetry with fields that transform as quasi-primaries under this. As an example, we briefly comment on celestial CFTs in this context.</description>

Abstract: We employ holography to investigate Liu-Mezei renormalization group monotones in conformal field theories influenced by massive flavor degrees of freedom. We examine the entanglement entropy of a spherical subregion in three holographic field theories - $\mathcal{N}=1$ Klebanov-Witten theory, $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory, and ABJM theory - with fundamental flavor. The gravity dual of massive unquenched flavor is described by dynamical D-branes, and we solve their backreaction in the smeared approximation. We compute entanglement entropy using the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in these backreacted geometries. Our findings indicate that the Liu-Mezei A- and F-functions decrease monotonically to leading order in the number of flavors across all examples. Additionally, we calculate the leading flavor contribution to entanglement entropy using an alternative probe brane method that does not require knowledge of backreaction in the bulk geometries. These results consistently match with backreacted calculations in all cases, assuming omission of a specific IR boundary term stemming from a total derivative.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the emergence of quantum state designs in systems with symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08949v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum state designs, by enabling an efficient sampling of random quantum states, play a quintessential role in devising and benchmarking various quantum protocols with broad applications ranging from circuit designs to black hole physics. Symmetries, on the other hand, are expected to reduce the randomness of a state. Despite being ubiquitous, the effects of symmetry on quantum state designs remain an outstanding question. The recently introduced projected ensemble framework generates efficient approximate state $t$-designs by hinging on projective measurements and many-body quantum chaos. In this work, we examine the emergence of state designs from the random generator states exhibiting symmetries. Leveraging on translation symmetry, we analytically establish a sufficient condition for the measurement basis leading to the state $t$-designs. Then, by making use of the trace distance measure, we numerically investigate the convergence to the designs. Subsequently, we inspect the violation of the sufficient condition to identify bases that fail to converge. We further demonstrate the emergence of state designs in a physical system by studying the dynamics of a chaotic tilted field Ising chain with translation symmetry. We find faster convergence of the trace distance during the early time evolution in comparison to the cases when the symmetry is broken. To delineate the general applicability of our results, we extend our analysis to other symmetries. We expect our findings to pave the way for further exploration of deep thermalization and equilibration of closed and open quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Fermion Mass Generation without Symmetry Breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the generation of fermion mass in a context where interactions break a discrete chiral symmetry. Then, fermion mass is not protected by a symmetry, no symmetry is broken by the generation of mass, and a vanishing mass no longer enhances a symmetry. We elaborate these scenarios for template fermionic and Yukawa theories in three dimensions where mass can be generated either by fluctuations, strong dynamics, or the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field. We find that fluctuation-induced contributions to fermion mass are parametrically suppressed in the number of fermion flavours $N$. The generation of fermion mass then takes the form of a rapid crossover which turns into a second order quantum phase transition for large $N$, much like in settings with fundamental chiral symmetry. We further discuss theories where fermion mass can be generated spontaneously without breaking any symmetry other than scale symmetry. Implications of our findings are discussed.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Coexistence of Spin States in [Fe-(tpy-ph)$_2$]$^{2+}$ Complexes on Au(111) using ab initio calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07014v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically study the electronic structure and stability of spin states of the [Fe-(tpy-ph)$_2$]$^{2+}$ molecule in both gas phase and on a Au(111) substrate using density functional theory +U (DFT+U) calculations. We find that the stability of the Fe$^{2+}$ ion's spin states is significantly influenced by the Hubbard U parameter. In the gas phase, the low-spin (LS, S=0) state is found to be energetically favorable for U(Fe) $\leq$ 3 eV, whereas the high-spin (HS, S=2) state is stabilized for U(Fe) &gt; 3 eV. Interaction with the Au(111) substrate is found to elevate the critical U for the spin-state transition to 3.5 eV. Additionally, we perform L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) calculations based on time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) for both HS and LS states. The calculated XAS suggests that the HS state more closely aligns with the experimental observations, indicating the potential coexistence of the HS state as the initial state during the X-ray excitation process. These findings enrich our understanding of spin-state dynamics in [Fe-(tpy-ph)$_2$]$^{2+}$.</description>
