      <title>Universal coarsening of a two-dimensional Bose gas under conservative evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase ordering dynamics of a uniform two-dimensional Bose gas quenched to a finite temperature in the superfluid phase. Starting from a defect-rich, far-from-equilibrium state, we model the subsequent evolution with the projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which conserves both energy and particle number. By tuning the initial energy, we control the effective post-quench temperature and examine its role in the equilibration dynamics. We find that the gas exhibits universal behaviour at all temperatures, evidenced by spatio-temporal scaling of correlation functions and power-law growth of the correlation length $\sim t^{1/z}$, with $z$ the dynamical critical exponent. We find $z$ to be temperature dependent, with $z \approx 1.5$ for post-quench temperatures just below the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, and $z \approx 1.9$ for quenches to near-zero temperature. Analysis of the Porod tail of the momentum distribution suggests a temperature-dependent competition between vortices and sound waves in the coarsening process. The two-time correlation function also exhibits universal scaling, decaying as $\sim t^{-\lambda/z}$, with autocorrelation exponent $\lambda$. Near the BKT transition we obtain $\lambda \approx 2$, whereas $\lambda$ is found to diverge as the effective temperature approaches zero.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion from hydrodynamic recoupling in particle-hole symmetric fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In charged fluids obeying particle-hole symmetry, such as the Dirac fluid in graphene, charge transport is diffusive despite the presence of ballistically propagating sound waves: sound waves "hydrodynamically decouple" from the slower charge fluctuations. For quasi-one-dimensional fluids, we show that this symmetry-protected charge diffusion is not smoothly connected to the normal diffusion that arises when momentum conservation is broken by noise (or static impurities). Instead, the charge diffusion constant is a discontinuous function of noise, which (in the weak-noise limit) depends only on the ratio of momentum and energy relaxation rates. In the special limit of momentum-conserving noise (e.g., spatially uniform fluctuations of the Hamiltonian), the diffusion constant diverges in the presence of noise. We describe the resulting superdiffusion in terms of coupled Burgers equations. We present a general mechanism--hydrodynamic recoupling--by which weak noise can induce singular changes in transport coefficients. Our results highlight the limits of zero-noise extrapolation for predicting dynamical quantities like diffusion constants.</description>

      <title>Observation of Shapiro steps in an ultracold atomic Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03340v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current-voltage characteristic of a driven superconducting Josephson junction displays discrete steps. This phenomenon, called the Shapiro steps, forms today's voltage standard! Here, we report the observation of Shapiro steps in a driven Josephson junction in a gas of ultracold atoms. We demonstrate that the steps exhibit universal features, and provide insight into the microscopic dissipative dynamics that we directly observe in the experiment. We find that the steps are directly connected to phonon emission and nucleation of solitonic excitations, whose dynamics we follow in space and time. The experimental results are underpinned by extensive numerical simulations based on classical-field dynamics and may enable metrological and fundamental advances.</description>

      <title>Bosonic quantum Hall droplets in rapidly rotating two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments demonstrate that rapidly rotating Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) near the lowest Landau level can self-organize into interaction-driven persistent quantum Hall droplet arrays. Inspired by this discovery, we investigate the formation and dynamics of single quantum Hall droplet and droplet arrays in rapidly rotating BECs. Guided by a rigorous theorem on localized many-body states for two-dimensional interacting systems in a magnetic field, we construct single quantum Hall droplet and droplet array states which are shown to be stationary solutions to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the rotating frame. The single quantum Hall droplet is shown to be dynamically stable, which underpins its role as the basic unit in a droplet array. The stability of the quantum Hall droplet arrays is demonstrated by their dynamic formation from a phase engineered initial condensate. Our study sheds light onto the nature of the quantum Hall droplet state in a rapidly rotating BEC and offers a new approach for generating and manipulating quantum Hall droplet arrays through designing the initial condensate phase.</description>

      <title>Bloch oscillations of helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in deep optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in deep optical lattice and study the dynamics of Bloch oscillation. We show that the variation of helicoidal gauge potential with spin-orbit coupling is different in zero-momentum and plane-wave phases. The characteristics of Bloch oscillation are different in the two phases. In the zero-momentum phase, the Bloch oscillation is harmonic while it is anharmonic in the plane-wave phase. The amplitude of Bloch oscillation is found to be affected by the helicoidal gauge potential and spin-orbit coupling. We examine that the decay of Bloch oscillation caused by mean-field interaction can be managed by helicoidal spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Optical excitation and stabilization of ultracold field-linked tetratomic molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a coherent optical population transfer of weakly bound field-linked (FL) tetratomic molecules (tetramers) to deeper FL bound states using stimulated Raman adiabatic passage. We consider static-electric-field shielded polar alkali-metal diatomic molecules and corresponding FL tetramers in their $\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$+$\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$ ground electronic state. We show that the excited metastable $\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$+$\textrm{b}^3\Pi$ electronic manifold supports FL tetramers in a broader range of electric fields with collisional shielding extended to zero field. We calculate the Franck-Condon factors between the ground and excited FL tetramers and show that they are highly tunable with the electric field. We also predict photoassociation of ground-state shielded molecules to the excited FL states in free-bound optical transitions. We propose proof-of-principle experiments to implement stimulated Raman adiabatic passage and photoassociation using FL tetramers, paving the way for the formation of deeply bound ultracold polyatomic molecules.</description>

      <title>Lectures on insulating and conducting quantum spin liquids</title>

Abstract: Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the prescient suggestion of P.~W.~Anderson, there were numerous early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations:
  (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and
  (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_\Delta$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)).
  These lecture notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Topological Phase Discovery in Periodically Driven Systems via Floquet-Bloch State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering offers an unparalleled platform for realizing novel non-equilibrium topological phases. However, the unique structure of Floquet systems, which includes multiple quasienergy gaps, poses a significant challenge to classification using conventional analytical methods. We propose a novel unsupervised machine learning framework that employs a kernel defined in momentum-time ($\boldsymbol{k},t$) space, constructed directly from Floquet-Bloch eigenstates. This approach is intrinsically data-driven and requires no prior knowledge of the underlying topological invariants, providing a fundamental advantage over prior methods that rely on abstract concepts like the micromotion operator or homotopic transformations. Crucially, this work successfully reveals the intrinsic topological characteristics encoded within the Floquet eigenstates themselves. We demonstrate that our method robustly and simultaneously identifies the topological invariants associated with both the $0$-gap and the $\pi$-gap across various symmetry classes (1D AIII, 1D D, and 2D A), establishing a robust methodology for the systematic classification and discovery of complex non-equilibrium topological matter.</description>
