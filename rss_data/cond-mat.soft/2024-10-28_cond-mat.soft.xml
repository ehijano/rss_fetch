      <title>Collective behavior of "flexicles"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years the functionality of synthetic active microparticles has edged even closer to that of their biological counterparts. However, we still lack the understanding needed to recreate at the microscale key features of autonomous behavior exhibited by microorganisms or swarms of macroscopic robots. In this study, we propose a model for a three-dimensional deformable cellular composite particle consisting of self-propelled rod-shaped colloids confined within a flexible vesicle - a superstructure we call a "flexicle". Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the collective behavior of dense systems comprised of many flexicles. We show that individual flexicles exhibit shape changes upon collisions with other flexicles that lead to rearrangement of the internal active rods that slow the flexicle motion significantly. This shape deformability gives rise to a diverse set of motility-induced phase separation phenomena and the spontaneous flow of flexicles akin to the migration of cells in dense tissues. Our findings establish a foundation for designing responsive cell-like active particles and developing strategies for controlling swarm migration and other autonomous swarm behaviors at cellular and colloidal scales.</description>

      <title>Irreversible charging caused by energy dissipation from depinning of droplets on polymer surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacial energy dissipation during stick-slip motion of a liquid drop on a non-conductive polymer substrate is shown to lead to an irreversible increase in electrical charge. This previously unobserved phenomenon occurs during surface wetting, in contrast to the previously reported charge separation mechanism that occurs during dewetting. Understanding this electrification mechanism will facilitate the design of energy harvesters and aid the development of risk mitigation strategies for electrostatic buildup in liquid flow across a wide range of industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Topological Rigidity and Non-Abelian defect junctions in chiral nematic systems with effective biaxial symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study topologically stable defect structures in systems where the defect line classification in three dimensions and associated algebra of interactions (the fundamental group) are governed by the non-Abelian 8-element group, the quaternions Q_8. The non-Abelian character of the defect algebra leads to a topological rigidity of bound defect pairs, and trivalent junctions which are the building blocks of multi-junction trivalent networks. We realize such structures in laboratory chiral nematics and analyze their behavior analytically, along with numerical modeling.</description>

      <title>Improving the functionality of non-stretching approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled polymers are an important class of materials for their toughness, processability, and functionalizability. However, physically detailed modeling of highly entangled polymers can prove challenging, especially as one considers additional layers of physical or chemical complexity. To address these challenges, we present a series of generalizations for the useful "non-stretching" approximation, using asymptotic methods to formalize and expand the analysis. First, we rederive the popular non-stretching Rolie Poly model and extend it second order, reintroducing effects from finite chain stretching. Then, we extended the non-stretching framework to other special cases, accounting for flow-induced disentanglement, polydispersity, and reversible scission reactions. Benchmark calculations confirm that non-stretching models derived via systematic asymptotic methods provide excellent and improvable approximations for the rheology of well-entangled polymer constitutive equations with finite-time stretch relaxation dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of Prewetting in Supracritical Fluid Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this communication we demonstrate the existence of a first-order prewetting transition of a supracritical model polymer solution adjacent to an attractive surface. The model fluid we use mimics (qualitatively) an aqueous polyethylene oxide solution and, like the actual solution, displays a closed loop 2-phase region with an upper and lower critical solution temperature. The model fluid is shown to undergo a prewetting transition at an adjacent attractive surface even at temperatures below the lower critical solution temperature (supracriticality). This phenomenon follows from non-local thermodynamics when the lengthscale of the relevant fluid structures of surface films are commensurate or smaller than the range of intermolecular interactions.</description>

      <title>Proper pair potential for mutually interacting point dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dipolar interactions play fundamental role in particle dynamics and structuring in the molecular to colloidal scales, thus being crucial to describing a variety of chemical, physical, and biological phenomena. Here, we derive the pair potential for mutually interacting point dipoles under the action of external fields. The derived relations account for the spatial dependence of the dipole moments thus far missed in the literature. Missing such terms leads to considerable errors as the dipoles are closer and more susceptible.</description>

      <title>A potpourri of results on molecular communication with active transport</title>

Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) is a model of information transmission where the signal is transmitted by information-carrying molecules through their physical transport from a transmitter to a receiver through a communication channel. Prior efforts have identified suitable "information molecules" whose efficacy for signal transmission has been studied extensively in diffusive channels (DC). Although easy to implement, DCs are inefficient for distances longer than tens of nanometers. In contrast, molecular motor-driven nonequilibrium or active transport can drastically increase the range of communication and may permit efficient communication up to tens of micrometers. In this paper, we investigate how active transport influences the efficacy of molecular communication, quantified by the mutual information between transmitted and received signals. We consider two specific scenarios: (a) active transport through relays and (b) active transport through a mixture of active and diffusing particles. In each case, we discuss the efficacy of the communication channel and discuss their potential pitfalls.</description>

      <title>Binding memory of liquid molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the binding dynamics of liquid molecules is of fundamental importance in physical and life sciences. However, nanoscale fast dynamics pose great challenges for experimental characterization. Conventionally, the binding dynamics have been assumed to be memoryless. Here, we integrate large scale computer simulation, scaling theory, and real-time single particle tracking microscopy with high spatiotemporal precision to unveil a universal memory effect in the binding dynamics of liquid molecules. This binding memory can be quantified by a binding time autocorrelation function, whose power-law decay depends not only on the binding affinity, but also on the topological and materials properties of the surrounding environment. Context-dependent biomolecular binding memory is likely exploited by biological systems to regulate biochemical reactions and biophysical processes. Deciphering this binding memory offers a novel strategy to probe complex biological systems and advanced soft materials.</description>

      <title>Armouring of a frictional interface by mechanical noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dry frictional interface loaded in shear often displays stick-slip. The amplitude of this cycle depends on the probability that a microscopic event nucleates a rupture and on the rate at which microscopic events are triggered. The latter is determined by the distribution of soft spots, $P(x)$, which is the density of microscopic regions that yield if the shear load is increased by some amount $x$. In minimal models of a frictional interface - that include disorder, inertia and long-range elasticity - we discovered an 'armouring' mechanism by which the interface is greatly stabilised after a large slip event: $P(x)$ then vanishes at small argument as $P(x)\sim x^\theta$ [1]. The exponent $\theta$ is non-zero only in the presence of inertia (otherwise $\theta=0$). It was found to depend on the statistics of the disorder in the model, a phenomenon that was not explained. Here, we show that a single-particle toy model with inertia and disorder captures the existence of a non-trivial exponent $\theta&gt;0$, which we can analytically relate to the statistics of the disorder.</description>

      <title>Reducing segregation in vibrated binary-sized granular mixtures by excessive small particle introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically examine binary-sized granular mixtures confined between two parallel walls subjected to vertical vibration using the discrete element method. For a size ratio of $3$ between large and small particles, we study the structure of large particles in moderately dense regimes where the combined two-dimensional packing fractions of both particle sizes exceed $1$. When the fraction of small particles is small, segregation of the large particles occurs. In contrast, as the fraction of small particles increases, an effective repulsion between the large particles emerges over distances greater than the large particle diameter, suppressing their segregation. The emergence of reduction in segregation is confirmed for another size ratio, vibrational acceleration, system size, and for a case of bidisperse size distribution. Additionally, at the size ratio of $3$, the effective repulsion induces a hexagonal phase of the large particles at packing fractions lower than in mono-component systems. This work will provide a fresh insight into granular physics, prompting further experimental and theoretical study.</description>

      <title>Local temperature measurement in molecular dynamics simulations with rigid constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constraining molecules in simulations (such as with constant bond lengths and/or angles) reduces their degrees of freedom (DoF), which in turn affects temperature calculations in those simulations. When local temperatures are measured, e.g. from a set of atoms in a subvolume or from velocities in one Cartesian direction, the result can appear to unphysically violate equipartition of the kinetic energy if the local DoF are not correctly calculated. Here we determine how to correctly calculate local temperatures from arbitrary Cartesian component kinetic energies, accounting for general geometric constraints, by self-consistently evaluating the DoF of atoms subjected to those constraints. The method is validated on a variety of test systems, including systems subject to a temperature gradient and those confined between walls. It is also shown to provide a sensitive test for the breakdown of kinetic energy equipartition caused by the approximate nature of numerical integration or insufficient equilibration times. As a practical demonstration, we show that kinetic energy equipartition between C and H atoms connected by rigid bonds can be violated even at the commonly-used time step of 2 fs, and that this equipartition violation appears to usefully indicate configurational overheating.</description>
