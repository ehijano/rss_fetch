      <title>Beyond Diagonal IRS Assisted Ultra Massive THz Systems: A Low Resolution Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The terahertz communications have the potential to revolutionize data transfer with unmatched speed and facilitate the development of new high-bandwidth applications. This paper studies the performance of downlink terahertz system assisted by beyond diagonal intelligent reconfigurable surface (BD-IRS). For enhanced energy efficiency and low cost, a joint precoding and BD-IRS phase shift design satisfying the $1$-bit resolution constraints to maximize the spectral efficiency is presented. The original problem is non-linear, NP-hard, and intricately coupled, and obtaining an optimal solution is challenging. To reduce the complexity, we first transform the optimization problem into two problems and then iteratively solve them to achieve an efficient solution. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach for the BD-IRS assisted terahertz system significantly enhances the spectral efficiency compared to the conventional diagonal IRS assisted system.</description>

      <title>Soley: Identification and Automated Detection of Logic Vulnerabilities in Ethereum Smart Contracts Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern blockchain, such as Ethereum, supports the deployment and execution of so-called smart contracts, autonomous digital programs with significant value of cryptocurrency. Executing smart contracts requires gas costs paid by users, which define the limits of the contract's execution. Logic vulnerabilities in smart contracts can lead to financial losses, and are often the root cause of high-impact cyberattacks. Our objective is threefold: (i) empirically investigate logic vulnerabilities in real-world smart contracts extracted from code changes on GitHub, (ii) introduce Soley, an automated method for detecting logic vulnerabilities in smart contracts, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), and (iii) examine mitigation strategies employed by smart contract developers to address these vulnerabilities in real-world scenarios. We obtained smart contracts and related code changes from GitHub. To address the first and third objectives, we qualitatively investigated available logic vulnerabilities using an open coding method. We identified these vulnerabilities and their mitigation strategies. For the second objective, we extracted various logic vulnerabilities, applied preprocessing techniques, and implemented and trained the proposed Soley model. We evaluated Soley along with the performance of various LLMs and compared the results with the state-of-the-art baseline on the task of logic vulnerability detection. From our analysis, we identified nine novel logic vulnerabilities, extending existing taxonomies with these vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we introduced several mitigation strategies extracted from observed developer modifications in real-world scenarios. Our Soley method outperforms existing methods in automatically identifying logic vulnerabilities. Interestingly, the efficacy of LLMs in this task was evident without requiring extensive feature engineering.</description>

      <title>Barriers facing e-service adopting and implementation at local environment level in Nigeria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: E-Government services offer a great deal of potential to improve government activities and citizen support. However, there is a lack of research covering E-Government services at the local government level, particularly in developing countries. However, implementing successful E-Service technology in this part of the world will not come without its barriers considering the unstable and fragile economies in most developing countries. The research aim is to identify the barriers facing E-Service adoption and implementation at a local environment level, using Nigeria as a case example.
  This thesis adopts an interpretive paradigm and uses action research. It consists of a large field study in Nigeria (interviews), an online survey of government officials, online focus groups, and analyses government documents and E-Service initiatives. A structured literature review method consisted of sifting through 3,245 papers. The main theoretical tools used in this thesis are the diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory and the theory of change.</description>

      <title>Examining the Legal Status of Digital Assets as Property: A Comparative Analysis of Jurisdictional Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the complex legal landscape surrounding digital assets, analysing how they are defined and regulated as property across various jurisdictions. As digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) increasingly integrate with global economies, their intangible nature presents unique challenges to traditional property law concepts, necessitating a re-evaluation of legal definitions and ownership frameworks. This research presents a comparative analysis, reviewing how different legal systems classify and manage digital assets within property law, highlighting the variations in regulatory approaches and their implications on ownership, transfer, and inheritance rights. By examining seminal cases and regulatory developments in major jurisdictions, including the United States, the European Union, and Singapore, this paper explores the emerging trends and potential legal evolutions that could influence the global handling of digital assets. The study aims to contribute to the scholarly discourse by proposing a harmonized approach to digital asset regulation, seeking to balance innovation with legal certainty and consumer protection.</description>

      <title>Dyna-5G: A Dynamic, Flexible, and Self-Organizing 5G Network for M2M Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present Dyna-5G, a dynamic, self-organizing 5G New Radio (5G-NR) network designed for massive Machine-to-Machine (M2M) networks. Traditional 5G NR networks, characterized by their centralized architecture, face challenges in supporting applications that require dynamic, decentralized communication, such as autonomous vehicles and drone swarms for emergency responses. These scenarios often suffer from the centralized model's single point of failure, undermining the reliability required in critical and fully autonomous applications. Dyna-5G addresses these challenges by allowing each device in the network to function as either part of the Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core Network, or as User Equipment (UE), thus maintaining network functionality even when conventional infrastructure components are compromised. Dyna-5G has built-in mechanisms carefully designed specifically for M2M networks, such as failure-recovery and ad-hoc entry and exit. We demonstrate the performance and feasibility of Dyna-5G using a custom-built testbed that simulates real-world missions, demonstrating our network's robustness, adaptability, and failure recovery capabilities. The results indicate that our entire 5G network model can fully re-organize in 6 seconds at maximum, without compromising the mission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An Electronic Health Record (EHR) is an electronic database used by healthcare providers to store patients' medical records which may include diagnoses, treatments, costs, and other personal information. Machine learning (ML) algorithms can be used to extract and analyze patient data to improve patient care. Patient records contain highly sensitive information, such as social security numbers (SSNs) and residential addresses, which introduces a need to apply privacy-preserving techniques for these ML models using federated learning and differential privacy.</description>

      <title>Beyond words and actions: Exploring Multimodal Analytics and Collaboration in the Digital Age</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores Multimodal Analytics' use in assessing communication within agile software development, particularly through planning poker, to understand collaborative behavior. Multimodal Analytics examines verbal, paraverbal, and non-verbal communication, crucial for effective collaboration in software engineering, which demands efficient communication, cooperation, and coordination. The study focuses on how planning poker influences speaking time and attention among team members by utilizing advanced audiovisual data analysis technologies. Results indicate that while planning poker doesn't significantly change total speaking or attention time, it leads to a more equitable speaking time distribution, highlighting its benefit in enhancing equitable team participation. These findings emphasize planning poker's role in improving software team collaboration and suggest multimodal analytics' potential to explore new aspects of team communication. This research contributes to better understanding coordination techniques' impact in software development and team education, proposing future investigations into optimizing team collaboration and performance through alternative coordination techniques and multimodal analysis across different collaborative settings.</description>

      <title>Received Power Maximization Using Nonuniform Discrete Phase Shifts for RISs With a Limited Phase Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To maximize the received power at a user equipment, the problem of optimizing a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with a limited phase range R and nonuniform discrete phase shifts with adjustable gains is addressed. Necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve this maximization are given. These conditions are employed in two algorithms to achieve the global optimum in linear time for R {\ge} {\pi} and R &lt; {\pi}, where R is the RIS phase range. With a total number of N(2K +1) complex vector additions, it is shown for R {\ge} {\pi} and R &lt; {\pi} that the global optimality is achieved in NK or fewer and N(K +1) or fewer steps, respectively, where N is the number of RIS elements and K is the number of discrete phase shifts which may be placed nonuniformly over the phase range R. In addition, we define an intuitive quantization algorithm that we call the nonuniform polar quantization (NPQ) algorithm. With NPQ, we provide a closed form solution for the approximation ratio with which an arbitrary set of nonuniform discrete phase shifts can approximate the continuous solution. We also show that with a phase range limitation, equal separation among the nonuniform discrete phase shifts maximizes the normalized performance. Furthermore, we show that the gain of using K {\ge} 3 with R &lt; {\pi}/2 and K {\ge} 4 with R &lt; {\pi} is only marginal. Finally, we reveal that when R &lt; 2{\pi}/3, ON/OFF selection for the RIS elements brings significant performance compared to the case when the RIS elements are strictly ON.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this white paper, I present my community effort to automatically co-design cheaper, faster and more energy-efficient software and hardware for AI, ML and other popular workloads with the help of the Collective Mind framework (CM), virtualized MLOps, MLPerf benchmarks and reproducible optimization tournaments. I developed CM to modularize, automate and virtualize the tedious process of building, running, profiling and optimizing complex applications across rapidly evolving open-source and proprietary AI/ML models, datasets, software and hardware. I achieved that with the help of portable, reusable and technology-agnostic automation recipes (ResearchOps) for MLOps and DevOps (CM4MLOps) discovered in close collaboration with academia and industry when reproducing more than 150 research papers and organizing the 1st mass-scale community benchmarking of ML and AI systems using CM and MLPerf.
  I donated CM and CM4MLOps to MLCommons to help connect academia and industry to learn how to build and run AI and other emerging workloads in the most efficient and cost-effective way using a common and technology-agnostic automation, virtualization and reproducibility framework while unifying knowledge exchange, protecting everyone's intellectual property, enabling portable skills, and accelerating transfer of the state-of-the-art research to production. My long-term vision is to make AI accessible to everyone by making it a commodity automatically produced from the most suitable open-source and proprietary components from different vendors based on user demand, requirements and constraints such as cost, latency, throughput, accuracy, energy, size and other important characteristics.</description>

      <title>High-quality activation function for applications in neuromorphic photonic chips realized using low-quality nonlinear optical resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated optical devices that can realize a threshold filtration of signals are in demand in photonics. In particular, they play a key role in neuromorphic chips, acting as optical neurons. A list of requirements exist for thresholders to be practically applicable in this context. A value of the threshold, in general, should be independently tunable for each neuron. A sharpness of the corresponding step function should be also dynamically variable, to allow switching between deterministic and stochastic algorithms, for example, in optical Ising machines. Nonlinear ring resonators draw the attention of researchers in this field since they potentially can provide the required type of threshold behavior. Here we suggest the switching mechanism that implements the property of resonators to provide extremely sharp (with respect to the wavelength) $\pi$ phase shifts near the critical coupling regime. Adding a variable source of losses into the resonator, a well controlled broadening of the threshold can be achieved. Sharpness of the step in this case is independent on the quality factor of resonators and corresponding width of resonances. The nonlinear switching mechanism allows to use this feature to construct efficient optical neurons, that operate at small intensities. It also allows to use conventional materials like silicon with a relatively weak Kerr nonlinearity. The obtained results potentially lead the way to fast nonlinear Kerr effect based activation functions that can operate in continuous wave regime.</description>

      <title>Applications of Post-quantum Cryptography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the constantly advancing capabilities of quantum computers, conventional cryptographic systems relying on complex math problems may encounter unforeseen vulnerabilities. Unlike regular computers, which are often deemed cost-ineffective in cryptographic attacks, quantum computers have a significant advantage in calculation speed. This distinction potentially makes currently used algorithms less secure or even completely vulnerable, compelling the exploration of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) as the most reasonable solution to quantum threats. This review aims to provide current information on applications, benefits, and challenges associated with the PQC. The review employs a systematic scoping review with the scope restricted to the years 2022 and 2023; only articles that were published in scientific journals were used in this paper. The review examined the articles on the applications of quantum computing in various spheres. However, the scope of this paper was restricted to the domain of the PQC because most of the analyzed articles featured this field. Subsequently, the paper is analyzing various PQC algorithms, including lattice-based, hash-based, code-based, multivariate polynomial, and isogeny-based cryptography. Each algorithm is being judged based on its potential applications, robustness, and challenges. All the analyzed algorithms are promising for the post-quantum era in such applications as digital signatures, communication channels, and IoT. Moreover, some of the algorithms are already implemented in the spheres of banking transactions, communication, and intellectual property. Meanwhile, despite their potential, these algorithms face serious challenges since they lack standardization, require vast amounts of storage and computation power, and might have unknown vulnerabilities that can be discovered only with years of cryptanalysis.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing is a cutting-edge field of information technology that harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations. It has major implications for the cyber security industry. Existing cyber protection applications are working well, but there are still challenges and vulnerabilities in computer networks. Sometimes data and privacy are also compromised. These complications lead to research questions asking what kind of cyber protection applications of quantum computing are there and what potential methods or techniques can be used for cyber protection? These questions will reveal how much power quantum computing has and to what extent it can outperform the conventional computing systems. This scoping review was conducted by considering 815 papers. It showed the possibilities that can be achievedif quantum technologies are implemented in cyber environments. This scoping review discusses various domains such as algorithms and applications, bioinformatics, cloud and edge computing, the organization of complex systems, application areas focused on security and threats, and the broader quantum computing ecosystem. In each of these areas, there is significant scope for quantum computing to be implemented and to revolutionize the working environment. Numerous quantum computing applications for cyber protection and a number of techniques to protect our data and privacy were identified. The results are not limited to network security but also include data security. This paper also discusses societal aspects, e.g., the applications of quantum computing in the social sciences. This scoping review discusses how to enhance the efficiency and security of quantum computing in various cyber security domains. Additionally, it encourages the reader to think about what kind of techniques and methods can be deployed to secure the cyber world.</description>
