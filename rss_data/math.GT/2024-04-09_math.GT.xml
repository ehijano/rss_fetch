      <title>Finding Fibonacci in the Hyperbolic Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a combinatorial approximation of the hyperbolic plane to investigate properties of hyperbolic geometry such as exponential growth of perimeter and area of disks, and the linear isoperimetric inequality. This calculations give a surprising link to Fibonacci numbers.</description>

      <title>Essential annuli in genus two handlebody exteriors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify all potential configurations of essential annuli in a genus two atoroidal handlebody exterior in the $3$-sphere, building on two recent classifications: the classification of the JSJ-graph of the exterior and the classification of essential annuli in the exterior. In contrast to knots, genus two handlebody exteriors may contain infinitely many non-isotopic essential annuli, due to the JSJ-graph classification. Our main result characterizes the numbers of different types of essential annuli in such an infinite family.</description>

      <title>Directional Invariants of Doubly Periodic Tangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we define novel topological invariants of doubly periodic tangles (DP tangles). DP tangles are embeddings of curves in the thickened plane that are repeated periodically in two directions. We first organize the components of a DP tangle into different it interlinked compounds, which are invariants of a DP tangle. The notion of interlinked compound leads to the classification of DP tangles according to their it directional type. We then prove that the directional type is an invariant of DP tangles using the concept of axis-motif, which can be viewed as the blueprint of a DP tangle.</description>

      <title>Infinite families of standard Cappell-Shaneson spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cappell-Shaneson homotopy 4-spheres (CS spheres) are potential counterexamples of the smooth 4-dimensional Poincar\'e conjecture. Akbulut proved that infinite CS spheres are diffeomorphic to the standard 4-sphere by Kirby calculus. Kim and Yamada found another family of CS spheres which is composed of standard CS spheres. In this paper, we prove more CS spheres are standard. We give 145 new infinite families of CS spheres which are diffeomorphic to the standard 4-sphere.</description>

      <title>The stable crossing number of a twist family of knots and the satellite crossing number conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisting a given knot $K$ about an unknotted circle $c$ a full $n \in \mathbb{N}$ times, we obtain a "twist family" of knots $\{ K_n \}$. Work of Kouno-Motegi-Shibuya implies that for a non-trivial twist family the crossing numbers $\{c(K_n)\}$ of the knots in a twist family grows unboundedly. However potentially this growth is rather slow and may never become monotonic. Nevertheless, based upon the apparent diagrams of a twist family of knots, one expects the growth should eventually be linear. Indeed we conjecture that if $\eta$ is the geometric wrapping number of $K$ about $c$, then the crossing number of $K_n$ grows like $n \eta(\eta-1)$ as $n \to \infty$. To formulate this, we introduce the "stable crossing number" of a twist family of knots and establish the conjecture for (i) coherent twist families where the geometric wrapping and algebraic winding of $K$ about $c$ agree and (ii) twist families with wrapping number $2$ subject to an additional condition. Using the lower bound on a knot's crossing number in terms of its genus via Yamada's braiding algorithm, we bound the stable crossing number from below using the growth of the genera of knots in a twist family. (This also prompts a discussion of the "stable braid index".) As an application, we prove that highly twisted satellite knots in a twist family where the companion is twisted as well satisfy the Satellite Crossing Number Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Sectional Category and the parametrized Borsuk-Ulam property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, for fibrations $p:E\to B$, $p':E'\to B$ over $B$ and a free involution $\tau:E\to E$ which satisfy the equality $p\circ\tau=p$, we discover a connection between the sectional category of the double covers $q:E\to E/\tau$ and $q^Y:F_{p'}(E',2)\to F_{p'}(E',2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ from the $2$-ordered fibre-wise configuration space $F_{p'}(E',2)$ to its unordered quotient $ F_{p'}(E',2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$, and the parametrized Borsuk-Ulam property (PBUP) for the triple $\left((p,\tau);p'\right)$. Explicitly, we demonstrate that the triple $\left((p,\tau);p'\right)$ satisfies the PBUP if the sectional category of $q$ is bigger than the sectional category of $q^{p'}$. This property connects a standard problem in parametrized Borsuk-Ulam theory to current research trends in sectional category. As applictions of our results, we explore the PBUP for $E, E'$ one of the following fibrations: trivial fibration, Hopf fibration and the Fadell-Neuwirth fibration.</description>

      <title>On the topology and combinatorics of decomposable arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A complex hyperplane arrangement $\mathcal{A}$ is said to be decomposable if there are no elements in the degree 3 part of its holonomy Lie algebra besides those coming from the rank 2 flats. When this purely combinatorial condition is satisfied, it is known that the associated graded Lie algebra of the arrangement group $G$ decomposes (in degrees greater than 1) as a direct product of free Lie algebras. It follows that the $I$-adic completion of the Alexander invariant $B(G)$ also decomposes as a direct sum of "local" invariants and the Chen ranks of $G$ are the sums of the local contributions. Moreover, if $B(G)$ is separated, then the degree 1 cohomology jump loci of the complement of $\mathcal{A}$ have only local components, and the algebraic monodromy of the Milnor fibration is trivial in degree 1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a version of Lagrangian Floer homology whose chain complex is generated by the inscriptions of a rectangle into a real analytic Jordan curve. By using its associated spectral invariants, we establish that a rectifiable Jordan curve admits inscriptions of a whole interval of rectangles. In particular, it inscribes a square if the area it encloses is more than half that of a circle of equal diameter.</description>

      <title>Some extensions of the Brouwer fixed point theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the existence of fixed points for continuous maps $f$ from an $n$-ball $X$ in $\mathbb R^n$ to $\mathbb R^n$ with $n\geq 1$. We show that $f$ has a fixed point if, for some absolute retract $Y\subset\partial X$, $f(Y)\subset X$ and $\partial X-Y$ is an $(f, X)$-blockading set. For $n\geq 2$, let $D$ be an $n$-ball in $X$ and $Y$ be an $(n-1)$-ball in $\partial X$. Relying on the result just mentioned, we show the existence of a fixed point of $f$, if $D$ and $Y$ are well placed and behave well under $f$, and ${\rm deg}(f_D)=-{\rm deg}(f_{\partial Y})$, where $f_D=f|D: D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ and $f_{\partial Y}=f|\partial Y: \partial Y \rightarrow \partial Y$. The degree ${\rm deg}(f_D)$ of $f_D$ is explicitly defined and some elementary properties of which are investigated. These results extend the Brouwer fixed point theorem.</description>

Abstract: We show that a conjecture of Putman--Wieland, which posits the nonexistence of finite orbits for higher Prym representations of the mapping class group, is equivalent to the existence of surface-by-surface and surface-by-free groups which do not virtually algebraically fiber. While the question about the existence of such groups remains open, we will show that there exist free-by-free and free-by-surface groups which do not algebraically fiber (hence fail to be virtually RFRS).</description>

      <title>A geometric classification of rod complements in the 3-torus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rod packings are used in crystallography to describe crystal structures with linear or zigzag chains of particles, and each rod packing can be topologically viewed as a collection of disjoint geodesics in the 3-torus. Hui and Purcell developed a method to study the complements of rods in the 3-torus with the use of 3-dimensional geometry and tools from the 3-sphere, and they partially classified the geometry of some families of rod complements in the 3-torus. In this paper, we provide a complete classification of the geometry of all rod complements in the 3-torus using topological arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the kernels of the $\mathrm{SO}(3)$-Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev quantum representations $\rho_p$ of mapping class groups of closed orientable surfaces $\Sigma_g$ of genus $g.$ We investigate the question whether the kernel of $\rho_p$ for $p$ prime is exactly the subgroup generated by $p$-th powers of Dehn twists. We show that if $g\geq 3$ and $p\geq 5$ then $\mathrm{Ker} \, \rho_p$ is contained in the subgroup generated by $p$-th powers of Dehn twists and separating twists, and if $g\geq 6$ and $p$ is a large enough prime then $\mathrm{Ker} \, \rho_p$ is contained in the subgroup generated by the commutator subgroup of the Johnson subgroup and by $p$-th powers of Dehn twists.</description>

      <title>Construction of real algebraic functions with prescribed preimages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nash and Tognoli show that smooth closed manifolds can be the zero sets of some real polynomial maps and non-singular. The canonical projections of spheres naturally embedded in the $1$-dimensional higher Euclidean spaces and some natural functions on projective spaces, Lie groups and their quotient spaces are important examples of real algebraic functions being also Morse. In general, it is difficult to construct such examples of maps and the structures of the manifolds. In addition the maps are hard to understand globally.
  We construct examples by answering to a problem from singularity theory and differential topology. It asks whether we can reconstruct nice smooth functions with prescribed preimages. We have previously given an answer with real algebraic functions. This previous result is one of our key ingredients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the boundary behavior of bounded pluriharmonic functions on the Teichm\"uller space. We will show a version of the Fatou theorem that every bounded pluriharmonic function admits the radial limits along the Teichm\"uller geodesic rays, and a version of the F. and M. Riesz theorem that the radial limit of a non-constant bounded holomorphic function is not constant on any non-null measurable set on the Bers boundary in terms of the pluriharmonic measure. As a corollary, we obtain the non-ergodicity of the action of the Torelli group for a closed surface of genus $g\ge 2$ on the space of projective measured foliations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07612v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the local geometry of dynamical systems $\dot{x}=F(x)$ with real time parameterization, where $F$ is holomorphic on connected open subsets of $\mathbb{C}\stackrel{\sim}{=}\mathbb{R}^2$. We describe the geometry of first-order equilibria. For equilibria of higher orders, we establish an equivalent condition for "definite directions", allowing us to reverse the implication in Theorem 2 of Chapter 2.10 in [Differential equations and dynamical systems, Lawrence Perko (1990)] under the additional condition of holomorphy. This enables the geometric construction of a finite elliptic decomposition. We derive a holomorphic Poincar\'e-Bendixson-type theorem, leading to the conclusion that bounded non-periodic orbits are always homoclinic or heteroclinic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a discrete group acting on a compact Hausdorff space $X$. Given $x\in X$, and $\mu\in\text{Prob}(X)$, we introduce the notion of contraction of $\mu$ towards $x$ with respect to unitary elements of a group von Neumann algebra not necessarily coming from group elements. Using this notion, we study relative commutants of subalgebras in tracial crossed product von Neumann algebras. The results are applied to negatively curved groups and $\text{SL}(d,\mathbb{Z})$, $d \geq 2$.</description>
