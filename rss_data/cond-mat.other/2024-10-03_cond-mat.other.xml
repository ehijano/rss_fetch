      <title>Non-Hermitian ultra-strong bosonic condensation through interaction-induced caging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover a new mechanism whereby the triple interplay of non-Hermitian pumping, bosonic interactions and nontrivial band topology leads to ultra-strong bosonic condensation. The extent of condensation goes beyond what is naively expected from the interaction-induced trapping of non-Hermitian pumped states, and is based on an emergent caging mechanism that can be further enhanced by topological boundary modes. Beyond our minimal model with 2 bosons, this caging remains applicable for generic many-boson systems subject to a broad range of density interactions and non-Hermitian hopping asymmetry. Our novel new mechanism for particle localization and condensation would inspire fundamental shifts in our comprehension of many-body non-Hermitian dynamics and open new avenues for controlling and manipulating bosons.</description>

      <title>Millikelvin Si-MOSFETs for Quantum Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large power consumption of silicon CMOS electronics is a challenge in very-large-scale integrated circuits and a major roadblock to fault-tolerant quantum computation. Matching the power dissipation of Si-MOSFETs to the thermal budget at deep cryogenic temperatures, below 1 K, requires switching performance beyond levels facilitated by currently available CMOS technologies. We have manufactured fully depleted silicon-on-insulator MOSFETs tailored for overcoming the power dissipation barrier towards sub-1 K applications. With these cryo-optimized transistors we achieve a major milestone of reaching subthreshold swing of 0.3 mV/dec at 420 mK, thereby enabling very-large-scale integration of cryo-CMOS electronics for ultra-low temperature applications.</description>

      <title>Graphene MEMS and NEMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene is being increasingly used as an interesting transducer membrane in micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS, respectively) due to its atomical thickness, extremely high carrier mobility, high mechanical strength and piezoresistive electromechanical transductions. NEMS devices based on graphene feature increased sensitivity, reduced size, and new functionalities. In this review, we discuss the merits of graphene as a functional material for MEMS and NEMS, the related properties of graphene, the transduction mechanisms of graphene MEMS and NEMS, typical transfer methods for integrating graphene with MEMS substrates, methods for fabricating suspended graphene, and graphene patterning and electrical contact. Consequently, we provide an overview of devices based on suspended and nonsuspended graphene structures. Finally, we discuss the potential and challenges of applications of graphene in MEMS and NEMS. Owing to its unique features, graphene is a promising material for emerging MEMS, NEMS and sensor applications.</description>

      <title>Four ribbons of double-layer graphene suspending masses for NEMS applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene ribbons with a suspended proof mass for nanomechanical systems have been rarely studied. Here, we report three types of nanomechanical devices consisting of graphene ribbons (two ribbons, four ribbons-cross and four ribbons-parallel) with suspended Si proof masses and studied their mechanical properties. The resonance frequencies and built-in stresses of three types of devices ranged from tens of kHz to hundreds of kHz, and from 82.61 MPa to 545.73 MPa, respectively, both of which decrease with the increase of the size of proof mass. The devices with four graphene ribbons featured higher resonance frequencies and spring constants, but lower built-in stresses than two ribbon devices under otherwise identical conditions. The Young's modulus and fracture strain of double-layer graphene were measured to be 0.34 TPa and 1.13% respectively, by using the experimental data and finite element analysis (FEA) simulations. Our studies would lay the foundation for understanding of mechanical properties of graphene ribbons with a suspended proof mass and their potential applications in nanoelectromechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Humidity Sensing Properties of Different Atomic Layers of Graphene on SiO2/Si Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene has the great potential to be used for humidity sensing due to ultrahigh surface area and conductivity. However, the impact of different atomic layers of graphene on SiO2/Si substrate on the humidity sensing have not been studied yet. In this paper, we fabricated three types of humidity sensors on SiO2/Si substrate based on one to three atomic layers of graphene, in which the sensing areas of graphene are 75 {\mu}m * 72 {\mu}m and 45 {\mu}m * 72 {\mu}m, respectively. We studied the impact of both the number of atomic layers of graphene and the sensing areas of graphene on the responsivity and response/recovery time of the prepared graphene-based humidity sensors. We found the relative resistance change of the prepared devices decreased with the increase of number of atomic layers of graphene under the same change of relative humidity. Further, devices based on tri-layer graphene showed the fastest response/recovery time while devices based on double-layer graphene showed the slowest response/recovery time. Finally, we chose the devices based on double-layer graphene that have relatively good responsivity and stability for application in respiration monitoring and contact-free finger monitoring.</description>
