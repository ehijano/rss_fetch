      <title>Trends and Gender Disparities in Grades and Grade Penalties Among Bioscience and Health-Related Major Students Before, During, and After COVID-19 Remote Instruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate student performance using grades and grade anomalies across periods before, during, and after COVID-19 remote instruction in courses for bioscience and health-related majors. Additionally, we explore gender equity in these courses using these measures. We define grade anomaly as the difference between a student's grade in a course of interest and their overall grade point average (GPA) across all other courses taken up to that point. If a student's grade in a course is lower than their GPA in all other courses, we refer to this as a grade penalty. Students received grade penalties in all courses studied, consisting of twelve courses taken by the majority of bioscience and health-related majors. Overall, we found that both grades and grade penalties improved during remote instruction but deteriorated after remote instruction. Additionally, we find more pronounced gender differences in grade anomalies than in grades. We hypothesize that women's decisions to pursue STEM careers may be more influenced by the grade penalties they receive in required science courses than men's, as women tend to experience larger penalties across all periods studied. Furthermore, institutions concerned with equity should consider grade penalties as a straightforward measure and make a conscious effort to consider their implications.</description>

      <title>Bioscience Students in Physics Courses With Higher Test Anxiety Have Lower Grades on High-Stakes Assessments, and Women Report More Test Anxiety Than Men</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test anxiety is beginning to be recognized as a significant factor affecting student performance in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses, potentially contributing to gender inequity within these fields. Additionally, the management of test anxiety can improve self-efficacy, which is a construct that has been well studied in the physics context. In this study, we investigated the relationship between self-efficacy, test anxiety, and gender differences in performance in a two-semester-long introductory physics course sequence for bioscience students in which women outnumber men. Using validated survey data and grade information from students in a two-semester introductory physics course sequence, we compared the predictive power of self-efficacy and test anxiety on female and male students' performance on both low- and high-stakes assessments. We found that there were gender differences disadvantaging women in self-efficacy and test anxiety in both Physics 1 and Physics 2, as well as gender differences in high-stakes outcomes in Physics 1. There were no gender differences in low-stakes assessment scores. We also found that self-efficacy and test anxiety predicted high-stakes (but not low-stakes) assessment outcomes in both Physics 1 and Physics 2. Comparison of these findings with prior studies involving physical science and engineering students shows that although women outnumber men in physics courses for bioscience students and the career goals of bioscience students are very different from the earlier researched group, most of the negative trends hold even for this new population.</description>

      <title>Capturing the Demon in Szilard's Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Szilard's engine, a demon measures a one-particle gas and applies feedback to extract work from thermal fluctuations, embodying Maxwell's notion that information reduces thermodynamic entropy - an apparent second-law violation. The Landauer-Bennett Thesis resolves this paradox by requiring the demon to record the measurement, which results in an entropy increase in the demon's memory. Eventually, the demon's memory needs to be erased. The erasure costs the same work as extracted previously, hence there is no violation of the second law. Though widely accepted, the fictitious memory invoked in the thesis has drawn multiple criticisms, with debates persisting over the demon's necessity. We show that the demon is the piston that partitions the space and drives the expansion. The final position of the piston after expansion records the particle's position pre-expansion: it is an ``information-bearing degree of freedom''. In this Piston-Demon Thesis, memory register and feedback (expansion) happen simultaneously. Our exposition identifies the mischievous demon as a physical degree of freedom, and greatly simplifies Szilard's engine. It also offers educators a tangible illustration of information-thermodynamics.</description>
