      <title>Synergistic interplay of morphology and metabolic activity rule response to CAR-T cells in B-cell lymphomas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular immunotherapies are one of the mainstream cancer treatments unveiling the power of the patient's immune system to fight tumors. CAR T-cell therapy, based on genetically engineered T cells, has demonstrated significant potential in treating hematological malignancies, including B-cell lymphomas. This treatment has complex longitudinal dynamics due to the interplay of different T-cell phenotypes (e.g. effector and memory), the expansion of the drug and the cytotoxic effect on both normal and cancerous B-cells, the exhaustion of the immune cells, the tumor immunosupressive environments, and more. Thus, the outcome of the therapy is not yet well understood leading to a variety of responses ranging from sustained complete responses, different types of partial responses, or no response at all. We developed a mechanistic model for the interaction between CAR T- and cancerous B-cells, accounting for the role of the tumor morphology and metabolic status. The simulations showed that lesions with irregular shapes and high proliferation could contribute to long term progression by potentially increasing their immunosuppressive capabilities impairing CAR T-cell efficacy. We analyzed 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging data from 63 relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma receiving CAR T-cells, quantifying radiomic features including tumor sphericity and lesion aggressiveness through standardized uptake values (SUV). Statistical analyses revealed significant correlations between these metrics and progression-free survival (PFS), emphasizing that individual lesions with complex morphology and elevated metabolism play a critical role in shaping long-term treatment outcomes. We demonstrated the potential of using data-driven mathematical models in finding molecular-imaging based biomarkers to identify lymphoma patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy having higher risk of disease progression.</description>

      <title>Which Phylogenetic Networks are Level-k Networks with Additional Arcs? Structure and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reticulate evolution gives rise to complex phylogenetic networks, making their interpretation challenging. A typical approach is to extract trees within such networks. Since Francis and Steel's seminal paper, "Which Phylogenetic Networks are Merely Trees with Additional Arcs?" (2015), tree-based phylogenetic networks and their support trees (spanning trees with the same root and leaf set as a given network) have been extensively studied. However, not all phylogenetic networks are tree-based, and for the study of reticulate evolution, it is often more biologically relevant to identify support networks rather than trees. This study generalizes Hayamizu's structure theorem for rooted binary phylogenetic networks, which yielded optimal algorithms for various computational problems on support trees, to extend the theoretical framework for support trees to support networks. This allows us to obtain a direct-product characterization of each of three sets: all, minimal, and minimum support networks, for a given network. Each characterization yields optimal algorithms for counting and generating the support networks of each type. Applications include a linear-time algorithm for finding a support network with the fewest reticulations (i.e., the minimum tier). We also provide exact and heuristic algorithms for finding a support network with the minimum level, both running in exponential time but practical across a reasonably wide range of reticulation numbers.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Control of Evolutionary and Ecological Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Evolutionary Dynamics moves from the realm of theory into application, algorithms are needed to move beyond simple models. Yet few such methods exist in the literature. Ecological and physiological factors are known to be central to evolution in realistic contexts, but accounting for them generally renders problems intractable to existing methods. We introduce a formulation of evolutionary games which accounts for ecology and physiology by modeling both as computations and use this to analyze the problem of directed evolution via methods from Reinforcement Learning. This combination enables us to develop first-of-their-kind results on the algorithmic problem of learning to control an evolving population of cells. We prove a complexity bound on eco-evolutionary control in situations with limited prior knowledge of cellular physiology or ecology, give the first results on the most general version of the mathematical problem of directed evolution, and establish a new link between AI and biology.</description>

      <title>Conditional gene genealogies given the population pedigree for a diploid Moran model with selfing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a stochastic model of a population with overlapping generations and arbitrary levels of self-fertilization versus outcrossing. We study how the global graph of reproductive relationships, or population pedigree, influences the genealogical relationships of a sample of two gene copies at a genetic locus. Specifically, we consider a diploid Moran model with constant population size $N$ over time, in which a proportion of offspring are produced by selfing. We show that the conditional distribution of the pairwise coalescence time at a single locus given the random pedigree converges to a limit law as $N$ tends to infinity. The distribution of coalescence times obtained in this way predicts variation among unlinked loci in a sample of individuals. Traditional coalescent analyses implicitly average over pedigrees and generally make different predictions. We describe three different behaviors in the limit depending on the relative strengths, from large to small, of selfing versus outcrossing: partial selfing, limited outcrossing, and negligible outcrossing. In the case of partial selfing, coalescence times are related to the Kingman coalescent, similar to what is found in traditional analyses. In the case of limited outcrossing, the retained pedigree information forms a random graph, with coalescence times given by the meeting times of random walks on this graph. In the case of negligible outcrossing, which represents complete or nearly complete selfing, coalescence times are determined entirely by the fixed times to common ancestry of diploid individuals in the pedigree.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of respiratory disease hospitalisation forecasts using synthetic outbreak data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forecasts of hospitalisations of infectious diseases play an important role for allocating healthcare resources during epidemics and pandemics. Large-scale analysis of model forecasts during the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the model rank distribution with respect to accuracy is heterogeneous and that ensemble forecasts have the highest average accuracy. Building on that work we generated a maximally diverse synthetic dataset of 324 different hospitalisation time-series that correspond to different disease characteristics and public health responses. We evaluated forecasts from 14 component models and 6 different ensembles. Our results show that component model accuracy was heterogeneous and varied depending on the current rate of disease transmission. Going from 7 day to 14 day forecasts mechanistic models improved in relative accuracy compared to statistical models. A novel adaptive ensemble method outperforms all other ensembles, but is closely followed by a median ensemble. We also investigated the relationship between ensemble error and variability of component forecasts and show that the coefficient of variation is predictive of future error. Lastly, we validated the results on data from the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden. Our findings have the potential to improve epidemic forecasting, in particular the ability to assign confidence to ensemble forecasts at the time of prediction based on component forecast variability.</description>

      <title>Strength and weakness of disease-induced herd immunity in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04700v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a fraction of a population becomes immune to an infectious disease, the population-wide infection risk decreases nonlinearly due to collective protection, known as herd immunity. Some studies based on mean-field models suggest that natural infection in a heterogeneous population may induce herd immunity more efficiently than homogeneous immunization. However, we theoretically show that this is not necessarily the case when the population is modeled as a network instead of using the mean-field approach. We identify two competing mechanisms driving disease-induced herd immunity in networks: the biased distribution of immunity toward socially active individuals enhances herd immunity, while the topological localization of immune individuals weakens it. The effect of localization is stronger in networks embedded in a low-dimensional space, which can make disease-induced immunity less effective than random immunization. Our results highlight the role of networks in shaping herd immunity and call for a careful examination of model predictions that inform public health policies.</description>

      <title>Change of some cropping systems in a long-term trial comparing different systems: rationale and implications for statistical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The project Agriculture 4.0 without chemical synthetical plant protection (NOcsPS) tests a number of cropping systems that avoid the use of chemical synthetical pesticides while at the same time using mineral fertilizers. The experiment started in 2020 (sowing fall 2019). In 2024 (sowing fall 2023), some of the cropping systems were modified. Analysis of this experiment may be done using linear mixed models. In order to include the data from 2020-2023 in joint analyses with the data collected for the modified systems from 2024 onwards, the mixed modelling approach needs to be reconsidered. In this paper, we develop models for this purpose. A key feature is the use of network meta-analytic concepts that allow a combination of direct and indirect comparisons among systems from the different years. The approach is first illustrated using a toy example. This is followed by detailed analyses of data from two the two trials sites Dahnsdorf and Hohenheim.</description>

      <title>Projected Gradient Descent Method for Tropical Principal Component Analysis over Tree Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2019, Yoshida et al. developed tropical Principal Component Analysis (PCA), that is, an analogue of the classical PCA in the setting of tropical geometry and applied it to visualize a set of gene trees over a space of phylogenetic trees which is an union of lower dimensional polyhedral cones in an Euclidean space with its dimension $m(m-1)/2$ where $m$ is the number of leaves. In this paper, we introduce a projected gradient descent method to estimate the tropical principal polytope over the space of phylogenetic trees and we apply it to apicomplexa dataset. With computational experiment against MCMC samplers, we show that our projected gradient descent has a lower sum of tropical distances between observations and their projections on an estimated best-fit tropical polytope compared with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach proposed by Page et al.</description>
