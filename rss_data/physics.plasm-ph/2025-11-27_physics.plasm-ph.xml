      <title>Isotope Production in Muon-Catalyzed-Fusion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Producing valuable isotopes with high-flux high-energy neutrons generated by muon-catalyzed fusion ($\mu$CF) reactions could substantially improve the economic prospects for muon-catalyzed fusion. Because no external heating is required for $\mu$CF, heat flux constraints are significantly relaxed compared with fusion systems requiring external heating. This could allow $\mu$CF to attain much higher neutron flux without breaching material heat flux limits. If muon production rates can be increased, $\mu$CF systems employing transmutation could be viable well before energy breakeven is possible. For $\mu$CF systems transmuting valuable isotopes, the required number of catalyzed fusion events per muon and muon energy generation cost can be relaxed by several orders of magnitude, making $\mu$CF an attractive intense neutron source. We show an example $\mu$CF system with a modest muon rate of $10^8$ muons / second could produce up to 0.5 mg of $^{225}$Ac per year - ten times current global supply - with a 10 gram $^{226}$Ra feedstock. As higher muon rate beams become available, many other radioisotope transmutation pathways become viable. These findings motivate the accelerated development of $\mu$CF systems for neutron-driven isotope production before net energy generation is possible.</description>

      <title>Impact of Cosmic Ray Distribution on the Growth and Saturation of Bell Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) streaming in weakly magnetized plasmas can drive large-amplitude magnetic fluctuations via nonresonant streaming instability (NRSI), or Bell instability. Using one-dimensional kinetic simulations, we investigate how mono-energetic and power-law CR momentum distributions influence the growth and saturation of NRSI. The linear growth is governed solely by the CR current and is largely insensitive to the CR distribution. However, the saturation depends strongly on the CR distribution and is achieved through CR isotropization, which quenches the driving current. Mono-energetic CRs effectively amplify the magnetic field and isotropize. For power-law distributions, the lowest-energy CRs dominate current relaxation and magnetic growth, while the highest-energy CRs remain weakly scattered, limiting their contribution to saturation. In the absence of low-energy CRs, high-energy particles amplify magnetic fields effectively and isotropize. We provide a modified saturation prescription accounting for these effects and propose a layered CR-confinement scenario upstream of astrophysical shocks, relevant to particle acceleration to high energies.</description>

      <title>Towards controlling electron charge with nanoparticle assisted laser wakefield accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores nanoparticle-assisted electron injection as a method for controlling beam charge in laser wakefield acceleration through particle-in-cell simulations. We systematically investigate how the material (Li through Au) and size (50-200 nm) of nanoparticles influence electron injection dynamics and beam charge. Our results demonstrate that beam charge (10-600 pC) can be effectively controlled by adjusting these parameters. We identify a saturation threshold in the nanoparticle electric field strength, beyond which beam charge depends on the total number of atoms in the nanoparticle rather than on the electron density after ionization. Significant electron injection occurs across multiple plasma wave periods with distribution patterns influenced by nanoparticle properties leading to increased beam charge but a broader energy spread. These findings offer practical guidelines for experimental implementation of nanoparticle-assisted injection in laser wakefield accelerators to tailor electron beam characteristics for various applications.</description>

      <title>Energy partitioning in electrostatic discharge with variable series load resistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an experimental investigation into the energy partitioning of quasi-static electrostatic discharge (ESD) events in air, a scenario in which the discharge occurs across a fixed gap. We systematically characterize the energy transferred to a series victim load across a broad range of resistances (0.1 to 10,000Ohm) and circuit parameters, including capacitance and gap length. Our results show that the fraction of stored energy delivered to the victim load is largely independent of gap length. We demonstrate that the classic Rompe-Weizel spark resistance model effectively predicts the scaling of this energy transfer, establishing a clear link between spark resistance and energy partitioning. These findings provide a valuable, predictive framework for guiding safety requirements for sensitive electronic components and energetic materials and will inform the development of more accurate circuit models for ESD events.</description>

      <title>ConStellaration: A dataset of QI-like stellarator plasma boundaries and optimization benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellarators are magnetic confinement devices under active development to deliver steady-state carbon-free fusion energy. Their design involves a high-dimensional, constrained optimization problem that requires expensive physics simulations and significant domain expertise. Recent advances in plasma physics and open-source tools have made stellarator optimization more accessible. However, broader community progress is currently bottlenecked by the lack of standardized optimization problems with strong baselines and datasets that enable data-driven approaches, particularly for quasi-isodynamic (QI) stellarator configurations, considered as a promising path to commercial fusion due to their inherent resilience to current driven disruptions. Here, we release an open dataset of diverse QI-like stellarator plasma boundary shapes, paired with their ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria and performance metrics. We generated this dataset by sampling a variety of QI fields and optimizing corresponding stellarator plasma boundaries. We introduce three optimization benchmarks of increasing complexity: (1) a single objective geometric optimization problem, (2) a "simple-to-build" QI stellarator, and (3) a multi-objective ideal-MHD stable QI stellarator that investigates trade-offs between compactness and coil simplicity. For every benchmark, we provide reference code, evaluation scripts, and strong baselines based on classical optimization techniques. Finally, we show how learned models trained on our dataset can efficiently generate novel, feasible configurations without querying expensive physics oracles. By openly releasing the dataset along with benchmark problems and baselines, we aim to lower the entry barrier for optimization and machine learning researchers to engage in stellarator design and to accelerate cross-disciplinary progress toward bringing fusion energy to the grid.</description>
