      <title>gggenomes: effective and versatile visualizations for comparative genomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective visualization of genomic data is crucial for exploring and interpreting complex relationships within and across genes and genomes. Despite advances in developing dedicated bioinformatics software, common visualization tools often fail to efficiently integrate the diverse datasets produced in comparative genomics, lack intuitive interfaces to construct complex plots and are missing functionalities to inspect the underlying data iteratively and at scale. Here, we introduce gggenomes, a versatile R package designed to overcome these challenges by extending the widely used ggplot2 framework for comparative genomics. gggenomes is available from CRAN and GitHub, accompanied by detailed and user-friendly documentation (https://thackl.github.io/gggenomes).</description>

      <title>Evidence of epigenetic oncogenesis: a turning point in cancer research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cancer research, the term epigenetics was used in the 1970s in its modern sense encompassing non-genetic events modifying the chromatin state, mainly to oppose the emerging oncogene paradigm. However, starting from the establishment of this prominent concept, the importance of these epigenetic phenomena in cancer rarely led to questioning the causal role of genetic alterations. Only in the last 10 years, the accumulation of problematic data, better experimental technologies, and some ambitious models pushed the idea that epigenetics could be at least as important as genetics in early oncogenesis. Until this year, a direct demonstration of epigenetic oncogenesis was still lacking. Now Parreno, Cavalli and colleagues, using a refined experimental model in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, enforced the initiation of tumours solely by imposing a transient loss of Polycomb repression, leading to a purely epigenetic oncogenesis phenomenon. Despite a few caveats that we discuss, this pioneering work represents a major breakpoint in cancer research that leads us to consider the theoretical and conceptual implications on oncogenesis and to search for links between this artificial experimental model and naturally occurring processes, while revisiting cancer theories that were previously proposed as alternatives to the oncogene-centered paradigm.</description>

      <title>GRAMEP: an alignment-free method based on the Maximum Entropy Principle for identifying SNPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Advances in high throughput sequencing technologies provide a huge number of genomes to be analyzed. Thus, computational methods play a crucial role in analyzing and extracting knowledge from the data generated. Investigating genomic mutations is critical because of their impact on chromosomal evolution, genetic disorders, and diseases. It is common to adopt aligning sequences for analyzing genomic variations. However, this approach can be computationally expensive and restrictive in scenarios with large datasets. Results: We present a novel method for identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNA sequences from assembled genomes. This study proposes GRAMEP, an alignment-free approach that adopts the principle of maximum entropy to discover the most informative k-mers specific to a genome or set of sequences under investigation. The informative k-mers enable the detection of variant-specific mutations in comparison to a reference genome or other set of sequences. In addition, our method offers the possibility of classifying novel sequences with no need for organism-specific information. GRAMEP demonstrated high accuracy in both in silico simulations and analyses of viral genomes, including Dengue, HIV, and SARS-CoV-2. Our approach maintained accurate SARS-CoV-2 variant identification while demonstrating a lower computational cost compared to methods with the same purpose. Conclusions: GRAMEP is an open and user-friendly software based on maximum entropy that provides an efficient alignment-free approach to identifying and classifying unique genomic subsequences and SNPs with high accuracy, offering advantages over comparative methods. The instructions for use, applicability, and usability of GRAMEP are open access at https://github.com/omatheuspimenta/GRAMEP</description>
