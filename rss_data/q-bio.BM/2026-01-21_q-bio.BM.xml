      <title>End-to-End Reverse Screening Identifies Protein Targets of Small Molecules Using HelixFold3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying protein targets for small molecules, or reverse screening, is essential for understanding drug action, guiding compound repurposing, predicting off-target effects, and elucidating the molecular mechanisms of bioactive compounds. Despite its critical role, reverse screening remains challenging because accurately capturing interactions between a small molecule and structurally diverse proteins is inherently complex, and conventional step-wise workflows often propagate errors across decoupled steps such as target structure modeling, pocket identification, docking, and scoring. Here, we present an end-to-end reverse screening strategy leveraging HelixFold3, a high-accuracy biomolecular structure prediction model akin to AlphaFold3, which simultaneously models the folding of proteins from a protein library and the docking of small-molecule ligands within a unified framework. We validate this approach on a diverse and representative set of approximately one hundred small molecules. Compared with conventional reverse docking, our method improves screening accuracy and demonstrates enhanced structural fidelity, binding-site precision, and target prioritization. By systematically linking small molecules to their protein targets, this framework establishes a scalable and straightforward platform for dissecting molecular mechanisms, exploring off-target interactions, and supporting rational drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Spatial Omics: From Data Acquisition to Computational Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in spatial omics technologies have enabled the generation of high dimensional molecular data, such as transcriptomes, proteomes, and epigenomes, within their spatial tissue context, either through coprofiling on the same slice or through serial tissue sections. These datasets, which are often complemented by images, have given rise to multimodal frameworks that capture both the cellular and architectural complexity of tissues across multiple molecular layers. Integration in such multimodal data poses significant computational challenges due to differences in scale, resolution, and data modality. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of computational methods developed to integrate multimodal spatial omics and imaging datasets. We highlight key algorithmic principles underlying these methods, ranging from probabilistic to the latest deep learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective fluorescent molecule design with a data-physics dual-driven generative framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing fluorescent small molecules with tailored optical and physicochemical properties requires navigating vast, underexplored chemical space while satisfying multiple objectives and constraints. Conventional generate-score-screen approaches become impractical under such realistic design specifications, owing to their low search efficiency, unreliable generalizability of machine-learning prediction, and the prohibitive cost of quantum chemical calculation. Here we present LUMOS, a data-and-physics driven framework for inverse design of fluorescent molecules. LUMOS couples generator and predictor within a shared latent representation, enabling direct specification-to-molecule design and efficient exploration. Moreover, LUMOS combines neural networks with a fast time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculation workflow to build a suite of complementary predictors spanning different trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and generalizability, enabling reliable property prediction across diverse scenarios. Finally, LUMOS employs a property-guided diffusion model integrated with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, enabling de novo design and molecular optimization under multiple objectives and constraints. Across comprehensive benchmarks, LUMOS consistently outperforms baseline models in terms of accuracy, generalizability and physical plausibility for fluorescence property prediction, and demonstrates superior performance in multi-objective scaffold- and fragment-level molecular optimization. Further validation using TD-DFT and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrates that LUMOS can generate valid fluorophores that meet various target specifications. Overall, these results establish LUMOS as a data-physics dual-driven framework for general fluorophore inverse design.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Generative Models to Distributional Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models frequently suffer miscalibration, wherein statistics of the sampling distribution such as class probabilities deviate from desired values. We frame calibration as a constrained optimization problem and seek the closest model in Kullback-Leibler divergence satisfying calibration constraints. To address the intractability of imposing these constraints exactly, we introduce two surrogate objectives for fine-tuning: (1) the relax loss, which replaces the constraint with a miscalibration penalty, and (2) the reward loss, which converts calibration into a reward fine-tuning problem. We demonstrate that these approaches substantially reduce calibration error across hundreds of simultaneous constraints and models with up to one billion parameters, spanning applications in protein design, image generation, and language modeling.</description>
