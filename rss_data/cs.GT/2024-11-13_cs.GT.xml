      <title>A Survey on Data Markets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data is the new oil of the 21st century. The growing trend of trading data for greater welfare has led to the emergence of data markets. A data market is any mechanism whereby the exchange of data products including datasets and data derivatives takes place as a result of data buyers and data sellers being in contact with one another, either directly or through mediating agents. It serves as a coordinating mechanism by which several functions, including the pricing and the distribution of data as the most important ones, interact to make the value of data fully exploited and enhanced. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of this important and emerging direction from the aspects of data search, data productization, data transaction, data pricing, revenue allocation as well as privacy, security, and trust issues. We also investigate the government policies and industry status of data markets across different countries and different domains. Finally, we identify the unresolved challenges and discuss possible future directions for the development of data markets.</description>

      <title>Strategyproof Learning with Advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important challenge in robust machine learning is when training data is provided by strategic sources who may intentionally report erroneous data for their own benefit. A line of work at the intersection of machine learning and mechanism design aims to deter strategic agents from reporting erroneous training data by designing learning algorithms that are strategyproof. Strategyproofness is a strong and desirable property, but it comes at a cost in the approximation ratio of even simple risk minimization problems.
  In this paper, we study strategyproof regression and classification problems in a model with advice. This model is part of a recent line on mechanism design with advice where the goal is to achieve both an improved approximation ratio when the advice is correct (consistency) and a bounded approximation ratio when the advice is incorrect (robustness). We provide the first non-trivial consistency-robustness tradeoffs for strategyproof regression and classification, which hold for simple yet interesting classes of functions. For classes of constant functions, we give a deterministic and strategyproof mechanism that is, for any $\gamma \in (0, 2]$, $1+\gamma$ consistent and $1 + 4/\gamma$ robust and provide a lower bound that shows that this tradeoff is optimal. We extend this mechanism and its guarantees to homogeneous linear regression over $\mathbb{R}$. In the binary classification problem of selecting from three or more labelings, we present strong impossibility results for both deterministic and randomized mechanism. Finally, we provide deterministic and randomized mechanisms for selecting from two labelings.</description>

      <title>Selling an Item through Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A monopolistic seller aims to sell an indivisible item to multiple potential buyers. Each buyer's valuation depends on their private type and the item's quality. The seller can observe the quality but it is unknown to buyers. This quality information is valuable to buyers, so it is beneficial for the seller to strategically design experiments that reveal information about the quality before deciding to sell the item to whom and at what price.
  We study the problem of designing a revenue-maximizing mechanism that allows the seller to disclose information and sell the item. First, we recast the revelation principle to our setting, showing that the seller can focus on one-round mechanisms without loss of generality. We then formulate the mechanism design problem as an optimization problem and derive the optimal solution in closed form. The optimal mechanism includes a set of experiments and payment functions. After eliciting buyers' types, the optimal mechanism asks a buyer to buy and sets a price accordingly. The optimal information structure involves partitioning the quality space. Additionally, we show that our results can be extended to a broader class of distributions and valuation functions.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Fusion Balancing Through Game-Theoretic Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning can complete the picture of information extraction by uncovering key dependencies between data sources. However, current systems fail to fully leverage multiple modalities for optimal performance. This has been attributed to modality competition, where modalities strive for training resources, leaving some underoptimized. We show that current balancing methods struggle to train multimodal models that surpass even simple baselines, such as ensembles. This raises the question: how can we ensure that all modalities in multimodal training are sufficiently trained, and that learning from new modalities consistently improves performance? This paper proposes the Multimodal Competition Regularizer (MCR), a new loss component inspired by mutual information (MI) decomposition designed to prevent the adverse effects of competition in multimodal training. Our key contributions are: 1) Introducing game-theoretic principles in multimodal learning, where each modality acts as a player competing to maximize its influence on the final outcome, enabling automatic balancing of the MI terms. 2) Refining lower and upper bounds for each MI term to enhance the extraction of task-relevant unique and shared information across modalities. 3) Suggesting latent space permutations for conditional MI estimation, significantly improving computational efficiency. MCR outperforms all previously suggested training strategies and is the first to consistently improve multimodal learning beyond the ensemble baseline, clearly demonstrating that combining modalities leads to significant performance gains on both synthetic and large real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Factorised Active Inference for Strategic Multi-Agent Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how individual agents make strategic decisions within collectives is important for advancing fields as diverse as economics, neuroscience, and multi-agent systems. Two complementary approaches can be integrated to this end. The Active Inference framework (AIF) describes how agents employ a generative model to adapt their beliefs about and behaviour within their environment. Game theory formalises strategic interactions between agents with potentially competing objectives. To bridge the gap between the two, we propose a factorisation of the generative model whereby each agent maintains explicit, individual-level beliefs about the internal states of other agents, and uses them for strategic planning in a joint context. We apply our model to iterated general-sum games with 2 and 3 players, and study the ensemble effects of game transitions, where the agents' preferences (game payoffs) change over time. This non-stationarity, beyond that caused by reciprocal adaptation, reflects a more naturalistic environment in which agents need to adapt to changing social contexts. Finally, we present a dynamical analysis of key AIF quantities: the variational free energy (VFE) and the expected free energy (EFE) from numerical simulation data. The ensemble-level EFE allows us to characterise the basins of attraction of games with multiple Nash Equilibria under different conditions, and we find that it is not necessarily minimised at the aggregate level. By integrating AIF and game theory, we can gain deeper insights into how intelligent collectives emerge, learn, and optimise their actions in dynamic environments, both cooperative and non-cooperative.</description>

      <title>Safe Exploitative Play with Untrusted Type Beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combination of the Bayesian game and learning has a rich history, with the idea of controlling a single agent in a system composed of multiple agents with unknown behaviors given a set of types, each specifying a possible behavior for the other agents. The idea is to plan an agent's own actions with respect to those types which it believes are most likely to maximize the payoff. However, the type beliefs are often learned from past actions and likely to be incorrect. With this perspective in mind, we consider an agent in a game with type predictions of other components, and investigate the impact of incorrect beliefs to the agent's payoff. In particular, we formally define a tradeoff between risk and opportunity by comparing the payoff obtained against the optimal payoff, which is represented by a gap caused by trusting or distrusting the learned beliefs. Our main results characterize the tradeoff by establishing upper and lower bounds on the Pareto front for both normal-form and stochastic Bayesian games, with numerical results provided.</description>

Abstract: A principal uses payments conditioned on stochastic outcomes of a team project to elicit costly effort from the team members. We develop a multi-agent generalization of a classic first-order approach to contract optimization by leveraging methods from network games. The main results characterize the optimal allocation of incentive pay across agents and outcomes. Incentive optimality requires equalizing, across agents, a product of (i) individual productivity (ii) organizational centrality and (iii) responsiveness to monetary incentives.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Collusion And The Minimum Price Markov Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Minimum Price Markov Game (MPMG), a theoretical model that reasonably approximates real-world first-price markets following the minimum price rule, such as public auctions. The goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a framework to study market fairness and regulation in both digitized and non-digitized public procurement processes, amid growing concerns about algorithmic collusion in online markets. Using multi-agent reinforcement learning-driven artificial agents, we demonstrate that (i) the MPMG is a reliable model for first-price market dynamics, (ii) the minimum price rule is generally resilient to non-engineered tacit coordination among rational actors, and (iii) when tacit coordination occurs, it relies heavily on self-reinforcing trends. These findings contribute to the ongoing debate about algorithmic pricing and its implications.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Voter Relevance in Facility Location Games with Tree-Shaped Invitation Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion mechanism design, which investigate how to incentivise agents to invite as many colleagues to a multi-agent decision making as possible, is a new research paradigm at the intersection between microeconomics and computer science. In this paper we extend traditional facility location games into the model of diffusion mechanism design. Our objective is to completely understand to what extent of anonymity/voter-relevance we can achieve, along with strategy-proofness and Pareto efficiency when voters strategically invite collegues. We define a series of anonymity properties applicable to the diffusion mechanism design model, as well as parameterized voter-relevance properties for guaranteeing reasonably-fair decision making. We obtained two impossibility theorems and two existence theorems, which partially answer the question we have raised in the beginning of the paper</description>

      <title>Designing Equilibria in Concurrent Games with Social Welfare and Temporal Logic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03045v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In game theory, mechanism design is concerned with the design of incentives so that a desired outcome of the game can be achieved. In this paper, we explore the concept of equilibrium design, where incentives are designed to obtain a desirable equilibrium that satisfies a specific temporal logic property. Our study is based on a framework where system specifications are represented as temporal logic formulae, games as quantitative concurrent game structures, and players' goals as mean-payoff objectives. We consider system specifications given by LTL and GR(1) formulae, and show that designing incentives to ensure that a given temporal logic property is satisfied on some/every Nash equilibrium of the game can be achieved in PSPACE for LTL properties and in NP/{\Sigma}P 2 for GR(1) specifications. We also examine the complexity of related decision and optimisation problems, such as optimality and uniqueness of solutions, as well as considering social welfare, and show that the complexities of these problems lie within the polynomial hierarchy. Equilibrium design can be used as an alternative solution to rational synthesis and verification problems for concurrent games with mean-payoff objectives when no solution exists or as a technique to repair concurrent games with undesirable Nash equilibria in an optimal way.</description>

      <title>Game-theoretic LLM: Agent Workflow for Negotiation Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the rationality of large language models (LLMs) in strategic decision-making contexts, specifically within the framework of game theory. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs across a spectrum of complete-information and incomplete-information games. Our findings reveal that LLMs frequently deviate from rational strategies, particularly as the complexity of the game increases with larger payoff matrices or deeper sequential trees.
  To address these limitations, we design multiple game-theoretic workflows that guide the reasoning and decision-making processes of LLMs. These workflows aim to enhance the models' ability to compute Nash Equilibria and make rational choices, even under conditions of uncertainty and incomplete information. Experimental results demonstrate that the adoption of these workflows significantly improves the rationality and robustness of LLMs in game-theoretic tasks. Specifically, with the workflow, LLMs exhibit marked improvements in identifying optimal strategies, achieving near-optimal allocations in negotiation scenarios, and reducing susceptibility to exploitation during negotiations. Furthermore, we explore the meta-strategic considerations of whether it is rational for agents to adopt such workflows, recognizing that the decision to use or forgo the workflow constitutes a game-theoretic issue in itself.
  Our research contributes to a deeper understanding of LLMs' decision-making capabilities in strategic contexts and provides insights into enhancing their rationality through structured workflows. The findings have implications for the development of more robust and strategically sound AI agents capable of navigating complex interactive environments.
