      <title>Graded Contact Geometry and the AKSZ Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AKSZ formalism is a construction of topological field theories where the target spaces are differential graded symplectic manifolds. In this paper, we describe an analogue of the AKSZ formalism where the target spaces are differential graded contact manifolds. We show that the space of fields inherits a weak contact structure, and we construct a solution to the analogue of the classical master equation, defined via the Jacobi bracket. In the $n=1$ case, we recover the Jacobi sigma model, and in the $n=2$ case, we obtain three-dimensional topological field theories associated to Courant-Jacobi algebroids.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of $b$-$6j$ symbols and anti-de Sitter tetrahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotics of the $6j$-symbols for the principal series of the modular double of $\mathrm U_q\mathfrak{sl}(2;\mathbb R)$, and of their analytic extension -- what we call the $b$-$6j$ symbols, relating them in various cases to the volume of truncated hyperideal tetrahedra in the hyperbolic and the anti-de Sitter geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the anti-de Sitter geometry appears in the asymptotics of quantum invariants. In addition, based on the connection to conformal field theory, we reveal a correspondence between the edge lengths and the dihedral angles of truncated hyperideal anti-de Sitter tetrahedra and the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates of hyperbolic four-holed spheres. We also provide a concrete instance of $3D/2D$ holography, in the spirit of the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>A novel third-order accurate and stable scheme for micromagnetic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity numerical simulation serves as a cornerstone for exploring magnetization dynamics in micromagnetics. This work introduces a novel third-order temporally accurate and stable numerical scheme for the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, aiming to address the limitations in accuracy and efficiency often encountered with conventional approaches. Validation via nanostrip simulations confirms two principal advantages of the proposed method: it attains strict third-order temporal accuracy, surpassing many current techniques, and it offers superior computational efficiency, enabling rapid convergence without sacrificing numerical precision. For Gilbert damping coefficients $\alpha$ ranging from $0.1$ to values below $10$, the scheme preserves strong stability and effectively avoids non-physical magnetization states. The magnetic microstructures predicted by this method are in excellent agreement with those from established benchmark methods, affirming its reliability for quantitative physical analysis. Salient distinctions between the proposed scheme and an existing third-order semi-implicit method include:
  (1) Solving the linear system associated with the existing scheme demands substantially greater computational time, underscoring the need for highly efficient solvers;
  (2) Although the proposed method shows increased sensitivity to damping parameters, it reliably converges to stable physical states and is effective in simulating magnetic domain wall motion, producing outcomes consistent with prior validated studies;
  (3) The energy levels computed by the proposed method are significantly lower than those obtained via the existing third-order scheme.</description>

      <title>New quasi-exatly solvable systems from SUSYQM and Bethe Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a systematic construction of new quasi-exactly solvable systems via Bethe ansatz and supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSYQM). Methods based on the intertwining of supercharges have been extensively used in the literature for exactly solvable systems. We generalize the state-deleting (Krein-Adler) supersymmetric transformations to quasi-exactly exactly solvable (QES) systems building on the Bethe ansatz method and related Bethe roots. This enables us to construct superpartners for a wide class of known QES systems classified previously through a hidden $sl(2)$ algebra. We present our constructions of factorizations and intertwining relations related to 1st-order SUSYQM and the $n=1$ state for 10 nonequivalent types, denoted I,...,X. In order to have a unified treatment we rely on their ODE standard form as this is also the appropriate setting to obtain the Bethe ansatz equations which constrain the polynomial solutions. This setting also allows one to deal with systems with $n$ states in a unified manner, using analysis based on the Bethe ansatz equations to build the supersymmetric transformations in terms of the Bethe ansatz roots. We derive the Schr\"odinger potentials for the $n=1$ superpartners of the 10 QES cases and give closed-form solutions for the spectra and wavefunctions of the corresponding QES SUSYQM systems. Furthermore, we present numerical results for higher excited states up to the $n=10$ level. The results obtained may have wider applicability as our framework is built on ODEs with polynomial coefficients.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Antiferromagnetic Order in the AKLT Model on Trees and Treelike Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the result of Fannes, Nachtergaele, and Werner on long-range order in the AKLT model on Cayley trees to include various trees and tree-like graphs that obey certain conditions. Our examples split into three cases: Cayley-like tree-like graphs generated by a finite subgraph, for which we have a simple condition; arbitrary trees with a prescribed growth rate of their volume; and bilayer Cayley trees.</description>

      <title>Sector theory of Levin-Wen models I : Classification of Anyon Sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the irreducible anyon sectors of Levin-Wen models over an arbitrary unitary fusion category $\mathcal{C}$, showing that they are in one-to-one correspondence with equivalence classes of simple objects of the Drinfeld center $Z(\mathcal{C})$. We achieve this by making explicit how the Levin-Wen Hamiltonian stabilizes subspaces isomorphic to state spaces of the corresponding Turaev-Viro TQFT, and developing a detailed understanding of these state spaces on punctured disks. In particular, we construct Drinfeld insertion operators on such spaces which can move anyons between the punctures, and can change their fusion channels. Using these Drinfeld insertions, we construct explicit string operators that excite anyons above the ground state. The fusion and braiding properties of these anyons will be analysed in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Spectral Density and Eigenvector Nonorthogonality in Complex Symmetric Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian random matrices with statistical spectral characteristics beyond the standard Ginibre ensembles have recently emerged in the description of dissipative quantum many-body systems as well as in non-ergodic wave transport in complex media. We investigate the class AI$^\dag$ of complex symmetric random matrices, for which available analytic results remain scarce. Using a recently proposed framework by one of the authors, we analyze this class for Gaussian entries and derive an explicit, closed-form expression for the joint distribution of a complex eigenvalue and its right eigenvector for arbitrary matrix size $N\ge 2$ in the entire complex plane. From this, we obtain the distribution of the eigenvector non-orthogonality overlap and the mean eigenvalue density, both for finite $N$ and in the large-$N$ limit. Notably, at the spectral edge both the eigenvalue density and eigenvector statistics exhibits a limiting behavior that differs from the Ginibre universtality class. This behavior is expected to be universal, as further supported by numerical evidence for Bernoulli random matrices.</description>

      <title>A Fractional Variational Approach to Spectral Filtering Using the Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interference of fluorescence signals and noise remains a significant challenge in Raman spectrum analysis, often obscuring subtle spectral features that are critical for accurate analysis. Inspired by variational methods similar to those used in image denoising, our approach minimizes a functional involving fractional derivatives to balance noise suppression with the preservation of essential chemical features of the signal, such as peak position, intensity, and area. The original problem is reformulated in the frequency domain through the Fourier transform, making the implementation simple and fast. In this work, we discuss the theoretical framework, practical implementation, and the advantages and limitations of this method in the context of {simulated} Raman data, as well as in image processing. The main contribution of this article is the combination of a variational approach in the frequency domain, the use of fractional derivatives, and the optimization of the {regularization parameter and} derivative order through the concept of Shannon entropy. This work explores how the fractional order, combined with the regularization parameter, affects noise removal and preserves the essential features of the spectrum {and image}. Finally, the study shows that the combination of the proposed strategies produces an efficient, robust, and easily implementable filter.</description>

      <title>Hybrid coupling with operator inference and the overlapping Schwarz alternating method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid approach for coupling subdomain-local non-intrusive Operator Inference (OpInf) reduced order models (ROMs) with each other and with subdomain-local high-fidelity full order models (FOMs) with using the overlapping Schwarz alternating method (O-SAM). The proposed methodology addresses significant challenges in multiscale modeling and simulation, particularly the long runtime and complex mesh generation requirements associated with traditional high-fidelity simulations. By leveraging the flexibility of O-SAM, we enable the seamless integration of disparate models, meshes, and time integration schemes, enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach is demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments on complex three-dimensional (3D) solid dynamics problems, showcasing speedups of up to 106x compared to conventional FOM-FOM couplings. This work paves the way for more efficient simulation workflows in engineering applications, with potential extensions to a wide range of partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>The canonical symmetry reduction of string backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String backgrounds, defined here as metric connections with skew-symmetric torsion and reduced holonomy, yield generalized Ricci solitons relative to the Lee vector field. By a variational argument using the string action, they are also gradient generalized Ricci solitons relative to a potential function. These two observations combine to yield a canonical symmetry, and in this work we derive fundamental features of the transverse geometry, and rigidity phenomena. We prove in a unified conceptual fashion that the transverse geometry satisfies the string generalized Ricci soliton equations (a simplified Hull-Strominger system) in many settings including almost Hermitian, almost contact, $SU(3)$, $G_2$, and $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$ geometry. We also show that the transverse geometry is always conformally co-closed, with the conformal factor given by the associated soliton potential.</description>

      <title>Exact WKB in all sectors II: Potentials with non-degenerate saddles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the exact quantization of general one-dimensional potentials in view of the exact-WKB formalism. Building on our previous work, we perform analytic continuations across different sectors via the complexification to the spectral (energy) parameter $u$ and identify continuous and discontinuous transitions of the exact spectrum for generic potentials. When the transition is discontinuous, it is characterized by the Stokes phenomena, inducing different exact (median) quantization conditions, thereby distinct trans-series structures valid in different sectors. We analyze two illustrative examples, namely asymmetric triple-well (ATW) and tilted double-well (TDW), and verify the general qualitative analysis by deriving exact (median) quantization conditions in each sector. Moreover, by obtaining the trans-series solutions for each system, we identify bion/bounce configurations and show that the trans-series of ATW is organized in accordance with the cluster expansion of the bion gas and there should exist a previously neglected complex saddle in the TDW system. These identifications further strengthen the link between path integral and exact-WKB formalisms, while also demonstrating the predictive power of the latter. In parallel, for the P-NP relations of genus-1 systems, we derive transformation rules between any perturbative and non-perturbative pair of WKB-cycles. Our results show that the entire resurgence data of a genus-1 system transforms only by the change of classical parameters, i.e. frequencies and bion/bounce actions, and the perturbative energy series. This also reveals the underlying reasons of the previously found $S$-duality transformations.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Coupled Mode Model for Fiber Laser Amplifiers as an Averaged Dynamical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply a known theorem for simplifying dynamical systems with bounded error to a specific optical fiber waveguide problem, supplementing the physical intuition and heuristics used in the optics community with proper mathematical justification. Using techniques from averaging theory of dynamical systems, a reliable accelerated model based on the coupled mode theory (CMT) approach for a common fiber laser amplifier application is derived. Computational testing reveals that this accelerated model achieves an ${\sim}4000$x increase in computational speed compared to the CMT model while preserving a high accuracy in key figures-of-merit such as output power and amplification efficiency. Further, we argue that by adopting our recommended approximations within the reduced model framework enables the model to be applied a wider set of amplifier types and configurations than can the current (comparable) reduced models found in the literature.</description>

      <title>First-order buoyancy correction of modal instabilities in stratified boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a perturbation-based framework that captures buoyancy effects on modal instabilities in stratified boundary-layer flows within the fully compressible, non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq formulation. Treating the Richardson number as a small parameter and recasting the stability problem into an adjoint-residual form, we derive a first-order correction for the eigenvalues using only the neutrally buoyant eigenvalue problem. This eliminates the need to re-solve the eigenvalue problem at each stratification level. For ideal-gas boundary layers, the framework accurately predicts how stable and unstable stratification modifies Tollmien-Schlichting waves, from growth rates and eigenfunctions to $N$-factors, holding across a wide range of Prandtl numbers, temperature ratios, and Mach numbers. Notably, the buoyancy sensitivity varies strongly with Prandtl number, revealing that for a given Richardson number, buoyancy can switch from destabilising to stabilising depending on the fluid. Beyond ideal-gas conditions, we apply the first-order buoyancy correction to strongly stratified boundary layers with supercritical fluids, where the phase relationship between density and velocity perturbations determines whether buoyancy stabilises or destabilises the underlying instability. The resulting $N$-factors demonstrate, for the first time, that buoyancy significantly affects transition predictions under pseudo-boiling conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the TFT construction of CFT correlators of [arXiv:hep-th/0204148] to so-called finite logarithmic CFTs for which the algebraic input data is no longer semisimple but still finite. More specifically, starting from the data of a chiral CFT given in the form of a not necessarily semisimple modular tensor category C we use a three dimensional topological field theory with surface defects based on the surgery TFT of [arXiv:1912.02063] to construct a full CFT as a braided monoidal oplax natural transformation.
  We make our construction explicit in the example of the transparent surface defect, resulting in the so-called Cardy case. In particular, we consider topological line defects and their action on bulk fields in these logarithmic CFTs, providing a source of examples for non-invertible and non-semisimple topological symmetries.</description>

Abstract: Let $u$ be a solution of $\Delta u=Vu$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $V$ be continuous, nonnegative and bounded. We prove that the condition $$\int_{r_j\leq|x|\leq r_j+1}|u(x)|^2dx\to 0,$$ along any sequence $(r_j)$, $r_j\nearrow+\infty$, implies $u\equiv 0$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$. In particular, this implies the Landis conjecture for solutions satisfying a sufficiently fast algebraic decay. These results are generalized to exterior domains as well as for a class of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations under suitable conditions on the zero set of the potential.</description>

      <title>A Dynamics-Informed Gaussian Process Framework for 2D Stochastic Navier-Stokes via Quasi-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent proof of quasi-Gaussianity for the 2D stochastic Navier--Stokes (SNS) equations by Coe, Hairer, and Tolomeo establishes that the system's unique invariant measure is equivalent (mutually absolutely continuous) to the Gaussian measure of its corresponding linear Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (OU) process. While Gaussian process (GP) frameworks are increasingly used for fluid dynamics, their priors are often chosen for convenience rather than being rigorously justified by the system's long-term dynamics.
  In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a probabilistic framework for 2D SNS built directly upon this theoretical foundation. We construct our GP prior precisely from the stationary covariance of the linear OU model, which is explicitly defined by the forcing spectrum and dissipation. This provides a principled, GP prior with rigorous long-time dynamical justification for turbulent flows, bridging SPDE theory and practical data assimilation.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Fragment of Physical Propositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a proof-theoretic analysis of the Operational Standard of Matsas, Pleitez, Saa, Vanzella (2024) showing that admissible measurement in Minkowski Spacetime yields only finite observational sequences and thereby restricts the class of physically meaningful propositions to those admitting terminating extraction procedures or uniform stability conditions. These correspond exactly to the arithmetical fragment $\Sigma^0_1 \cup \Pi^0_2$, and the induced realizability structure interprets $\Delta_0$ Heyting Arithmetic on the code of observational data. A diagonal argument then establishes an operational form of incompleteness: there exist true arithmetical propositions about admissible extraction that no sound, recursively axiomatizable theory of spacetime can decide. The result is structurally analogous to classical incompleteness but arises from the evidential limits of measurement rather than from ontological assumptions.</description>

      <title>Deriving the Generalised Born Rule from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A basic postulate of modern compositional approaches to generalised physical theories is the generalised Born rule, in which probabilities are postulated to be computable from the composition of states and effects. In this paper we consider whether this postulate, and the strength of the identification between scalars and probabilities, can be argued from basic principles. To this end, we first consider the most naive possible process-theoretic interpretation of textbook quantum theory, in which physical processes (unitaries) along with states and effects (kets and bras) and a probability function from states and effects satisfying just some basic compatibility axioms are identified. We then show that any process theory equipped with such structure is equivalent to an alternative process theory in which the generalised Born rule holds. We proceed to consider introduction of noise into any such theory, and observe that the result of doing so is a strengthening of the identification between scalars and probabilities; from bare monoid homomorphisms to semiring isomorphisms.</description>

      <title>From double-scaled SYK correlators to Weil-Petersson volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Okuyama introduced a family of polynomials, whose coefficients depend on a parameter $q$, in his study of correlators in the double-scaled SYK model. He verified in small cases that their coefficients can be expressed in terms of certain $q$-zeta values and that the polynomials recover the Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces studied by Mirzakhani under a certain $q \to 1$ limit. In this paper, we provide mathematically rigorous proofs of these two phenomena. The authors previously defined natural $q$-deformations of the Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces of curves. We prove that these polynomials appear as the top degree part of Okuyama's polynomials. Our work provides a link between the two topics of the title, which hints at a ``quantum'' Weil-Petersson geometry and a combinatorial-geometric approach to double-scaled SYK correlators.</description>

      <title>Polynomials of the Askey scheme as Clebsch-Gordan coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a semi-simple algebra equipped with a coproduct, the Clebsch--Gordan coefficients are the elements of the transition matrices between direct product representation and its irreducible decomposition. It is well known that the Clebsch--Gordan coefficients of the Lie algebra $sl_2$ are given in terms of the dual Hahn polynomials. Taking the reversed point of view, we show that any finite dimensional family of polynomials belonging to the Askey scheme can be interpreted as Clebsch--Gordan coefficients of an algebra. The Hahn polynomials are thus associated to the oscillator algebra with the Krawtchouk polynomials treated through a limit. The dual Hahn polynomials and Racah polynomials are seen to be associated to $sl_2$ with a more general coproduct than the standard one. The $q$-Hahn polynomials are interpreted as Clebsch--Gordan coefficients of a $q$-deformation of the oscillator algebra and the $q$-Racah polynomials are seen to be connected in this way to $U_q(sl_2)$ with a generalized coproduct.</description>

      <title>Polychromatic Localized Waves with Complex Frequencies in Nonlinear Maxwell Equations with Material Dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the existence of polychromatic solutions of cubically nonlinear Maxwell equations in the whole space and with dispersive media, i.e., with a time delayed polarization. Due to the complex nature of the dielectric function, the frequencies are complex, resulting in a decay in time. The geometry is that of a waveguide in $x$ with the propagation direction being $y$ and the solutions are localized in $x$ and TM-polarized. These are often referred to as breathers. They are given as a Fourier series in $y$ and $t$ with the leading frequency $\omega$ being an eigenvalue of a corresponding operator pencil on $\mathbb{R}$ (in the $x$ variable). Each term in the series corresponds to a different temporal decay rate or a different frequency. The series is constructed iteratively via a sequence of linear ordinary differential equations. Our general result provides the existence under some assumptions on the spectrum and on estimates of the resolvent of the corresponding linear operator. We also produce an example of a waveguide given by the interface of two spatially homogeneous physically relevant media for which these assumptions are satisfied. For such an interface setting the constructed solutions correspond to nonlinear polychromatic surface plasmons.</description>

      <title>Scaling limits of critical FK-decorated random planar maps with $q=4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the first scaling limit for FK($q$)-weighted planar maps in the critical case $q=4$, resolving a problem that has remained open since Sheffield's seminal work arXiv:1108.2241. In that work, Sheffield proved a scaling limit for $q&lt;4$ via the celebrated hamburger-cheeseburger bijection, which initiated the peanosphere (mating-of-trees) approach to Liouville quantum gravity. We prove that, at criticality, the associated burger count $\mathcal{S}$ and discrepancy $\mathcal{D}$ satisfy \[ \left(\frac{\mathcal{S}_{\lfloor nt \rfloor}}{\sqrt{n}}, \frac{\log(n)}{{2\pi }\sqrt{n}} \mathcal{D}_{\lfloor nt \rfloor}\right)_{t\in\mathbb{R}} \stackrel{\text{d}}{\longrightarrow} (B^1_t, B^2_{t})_{t\in\mathbb{R}}, \] where $B^1$ and $B^2$ are independent two-sided Brownian motions. To the best of our knowledge, no conjecture for the correct discrepancy scaling factor had previously been formulated. Matching the limiting process with the critical mating of trees arXiv:2109.00275, we establish the first rigorous planar map convergence towards CLE$_4$ and critical ($\gamma=2$) Liouville quantum gravity, in the peanosphere sense. Our proof is based on a novel approach that reveals the exactly solvable nature of the model through a correspondence with the (bicoloured) fully packed loop-$O(2)$ model on triangulations, and yields critical geometric exponents matching the predictions of conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Analytic First-Order Entanglement Entropy of Schwarzschild Black Holes with Interacting Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the first-order correction to the entanglement entropy of a scalar field with quartic self-interaction across the horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. The key result is a fully explicit analytic expression for both the renormalized Newton constant and the corresponding correction to the entropy. Using the Euclidean action, the replica trick, and heat-kernel methods, we obtain a closed-form expression that depends directly on the horizon area, the scalar mass, the interaction strength, and the curvature coupling. The correction exhibits a characteristic logarithmically enhanced quadratic divergence, which is absorbed into the renormalized gravitational coupling. Once this renormalization is performed, the entropy takes the standard Bekenstein-Hawking form with a finite, physically meaningful value. Our result makes it possible to study in detail how the correction varies with model parameters: light fields and strong interactions increase the effect, curvature suppresses it, and conformally coupled fields show no leading-order contribution. Overall, this work provides a clear analytic demonstration of how quantum field interactions modify black hole entropy through the renormalization of Newton's constant.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of generalized abcd Boussinesq solitary waves under a slowly variable bottom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Boussinesq $abcd$ system is a 4-parameter set of equations posed in $\mathbb R_t\times\mathbb R_x$, originally derived by Bona, Chen and Saut as first-order 2-wave approximations of the incompressible and irrotational, two-dimensional water wave equations in the shallow water wave regime, in the spirit of the original Boussinesq derivation. Among the various particular regimes, each determined by the values of the parameters $(a, b, c, d)$ appearing in the equations, the \emph{generic} regime is characterized by the conditions $b, d &gt; 0$ and $a, c &lt; 0$. If additionally $b=d$, the $abcd$ system is Hamiltonian.
  In this paper, we investigate the existence of generalized solitary waves and the corresponding collision problem in the physically relevant \emph{variable bottom regime}, introduced by M.\ Chen. More precisely, the bottom is represented by a smooth space-time dependent function $h=\varepsilon h_0(\varepsilon t,\varepsilon x)$, where $\varepsilon$ is a small parameter and $h_0$ is a fixed smooth profile. This formulation allows for a detailed description of weak long-range interactions and the evolution of the solitary wave without its destruction. We establish this result by constructing a new approximate solution that captures the interaction between the solitary wave and the slowly varying bottom.</description>

      <title>Intensity doubling for Brownian loop-soups in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive an intensity doubling feature of critical Brownian loop-soups on the cable-graphs of ${\mathbb Z}^d$ for $d \ge 7$ that can be described as follows: In the box $[-N, N]^d$ (and with a probability that goes to $1$ as $N$ goes to infinity), the set of all clusters of Brownian loops that do contain proper self-avoiding cycles of diameter comparable to $N$ can be decomposed into two identically distributed families: (a) The collection of clusters that do contain a large Brownian loop from the loop-soup (and therefore do automatically contain such a large cycle) (b) The collection of clusters that contain no macroscopic loop from the loop-soup (more specifically, no loop of diameter greater than $N^{\beta}$ when $\beta &gt; 4/ (d-2)$ is fixed) but nevertheless contain a large cycle. In particular, due to the fact that these two families are asymptotically identically distributed, large cycles formed in case (b) by chains of small Brownian loops (i.e., all of diameter much smaller than $N$) will look like large Brownian loops themselves, and form a second independent "ghost" critical loop-soup in the scaling limit. Reformulated in terms of the Gaussian free field on such cable-graphs, this shows that large cycles in the collection of its sign clusters will converge in the scaling limit to a Brownian loop-soup with twice the usual critical intensity. This result had been conjectured by the first author in arXiv:2209.07901 [math.PR] ; our proof builds heavily on the second author's switching property for such loop-soups from arXiv:2502.06754 [math.PR] .</description>

Abstract: We consider the effective theory of heterotic strings in two spacetime dimensions, in a double field theory-inspired formalism, manifestly consistent with $T$-duality in string theory. Restricting the gauge group to a single $\mathrm{U}(1)$, we study the charged black hole solution and perform a precise analysis of the properties of the dual geometry with the $\mathrm{O}(1,2; \mathbb{R})$-valued generalized metric. We comment on some aspects related to singularities and gauge dependence. We show that the classification program for higher derivative corrections can also be applied to the heterotic case. We further elucidate how a previously proposed solution to the equations of motion, parametrized in a manner fully non-perturbative in $\alpha'$, can be extended to the scenario with $r$ abelian fields and the corresponding $\mathrm{O}(1,1+r; \mathbb{R})$ symmetry. We discuss some novel features of the solution for charged black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07772v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a wide class of random quantum channels with few Kraus operators, sampled as random matrices with some sparsity and moment assumptions, typically exhibit a large spectral gap, and are therefore optimal quantum expanders. In particular, our result provides a recipe to construct random quantum expanders from their classical (random or deterministic) counterparts. This considerably enlarges the list of known constructions of optimal quantum expanders, which was previously limited to few examples. Our proofs rely on recent progress in the study of the operator norm of random matrices with dependence and non-homogeneity, which we expect to have further applications in several areas of quantum information.</description>

Abstract: In \cite{HSZ23}, with Gus Schrader and Eric Zaslow we developed a skein-theoretic version of cluster theory, and made a conjecture on the pentagon relation for the skein dilogarithm. Here we give a topological proof of this conjecture. Combining \cite{MS21} and \cite{BCMN23}, we get a surjection from the skein algebra $\mathrm{Sk}^+(T - D)$ to the positive part of the elliptic Hall algebra $\mathcal{E}_{q, t}^+$. Hence our pentagon relation generalizes the ones in \cite{Z23} and \cite{GM19}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first part of this thesis focuses on the Weyl-covariant nature of holography. We generalize the Fefferman-Graham ambient construction for conformal geometry to a corresponding construction for Weyl geometry. Through the Weyl-ambient construction, we investigate Weyl-covariant quantities on the Weyl manifold and define Weyl-obstruction tensors. We show that Weyl-obstruction tensors appear as poles in the Fefferman-Graham expansion of the AlAdS bulk metric for even boundary dimensions. Under holographic renormalization in the Weyl-Fefferman-Graham gauge, we compute the Weyl anomaly of the boundary theory in multiple dimensions and demonstrate that Weyl-obstruction tensors can be used as the building blocks for the Weyl anomaly of the dual quantum field theory. The holographic calculation with a background Weyl geometry also suggests an underlying geometric interpretation of the Weyl anomaly.
  The second part of this thesis is devoted to understanding the geometric nature of the BRST formalism and quantum anomalies. Using the language of Lie algebroids, the BRST complex can be encoded in the exterior algebra of an Atiyah Lie algebroid derived from the principal bundle of the gauge theory. We showed that the cohomology of an Atiyah Lie algebroid in a trivialization gives rise to the BRST cohomology. We then apply the Lie algebroid cohomology in studying quantum anomalies and demonstrate the computation for chiral and Lorentz-Weyl anomalies. In particular, we pay close attention to the fact that the geometric intuition afforded by the Lie algebroid (which was absent in the traditional BRST complex) provides hints of a deeper picture that simultaneously geometrizes the consistent and covariant forms of the anomaly. In the algebroid construction, the difference between the consistent and covariant anomalies is simply a different choice of basis.</description>

      <title>Explicit spectral gap estimates for the linearized Boltzmann operator modeling reactive gaseous mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider hard-potential cutoff multi-species Boltzmann operators modeling microscopic binary elastic collisions and bimolecular reversible chemical reactions inside a gaseous mixture. We prove that the spectral gap estimate derived for the linearized elastic collision operator can be exploited to deduce an explicit negative upper bound for the Dirichlet form of the linearized chemical Boltzmann operator. Such estimate may be used to quantify explicitly the rate of convergence of close-to-equilibrium solutions to the reactive Boltzmann equation toward the global chemical equilibrium of the mixture.</description>

Abstract: We define a family of Turaev-Viro type invariants of hyperbolic $3$-manifolds with totally geodesic boundary from the $6j$-symbols of the modular double of $\mathrm U_{q}\mathfrak{sl}(2;\mathbb R)$, and prove that these invariants decay exponentially with the rate the hyperbolic volume of the manifolds and with the $1$-loop term the adjoint twisted Reidemeister torsion of the double of the manifolds.</description>

      <title>$k$-Positive Maps: New Characterizations and a Generation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $k$-positive linear maps on matrix algebras and address two problems, (i) characterizations of $k$-positivity and (ii) generation of non-decomposable $k$-positive maps. On the characterization side, we derive optimization-based conditions equivalent to $k$-positivity that (a) reduce to a simple check when $k=d$, (b) reveal a direct link to the spectral norm of certain order-3 tensors (aligning with known NP-hardness barriers for $k&lt;d$), and (c) recast $k$-positivity as a novel optimization problem over separable states, thereby connecting it explicitly to separability testing. On the generation side, we introduce a Lie-semigroup-based method that, starting from a single $k$-positive map, produces one-parameter families that remain $k$-positive and non-decomposable for small enough times. We illustrate this by generating such families for $d=3$ and $d=4$. We also formulate a semi-definite program (SDP) to test an equivalent form of the positive partial transpose (PPT) square conjecture (and do not find any violation of the latter). Our results provide practical computational tools for certifying $k$-positivity and a systematic way to sample $k$-positive non-decomposable maps.</description>

      <title>The logic of quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum logic program originated in a 1936 article by G. Birkhoff and J. von Neumann. This program is generally disregarded due to no-go theorems restricting the existence of the tensor product of elementary quantum logics and, above all, the impossibility of considering entangled states and Bell non-local states within the framework of these composite quantum logics. We revisit this study from the beginning and reverse the perspective. Here, the existence of a tensor product and a star involution are the only prerequisites for the definition of the state spaces. Surprisingly, the quantum logics constructed in this way turn out to have a close connection with irreducible Hilbert geometries, even though we did not impose this sort of structure ab initio. Endly, the existence of some basic quantum-like properties is explicitly proven in our framework : contextuality, no-broadcasting theorem, and Bell non-locality. These elements demonstrate that our quantum logic program is capable of achieving G. Birkhoff and J. von Neumann's initial ambition of founding quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of a generalized Stokes operator on smooth bounded domains via layer-potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the invertibility of the relevant single and double layer potentials associated to some generalizations of the Stokes operator on bounded domains. In order to do that, we first develop an ``algebra tool kit'' to deal with limit and jump relations of layer operators. We do that first on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for operators acting on a distribution supported on $\{x_{n} = 0\}$ and then in general on (possibly non-compact manifolds). We use these results to study the limit and jump relations of the layer potential operators associated to our generalized Stokes operators. In turn, we then use these results to prove the Fredholm property of single and double layer potentials of the generalized Stokes operator and even their invertibility when the auxiliary potentials satisfy suitable non-vanishing conditions. As an application, we obtain well-posedness results.</description>

      <title>Stability theory of flat band solitons in nonlinear wave systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a sharp criterion for the stability of a class of compactly supported, homogeneous density``minimal compact solitons'' or MCS states, of the time-dependent discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a multi-lattice, $\mathbb L$ ($\mathbb L$-DNLS). MCS states arise for multi-lattices where a nearest neighbor Laplace-type operator on $\mathbb L$ has a flat band. Our stability criterion is in terms of the explicit form of the nonlinearity and the projection of distinguished vectors onto the flat band eigenspace. We apply our general results to MCS states of DNLS for the diamond, Kagom{\'e} and checkerboard lattices. In lattices where MCS states are unstable, we demonstrate how to engineer the nonlinearity to stabilize small amplitude MCS states. Finally, via systematic numerical computations, we put our analytical results in the context of global bifurcation diagrams.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal polynomials for the singularly perturbed Laguerre weight, Hankel determinants and asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the work of Chen and Its [{\em J. Approx. Theory} {\bf 162} ({2010}) {270--297}], we further study orthogonal polynomials with respect to the singularly perturbed Laguerre weight $w(x;t,\alpha) = {x^\alpha}{\mathrm e^{- x-\frac{t}{x}}}, \; x\in\mathbb{R}^{+},\;\alpha &gt; -1,\; t\geq 0$. By using the ladder operators and associated compatibility conditions for orthogonal polynomials with general Laguerre-type weights, we derive the second-order differential equation satisfied by the orthogonal polynomials, a system of difference equations and a system of differential-difference equations for the recurrence coefficients. We also investigate the properties of the zeros of the orthogonal polynomials. Using Dyson's Coulomb fluid approach together with the discrete system, we obtain the large $n$ asymptotic expansions of the recurrence coefficients, the sub-leading coefficient of the monic orthogonal polynomials, the Hankel determinant and the normalized constant for fixed $t&gt;0$. It is found that all the asymptotic expansions are singular at $t=0$. We also study the long-time ($t\rightarrow+\infty$) asymptotics of these quantities explicitly for fixed $n\in\mathbb{N}$ from the Toda-type system.</description>

      <title>Exact Quantum Stochastic Differential Equations for Reverse Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ensemble-averaged dynamics of open quantum systems are typically irreversible. We show that this irreversibility need not hold at the level of individually monitored quantum trajectories. Our main results are quantum stochastic differential equations for reverse diffusion, along with corresponding stochastic master equations. These equations describe the exact and approximate stochastic reverse processes for continuously monitored Pauli channels, including time-dependent depolarizing noise. The exact SDEs admit closed-form solutions that can be implemented online without the need for variational techniques. Importantly, the reverse SDEs and corresponding processes are generalizations of their forward counterparts. One can recover the forward process from its reverse, meaning that the reverse process experiences the same decoherence and noise effects as the forward process. This establishes an analytical framework for noise-resilient quantum gates, quantum tomography via forward-reverse cycles, and potential paradigms for quantum error correction based on reverse diffusion.</description>
