      <title>Isotope Enrichment and Element Separation by Self Generated Magnetic Centrifuge Fields in Ultrafast Laser Ablation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A self-consistent model is developed to explain the anomalously large enrichment of nickel isotopes observed in ablation plumes from ultrafast laser irradiation of solid surfaces. The model is based on the spontaneous creation of a magnetic centrifuge in the ablation plume and the associated cyclotron rotation of plasma ions with rotation rates on the order of 10^9 radians per second. Mass separation occurs around the radial coordinate of cylindrical symmetry with longitudinal axis normal to the ablating surface. A Gaussian shaped radial magnetic field distribution is extracted for Ni isotopes with peak field of 53 Megagauss and average field of 20 Megagauss. In addition to cyclotron rotation of ions, a rigid rotor model is also presented that is associated with the hydrodynamic rotation of the entire plasma and is shown to be of little consequence for the isotope enrichment. Cyclotron rotations dominate the process. A profound resonance of enrichment is observed for specific cyclotron charge states and is shown to be associated with Ion Bernstein Wave (IBW) coupling that provides electrostatic acceleration to these resonant orbits.</description>

      <title>Efficient ion re-acceleration in laboratory-produced interpenetrating collisionless shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the origin of cosmic rays (CRs) remains an open question, collisionless magnetized shock waves are widely regarded as key sites for particle acceleration. Recent theories further suggest that shock-shock collisions in stellar clusters could provide the additional acceleration needed to explain the observed high-energy CR spectrum. Here, we investigate this hypothesis through a laser-based experiment that creates magnetized plasma conditions similar to astrophysical environments. Our results demonstrate that interpenetrating collisionless shocks can significantly boost the energy of ambient protons previously energized by the individual shocks, while also improving the overall acceleration efficiency. Numerical kinetic simulations corroborate these findings, revealing that protons are reaccelerated via their bouncing motion in the convective electric fields of the colliding magnetized flows. By allowing to highly energize ambient protons, our novel colliding-shock platform opens the prospect to test the long-discussed mechanism of diffusive shock acceleration in a controlled laboratory setting.</description>

      <title>Assessment of the Runaway Electrons induced damage to the Tokamak First Wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study assessed the damage caused by Runaway Electrons (RE) on First Wall tiles, comparing the effects on Beryllium and Tungsten. This was done by using realistic RE energy distribution functions to replicate RE impacts through the FLUKA code. These energy distribution functions are based on the ASDEX Upgrade experiment # 39012. The parametric analysis carried out with FLUKA in the presence of magnetic fields indicated a clear relationship between the beam impact angle and the material deposited energy, demonstrating that higher impact angles lead to deeper electron penetration and greater deposited energies. A finite element model based on apparent heat capacity formulation in FreeFem++ was developed to analyze the material thermal response to such thermal loads using volumetric energy density profiles from FLUKA simulations as input. Different RE current values were simulated to show its influence on the evolution of the material temperature and melting thickness</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulation method for incoherent Thomson scattering spectra from arbitrary electron distribution functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a Monte Carlo simulation method to calculate incoherent Thomson scattering spectra in high temperature plasmas. The basic idea is to treat the entire scattering process as the superposition of individual photon-electron interactions. We introduce macro-particles, referred from particle-in-cell simulations, to reduce the computational cost, and obtain scattered spectra within a reasonable computational time. Since the velocity of the interacting electron is randomly sampled from an electron distribution function, the method can be applied to arbitrary electron distribution functions provided an appropriate sampling scheme is available. We present simulation results for relativistic Maxwellian and kappa distribution functions, and compare them with both analytical and numerical spectra for validation. The simulated spectra show good agreement with both analytical and numerical results, demonstrating that the Monte Carlo simulation method can reliably reproduce incoherent Thomson scattering spectra.</description>

      <title>Automated simulation-based design via multi-fidelity active learning and optimisation for laser direct drive implosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of inertial fusion experiments is a complex task as driver energy must be delivered in a precise manner to a structured target to achieve a fast, but hydrodynamically stable, implosion. Radiation-hydrodynamics simulation codes are an essential tool in this design process. However, multi-dimensional simulations that capture hydrodynamic instabilities are more computationally expensive than optimistic, 1D, spherically symmetric simulations which are often the primary design tool. In this work, we develop a machine learning framework that aims to effectively use information from a large number of 1D simulations to inform design in the presence of hydrodynamic instabilities. We use an ensemble of neural network surrogate models trained on both 1D and 2D data to capture the space of good designs, i.e. those that are robust to hydrodynamic instabilities. We use this surrogate to perform Bayesian optimisation to find optimal designs for a 25 kJ laser driver. We perform hydrodynamic scaling on these designs to confirm the achievement of high gain for a 2 MJ laser driver, using 2D simulations including alpha heating effects.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Impact of Alfv\'en Wave Forcing in Interplanetary Space on the Distribution of near-Earth Solar Wind Speeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broadly, solar wind source regions can be classified by their magnetic topology as intermittently and continuously open to the heliosphere. Early models of solar wind acceleration do not account for the fastest, non-transient solar wind speeds observed near-Earth and energy must be deposited into the solar wind after it leaves the Sun. Alfv\'en wave energy deposition and thermal pressure gradients are likely candidates and the relative contribution of each acceleration mechanism likely depends on the source region. Although solar wind speed is a rough proxy for solar wind source region, it cannot unambiguously identify source region topology.
  Using near-Sun observations of the solar wind's kinetic energy flux, we predict the expected kinetic energy flux near-Earth. This predicted kinetic energy flux corresponds to the range of solar wind speeds observed in the fast solar wind and infer that the solar wind's near-Sun kinetic energy flux is sufficient to predict the distribution of fastest, non-transient speeds observed near Earth. Applying a recently developed model of solar wind evolution in the inner heliosphere, we suggest that the acceleration required to generate this distribution of fastest, non-transient speeds is likely due to the continuous deposition of energy by Alfv\'en wave forcing during the solar wind's propagation through interplanetary space. We infer that the solar wind's Alfv\'enicity can statistically map near-Earth observations to their source regions because the Alfv\'en wave forcing that the solar wind experiences in transit is a consequence of the source region topology.</description>

      <title>On the Regulation of the Solar Wind Helium Abundance by the Hydrogen Compressibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditionally, fast solar wind is considered to originate in solar source regions that are continuously open to the heliosphere and slow wind originates in regions that are intermittently open to it. In fast wind, the gradient of the solar wind helium abundance ($A_\mathrm{He}$) with increasing solar wind speed ($v_\mathrm{sw}$) is $\sim0$ and $A_\mathrm{He}$ is fixed at $\sim50\%$ of the photospheric value. In slow wind, this gradient is large, $A_\mathrm{He}$ is highly variable, and it doesn't exceed this $\sim50\%$ value. Although the normalized cross helicity in fast wind typically approaches 1, this is not universally true and Alterman &amp; D'Amicis (2025) show that $\nabla_{v_\mathrm{sw}} \! A_\mathrm{He}$ in fast wind unexpectedly increases with decreasing $\left|\sigma_c\right|$. We show that these large gradients are due to the presence of compressive fluctuations. Accounting for the solar wind's compressibility ($\left|\delta n/n\right|$), there are two subsets of enhanced $A_\mathrm{He}$ in excess of typical fast wind values. The subset with a large compressibility is likely from neither continuously nor intermittently open sources. The portion of the solar wind speed distribution over which these fluctuations are most significant corresponds to the range of Alfv\'en wave-poor solar wind from continuously open source regions, which is likely analogous to the Alfv\'enic slow wind. Mapping the results of this work to Alterman &amp; D'Amicis (2025) and vice versa shows that, in any given $\left|\delta n/n\right|$ quantile, $\left|\sigma_c\right| \lesssim 0.65$, an upper bound on non-Alfv\'enic cross helicity. Similarly, $\left|\delta n/n\right| \lesssim 0.15$ in any given $\left|\sigma_c\right|$ quantile, is an upper bound on incompressible fluctuations. We conclude that $\left|\delta n/n\right|$ is essential for characterizing the solar wind helium abundance and possibly regulating it.</description>

      <title>Start-to-end modelling of laser-plasma acceleration, beam transport and dose deposition of very high-energy electrons for radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiotherapy using very high-energy electron (VHEE) beams generated by a laser-plasma accelerator has garnered significant interest due to its dose distribution capabilities and potential to address limitations of traditional photon-based radiotherapy. To explore the feasibility of such approach, the presented study uses the parameters of OONA, the commercial &lt;1.3\,J, &lt;25\,fs pulse duration laser recently installed at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Through particle-in-cell simulations of laser-plasma interaction, realistic electron beams were obtained. After filtering and collimation with a beamline and arranging them into an array of pencil beams, their radiotherapeutic potential was investigated. GEANT4 simulations were used to calculate the dose deposition in water phantoms and heterogeneous phantoms with bone inserts, considering realistic beam parameters for laser-plasma accelerators. Multifield irradiation setup and the dose distribution at the isocenter through different incidence angles were studied, simulating an intensity-modulated delivery. Our findings demonstrate that polychromatic VHEE beams generated from laser-plasma accelerators, when collimated using a compact beamline of quadrupoles and dipoles, can deliver an on-axis dose with enhanced precision and uniformity. This study highlights the transformative potential of laser-plasma accelerators in advancing radiotherapy modalities, paving the way for further research and clinical implementation.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast solid-state chemical synthesis of BaTiO3 initiated by gyrotron microwave radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the results of a study on the solid-state synthesis of barium titanate under continuous microwave radiation from a 24 GHz gyrotron in a multimode cavity reactor. It is shown that in localized domains where fine-scale thermal instabilities develop, initiated by microwave radiation within the initial stoichiometric reaction mixture of ultrafine barium carbonate and titanium dioxide powders, the synthesis can proceed within 1,5 - 7 minutes, achieving a target product yield of up to 90%. Based on a developed realistic numerical model of the multimode reactor, involving an iterative solution of stationary Maxwell and heat conduction equations, it is demonstrated that the specific absorbed power in the domains where fine-scale thermal instabilities develop can reach 670 W/cm3 under an input microwave power of 400 W.</description>

      <title>HEART: A New X-Ray Tracing Code for Mosaic Crystal Spectrometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new open-source Python x-ray tracing code for modelling Bragg diffracting mosaic crystal spectrometers: High Energy Applications Ray Tracer (HEART). HEART's high modularity enables customizable workflows as well as efficient development of novel features. Utilizing Numba's just-in-time (JIT) compiler and the message-passing interface (MPI) allows running HEART in parallel leading to excellent performance. HEART is intended to be used for modelling x-ray spectra as they would be seen in experiments that measure x-ray spectroscopy with a mosaic crystal spectrometer. This enables the user to make predictions about what will be seen on a detector in experiment, perform optimizations on the design of the spectrometer setup, or to study the effect of the spectrometer on measured spectra. However, the code certainly has further uses beyond these example use cases. Here, we discuss the physical model used in the code, and explore a number of different mosaic distribution functions, intrinsic rocking curves, and sampling approaches which are available to the user. Finally, we demonstrate its strong predictive capability in comparison to spectroscopic data collected at the European XFEL in Germany.</description>

      <title>Strong gradient effects on neoclassical electron transport and the bootstrap current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard approaches to neoclassical theory do not extend into regions of strong gradients in tokamaks such as the pedestal and internal transport barriers. Here, we calculate the modifications to neoclassical electron physics inside strong gradient regions of large aspect ratio tokamaks. We show that these modifications are due to the different ion flow and the strong poloidal variation of the potential. We also provide a physical interpretation of the mechanisms that drive poloidal asymmetries and hence a poloidal electric field. We apply our model to two specific example cases of pedestal profiles, calculating the neoclassical electron flux and the bootstrap current. We find that depending on the ion flow, weak gradient neoclassical theory overestimates or underestimates the neoclassical electron transport and the bootstrap current in regions with strong gradients. We show that the determination of the mean parallel flow is more complex than in weak gradient neoclassical theory. For vanishing turbulence, we can determine the radial electric field for a given flow profile in the pedestal.</description>

Abstract: The metriplectic formulation of collisional guiding-center Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau theory is presented. The guiding-center Landau collision operator, which describes collisions involving test-particle and field-particle guiding-center orbits, is represented in terms of a symmetric dissipative bracket involving functional derivatives of the guiding-center Vlasov phase-space density $F_{\rm gc}$ and the electromagnetic fields $({\bf D}_{\rm gc},{\bf B})$, where the guiding-center displacement vector ${\bf D}_{\rm gc} \equiv {\bf E} + 4\pi\,{\sf P}_{\rm gc}$ is expressed in terms of the electric field ${\bf E}$ and the guiding-center polarization ${\sf P}_{\rm gc}$. This dissipative Landau bracket conserves guiding-center energy-momentum and angular momentum, as well as satisfying a guiding-center H-theorem.</description>

      <title>Magnetorotational instability in a solar near-surface mean-field dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the question whether the magnetorotational instability (MRI) can operate in the near-surface shear layer (NSSL) of the Sun and how it affects the interaction with the dynamo process. Using hydromagnetic mean-field simulations of $\alpha\Omega$-type dynamos in rotating shearing-periodic boxes, we show that for negative shear, the MRI can operate above a certain critical shear parameter. This parameter scales inversely with the equipartition magnetic field strength above which $\alpha$ quenching set in. Like the usual $\Omega$ effect, the MRI produces toroidal magnetic field when the field is sufficiently strong. The work done by the Lorentz force is positive, so the magnetic field drives kinetic energy and not the other way around, as in a turbulent dynamo. This results in strong kinetic energy production and dissipation, which tends to go at the expense of the magnetic energy. In view of the application to the solar NSSL, we conclude that the turbulent magnetic diffusivity may be too large for the MRI to be excited and that therefore only the standard $\Omega$ effect is expected to operate.</description>
