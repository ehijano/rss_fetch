      <title>Singular algebraic curves and infinite symplectic staircases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the infinite staircases which arise in the ellipsoid embedding functions of rigid del Pezzo surfaces can be entirely explained in terms of rational sesquicuspidal symplectic curves. Moreover, we show that these curves can all be realized algebraically, giving various new families of algebraic curves with one cusp singularity. Our main techniques are (i) a generalized Orevkov twist, and (ii) the interplay between algebraic $\Q$-Gorenstein smoothings and symplectic almost toric fibrations. Along the way we develop various methods for constructing singular algebraic (and hence symplectic) curves which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A tree formula for the ellipsoidal superpotential of the complex projective plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ellipsoidal superpotential of the complex projective plane can be interpreted as a count of rigid rational plane curves of a given degree with one prescribed cusp singularity. In this note we present a closed formula for these counts as a sum over trees with certain explicit weights. This is a step towards understanding the combinatorial underpinnings of the ellipsoidal superpotential and its mysterious nonvanishing and nondecreasing properties.</description>

      <title>Tight contact structures on hyperbolic homology 3-spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We produce a large class of hyperbolic homology $3$-spheres admitting arbitrarily many distinct tight contact structures. We also produce a sub-class admitting arbitrarily many distinct tight contact structures within the same homotopy class of oriented plane distributions. We also introduce a notion of geometric limits of contact structures compatible with geometric limits of hyperbolic manifolds. We study the behavior of the tight contact structures we construct under geometric limits.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the hypersymplectic flow on $T^4$ with $T^3$-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hypersymplectic structure on a 4-manifold is a triple $\omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3$ of 2-forms for which every non-trivial linear combination $a^1\omega_1 + a^2 \omega_2 + a^3 \omega_3$ is a symplectic form. Donaldson has conjectured that when the underlying manifold is compact, any such structure is isotopic in its cohomolgy class to a hyperk\"ahler triple. We prove this conjecture for a hypersymplectic structure on $T^4$ which is invariant under the standard $T^3$ action. The proof uses the hypersymplectic flow, a geometric flow which attempts to deform a given hypersymplectic structure to a hyperk\"ahler triple. We prove that on $T^4$, when starting from a $T^3$-invariant hypersymplectic structure, the flow exists for all time and converges modulo diffeomorphisms to the unique cohomologous hyperk\"ahler structure.</description>

      <title>Higher symplectic capacities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01490</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.01490v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct new families of symplectic capacities indexed by certain symmetric polynomials, defined using rational symplectic field theory. In particular, we introduce a sequence of capacities based on an L-infinity structure on linearized contact homology and rational curve counts with local tangency constraints. We prove various structural properties of these capacities and give some preliminary computations which show that they give state of the art symplectic embedding obstructions in basic examples.</description>

      <title>On the embedding complexity of Liouville manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.04627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a family of symplectic invariants which obstruct exact symplectic embeddings between Liouville manifolds, using the general formalism of linearized contact homology and its L-infinity structure. As our primary application, we investigate embeddings between normal crossing divisor complements in complex projective space, giving a complete characterization in many cases. Our main embedding results are deduced explicitly from pseudoholomorphic curves, without appealing to Hamiltonian or virtual perturbations.</description>

      <title>Symplectic capacities, unperturbed curves, and convex toric domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.00515v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use explicit pseudoholomorphic curve techniques (without virtual perturbations) to define a sequence of symplectic capacities analogous to those defined recently by the second named author using symplectic field theory. We then compute these capacities for all four-dimensional convex toric domains. This gives various new obstructions to stabilized symplectic embedding problems which are sometimes sharp.</description>

      <title>Hofer Energy and Link Preserving Diffeomorphisms in Higher Genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a pre-monotone Lagrangian link, we obtain Hofer energy estimates for Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms preserving it. Such estimates depend on the braid type of the Hamiltonian diffeomorphism only, and the natural language to talk about this phenomenon is provided by a family of norms on braid groups for surfaces with boundary. This generalises the results obtained by the first author to higher genus surfaces with boundary.</description>
