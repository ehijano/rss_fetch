      <title>The Long Arm of Nashian Allocation in Online $p$-Mean Welfare Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the online allocation of divisible items to $n$ agents with additive valuations for $p$-mean welfare maximization, a problem introduced by Barman, Khan, and Maiti~(2022). Our algorithmic and hardness results characterize the optimal competitive ratios for the entire spectrum of $-\infty \le p \le 1$. Surprisingly, our improved algorithms for all $p \le \frac{1}{\log n}$ are simply the greedy algorithm for the Nash welfare, supplemented with two auxiliary components to ensure all agents have non-zero utilities and to help a small number of agents with low utilities. In this sense, the long arm of Nashian allocation achieves near-optimal competitive ratios not only for Nash welfare but also all the way to egalitarian welfare.</description>

      <title>Trading Prophets: How to Trade Multiple Stocks Optimally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the single stock trading prophet problem formulated by Correa et al.\ (2023), an online algorithm observes a sequence of prices of a stock. At each step, the algorithm can either buy the stock by paying the current price if it doesn't already hold the stock, or it can sell the currently held stock and collect the current price as a reward. The goal of the algorithm is to maximize its overall profit.
  In this work, we generalize the model and the results of Correa et al.\ by allowing the algorithm to trade multiple stocks. First, we formulate the $(k,\ell,\ell')$-Trading Prophet Problem, wherein there are $k$ stocks in the market, and the online algorithm can hold up to $\ell$ stocks at any time, where $\ell\leq k$. The online algorithm competes against an offline algorithm that can hold at most $\ell'\leq\ell$ stocks at any time. Under the assumption that prices of different stocks are independent, we show that, for any $\ell$, $\ell'$, and $k$, the optimal competitive ratio of $(k,\ell,\ell')$-Trading Prophet Problem is $\min(1/2,\ell/k)$.
  We further introduce the more general $\cal{M}$-Trading Prophet Problem over a matroid $\cal{M}$ on the set of $k$ stocks, wherein the stock prices at any given time are possibly correlated (but are independent across time). The algorithm is allowed to hold only a feasible subset of stocks at any time. We prove a tight bound of $1/(1+d)$ on the competitive ratio of the $\cal{M}$-Trading Prophet Problem, where $d$ is the density of the matroid.
  We then consider the non-i.i.d.\ random order setting over a matroid, wherein stock prices drawn independently from $n$ potentially different distributions are presented in a uniformly random order. In this setting, we achieve a competitive ratio of at least $1/(1+d)-\cal{O}(1/n)$, where $d$ is the density of the matroid, matching the hardness result for i.i.d.\ instances as $n$ approaches $\infty$.</description>

      <title>Graphical Models for Decision-Making: Integrating Causality and Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causality and game theory are two influential fields that contribute significantly to decision-making in various domains. Causality defines and models causal relationships in complex policy problems, while game theory provides insights into strategic interactions among stakeholders with competing interests. Integrating these frameworks has led to significant theoretical advancements with the potential to improve decision-making processes. However, practical applications of these developments remain underexplored. To support efforts toward implementation, this paper clarifies key concepts in game theory and causality that are essential to their intersection, particularly within the context of probabilistic graphical models. By rigorously examining these concepts and illustrating them with intuitive, consistent examples, we clarify the required inputs for implementing these models, provide practitioners with insights into their application and selection across different scenarios, and reference existing research that supports their implementation. We hope this work encourages broader adoption of these models in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Modelling Mean-Field Games with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean-field game theory relies on approximating games that would otherwise have been intractable to model. While the games can be solved analytically via the associated system of partial derivatives, this approach is not model-free, can lead to the loss of the existence or uniqueness of solutions and may suffer from modelling bias. To reduce the dependency between the model and the game, we combine mean-field game theory with deep learning in the form of neural ordinary differential equations. The resulting model is data-driven, lightweight and can learn extensive strategic interactions that are hard to capture using mean-field theory alone. In addition, the model is based on automatic differentiation, making it more robust and objective than approaches based on finite differences. We highlight the efficiency and flexibility of our approach by solving three mean-field games that vary in their complexity, observability and the presence of noise. Using these results, we show that the model is flexible, lightweight and requires few observations to learn the distribution underlying the data.</description>

      <title>Splitting Guarantees for Prophet Inequalities via Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prophet inequality is one of the cornerstone problems in optimal stopping theory and has become a crucial tool for designing sequential algorithms in Bayesian settings. In the i.i.d. $k$-selection prophet inequality problem, we sequentially observe $n$ non-negative random values sampled from a known distribution. Each time, a decision is made to accept or reject the value, and under the constraint of accepting at most $k$. For $k=1$, Hill and Kertz [Ann. Probab. 1982] provided an upper bound on the worst-case approximation ratio that was later matched by an algorithm of Correa et al. [Math. Oper. Res. 2021]. The worst-case tight approximation ratio for $k=1$ is computed by studying a differential equation that naturally appears when analyzing the optimal dynamic programming policy. A similar result for $k&gt;1$ has remained elusive.
  In this work, we introduce a nonlinear system of differential equations for the i.i.d. $k$-selection prophet inequality that generalizes Hill and Kertz's equation when $k=1$. Our nonlinear system is defined by $k$ constants that determine its functional structure, and their summation provides a lower bound on the optimal policy's asymptotic approximation ratio for the i.i.d. $k$-selection prophet inequality. To obtain this result, we introduce for every $k$ an infinite-dimensional linear programming formulation that fully characterizes the worst-case tight approximation ratio of the $k$-selection prophet inequality problem for every $n$, and then we follow a dual-fitting approach to link with our nonlinear system for sufficiently large values of $n$. As a corollary, we use our provable lower bounds to establish a tight approximation ratio for the stochastic sequential assignment problem in the i.i.d. non-negative regime.</description>

      <title>Maximum Welfare Allocations under Quantile Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new model for aggregating preferences over a set of indivisible items based on a quantile value. In this model, each agent is endowed with a specific quantile, and the value of a given bundle is defined by the corresponding quantile of the individual values of the items within it. Our model captures the diverse ways in which agents may perceive a bundle, even when they agree on the values of individual items. It enables richer behavioral modeling that cannot be easily captured by additive valuation functions. We study the problem of maximizing utilitarian and egalitarian welfare within the quantile-based valuation setting. For each of the welfare functions, we analyze the complexity of the objectives. Interestingly, our results show that the complexity of both objectives varies significantly depending on whether the allocation is required to be balanced. We provide near-optimal approximation algorithms for utilitarian welfare, and for egalitarian welfare, we present exact algorithms whenever possible.</description>

      <title>Less-excludable Mechanism for DAOs in Public Good Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise of smart contracts, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) have emerged in public good auctions, allowing "small" bidders to gather together and enlarge their influence in high-valued auctions. However, models and mechanisms in the existing research literature do not guarantee non-excludability, which is a main property of public goods. As such, some members of the winning DAO may be explicitly prevented from accessing the public good. This side effect leads to regrouping of small bidders within the DAO to have a larger say in the final outcome. In particular, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the best regrouping of bidders that maximizes the total bidding power of a DAO. We also prove that such a regrouping is less-excludable, better aligning the needs of the entire DAO and the nature of public goods. Next, notice that members of a DAO in public good auctions often have a positive externality among themselves. Thus we introduce a collective factor into the members' utility functions. We further extend the mechanism's allocation for each member to allow for partial access to the public good. Under the new model, we propose a mechanism that is incentive compatible in generic games and achieves higher social welfare as well as less-excludable allocations.</description>
