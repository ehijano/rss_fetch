      <title>Emulation of the final r-process abundance pattern with a neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the construction of a fast emulator for the calculation of the final pattern of nucleosynthesis in the rapid neutron capture process (the $r$-process). An emulator is built using a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN). We train the ANN with nuclear data and relative abundance patterns. We take as input the $\beta$-decay half-lives and the one-neutron separation energy of the nuclei in the rare-earth region. The output is the final isotopic abundance pattern. In this work, we focus on the nuclear data and abundance patterns in the rare-earth region to reduce the dimension of the input and output space. We show that the ANN can capture the effect of the changes in the nuclear physics inputs on the final $r$-process abundance pattern in the adopted astrophysical conditions. We employ the deep ensemble method to quantify the prediction uncertainty of the neutal network emulator. The emulator achieves a speed-up by a factor of about 20,000 in obtaining a final abundance pattern in the rare-earth region. The emulator may be utilized in statistical analyses such as uncertainty quantification, inverse problems, and sensitivity analysis.</description>

      <title>Alpha-Particle Monopole Form Factors with Ab Initio No-Core Shell Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The state-of-the-art ab initio nuclear many-body approaches with modern nuclear forces are challenged by the recent experimental measurement of the monopole form factor of the $0^+_1\rightarrow 0^+_2$ transition in the $\alpha$ particle [Kegel et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 152502 (2023)]. We investigate the elastic and inelastic $0^+_1\rightarrow 0^+_2$ transition form factors using the ab initio no-core shell model (NCSM). We observe a good convergence of both form factors with respect to the basis size employing the Daejeon16 nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) interaction. Our NCSM results are very close to the effective interaction hyperspherical harmonic calculations using $NN$ plus three-nucleon interactions based on the chiral effective field theory which take into account the continuum effects via the Lorentz integral transform. The significant difference between the ab initio results with various modern nuclear interactions and of some of them with the recent experimental data provides motivations for deeper investigation of this observable.</description>

      <title>Chirality in $(\vec{p},2p)$ reactions induced by proton helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that longitudinally-polarized protons can be used to induce chirality in final states of the $(\vec{p},pN)$ reaction at intermediate energies, when there exist three final-state particles with non-coplanar momentum vectors. The analyzing power $A_z$ is proposed as a measure of this effect. Theoretical descriptions to obtain $A_z$ based on an intuitive picture as well as a distorted wave impulse approximation are presented, showing that the helicity of incident protons is coupled to the chirality of the orbital motion of a single-particle wave function, resulting in the chirality of the final states and a large $A_z$ value.</description>

      <title>Fermionic equations of motion in strongly-correlated media: applications to the nuclear many-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes summarise the lectures given at the International School of Physics "Enrico Fermi" in Summer 2024 in Varenna (Italy) about the strongly coupled quantum many-body theory and its applications to nuclear structure. The lectures present a rather short overview of the subject with an emphasis on the analytical aspects of the nuclear many-body problem, aiming at a deep understanding of the complexity of strongly coupled nucleonic states and emergent collective phenomena. The major pedagogical focus is recognizing how all the models describing nuclear dynamics follow from a unified model-independent framework formulated in the universal language of quantum field theory. In particular, connections between the classes of ab initio, density functional theory, and beyond mean-field approaches are made accessible. Approximations of varying complexity are discussed in applications to excited states of medium-heavy nuclei.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of the non-uniformity of nucleon density distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Saturation of nuclear density is a fundamental property of atomic nuclei but in reality, the nuclear internal density distribution is not uniform, e.g., some nuclei are known to have the so-called bubble structure, in which the central density is depressed.
  Purpose: We aim to unveil the emergent mechanism of the non-uniformity of the nucleon density distributions for whole nuclear mass regions, not only for a typical bubble structure.
  Method: We systematically investigate the nucleon density distributions using the Skyrme Hartree-Fock plus Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer calculation represented in the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate space. The ground states of 1,389 even-even nuclei are generated. To quantify the nonuniformity of these density distributions, a ``generalized bubble parameter" is introduced.
  Results: We find that the bubble structure appears around the magic numbers, which correspond to the regions where the s orbit appears near the Fermi surface. The nuclear deformation and pairing correlations strongly affect the occupation probability, but the robust bubble structure of a medium mass nucleus, $^{100}$Sn, is found. We confirm that the Coulomb force enhances the bubble degree in the superheavy region. The nuclear non-uniformity is further generalized by the ``multi-layered" bubble structure, which exhibits some density depression in the internal regions of the density distributions.
  Conclusion: The non-uniformity of the internal density distribution occurs due to the deficiency of the specific single-particle orbits: the nodal $s$, $p$, and $d$ orbits. This is certainly reflected in the density distribution near the nuclear surface, which can be deduced from proton-elastic scattering.</description>

      <title>Improving $\pi\pi$ dispersive analyses and resonance determination with Forward Dispersion Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present preliminary results of an improved pion-pion scattering dispersive analysis that includes: a refined treatment of inelasticities, the introduction of G-waves, the extension of Forward Dispersion Relations as constraints up to 1.6 GeV, and data description up to roughly 1.8 GeV. Additionally, we impose Roy-like dispersion relations. As a result, we obtain three reliable solutions corresponding to three different datasets. From the Forward Dispersion Relation output, we extract resonance pole parameters in a parameterization-independent way using continued fractions.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering and New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interactions of low-energy neutrinos with nuclei provide a unique window to explore various Standard Model (SM) and Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) processes. In particular, the recent observation of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS), predicted over five decades ago, has generated significant interest across disciplines. With its high cross section and suitability for compact detectors, particularly with stopped pion neutrinos, CEvNS offers a powerful probe for light, weakly coupled new physics. Ongoing global experimental efforts now aim to leverage CEvNS to test SM predictions and search for BSM signals, where deviations in event rates or spectra could reveal new physics. We present here an estimate of the number of recoil events obtained from CEvNS using the current and upcoming liquid argon based experiments. Furthermore, the event rate due to the inclusion of neutrino magnetic moment is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Heavy-Quark Spin Symmetry Violation effects in Charmed Baryon Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Heavy-Quark Spin Symmetry (HQSS) exhibited in the effective Lagrangians governing the three-point interactions of $D$ mesons, charmed baryons, and nucleons. We first construct the effective Lagrangians, and there are 12 distinct terms. As a result, we observe that the invariant Lagrangian under HQSS manifests exclusively in the pseudoscalar $D$ mesons coupling to nucleons and $\Lambda_c$ baryons, whereas nucleons and $\Sigma_c$ ($\Sigma_c^*$) baryons only couple with vector $D$ mesons. By taking into account the violated heavy-quark spin transformation, one can recover all interactions from the effective Lagrangians. Furthermore, we compute the differential cross-sections of the $p\bar p \to Y_c\bar{Y}_c'$ scatterings, where $Y_c,\bar{Y_c}' = \Lambda_c,~\Sigma_c,~\Sigma_c^*$, to reveal the residue of the violating HQSS (VHQSS) on charmed baryon production. Ultimately, by accounting for VHQSS, we aim for precise predictions of production rates, which are essential for the High-Energy Storage Ring (HESR) experiments at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR).</description>

      <title>Using the Th III Ion for a Nuclear Clock and Searches for New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 229Th nucleus possesses a unique low-frequency transition at 8.4 eV, which is being considered for the development of an extremely accurate nuclear clock. We investigate an electronic bridge process in the Th III ion, where nuclear excitation occurs via electronic transitions, and demonstrate that a proper choice of laser frequencies can lead to a significant enhancement of this effect. Electrons also reduce the lifetime of the nuclear excited state.
  Additionally, the electronic structure of the Th III ion exhibits features that make it particularly useful for probing new physics. Notably, it contains a metastable state connected to the ground state via a weak M2 transition, which can be utilized for quantum information processing, as well as searches for oscillating axion field, violation of local Lorentz invariance, test of the Einstein's equivalence principle, and measurement of nuclear weak quadrupole moment. The electronic states of the ion present a unique case of level crossing involving the 5f, 6d, and 7s single-electron states. This crossing renders the transition frequencies highly sensitive to potential time-variation of the fine-structure constant.</description>

      <title>Non-radial oscillations of hadronic neutron stars, quark stars, and hybrid stars : Estimation of $f$, $p$, and $g$ modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The composition and equation of state (EoS) of dense matter relevant to compact stars are quite inconclusive. However, certain observational constraints on the structural properties of compact stars help us constrain the EoS to a fair extent. Moreover, gravitational asteroseismology gives us a notion of the interior of the compact star viz., its composition and EoS. The next generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors are likely to detect several oscillation mode frequencies of the GWs, specially the fundamental ($f$) mode frequency. In this work we compute the $f$ and the first pressure ($p_1$) mode frequencies ($f_f$ and $f_{p1}$, respectively) with different compositions viz., hadronic matter, quark matter, and hybrid star (HS) matter. For HSs, we also study the gravity ($g$) mode frequency ($f_g$) arising due to the discontinuity in density. For each phase we also study the correlation between the oscillation frequencies of the 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ and 2.01 $M_{\odot}$ compact stars with the other different properties. We find that the different possible composition of compact stars substantially affects the different oscillation mode frequencies. However, the mass-scaled angular $f$ mode frequency ($\omega_f M$) varies universally with compactness ($C$) for all hadronic, quark and hybrid stars. The $f$ mode frequency ($f_{f_{1.4}}$) of the canonical 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ compact star, obtained with the different composition, is quite correlated with the canonical radius ($R_{1.4}$) and tidal deformability ($\Lambda_{1.4}$) while $f_{p_{1.4}}$ is well correlated with the slope parameter ($L$) of the symmetry energy. We also show that $f_{g_{1.4}}$ of the HSs varies almost linearly with $\Lambda_{1.4}$. Should $g$ modes be detected, they could not only support the existence of HSs, but the magnitude of $f_g$ could be useful to understand the strength of quark repulsion in HSs.</description>

      <title>Constraints for rare electron-capture decays mimicking detection of dark-matter particles in nuclear transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give for the first time, theoretical estimates of unknown rare electron-capture (EC) decay branchings of $^{44}$Ti, $^{57}$Co, and $^{139}$Ce, relevant for searches of (exotic) dark-matter particles. The nuclear-structure calculations have been done exploiting the nuclear shell model (NSM) with well-established Hamiltonians and an advanced theory of $\beta$ decay. In the absence of experimental measurements of these rare branches, these estimates are of utmost importance for terrestrial searches of dark-matter particles, such as axionic dark matter in the form of axion-like particles (ALPs), anapole dark matter, and dark photons in nuclear transitions. Predictions are made for EC-decay rates of 2$^{nd}$-forbidden unique (FU) and 2$^{nd}$-forbidden non-unique (FNU) EC transitions that can potentially mimic dark-matter-particle detection in dedicated underground experiments designed to observe the absence of the corresponding nuclear electromagnetic transitions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian evidence for two peaks in the sound speed in cold dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08760v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I show that in addition to the well-known peak inside massive neutron stars, the sound speed in cold dense QCD matter likely exhibits another peak above neutron star densities before it asymptotes to $c_s=\sqrt{C_s}=\sqrt{1/3}$. Based on the framework reported in arxiv:2408.16738, this approach does not rely on any assumption about the ultra-dense matter not realized in nature. Current multimessenger observation of neutron stars favors the two-peak scenario with a Bayes factor $5.1_{-0.7}^{+0.9}$, where the uncertainties are systematics due to models of neutron star inner cores. This evidence grows to $27_{-8}^{+11}$ if the $2.6M_\odot$ component of GW190814 is a neutron star. The trough in $C_s$ separating the two peaks is inferred to be below $0.05^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ (at the $50\%$ level) if $2.6M_\odot$ neutron stars exist. The second peak above $1/3$ beyond baryon chemical potential $\mu_B=1.6-1.9$ GeV most likely signals non-perturbative effects in cold quark matter, for instance color superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Parton distribution functions and transverse momentum dependence of heavy mesons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The leading Fock state light-front wave functions of heavy quarkonia and $D$ and $B$ mesons are obtained from the projections of their Bethe-Salpeter wave functions on the light front. We compute therefrom their leading-twist time-reversal even transverse momentum distributions and parton distribution functions. Mirroring the behavior of parton distribution amplitudes, the support of both distributions is increasingly narrower and shifted towards larger $x$ as a function of the meson mass. The dependence of $x$ and $\k_\perp^2$ of the transverse distributions does not factorize into separate functions, and their fall-off with $\k_\perp^2$ is much slower than that of light mesons.</description>

      <title>Born-Oppenheimer Renormalization group for High Energy Scattering: the Modified BFKL, or where did it all go?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue exploring the Born-Oppenheimer renormalization group generating evolution in frequency of physical observables. In this paper we study the evolution of the total cross section for dilute-dilute scattering retaining only eikonal emissions. We derive and analyze the analog of the BFKL equation in this framework. The frequency evolution has a very strong effect on the solutions of the BO-BFKL equation, slowing down the evolution of the scattering amplitude in a spectacular fashion: the intercept of the Pomeron is decreased by about a factor of three relative to the canonical LO BFKL result. The anomalous dimension is also modified significantly - from the BFKL value of one it goes down to the negative value of $\approx-0.2$. Introducing saturation boundary as a proxy for the full saturation dynamics, we find that the dependence of the saturation momentum on rapidity $\eta$ becomes quite weak with $Q^2_s\sim e^{a\bar\alpha_s\eta}$ with $a\approx 0.784$ as opposed to the BFKL value $a=4.88$. Our results underscore the necessity to take into account the DGLAP effects in the high energy evolution. This is left for future work.</description>

Abstract: Generalized parton distributions (GPDs) characterize the 3-dimensional structure of hadrons, combining information about their internal quark and gluon longitudinal momentum distributions and transverse position within the hadron. The dependence of GPDs on the factorization scale $Q^2$ allows one to connect hard exclusive processes involving GPDs at disparate energy and momentum scales, which is needed in global analyses of experimental data. In this work we explore how finite element methods can be used to construct fast and differentiable $Q^2$ evolution codes for GPDs in momentum space, which can be used in a machine learning framework. We show numerical benchmarks of the methods' accuracy, including a comparison to an existing evolution code from PARTONS/APFEL++, and provide a repository where the code can be accessed.</description>
