      <title>Scale-dependent alignment in compressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using $10,\!080^3$ grid simulations, we analyze scale-dependent alignment in driven, compressible, no net-flux magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The plasma self-organizes into localized, strongly aligned regions. Alignment spans all primitive variables and their curls. Contrary to incompressible theory, velocity-magnetic alignment scales as $\theta(\lambda) \sim \lambda^{1/8}$, where $\lambda$ is the scale, suggesting a distinct three-dimensional eddy anisotropy and a much higher critical transition scale toward a reconnection-mediated cascade.</description>

      <title>Plasma Mechanism of Radio Emission Generation at the Bow Shock of the Exoplanet HD 189733b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the possibility of efficient radio emission generation in the bow shock region of hot Jupiter-type exoplanets. As a source of energetic electrons, the shock drift acceleration mechanism at a quasi-perpendicular shock is proposed. Electrons reflected and accelerated by the shock propagate through the relatively dense stellar wind plasma and excite plasma waves; therefore, a plasma emission mechanism is considered as the source of the resulting radio waves. Using the bow shock of the hot Jupiter HD 189733b as a case study, the properties of the energetic electron beam, the excited plasma waves, and the resulting radio frequencies are estimated. An energy-based analysis is carried out to identify the range of stellar wind parameters for which radio emission from the bow shock of the exoplanet HD 189733b could be detectable by modern astronomical instruments.</description>

      <title>Temperature anisotropy instabilities of solar wind electrons with regularized Kappa-halos resolved with ALPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space plasmas in various astrophysical setups can often be both very hot and dilute, making them highly susceptible to waves and fluctuations, which are generally self-generated and maintained by kinetic instabilities. In this sense, we have in-situ observational evidence from the solar wind and planetary environments, which reveal not only wave fluctuations at kinetic scales of electrons and protons, but also non-equilibrium distributions of particle velocities. This paper reports on the progress made in achieving a consistent modeling of the instabilities generated by temperature anisotropy, taking concrete example of those induced by anisotropic electrons, such as, electromagnetic electron-cyclotron (whistler) and firehose instabilities. The effects of the two main electron populations, the quasi-thermal core and the suprathermal halo indicated by the observations, are thus captured. The low-energy core is bi-Maxwellian, and the halo is described for the first time by a regularized (bi-)$\kappa$-distribution (RKD), which was recently introduced to fix inconsistencies of standard $\kappa$-distributions (SKD). In the absence of a analytical RKD dispersion kinetic formalism (involving tedious and laborious derivations), both the dispersion and (in)stability properties are directly solved numerically using the numerical Arbitrary Linear Plasma Solver (ALPS). The results have an increased degree of confidence, considering the successful testing of the ALPS on previous results with established distributions.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the electrodynamic nature of spacetime collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from merging binary black holes present exciting opportunities for understanding fundamental aspects of gravity, including nonlinearities in the strong-field regime. One challenge in studying and interpreting the dynamics of binary black hole collisions is the intrinsically geometrical nature of spacetime, which in many ways is unlike that of other classical field theories. By exactly recasting Einstein's equations into a set of coupled nonlinear Maxwell equations closely resembling classical electrodynamics, we visualize the intricate dynamics of gravitational electric and magnetic fields during inspiral, merger and ring-down of a binary black hole collision.</description>

      <title>Strong-field ionization in particle-in-cell simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inclusion of the process of multiple ionization of atoms in high-intensity electromagnetic fields into particle-in-cell (PIC) codes applied to the simulation of laser-plasma interactions is a challenging task. In this paper, we first revisit ionization rates as given by the Perelomov-Popov-Terent'yev formulas within the paradigm of sequential tunnel ionization. We analyze the limit of validity and possible inconsistencies of this approach. We show that a strongly limiting factor to a precise description of ionization is the competing contribution of different sequential ionization processes. To solve this an algorithm is proposed that allows to find the dominant nonsequential path of tunnel ionization, and significantly improves the precision in simulations. This novel procedure is implemented in the PIC code SMILE, and includes the dependence of the ionization rates on the magnetic quantum number of the level. The sensitivity to variations in the ionization model is studied via full simulations of the ionization of an argon target by an incident high-intensity laser pulse. Finally, we analyze generalizations of the Perelomov-Popov-Terent'yev rate developed to describe the barrier suppression ionization in high fields and discuss the necessity and possibility of including these extensions in PIC simulations.</description>
