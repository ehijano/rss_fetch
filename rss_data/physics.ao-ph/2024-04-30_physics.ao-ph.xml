      <title>MetaSD: A Unified Framework for Scalable Downscaling of Meteorological Variables in Diverse Situations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing complex meteorological processes at a fine spatial resolution requires substantial computational resources. To accelerate meteorological simulations, researchers have utilized neural networks to downscale meteorological variables from low-resolution simulations. Despite notable advancements, contemporary cutting-edge downscaling algorithms tailored to specific variables. Addressing meteorological variables in isolation overlooks their interconnectedness, leading to an incomplete understanding of atmospheric dynamics. Additionally, the laborious processes of data collection, annotation, and computational resources required for individual variable downscaling are significant hurdles. Given the limited versatility of existing models across different meteorological variables and their failure to account for inter-variable relationships, this paper proposes a unified downscaling approach leveraging meta-learning. This framework aims to facilitate the downscaling of diverse meteorological variables derived from various numerical models and spatiotemporal scales. Trained at variables consisted of temperature, wind, surface pressure and total precipitation from ERA5 and GFS, the proposed method can be extended to downscale convective precipitation, potential energy, height, humidity and ozone from CFS, S2S and CMIP6 at different spatiotemporal scales, which demonstrating its capability to capture the interconnections among diverse variables. Our approach represents the initial effort to create a generalized downscaling model. Experimental evidence demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms existing top downscaling methods in both quantitative and qualitative assessments.</description>

      <title>Validating Deep-Learning Weather Forecast Models on Recent High-Impact Extreme Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forecast accuracy of deep-learning-based weather prediction models is improving rapidly, leading many to speak of a "second revolution in weather forecasting". With numerous methods being developed, and limited physical guarantees offered by deep-learning models, there is a critical need for comprehensive evaluation of these emerging techniques. While this need has been partly fulfilled by benchmark datasets, they provide little information on rare and impactful extreme events, or on compound impact metrics, for which model accuracy might degrade due to misrepresented dependencies between variables. To address these issues, we compare deep-learning weather prediction models (GraphCast, PanguWeather, FourCastNet) and ECMWF's high-resolution forecast (HRES) system in three case studies: the 2021 Pacific Northwest heatwave, the 2023 South Asian humid heatwave, and the North American winter storm in 2021. We find evidence that machine learning (ML) weather prediction models can locally achieve similar accuracy to HRES on record-shattering events such as the 2021 Pacific Northwest heatwave and even forecast the compound 2021 North American winter storm substantially better. However, extrapolating to extreme conditions may impact machine learning models more severely than HRES, as evidenced by the comparable or superior spatially- and temporally-aggregated forecast accuracy of HRES for the two heatwaves studied. The ML forecasts also lack variables required to assess the health risks of events such as the 2023 South Asian humid heatwave. Generally, case-study-driven, impact-centric evaluation can complement existing research, increase public trust, and aid in developing reliable ML weather prediction models.</description>

      <title>Generative Diffusion-based Downscaling for Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Downscaling, or super-resolution, provides decision-makers with detailed, high-resolution information about the potential risks and impacts of climate change, based on climate model output. Machine learning algorithms are proving themselves to be efficient and accurate approaches to downscaling. Here, we show how a generative, diffusion-based approach to downscaling gives accurate downscaled results. We focus on an idealised setting where we recover ERA5 at $0.25\degree$~resolution from coarse grained version at $2\degree$~resolution. The diffusion-based method provides superior accuracy compared to a standard U-Net, particularly at the fine scales, as highlighted by a spectral decomposition. Additionally, the generative approach provides users with a probability distribution which can be used for risk assessment. This research highlights the potential of diffusion-based downscaling techniques in providing reliable and detailed climate predictions.</description>

      <title>Event-scale Internal Tide Variability via X-band Marine Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A combined radar remote sensing and in situ data set is used to track packets of nonlinear internal waves as they propagate and shoal across the inner shelf (40m - 9m). The dataset consists of high space-time resolution (5m, 2min) radar image time series collected over a 10km radial footprint, with over a dozen synchronous and co-located moorings measuring temperature, salinity, and velocity throughout the water column. The internal bores and higher-frequency internal waves that make up the internal tide are tracked in the radar image time series and, therefore, provide continuous cross-shore speed and angle estimates as the waves propagate across the inner shelf. We compare radar-estimated speeds to those estimated from moorings and confirm a cross-shore shoaling profile that deviates from linear theory. We additionally use combined remote sensing and in situ data to perform a detailed analysis on four consecutive internal tides. These analyses reveal intra-packet speed variability, tide-tide influences, reflected internal waves, and an instance of internal wave polarity reversal observed in the radar and moorings.</description>

      <title>The Jive Verification System and its Transformative Impact on Weather Forecasting Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecast verification is critical for continuous improvement in meteorological organizations. The Jive verification system was originally developed to assess the accuracy of public weather forecasts issued by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. It started as a research project in 2015 and gradually evolved into the operational verification system that went live in 2022. The system includes daily verification dashboards for forecasters to visualize recent forecast performance and "Evidence Targeted Automation" dashboards for exploring the performance of competing forecast systems. Additionally, there is a Jupyter Notebook server with the Jive Python library which supports research experiments, case studies, and the development of new verification metrics and tools.
  This paper shows how the Jive verification project helped bring verification to the forefront at the Bureau of Meteorology, leading to more accurate, streamlined forecasts. Jive has been used to provide evidence for forecast automation decisions and has helped to understand the evolving role of meteorologists in the forecast process. It has given operational meteorologists tools for evaluating forecast processes, including identifying when and how manual interventions lead to superior predictions. The project also led to new verification science, including novel metrics that are decision-focused, including for extreme conditions. Additionally, Jive has provided the Bureau with an enterprise-wide data analysis environment and has prompted a clarification of forecast definitions.
  These collective impacts have resulted in more accurate forecasts, ultimately benefiting society, and building trust with forecast users. These positive outcomes highlight the importance of meteorological organizations investing in verification science and technology.</description>

      <title>Potential Paradigm Shift in Hazard Risk Management: AI-Based Weather Forecast for Tropical Cyclone Hazards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advents of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven models marks a paradigm shift in risk management strategies for meteorological hazards. This study specifically employs tropical cyclones (TCs) as a focal example. We engineer a perturbation-based method to produce ensemble forecasts using the advanced Pangu AI weather model. Unlike traditional approaches that often generate fewer than 20 scenarios from Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulations for one event, our method facilitates the rapid nature of AI-driven model to create thousands of scenarios. We offer open-source access to our model and evaluate its effectiveness through retrospective case studies of significant TC events: Hurricane Irma (2017), Typhoon Mangkhut (2018), and TC Debbie (2017), affecting regions across North America, East Asia, and Australia. Our findings indicate that the AI-generated ensemble forecasts align closely with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ensemble predictions up to seven days prior to landfall. This approach could substantially enhance the effectiveness of weather forecast-driven risk analysis and management, providing unprecedented operational speed, user-friendliness, and global applicability.</description>

      <title>The impact of Ozone on Earth-like exoplanet climate dynamics: the case of Proxima Centauri b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of the James Webb Space Telescope and the development of other advanced observatories (e.g., ELTs, LIFE and HWO) marks a pivotal moment in the quest to characterize the atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets. Motivated by these advancements, we conduct theoretical explorations of exoplanetary atmospheres, focusing on refining our understanding of planetary climate and habitability. Our study investigates the impact of ozone on the atmosphere of Proxima Centauri b in a synchronous orbit, utilizing coupled climate chemistry model simulations and dynamical systems theory. The latter quantifies compound dynamical metrics in phase space through the inverse of co-persistence ($\theta$) and co-dimension (d), of which low values correspond to stable atmospheric states. Initially, we scrutinized the influence of ozone on temperature and wind speed. Including interactive ozone (i.e., coupled atmospheric (photo)chemistry) reduces the hemispheric difference in temperature from 68 K to 64 K, increases ($\sim+$7 K) atmospheric temperature at an altitude range of $\sim$20-50 km, and increases variability in the compound dynamics of temperature and wind speed. Moreover, with interactive ozone, wind speed during highly temporally stable states is weaker than for unstable ones, and ozone transport to the nightside gyres during unstable states is enhanced compared to stable ones ($\sim+$800 DU). We conclude that including interactive ozone significantly influences Earth-like exoplanets' chemistry and climate dynamics. This study establishes a novel pathway for comprehending the influence of photochemical species on the climate dynamics of potentially habitable Earth-like exoplanets. We envisage an extension of this framework to other exoplanets.</description>

      <title>DIRESA, a distance-preserving nonlinear dimension reduction technique based on regularized autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In meteorology, finding similar weather patterns or analogs in historical datasets can be useful for data assimilation, forecasting, and postprocessing. In climate science, analogs in historical and climate projection data are used for attribution and impact studies. However, most of the time, those large weather and climate datasets are nearline. They must be downloaded, which takes a lot of bandwidth and disk space, before the computationally expensive search can be executed. We propose a dimension reduction technique based on autoencoder (AE) neural networks to compress those datasets and perform the search in an interpretable, compressed latent space. A distance-regularized Siamese twin autoencoder (DIRESA) architecture is designed to preserve distance in latent space while capturing the nonlinearities in the datasets. Using conceptual climate models of different complexities, we show that the latent components thus obtained provide physical insight into the dominant modes of variability in the system. Compressing datasets with DIRESA reduces the online storage and keeps the latent components uncorrelated, while the distance (ordering) preservation and reconstruction fidelity robustly outperform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and other dimension reduction techniques such as UMAP or variational autoencoders.</description>

      <title>Wave-resolving Voronoi model of Rouse number for sediment entrainment equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10878v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To integrate wave and sediment transport modeling, a computationally extensive wave-resolving Voronoi mesh-based simulation has been developed to improve upon heretofore separate sediment and spectral wave modeling. Orbital wave motion-dependent sediment transport and fine structures of the dynamic Rouse number distribution across the seabed were brought into focus. The entirely parallelized wave-resolving hydrodynamic model is demonstrated for nearshore beach waters adjacent to artificial islands in Doha Bay. The nested model was validated with tidal time series for three locations and two seasons.</description>

      <title>A simple model for the emergence of relaxation-oscillator convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Earth's tropics are characterized by quasi-steady precipitation with small oscillations about a mean value, which has led to the hypothesis that moist convection is in a state of quasi-equilibrium (QE). In contrast, very warm simulations of Earth's tropical convection are characterized by relaxation-oscillator-like (RO) precipitation, with short-lived convective storms and torrential rainfall forming and dissipating at regular intervals with little to no precipitation in between. We develop a model of moist convection by combining a zero-buoyancy model of bulk-plume convection with a QE heat engine model, and we use it to show that QE is violated at high surface temperatures. We hypothesize that the RO state emerges when the equilibrium condition of the convective heat engine is violated, i.e., when the net cooling times a thermodynamic efficiency exceeds the work that can be performed. We test our hypothesis against one- and three-dimensional numerical simulations and find that it accurately predicts the onset of RO convection. The proposed mechanism for RO emergence from QE breakdown is agnostic of the condensing component, and can be applied to any planetary atmosphere undergoing moist convection. To date, RO states have only been demonstrated in three-dimensional convection-resolving simulations, which has made it seem that the physics of the RO state requires simulations that can explicitly resolve the three-dimensional interaction of cloudy plumes and their environment. We demonstrate that RO states also exist in single-column simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium with parameterized convection, albeit in a different surface temperature range and with much longer storm-free intervals.</description>
