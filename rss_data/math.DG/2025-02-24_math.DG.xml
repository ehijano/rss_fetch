      <title>Parallel differential forms of codegree two, and three-forms in dimension six</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a differential form on a manifold, having constant components in suitable local coordinates trivially implies being parallel relative to a torsion-free connection, and the converse implication is known to be true for $p$-forms in dimension $n$ when $p=0,1,2,n-1,n$. We prove the converse for $(n-2)$-forms, and for 3-forms when $n=6$, while pointing out that it fails to hold for Cartan 3-forms on all simple Lie groups of dimensions $n\ge8$ as well as for $(n,p)=(7,3)$ and $(n,p)=(8,4)$, where the 3-forms and 4-forms arise in compact simply connected Riemannian manifolds with exceptional holonomy groups. We also provide geometric characterizations of 3-forms in dimension six and $(n-2)$-forms in dimension $n$ having the constant-components property mentioned above, and describe examples illustrating the fact that various parts of these geometric characterizations are logically independent.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Contraction Mappings to The Complement of Closed Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study some analytic properties of distance decreasing self-maps onto the complement of a smooth curve $\Sigma$ in $S^n$. For $n&gt;4$ and $n\equiv 0 \mod 4$, let $\Sigma$ be an embedded circle in $S^n$ and let $g$ be a complete Riemannian metric on $X=S^n\backslash \Sigma$ and $f:(X,g)\to (X,g_{std})$ be a proper 1-contracting diffeomorphism. We verify the sharp estimate $\inf_{x\in X}Sc(g)_x&lt;n(n-1)$ if any real Lipschitz 2-chain $C$ which represents a generator $[C]$ in $H_2(S^n, W(\Sigma); \mathbb{R})$ satisfies $Area_g(C)&gt;C(n)\cdot \max_i\{\theta_i\}$ where $W(\Sigma)$ is any tubular neighborhood of $\Sigma$ and $\{e^{2\pi i\theta_i}\}_i$ are the holonomy parameters along $\iota^*S^+$ where $S^+$ is the positive spinor bundle over $S^n$. This answers a question in \cite{gromov2018metric}.</description>

      <title>Geometric deformations of cuspidal $S_1$ singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study a deformation of a singularity taking into consideration their differential geometric properties, a form representing the deformation using only diffeomorphisms on the source space and isometries of the target space plays a crucial role. Such a form for an $S_1$ singularity is obtained by the author's previous work. On this form, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for such a map is being a frontal. The form for an $S_1$ singularity with the frontal condition can be considered such a form for a cuspidal $S_1$ singularity. Using this form, we investigate geometric properties of cuspidal $S_1$ singularities and the cuspidal cross caps appearing in the deformation.</description>

      <title>Primitive immersions of constant curvature of surfaces into flag manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate certain immersions of constant curvature from Riemann surfaces into flag manifolds equipped with invariant metrics, namely primitive lifts associated to pseudoholomorphic maps of surfaces into complex Grassmannians. We prove that a primitive immersion from the two-sphere into the full flag manifold which has constant curvature with respect to \emph{at least one} invariant metric is unitarily equivalent to the primitive lift of a Veronese map, hence it has constant curvature with respect to \emph{all} invariant metrics. We prove a partial generalization of this result to the case where the domain is a general simply connected Riemann surface. On the way, we consider the problem of finding the invariant metric on the flag manifold, under a certain normalization condition, that maximizes the induced area of the two-sphere by a given primitive immersion.</description>

      <title>An essential one sided boundary singularity for a $3$-dimensional area minimizing current in $\mathbb{R}^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a $3$ dimensional area minimizing current $T$ in $\mathbb{R}^5$ whose boundary contains a real analytic surface of multiplicity $2$ at which $T$ has a density $1$ essential boundary singularity with a flat tangent cone. This example shows that the regularity theory we developed with Reinaldo Resende in another paper, is dimensionally sharp.
  The construction of $T$ relies on the prescription of boundary data with non-trivial topology, which makes it an extremely flexible technique and gives rise to a wide family of singular examples.
  In order to understand the examples, we develop a boundary regularity theory for a class of area minimizing $m$-dimensional currents whose boundary consists of smooth $(m-1)$-dimensional surfaces with multiplicities meeting at an $(m-2)$-dimensional smooth submanifold.</description>

      <title>Curvature Corrected Nonnegative Manifold Data Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data with underlying nonlinear structure are collected across numerous application domains, necessitating new data processing and analysis methods adapted to nonlinear domain structure. Riemannanian manifolds present a rich environment in which to develop such tools, as manifold-valued data arise in a variety of scientific settings, and Riemannian geometry provides a solid theoretical grounding for geometric data analysis. Low-rank approximations, such as nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), are the foundation of many Euclidean data analysis methods, so adaptations of these factorizations for manifold-valued data are important building blocks for further development of manifold data analysis. In this work, we propose curvature corrected nonnegative manifold data factorization (CC-NMDF) as a geometry-aware method for extracting interpretable factors from manifold-valued data, analogous to nonnegative matrix factorization. We develop an efficient iterative algorithm for computing CC-NMDF and demonstrate our method on real-world diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging data.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on Renormalized Volume for Schottky groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:1905.03303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we show that for any given Riemann surface $\Sigma$ of genus $g$, we can bound (from above) the renormalized volume of a (hyperbolic) Schottky group with boundary at infinity conformal to $\Sigma$ in terms of the genus and the combined extremal lengths on $\Sigma$ of $(g-1)$ disjoint, non-homotopic, simple closed compressible curves. This result is used to partially answer a question posed by Maldacena about comparing renormalized volumes of Schottky and Fuchsian manifolds with the same conformal boundary.</description>

      <title>Cohomogeneity-one solitons in Laplacian flow: local, smoothly-closing and steady solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.09095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of cohomogeneity-one solitons in Bryant's Laplacian flow of closed G_2-structures on a 7-manifold, motivated by the problem of understanding finite-time singularities of that flow. Here we focus on solitons with symmetry groups Sp(2) and SU(3); in both cases we prove the existence of continuous families of local cohomogeneity-one gradient Laplacian solitons and characterise which of these local solutions extend smoothly over their unique singular orbits. The main questions are then to determine which of these smoothly-closing solutions extend to complete solitons and furthermore to understand the asymptotic geometry of these complete solitons.
  We provide complete answers to both questions in the case of steady solitons. Up to the actions of scaling and discrete symmetries, we show that the set of all smoothly-closing SU(3)-invariant steady Laplacian solitons defined on a neighbourhood of the zero-section of the anti-self-dual bundle of CP^2 is parametrised by the set of nonnegative reals. An open interval I=(0,c) corresponds to complete nontrivial gradient solitons that are asymptotic to the unique SU(3)-invariant torsion-free G_2 cone. The boundary point 0 of I corresponds to the well-known Bryant--Salamon asymptotically conical G_2-manifold, while the other boundary point c corresponds to an explicit complete gradient steady soliton with exponential volume growth and novel asymptotic geometry. The open interval (c, oo) consists entirely of incomplete solutions.
  In addition, we find an explicit complete gradient shrinking soliton on the anti-self-dual bundle of S^4 and CP^2. Both these shrinkers are asymptotic to closed but non-torsion-free G_2 cones. Like the nontrivial AC gradient steady solitons on the anti-self-dual bundle of CP^2, these shrinkers appear to be potential singularity models for finite-time singularities of Laplacian flow.</description>

      <title>A solution of the problem of standard compact Clifford-Klein forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve the long standing problem of classification of standard compact Clifford-Klein forms of homogeneous spaces of simple non-compact real Lie groups under the extra assumption that $G$, $H$, $L$ are simple and absolutely simple. Then the result is that standard compact Clifford-Klein forms always arise from triples $(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{h},\mathfrak{l})$ of real Lie algebras such that $\mathfrak{h}\subset\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{l}\subset\mathfrak{g}$, $\mathfrak{g}$ is simple and absolutely simple, $\mathfrak{h},\mathfrak{l}$ are (non-compact) reductive, $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{h}+\mathfrak{l}$, and the intersection $\mathfrak{h}\cap\mathfrak{l}$ is compact. The consequence of this is the following characterization of proper co-compact actions of reductive Lie subgroups $L\subset G$ on a homogeneous spaces $G/H$ determined by absolutely simple real Lie group $G$ and a closed reductive subgroup $H$: $L$ acts on $G/H$ properly and co-compactly if and only if $G=H\cdot L$ and $H\cap L$ is compact.</description>

      <title>Partial Scalar Curvatures and Topological Obstructions for Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate specific intrinsic curvatures $\rho_k$ (where $1\leq k\leq n$) that interpolate between the minimum Ricci curvature $\rho_1$ and the normalized scalar curvature $\rho_n=\rho$ of $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds. For $n$-dimensional submanifolds in space forms, these curvatures satisfy an inequality involving the mean curvature $H$ and the normal scalar curvature $\rho^\perp$, which reduces to the well-known DDVV inequality when $k=n$. We derive topological obstructions for compact $n$-dimensional submanifolds based on universal lower bounds of the $L^{n/2}$-norms of certain functions involving $\rho_k,H$ and $\rho^\perp$. These obstructions are expressed in terms of the Betti numbers. Our main result applies for any $1\leq k \leq n-1$, but it generally fails for $k=n$, where the involved norm vanishes precisely for Wintgen ideal submanifolds. We demonstrate this by providing a method of constructing new compact 3-dimensional minimal Wintgen ideal submanifolds in even-dimensional spheres. Specifically, we prove that such submanifolds exist in $\mathbb{S}^6$ with arbitrarily large first Betti number.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on G_2-structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0305124</link>
      <description>arXiv:math/0305124v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article consists of some loosely related remarks about the geometry of G_2-structures on 7-manifolds and is partly based on old unpublished joint work with two other people: F. Reese Harvey and Steven Altschuler. Much of this work has since been subsumed in the work of Hitchin \cite{MR02m:53070} and Joyce \cite{MR01k:53093}. I am making it available now mainly because of interest expressed by others in seeing these results written up since they do not seem to have all made it into the literature.
  A formula is derived for the scalar curvature and Ricci curvature of a G_2-structure in terms of its torsion. When the fundamental 3-form of the G_2-structure is closed, this formula implies, in particular, that the scalar curvature of the underlying metric is nonpositive and vanishes if and only if the structure is torsion-free. This version contains some new results on the pinching of Ricci curvature for metrics associated to closed G_2-structures.
  Some formulae are derived for closed solutions of the Laplacian flow that specify how various related quantities, such as the torsion and the metric, evolve with the flow. These may be useful in studying convergence or long-time existence for given initial data.</description>
