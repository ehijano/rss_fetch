      <title>Adaptive Neural Quantum States: A Recurrent Neural Network Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural-network quantum states (NQS) are powerful neural-network ans\"atzes that have emerged as promising tools for studying quantum many-body physics through the lens of the variational principle. These architectures are known to be systematically improvable by increasing the number of parameters. Here we demonstrate an Adaptive scheme to optimize NQSs, through the example of recurrent neural networks (RNN), using a fraction of the computation cost while reducing training fluctuations and improving the quality of variational calculations targeting ground states of prototypical models in one- and two-spatial dimensions. This Adaptive technique reduces the computational cost through training small RNNs and reusing them to initialize larger RNNs. This work opens up the possibility for optimizing graphical processing unit (GPU) resources deployed in large-scale NQS simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum diffusion in the Harper model under polychromatic time-perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum dynamics of the Harper model with self-duality exhibits localized, diffusive, and ballistic states depending on the potential strength $V$. By adding time-dependent harmonic perturbations composed of $M$ incommensurate frequencies, we show that all states of the Harper model transition to quantum diffusive states as the perturbation strength $\epsilon$ increases for $M \geq 3$. The transition schemes and diffusion behaviors are discussed in detail and the phase diagram in the $(\epsilon,V)$ parameter space is presented.</description>

      <title>Multifractality and statistical localization in the sparse Barrat-M\'ezard trap model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study within a paradigmatic model for glassy dynamics, the Barrat-M\'ezard trap model, the effect of a nontrivial network structure in the connectivity among traps. Sparseness of this network has recently been shown to lead to divergences in the bulk of the spectrum of the associated master operator [1, 2]. We analyse here specifically the properties of the relaxation modes that contribute to these spectral divergences. We characterize the statistics of the corresponding wavefunctions and demonstrate that they are localized with multifractal properties. The localization patterns are unrelated to the spatial (network) topology, however, and instead fall within the recently introduced class of statistical localization phenomena [3]. To rationalize these results we develop an effective model that successfully explains both the spectral divergences and the power law tails in the wavefunction entries, and provides a clear physical picture of why the localization is statistical rather than spatial.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Many Body Localization Crossover as a Metal-Insulator Transition: Localization length from Polarization and Quantum Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many body localization (MBL) represents a unique physical phenomenon, providing a testing ground for exploring thermalization, or more precisely its failure. Here we characterize the MBL regime geometrically by the many-body quantum metric (MBQM), defined in the parameter space of twist boundary, and the localization parameter as defined in the modern theory of polarization and insulators. First, we demonstrate that the quantum metric can be used to characterize disordered insulating states by applying this theoretical framework to excited states of the 1D Anderson insulator. There we observe that the MBQM and localization parameter are related in finite realizations despite the states being gapless in the thermodynamic limit. Then, we consider a disordered 1D Bose-Hubbard model and find that we can characterize the ergodic-MBL crossover by comparing the MBQM and localization parameter. We find that we can extract a natural localization length in the MBL regime that characterizes the real space spread of the wave function and can be measured by extracting the quantum metric. Our analysis provides complementary insight into the MBL regime focusing on its insulating properties and providing a localization length whose definition is consistent across a range of insulating phases.</description>

      <title>Equilibration of Non-interacting Photons and Quantum Signatures of Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equilibration plays a fundamental role in our understanding of statistical mechanics and the long-time dynamics of many-body systems. In quantum systems, the route to equilibration is intimately related to level repulsion and quantum signatures of chaos that are encoded in their unitary evolution. Chaotic quantum systems exhibit the level statistics characteristic of ensembles of random matrices. In this work, we demonstrate that single-particle chaos leads to equilibration of many non-interacting photons. We show that the underlying mechanisms for equilibration are operator spreading and quantum interference. More specifically, we demonstrate that the unitary dynamics of a general Floquet system implemented using single-mode phase shifters and multiport beamsplitters leads to equilibration of photons. We propose a realistic photonic implementation of the multiparticle kicked rotor, which is a Floquet system that we use as a concrete example of our general approach.</description>

      <title>The moments of the spectral form factor in SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In chaotic quantum systems the spectral form factor exhibits a universal linear ramp and plateau structure with superimposed erratic oscillations. The mean signal and the statistics of the noise can be probed by the moments of the spectral form factor, also known as higher-point spectral form factors. We identify saddle points in the SYK model that describe the moments during the ramp region. Perturbative corrections around the saddle point indicate that SYK mimics random matrix statistics for the low order moments, while large deviations for the high order moments arise from fluctuations near the edge of the spectrum. The leading correction scales inversely with the number of random parameters in the SYK Hamiltonian and is amplified in a sparsified version of the SYK model, which we study numerically, even in regimes where a linear ramp persists. Finally, we study the $q=2$ SYK model, whose spectral form factor exhibits an exponential ramp with increased noise. These findings reveal how deviations from random matrix universality arise in disordered systems and motivate their interpretation from a bulk gravitational perspective.</description>

      <title>Balanced multi-species spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a special class of multi-species spin glass models: ones in which the species proportions serve to ''balance'' out the interaction strengths. For this class, we prove a free energy lower bound that does not require any convexity assumption, and applies to both Ising and spherical models. The lower bound is the free energy of a single-species model whose $p$-spin inverse-temperature parameter is exactly the variance of the $p$-spin component of the multi-species Hamiltonian. For the Ising case, this generalizes an inequality recently found by Issa in the context of vector spin models. We further demonstrate that this lower bound is actually an equality in many cases, including: at high temperatures for all models, at all temperatures for convex models, and at zero temperature for pure bipartite spherical models. When translated to a statement about the injective norm of a nonsymmetric Gaussian tensor, our lower bound matches an upper bound recently established by Dartois and McKenna.</description>
