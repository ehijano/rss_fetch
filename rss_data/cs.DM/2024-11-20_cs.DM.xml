      <title>A Course of Algebra (PART I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The following is an exposition of a course of algebra that Prof. Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Zykov (1922-2013) distributed among the participants of his seminar in graph theory not far away from Odessa, Ukraine, on September, 1991. It is a privilege for me to be able to reproduce, with some good additions, the English version of this remarkable course that he designed carefully over several years with the help of other colleagues and with the only purpose of making the science of algebra more accessible to the less gifted student. Prof. Zykov was an admirable person and a very clever mathematician and scientist. His scientific interests were wide: from the mathematical sciences at any level and in any of their branches to the theory of relativity as I recall. He kindly wrote a review recommending the results of my doctoral dissertation, which was necessary for the approval to obtain a Ph.D. degree during the meeting of my defense. In that meeting, I was very nervous because I had in front of me fifteen professors all of them doctors of technical or mathematical sciences asking all sort of questions and whom I had to convince of the fact that my results were true. I am sure this algebra course played the role that Prof. Zykov, with his deepness of thought, had primarily intended, that is, one course designed with the right approach to help out many of his students.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Time-Sparsity Trade-Offs for Solving Noisy Linear Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a polynomial-time reduction from solving noisy linear equations over $\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z}$ in dimension $\Theta(k\log n/\mathsf{poly}(\log k,\log q,\log\log n))$ with a uniformly random coefficient matrix to noisy linear equations over $\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z}$ in dimension $n$ where each row of the coefficient matrix has uniformly random support of size $k$. This allows us to deduce the hardness of sparse problems from their dense counterparts. In particular, we derive hardness results in the following canonical settings. 1) Assuming the $\ell$-dimensional (dense) LWE over a polynomial-size field takes time $2^{\Omega(\ell)}$, $k$-sparse LWE in dimension $n$ takes time $n^{\Omega({k}/{(\log k \cdot (\log k + \log \log n))})}.$ 2) Assuming the $\ell$-dimensional (dense) LPN over $\mathbb{F}_2$ takes time $2^{\Omega(\ell/\log \ell)}$, $k$-sparse LPN in dimension $n$ takes time $n^{\Omega(k/(\log k \cdot (\log k + \log \log n)^2))}~.$ These running time lower bounds are nearly tight as both sparse problems can be solved in time $n^{O(k)},$ given sufficiently many samples. We further give a reduction from $k$-sparse LWE to noisy tensor completion. Concretely, composing the two reductions implies that order-$k$ rank-$2^{k-1}$ noisy tensor completion in $\mathbb{R}^{n^{\otimes k}}$ takes time $n^{\Omega(k/ \log k \cdot (\log k + \log \log n))}$, assuming the exponential hardness of standard worst-case lattice problems.</description>

      <title>Generation of Cycle Permutation Graphs and Permutation Snarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for the efficient generation of all pairwise non-isomorphic cycle permutation graphs, i.e. cubic graphs with a $2$-factor consisting of two chordless cycles, and non-hamiltonian cycle permutation graphs, from which the permutation snarks can easily be computed. This allows us to generate all cycle permutation graphs up to order $34$ and all permutation snarks up to order $46$, improving upon previous computational results by Brinkmann et al. Moreover, we give several improved lower bounds for interesting permutation snarks, such as for a smallest permutation snark of order $6 \bmod 8$ or a smallest permutation snark of girth at least $6$. These computational results also allow us to complete a characterisation of the orders for which non-hamiltonian cycle permutation graphs exist, answering an open question by Klee from 1972, and yield many more counterexamples to a conjecture by Zhang.</description>
