      <title>Incidence of lines, points, and planes in $PG(3,q)$ with respect to the twisted cubic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the orbits of the group $G=PGL_2(q)$ on the points, lines and planes of the projective space $PG(3,q)$ over a finite field $\mathbb F_q$ of characteristic different from $2$ and $3$. The points of $PG(3,q)$ can be identified with projective space of binary cubic forms, and the set $\mathcal L$ of lines of $PG(3,q)$ can be thought of as pencils of cubic forms. The action of $G$ on $PG(1,q)$ naturally induces an action of $G$ on binary cubic forms $f(X,Y)$. The points of $PG(3, q)$ decompose into five $G$ orbits. The $G$ orbits on $\mathcal L$ were recently obtained by the authors. Let $\mathcal I$ be the subset of $\mathcal L \times PG(3,q)$ consisting of pairs $(L,P)$ where $L$ is a line incident with the point $P$. The decomposition of $\mathcal L \times PG(3,q)$ into $G \times G$ orbits yields a partition of $\mathcal I$. The problem that we solve in this work is to determine the sizes of the corresponding parts of $\mathcal I$.</description>

      <title>Entropy approximations of algebraic matroids over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of entropy polymatroids associated with algebraic matroids over finite fields. Given an algebraic matroid ${\sf M}:=(\mathcal{E},r)$ and the irreducible variety $V$ associated with ${\sf M}$, we consider the polymatroid $h_{\mathbb{F}}$ induced by the entropies of the projections of $V(\mathbb{F})$, where $\mathbb{F}$ is a finite extension of $\mathbb{G}$. Revisiting a construction of Mat\'u$\check{\mathrm{s}}$, we show that the polymatroid $h_{\mathbb{F}}$ converges to the rank function $r$ of ${\sf M}$ as $q:=|\mathbb{F}|$ tends to infinity.
  Our main contribution is to make this convergence quantitative: we derive explicit uniform error bounds for the deviation $|h_\mathbb{F}-r|$, expressed in terms of the degree of $V$, the ground set size $|\mathcal{E}|$, the rank $r(\mathcal{E})$, and $q$. The proofs combine tools of algebraic geometry (effective Lang-Weil estimates and intrinsic degree bounds for annihilating polynomials of circuits) with information-theoretic arguments (submodularity of entropy and conditional entropy estimates).
  These results provide the first effective and uniform approximation bounds for algebraic matroids by entropy polymatroids, clarifying the quantitative link between algebraic independence (captured by matroid rank) and information-theoretic independence (captured by entropy).</description>

      <title>Global coalition sets in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph. A subset $S \subseteq V$ is called a global dominating set of $G$, if it serves as a dominating set in both $G$ and its complement $\overline{G}$. We define two disjoint subsets $V_1,V_2 \subseteq V$ to form a global coalition if neither $V_1$ nor $V_2$ individually constitutes a global dominating set, yet their union $V_1 \cup V_2$ does. A global coalition partition (abbreviated as $gc$-partition) of $G$ is a vertex partition $\pi$ of $V(G)$ such that for every subset $V_i \in \pi$, there exists another subset $V_j \in \pi$ with which $V_i$ forms a global coalition. In this paper, we initiate the study of global coalition in graphs. Specifically, we prove that every graph admits a gc-partition. Additionally, we establish an upper bound on the number of global coalitions in which each member of a gc-partition can participate. We also explore the relationships between global coalition and coalition, as well as between global coalition and perfect coalition in graphs. Finally, we explore properties of $gc$-partitions in unicyclic graphs.</description>

      <title>The nucleus of the Grassmann graph $J_q(N,D)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ denote a finite field with $q$ elements. Let $N$ and $D$ denote integers with $N&gt;D \ge 1$. Let $\mathcal{V}$ denote an $N$-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{F}_q$. The Grassmann graph $J_q(N,D)$ is the graph with vertex set $X$ that consists of the $D$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathcal{V}$. Two vertices are adjacent whenever their intersection has dimension $D-1$. Fix a vertex $x$ in $X$. The Terwilliger algebra $T=T(x)$ of $J_q(N,D)$ with respect to $x$ is the subalgebra of $\mathrm{Mat}_X(\mathbb{C})$ generated by the adjacency matrix $A$ and the dual adjacency matrix $A^* = A^*(x)$. It is known that an irreducible $T$-module $W$ has certain parameters called the endpoint $r$, the dual endpoint $t$, and the diameter $d$. The displacement of $W$ is defined to be the integer $r+t-D+d$. Let $\mathcal{N}=\mathcal{N}(x)$ denote the span of all irreducible $T$-modules with displacement 0. We call $\mathcal{N}$ the nucleus of $J_q(N,D)$ with respect to $x$. In this paper, we study the structure of $\mathcal{N}$. Specifically, we present a formula for the dimension of $\mathcal{N}$, construct two explicit bases for $\mathcal{N}$, and describe the action of $A$ and $A^*$ on these bases. To obtain these results, we use the projective geometry $P_q(N)$, consisting of all subspaces of $\mathcal{V}$, as a key tool.</description>

      <title>On the existence of directed strongly regular graphs with parameters (22, 9, 6, 3, 4)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper shows the existence of a family of directed strongly regular graphs with parameters (22, 9, 6, 3, 4). The adjacency matrices of the found digraphs are composed of $3\times 3$ circulant blocks. The automorphism group of all the digraphs found is the group $\mathbb{Z}_3$. The structure of the resulting digraphs is described using concepts of skeleton and rigging.</description>

      <title>Linear recoloring diameter of degenerate chordal graphs and bounded treewidth graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices and $t$ an integer. The reconfiguration graph of $G$, denoted by $R_t(G)$, consists of all $t$-colorings of $G$ and two $t$-colorings are adjacent if they differ on exactly one vertex. The $t$-recoloring diameter of $G$ is the diameter of $R_t(G)$. For a $d$-degenerate graph $G$, $R_t(G)$ is connected when $t \ge d+2$~(Dyer et al., 2006). Furthermore, the $t$-recoloring diameter is $O(n^2)$ when $t \ge 3(d+1)/2$~(Bousquet et al., 2022), and it is $O(n)$ when $t \ge 2d+2$~(Bousquet and Perarnau, 2016). For a $d$-degenerate and chordal graph $G$, the $t$-recoloring diameter of $G$ is $O(n^2)$ when $t \ge d+2$~(Bonamy et al. 2014). If $G$ is a graph of treewidth at most $k$, then $G$ is also $k$-degenerate, and the previous results hold. Moreover, when $t \ge k+2$, the $t$-recoloring diameter is $O(n^2)$~(Bonamy and Bousquet, 2013). When $k=2$, the $t$-recoloring diameter of $G$ is linear when $t \ge 5$~(Bartier, Bousquet and Heinrich, 2021) and the result is tight. In this paper, we prove that if $G$ is $d$-degenerate and chordal, then the $t$-recoloring diameter of $G$ is $O(n)$ when $t \ge 2d+1$. Moreover, if the treewidth of $G$ is at most $k$, then the $t$-recoloring diameter is $O(n)$ when $t \ge 2k+1$. This result is a generalization of the previous results on graphs of treewidth at most two.</description>

      <title>Tree-independence number VI. Thetas and pyramids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a family $\mathcal{H}$ of graphs, we say that a graph $G$ is $\mathcal{H}$-free if no induced subgraph of $G$ is isomorphic to a member of $\mathcal{H}$. Let $W_{t\times t}$ be the $t$-by-$t$ hexagonal grid and let $\mathcal{L}_t$ be the family of all graphs $G$ such that $G$ is the line graph of some subdivision of $W_{t \times t}$. We denote by $\omega(G)$ the size of the largest clique in $G$. We prove that for every integer $t$ there exist integers $c_1(t)$, $c_2(t)$ and $d(t)$ such that every (pyramid, theta, $\mathcal{L}_t$)-free graph $G$ satisfies: i) $G$ has a tree decomposition where every bag has size at most $\omega(G)^{c_1(t)} \log (|V(G)|)$. ii) If $G$ has at least two vertices, then $G$ has a tree decomposition where every bag has independence number at most $\log^{c_2(t)} (|V(G)|)$. iii) For any weight function, $G$ has a balanced separator that is contained in the union of the neighborhoods of at most $d(t)$ vertices. These results qualitatively generalize the main theorems of Abrishami et al. (2022) and Chudnovsky et al. (2024). Additionally, we show that there exist integers $c_3(t), c_4(t)$ such that for every (theta, pyramid)-free graph $G$ and for every non-adjacent pair of vertices $a,b \in V(G)$, i) $a$ can be separated from $b$ by removing at most $w(G)^{c_3(t)}\log(|V(G)|)$ vertices. ii) $a$ can be separated from $b$ by removing a set of vertices with independence number at most $\log^{c_4(t)}(|V(G)|)$.</description>

      <title>Counting induced subgraphs with given intersection sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a graph of order $r$. In this paper, we study the maximum number of induced copies of $F$ with restricted intersections, which highlights the motivation from extremal set theory. Let $L=\{\ell_1,\dots,\ell_s\}\subseteq[0,r-1]$ be an integer set with $s\not\in\{1,r\}$. Let $\Psi_r(n,F,L)$ be the maximum number of induced copies of $F$ in an $n$-vertex graph, where the induced copies of $F$ are $L$-intersecting as a family of $r$-subsets, i.e., for any two induced copies of $F$, the size of their intersection is in $L$. Helliar and Liu initiated a study of the function $\Psi_r(n,K_r,L)$. Very recently, Zhao and Zhang improved their result and showed that $\Psi_r(n,K_r,L)=\Theta_{r,L}(n^{s})$ if and only if $\ell_1,\dots,\ell_s,r$ form an arithmetic progression. In this paper, we show that $\Psi_r(n,F,L)=o_{r,L}(n^{s})$ when $\ell_1,\dots,\ell_s,r$ do not form an arithmetic progression. We study the asymptotical result of $\Psi_r(n,C_r,L)$, and determined the asymptotically optimal result when $\ell_1,\dots,\ell_s,r$ form an arithmetic progression and take certain values. We also study the generalized Tur\'an problem, determining the maximum number of $H$, where the copies of $H$ are $L$-intersecting as a family of $r$-subsets. The entropy method is used to prove our results.</description>

      <title>Extending edge colorings of distance-2 matchings in the hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Casselgren, Markst\"orm, and Pham conjectured that any precolored distance-2 matching in the $d$-dimensional cube $Q_d$ can be extended to a proper $d$-edge coloring. In this paper, we prove this conjecture and some related theorems. Especially, our result establishes that if $G$ is a bipartite graph, then a precolored distance-2 matching in the Cartesian product $G \square K_{2m}$ can be extended to an edge coloring using at most $\Delta(G)+1$ colors. As another generalization, we establish the same result for the Cartesian product $G \square K_{1,m}$.</description>

      <title>Improper coloring of toroidal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is called $(d_1,\dots,d_k)$-colorable if its vertices can be partitioned into $k$ sets $V_1,\dots,V_k$ such that $\Delta(\langle V_i\rangle_G)\leq d_i, i\in \{1,\dots, k\}$. If $d_1 = \dots = d_k = m$ we say that $G$ is $k$-colorable with defect $m$. A coloring with at least one $d_i, i\in \{1,\dots, k\}$, greater than $0$ is called an improper coloring. It is known that toroidal graphs are properly $7$-colorable, therefore they are $7$-colorable with defect $0$. It was also proved that toroidal graphs are $5$-colorable with defect $1$ and $3$-colorable with defect $2$. The question whether they are $4$-colorable with defect $1$ remains open.
  In this paper we focus on improper coloring of toroidal graphs with values of defects being not all equal. We prove that these graphs are $(0,0,0,0,0,1^*)$-colorable, $(0,0,0,0,2)$-colorable and $(0,0,0,1^*,1^*)$-colorable (a star means that there is an improper coloring in which subgraph induced by the corresponding color class contains at most one edge). Choi and Esperet in [Improper coloring of graphs on surfaces, J. Graph Theory $91(1)\,(2019), 16-34$] proved that every graph of Euler genus $eg &gt; 0$ is $(0, 0, 0, 9eg - 4)$-colorable. From this result it follows that toroidal graphs are $(0,0,0,14)$-colorable. We decreased the value $14$ and proved that toroidal graphs are $(0,0,0,4)$-colorable.
  We also show that all 6-regular toroidal graphs except $K_7$ and $T_{11}$ are $(0,0,0,1)$-colorable. Finally, we discuss the colorability of graphs embeddable on $N_1$ and show that they are $(0,0,0,2)$-colorable.</description>

      <title>Facial nested complexes and acyclonestohedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nested complexes of building sets on the Las Vergnas face lattices of oriented matroids. Such a nested complex is the face lattice of an oriented matroid, obtained by iterated stellar subdivisions of the positive tope. If the oriented matroid is realizable, the nested complex is isomorphic to the boundary complex of a polytope.
  We turn this into an explicit and combinatorially meaningful polytopal realization. We prove that the facial nested complex can be embedded as the acyclic subcomplex of the nested complex of a well-chosen boolean building set. In the realizable case, we show that this acyclic subcomplex can be geometrically selected as the section of a nestohedron by the evaluation space of the vector configuration, which we call acyclonestohedron.
  Our framework generalizes the poset associahedra recently introduced by P. Galashin, from order polytopes to any polytope. Poset associahedra are the graphical acyclonestohedra, and our approach recovers as particular cases the main results of P. Galashin and answers some of his open questions. Besides poset associahedra, our framework unifies various other existing families of nested-like polytopes, such as the simple polytope nestohedra, the hyperoctahedral nestohedra, the design graph associahedra and the permutopermutohedra, to which our palette of results can be directly applied.
  The core of our construction is the embedding of the facial nested complex inside a boolean nested complex. More generally, we provide conditions that guarantee an embedding between nested complexes over two lattices. For instance, any atomic nested complex has a canonical embedding inside a boolean nested complex. As another application, we embed nested complexes over lattices of faces into nested complexes over lattices of flats, recovering as a particular case, the embedding of the positive Bergman complex into the Bergman complex.</description>

      <title>Reduced complexities for sequences over finite alphabets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Letting $w$ denote a finite, nonempty word, let $\text{red}(w)$ denote the word obtained from $w$ by replacing every subword $s$ of $w$ of the form $cc \cdots c$ for a given character $c$ (such that there is no character immediately to the left or right of $s$ equal to $c$) with $c$. Complexity functions for infinite words play important roles within combinatorics on words, and this leads us to introduce and investigate variants of the factor and abelian complexity functions using the given reduction operation. By enumerating words $v$ and $w$ of a given length $n \geq 0$ and associated with an infinite sequence over a finite alphabet such that $\text{red}(v)$ and $\text{red}(w)$ are equal or otherwise equivalent in some specified way, by analogy with the factor and abelian complexity functions, this may be seen as producing simplified versions of previously introduced complexity functions. We prove a recursion for the reduced factor complexity function $\rho_{\mathbf{t}}^{\text{red}}$ for the Thue-Morse sequence $\mathbf{t}$, giving us that $(\rho_{\mathbf{t}}^{\text{red}}(n) : n \in \mathbb{N})$ is a $2$-regular sequence, we prove an explicit evaluation for the reduced factor complexity function $\rho_{\mathbf{f}}^{\text{red}}$ for the (regular) paperfolding sequence $\mathbf{f}$, together with an evaluation for the reduced abelian complexity function $\rho_{\mathbf{f}}^{\text{ab}, \text{red}}$ for $\mathbf{f}$. We conclude with open problems concerning $\rho_{\mathbf{t}}^{\text{ab}, \text{red}}$.</description>

      <title>Equitably Coloring Planar and Outerplanar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proper $s$-coloring of an $n$-vertex graph is \emph{equitable} if every color class has size $\lfloor{n/s}\rfloor$ or $\lceil{n/s}\rceil$. A necessary condition to have an equitable $s$-coloring is that every vertex $v$ appears in an independent set of size at least $\lfloor{n/s}\rfloor$. That is $\min_{v\in V(G)}\alpha_v\ge \lfloor{n/s}\rfloor$. Various authors showed that when $G$ is a tree and $s\ge 3$ this obvious necessary condition is also sufficient. Kierstead, Kostochka, and Xiang asked whether this result holds more generally for all outerplanar graphs. We show that the answer is No when $s=3$, but that the answer is Yes when $s\ge 6$. The case $s\in\{4,5\}$ remains open. We also prove an analogous result for planar graphs, with a necessary and sufficient hypothesis. Fix $s\ge 40$. Let $G$ be a planar graph, and let $w_0,w_1$ be its $2$ vertices with largest degrees. If there exist disjoint independent sets $I_0, I_1$ such that $|I_0|=\lfloor{n/s}\rfloor$ and $|I_1| = \lfloor{(n+1)/s}\rfloor$ and $w_0,w_1\in I_0\cup I_1$, then $G$ has an equitable $s$-coloring.</description>

      <title>Hardness and Structural Properties of Fuzzy Edge Contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the computational complexity of edge-deletion and edge-contraction problems in fuzzy graphs. For any graph property {\Pi} that is hereditary under contractions (or deletions) and determined by 3-connected components, the corresponding fuzzy edge-deletion (FPED) and fuzzy edge-contraction (FPEC) problems are NP- hard. Our results hold under both fixed-threshold ({\alpha}_0) and all-threshold (\forall {\alpha}) semantics, and apply even to restricted classes of fuzzy graphs such as fuzzy 3-connected or fuzzy bipartite graphs. We further demonstrate that well-known properties, including planarity and series-parallelness, satisfy these conditions, making the fuzzy versions of these classical graph problems computationally intractable. The proofs leverage reductions from classical NP-hard problems and generalize the constructions to the fuzzy setting while preserving key structural properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove strong, explicit diameter bounds for finite simple Lie algebras that parallel Babai's conjecture for finite simple groups. Specifically, we show that any nonabelian finite simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ over $\mathbf{F}_p$ has diameter $O((\log{|\mathfrak{g}|})^D)$ for $D \approx 3.21$ with respect to any generating set. For absolutely simple classical Lie algebras over $\mathbf{F}_p$, we establish the sharper bound $O(\log{|\mathfrak{g}|})$ when the Lie type is fixed and generators are chosen uniformly at random.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The principal left ideal graph of a semigroup is a simple graph whose vertices are the non-zero elements of the semigroup, and two vertices are adjacent if their principal left ideals intersect non-trivially. In this paper, we study the structure of the principal ideal graphs of inverse semigroups, particularly symmetric inverse semigroups. We also introduce the concept of skeletal of a graph and show that the principal ideal graph of an inverse semigroup has a skeletal, which is a simple graph with vertex set as $\mathcal{L}$ classes of non-zero elements. It is also proved that the principal ideal graph of symmetric inverse semigroups has a skeletal which is isomorphic to the intersection graph on the power set of a non-empty set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work analyzes and compares the asymptotic properties of the covariance matrices of vectors of volume power functionals of random Vietoris-Rips complexes, as the intensity of the underlying homogeneous Poisson point process grows. Several key results are established which, in particular, generalize well-known facts on random graphs. Findings regarding rank, definiteness, determinant, eigenspaces, and related decompositions are presented within three distinct regimes. Moreover, we derive stochastic applications of these algebraic properties, leading to interesting results for vectors of volume power functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure groups and monoids of set-theoretic solutions to the Yang-Baxter Equation can be regarded as deformations of free abelian groups resp. monoids. In this work, we obtain explicit formulae for the growth series of the structure groups and monoids of transposition and dihedral quandles, and of the structure groups of permutation quandles. These quandles provide important families of YBE solutions. The intricate nature of our formulae confirms that, while preserving many nice properties of free abelian groups, even the simplest structure groups and monoids are remarkably rich objects. We also establish some structural properties and easily computable normal forms for the monoids considered.</description>

      <title>Almost Commutative Terwilliger Algebras I: The Group Association Scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terwilliger algebras are a subalgebra of a matrix algebra constructed from an association scheme. Rie Tanaka defined what it means for a Terwilliger algebra to be almost commutative and gave five equivalent conditions. In this paper we first determine an equivalent sixth condition for a Terwilliger algebra coming from a commutative Schur ring to be almost commutative. We then provide a classification of which finite groups result in an almost commutative Terwilliger algebra when looking at the group association scheme determined by the conjugacy classes. In particular, we show that all such groups are either abelian, or Camina groups. We then compute the dimension of each Terwilliger algebra, and we also express each of the group association schemes with an almost commutative Terwilliger algebra as a wreath product of the group schemes of finite abelian groups and $1-$class association schemes. Furthermore, we give the non-primary primitive idempotents for each Terwilliger algebra for those groups.</description>

Abstract: Terwilliger algebras are a subalgebra of a matrix algebra constructed from an association scheme. In 2010, Tanaka defined what it means for a Terwilliger algebra to be almost commutative and gave five equivalent conditions for a Terwilliger algebra to be almost commutative. In this paper we look at Terwilliger algebras coming from strong Gelfand pairs $(G,H)$ for a finite group $G$. From such a pair, one can create a Terwilliger algebra using the Schur ring of $H-$classes of elements of $G$. We determine all strong Gelfand pairs that give an Almost Commutative Terwilliger algebra.</description>

      <title>Size-Ramsey numbers of graphs with maximum degree three</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The size-Ramsey number $\hat{r}(H)$ of a graph $H$ is the smallest number of edges a (host) graph $G$ can have, such that for any red/blue colouring of $G$, there is a monochromatic copy of $H$ in $G$. Recently, Conlon, Nenadov and Truji\'c showed that if $H$ is a graph on $n$ vertices and maximum degree three, then $\hat{r}(H) = O(n^{8/5})$, improving upon the upper bound of $n^{5/3 + o(1)}$ by Kohayakawa, R\"odl, Schacht and Szemer\'edi. In this paper we show that $\hat{r}(H)\leq n^{3/2+o(1)}$. While the previously used host graphs were vanilla binomial random graphs, we prove our result using a novel host graph construction. Our bound hits a natural barrier of the existing methods.</description>

      <title>Treewidth of generalized Hamming graph, bipartite Kneser graph and generalized Petersen graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $t,q$ and $n$ be positive integers. Write $[q] = \{1,2,\ldots,q\}$. The generalized Hamming graph $H(t,q,n)$ is the graph whose vertex set is the cartesian product of $n$ copies of $[q]$$(q\ge 2)$, where two vertices are adjacent if their Hamming distance is at most $t$. In particular, $H(1,q,n)$ is the well-known Hamming graph and $H(1,2,n)$ is the hypercube. In 2006, Chandran and Kavitha described the asymptotic value of $tw(H(1,q,n))$, where $tw(G)$ denotes the treewidth of $G$. In this paper, we give the exact pathwidth of $H(t,2,n)$ and show that $tw(H(t,q,n)) = \Theta(tq^n/\sqrt{n})$ when $n$ goes to infinity. Based on those results, we show that the treewidth of bipartite Kneser graph $BK(n,k)$ is $\binom{n}{k} - 1$ when $n$ is sufficient large relative to $k$ and the bounds of $tw(BK(2k+1,k))$ are given. Moreover, we present the bounds of the treewidth of generalized Petersen graph.</description>

      <title>Tighter Bounds on the Expected Absorbing Time of Ungarian Markov Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In $2023$, Defant and Li defined the Ungarian Markov chain $\mathbf{U}_L$ associated to a finite lattice $L$. This Markov chain has state space $L$, and from any state $x \in L$ transitions to the meet of $\{x\} \cup T$, where $T$ is a randomly selected subset of the elements of $L$ covered by $x$. For any lattice $L$, let $\mathcal{E}(L)$ be the expected number of steps until the maximal element of $L$ transitions into the minimal element in the Ungarian Markov chain. We show that $\mathcal{E}(L)$ is linear in $n$ when $L$ is the weak order on the symmetric group $S_n$, and satisfies an $n^{1-o(1)}$ lower bound when $L$ is the $n^\text{th}$ Tamari lattice. This completely resolves a conjecture by Defant and Li and partially resolves another.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the property of a spatial graph of having a leveled embedding and characterize the abstract graphs with this property. We show that all leveled embeddings are free and we compare leveled and paneled (also known as flat) embeddings. Two new graph invariants are introduced: the level number, an invariant for graphs that admit a leveled embedding, and the Hamiltonian level number, an invariant for Hamiltonian graphs. These invariants provide a measure on how far a graph is from being planar. We study the relation between the (Hamiltonian) level number and other graph invariants that minimize the decomposition of a graph in planar subgraphs, namely the thickness and the book thickness of a graph. We characterize graphs with low level number and determine both the level number and the Hamiltonian level number of complete graphs and of complete bipartite graphs.</description>

Abstract: We define and study a natural category of graph limits. The objects are pairs $(\pi,\mu)$, where $\pi$ (the distribution of vertices) is an abstract probability measure on some abstract measurable space $(X,\mathcal{A})$ and $\mu$ (the distribution of edges) is an abstract finite measure on the square $(X,\mathcal{A})^2$. Morphisms are random maps between the underlying measurable spaces which preserve the distribution of vertices as well as the distribution of edges. We also define a convergence notion (inspired by s-convergence) for sequences of graph limits. We apply tools from category theory to prove the compactness of the space of all graph limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for any isomorphism $h: \mathcal{K}_1 \to \mathcal{K}_2$ between pure union-closed families, there exists a hyperisomorphism $H: \bigcup \mathcal{K}_1 \to \bigcup \mathcal{K}_2$ such that $h(A) = \{ H(a) \mid a \in A \}$, for all $A \in \mathcal{K}_1$. Since every union-closed family forms a lattice under inclusion, this result establishes a strong connection between the two frameworks. More precisely, any such family can be uniquely reconstructed from its lattice up to isomorphism. Hence, the lattice representation provides a faithful encoding, offering a perspective that may yield new insights into problems on union-closed families, including Frankl's union-closed sets conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a construction of homotopy invariants of open or closed covers, where the homotopy class is defined relative to a pair $(V,r)$, with $V$ a finite set of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $r$ a point in the interior of their convex hull. We show that the simplicial complex of non-balanced subsets associated with $(V,r)$ has the homotopy type of a sphere, and use this to develop a theory of homotopy invariants of covers relative to balanced sets. A key result is that the homotopy class of a cover depends only, up to an involution, on the balanced-equivalence class of $(V,r)$. As applications, we obtain extension theorems for covers in this setting and derive the KKMS lemma, its analogues, and related combinatorial fixed-point results.</description>

      <title>On expectations and variances in the hard-core model on bounded degree graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the study of the occupancy fraction of the hard-core model in two novel directions. One direction gives a tight lower bound in terms of individual vertex degrees, extending work of Sah, Sawhney, Stoner and Zhao which bounds the partition function. The other bounds the variance of the size of an independent set drawn from the model, which is strictly stronger than bounding the occupancy fraction.
  In the setting of triangle-free graphs, we make progress on a recent conjecture of Buys, van den Heuvel and Kang on extensions of Shearer's classic bounds on the independence number to the occupancy fraction of the hard-core model. Sufficiently strong lower bounds on both the expectation and the variance in triangle-free graphs have the potential to improve the known bounds on the off-diagonal Ramsey number $R(3,t)$, and to shed light on the algorithmic barrier one observes for independent sets in sparse random graphs.</description>

      <title>Words avoiding the morphic images of most of their factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13368v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We say that a finite factor $f$ of a word $w$ is \emph{imaged} if there exists a non-erasing morphism $m$, distinct from the identity, such that $w$ contains $m(f)$. We show that every infinite word contains an imaged factor of length at least 6 and that 6 is best possible. We show that every infinite binary word contains at least 36 distinct imaged factors and that 36 is best possible.</description>

      <title>Remarks on proper conflict-free degree-choosability of graphs with prescribed degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A proper coloring $\phi$ of $G$ is called a proper conflict-free coloring of $G$ if for every non-isolated vertex $v$ of $G$, there is a color $c$ such that $|\phi^{-1}(c)\cap N_G(v)|=1$. As an analogy of degree-choosability of graphs, we introduced the notion of proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+k)$-choosability of graphs. For a non-negative integer $k$, a graph $G$ is proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+k)$-choosable if for any list assignment $L$ of $G$ with $|L(v)|\geq d_G(v)+k$ for every vertex $v\in V(G)$, $G$ admits a proper conflict-free coloring $\phi$ such that $\phi(v)\in L(v)$ for every vertex $v\in V(G)$. In this note, we first remark if a graph $G$ is $d$-degenerate, then $G$ is proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+d+1)$-choosable. Furthermore, when $d=1$, we can reduce the number of colors by showing that every tree is proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+1)$-choosable. This motivates us to state a question.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic 4-AP avoidance in $2$-colorings of $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ for primes $5 \le p \le 997$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $2$-colorings of $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ that avoid monochromatic $4$-term arithmetic progressions for every step $d$ with $p\nmid d$. We completely classify all primes $5\le p\le 997$: such a coloring exists if and only if $p\in\{5,7,11\}$. For larger primes, nonexistence is consistent with lower bounds of Wolf and Lu-Peng on the number of monochromatic 4-APs in $2$-colorings of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ [10,7]. When solutions exist, the minimal period equals $p$, and we enumerate them up to dihedral symmetries and global color swap. The proofs combine residue class checks with small structural observations and SAT certificates for nonexistence [9,5]. All scripts and proof logs are provided for exact reproduction.</description>

      <title>Classification properties for some ternary structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a model-theoretic classification of the countable homogeneous $\mathbf{H}_4$-free 3-hypertournament studied by Cherlin, Hubi\v{c}ka, Kone\v{c}n\'y, and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il. Our main result is that the theory of this structure is $\mathrm{SOP}_3$, $\mathrm{TP}_2$, and $\mathrm{NSOP}_4$. We offer two proofs of this fact: one is a direct proof, and the other employs part of the abstract machinery recently developed by Mutchnik.</description>

      <title>Parameterised algorithms for temporally satisfying reconfiguration problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a static vertex-selection problem (e.g. independent set, dominating set) on a graph, we can define a corresponding temporally satisfying reconfiguration problem on a temporal graph which asks for a sequence of solutions to the vertex-selection problem at each time such that we can reconfigure from one solution to the next. We can think of each solution in the sequence as a set of vertices with tokens placed on them; our reconfiguration model allows us to slide tokens along active edges of a temporal graph at each time-step.
  We show that it is possible to efficiently check whether one solution can be reconfigured to another, and show that approximation results on the static vertex-selection problem can be adapted with a lifetime factor to the reconfiguration version. Our main contributions are fixed-parameter tractable algorithms with respect to: enumeration time of the related static problem; the combination of temporal neighbourhood diversity and lifetime of the input temporal graph; and the combination of lifetime and treewidth of the footprint graph.</description>

      <title>The Likelihood Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An arrangement of hypersurfaces in projective space is strict normal crossing (SNC) if and only if its Euler discriminant is nonzero. We study the critical loci of arbitrary Laurent monomials in the equations of the smooth hypersurfaces. The family of these loci forms an irreducible variety in the product of two projective spaces, known in algebraic statistics as the likelihood correspondence and in particle physics as the scattering correspondence. We establish an explicit determinantal representation for the minimal generators of the bihomogeneous prime ideal that defines this variety.</description>

      <title>k-Planar and Fan-Crossing Drawings and Transductions of Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a two-way connection between FO transductions (first-order logical transformations) of planar graphs, and a certain variant of fan-crossing (fan-planar) drawings of graphs which for bounded-degree graphs essentially reduces to being k-planar for fixed k. For graph classes, this connection allows to derive non-transducibility results from nonexistence of the said drawings and, conversely, from nonexistence of a transduction to derive nonexistence of the said drawings. For example, the class of 3D-grids is not k-planar for any fixed k. We hope that this connection will help to draw a path to a possible proof that not all toroidal graphs are transducible from planar graphs.
  Our characterization can be extended to any fixed surface instead of the plane. The result is based on a very recent characterization of weakly sparse FO transductions of classes of bounded expansion by [Gajarsk\'y, G{\l}adkowski, Jedelsk\'y, Pilipczuk and Toru\'nczyk, arXiv:2505.15655].</description>

      <title>Infinite-Exponent Partition Relations on the Real Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the theory of infinite-exponent partition relations to arbitrary linear order types, with a particular focus on the real number line. We give a complete classification of all consistent partition relations on the real line with countably infinite exponents, and a characterisation of the statement "no uncountable-exponent partition relations hold on the real line", working throughout in ZF without the Axiom of Choice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a one-ended, locally finite, measurable graph on a standard probability space admits a measurable one-ended spanning subtree if and only if it is measure-hyperfinite. This answers a question posed by Bowen, Poulin, and Zomback and extends recent results of Tim\'ar and Conley, Gaboriau, Marks, and Tucker-Drob.</description>
