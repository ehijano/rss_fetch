      <title>An unconditional lower bound for the active-set method in convex quadratic maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the active-set method needs an exponential number of iterations in the worst-case to maximize a convex quadratic function subject to linear constraints, regardless of the pivot rule used. This substantially improves over the best previously known lower bound [IPCO 2025], which needs objective functions of polynomial degrees $\omega(\log d)$ in dimension $d$, to a bound using a convex polynomial of degree 2. In particular, our result firmly resolves the open question [IPCO 2025] of whether a constant degree suffices, and it represents significant progress towards linear objectives, where the active-set method coincides with the simplex method and a lower bound for all pivot rules would constitute a major breakthrough.
  Our result is based on a novel extended formulation, recursively constructed using deformed products. Its key feature is that it projects onto a polygonal approximation of a parabola while preserving all of its exponentially many vertices. We define a quadratic objective that forces the active-set method to follow the parabolic boundary of this projection, without allowing any shortcuts along chords corresponding to edges of its full-dimensional preimage.</description>

      <title>An Exact Solver for Maximizing a Submodular Function Subject to a Knapsack Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of maximizing a monotone increasing submodular function over a set of weighted elements subject to a knapsack constraint.
  Although this problem is NP-hard, many applications require exact solutions, as approximate solutions are often insufficient in practice.
  To address this need, we propose an exact branch-and-bound algorithm tailored for the submodular knapsack problem and introduce several acceleration techniques to enhance its efficiency. We evaluate these techniques on instances of three benchmark problems and compare the proposed solvers to two solvers by Sakaue and Ishihata, which are considered state-of-the-art, demonstrating that the presented methods outperform the existing methods.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic methods of finite discrete structures. Topological graph drawing (part IV)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chapter presents mathematical models intended for creating a topological drawing of a non-separable non-planar graph based on the methods of G. Ringel's vertex rotation theory. The induced system of cycles generates a topological drawing of a certain thickness. A method for determining the location of imaginary vertices by finding the intersection of connections on a plane is presented. A topological drawing of a maximum planar subgraph is used as a basis.</description>

      <title>Unavoidable induced subgraphs in graphs with complete bipartite induced minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that if a graph contains the complete bipartite graph $K_{134, 12}$ as an induced minor, then it contains a cycle of length at most~12 or a theta as an induced subgraph. With a longer and more technical proof, we prove that if a graph contains $K_{3, 4}$ as an induced minor, then it contains a triangle or a theta as an induced subgraph. Here, a \emph{theta} is a graph made of three internally vertex-disjoint chordless paths $P_1 = a \dots b$, $P_2 = a \dots b$, $P_3 = a \dots b$, each of length at least two, such that no edges exist between the paths except the three edges incident to $a$ and the three edges incident to $b$.
  A consequence is that excluding a grid and a complete bipartite graph as induced minors is not enough to guarantee a bounded tree-independence number, or even that the treewidth is bounded by a function of the size of the maximum clique, because the existence of graphs with large treewidth that contain no triangles or thetas as induced subgraphs is already known (the so-called layered wheels).</description>
