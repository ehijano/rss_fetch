      <title>An alternative $\mathbb{Q}$-form of the cyclotomic double shuffle Lie algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an alternative $\mathbb{Q}$-form for Racinet's cyclotomic double shuffle Lie algebra, inspired by the double shuffle relations among congruent multiple zeta values studied by Yuan and Zhao. Our main result establishes an invariance characterization theorem, demonstrating how these two $\mathbb{Q}$-forms can be reconstructed from each other under Galois action.</description>

      <title>Quiver Yangians as Coulomb branch algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a 3D N=4 gauge theory, turning on the $\Omega$-background in RxR$^2_{\epsilon}$ deforms the Coulomb branch chiral ring into the quantum Coulomb branch algebra, generated by the 1/2-BPS monopoles together with the complex scalar in the vector-multiplet. We conjecture that for a 3D N=4 quiver gauge theory with unitary gauge group, the quantum Coulomb branch algebra can be formulated as the truncated shifted quiver Yangian Y$(\widehat{Q},\widehat{W})$ based on the triple quiver $\widehat{Q}$ of the original quiver Q with canonical potential $\widehat{W}$. We check this conjecture explicitly for general tree-type quivers Q by considering the action of monopoles on the 1/2-BPS vortex configurations. The Hilbert spaces of vortices approaching different vacua at spatial infinity furnish different representations of the shifted quiver Yangian, and all the charge functions have only simple poles. For quivers beyond tree-type, our conjecture is consistent with known results on special examples.</description>

      <title>Two invariant subalgebras of rational Cherednik algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Originally motivated by connections to integrable systems, two natural subalgebras of the rational Cherednik algebra have been considered in the literature. The first is the subalgebra generated by all degree zero elements and the second is the Dunkl angular momentum subalgebra. In this article, we study the ring-theoretic and homological properties of these algebras. Our approach is to realise them as rings of invariants under the action of certain reductive subgroups of $\rm SL_2$. This allows us to describe their centres. Moreover, we show that they are Auslander-Gorenstein and Cohen-Macaulay and, at $t = 0$, give rise to prime PI-algebras whose PI-degree we compute. Since the degree zero subalgebra can be realized as the ring of invariants for the maximal torus $\rm T \subset SL_2$ and the action of this torus on the rational Cherednik algebra is Hamiltonian, we also consider its (quantum) Hamiltonian reduction with respect to $\rm T$. At $t = 1$, the quantum Hamiltonian reduction of the spherical subalgebra is a filtered quantization of the quotient of the minimal nilpotent orbit closure $\overline{\mathcal O}_{\min}$ in ${\mathfrak gl}(n)$ by the reflection group $W$. At $t = 0$, we get a graded Poisson deformation of the symplectic singularity $\overline{\mathcal O}_{\min}/W$.</description>

      <title>Into Multiplier Hopf ($*$-)Graph Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09787v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the structures introduced recently by the authors of the current paper concerning the multiplier Hopf $*$-graph algebras and also the Cuntz-Krieger algebras and their relations with the $C^*$-graph algebras, and once again by using the $C^*$-graph algebra constructions associated to our toy example, to initiate our first class of examples concerning the multiplier Hopf $*$-graph algebras.
  At the final part of the paper, we apply our study to the $SL(n)$ case over the field of complex numbers, and prove that $(\mathcal{O}(SL(n),\Delta)$ possesses the initial requirements of being a discrete quantum group in the sense of Van Daele, and propose a direction in approaching one step further to the problem raised by Wang, asking ``if finite groups of Lie type have an analogue of $q$-deformations into finite quantum groups?''.</description>

      <title>A quantum shuffle approach to admissible quantum affine (super-)algebra of types $A_1^{(1)}$ and $C(2)^{(2)}$ and their equitable presentations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03048v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the positive part $U_q^{+}$ of the admissible quantum affine algebra $\mathcal{U}_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{s l}_2})$ newly defined in \cite{HZ} and the quantum affine superalgebra $U_q(C(2)^{(2)})$, which both have presentations with two generators $e_{\alpha}, e_{\delta-\alpha}$ that satisfy the cubic $q$-Serre relations. There are the Damiani and the Beck $PBW$ bases for those two (super)algebras due to Hu-Zhuang and Khoroshkin-Lukierski-Tolstoy, respectively. In this paper, we use $q$-shuffle (super)algebra and Catalan words to express those two bases in closed form. Finally, the equitable presentations of $\mathcal{U}_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2})$ and its bosonization of $U_q(C(2)^{(2)})$ are exhibited.</description>

      <title>Quantum duality maps, skein algebras and their ensemble compatibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19074v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the quantum duality map $\mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}}$ of Allegretti--Kim [AK17] for punctured closed surfaces to general marked surfaces. When the marked surface has no interior marked points, we investigate its compatibility with the quantum duality map $\mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{X}}$ on the dual side based on the quantum bracelets basis [Thu14, MQ23]. Our construction factors through reduced stated skein algebras, based on the quantum trace maps [L\^e18] together with an appropriate way of \emph{skein lifting} of integral $\mathcal{A}$-laminations. We also give skein theoretic proofs for some expected properties of Laurent expressions, and positivity of structure constants for marked disks and a marked annulus.</description>

      <title>A route to quantum computing through the theory of quantum graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13773v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on our previous works, and in order to relate them with the theory of quantum graphs and the quantum computing principles, we once again try to introduce some newly developed technical structures just by relying on our toy example, the coordinate ring of $n\times n$ quantum matrix algebra $M_q(n)$, and the associated directed locally finite graphs $\mathcal{G}(\Pi_n)$, and the Cuntz-Krieger $C^*$-graph algebras. Meaningly, we introduce a $(4i-6)$-qubit quantum system by using the Cuntz-Krieger $\mathcal{G}(\Pi_i)$-families associated to the $4i-6$ distinct Hamiltonian paths of $\mathcal{G}(\Pi_i)$, for $i\in\{2,\cdots,n\}$. We also will present a proof of a claim raised in our previous paper concerning the graph $C^*$-algebra structure and the associated Cuntz-Krieger $\mathcal{G}(\Pi_n)$-families.</description>

      <title>Alternating snake modules and a determinantal formula</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of modules for the quantum affine algebra which include as very special cases both the snake modules and the modules arising from a monoidal categorification of cluster algebras. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for these modules to be prime and prove a unique factorization result. We also give an explicit formula expressing the module as an alternating sum of Weyl modules. Finally, we give an application of our results to classical questions in the category $\mathcal{ O}(\mathfrak{gl}_r)$. Specifically we apply our results to show that there are a large family of non-regular, non-dominant weights $\mu$ for which the non-zero Kazhdan-Lusztig coefficients $c_{\mu, \nu}$ are $\pm 1$.</description>

      <title>Conformal transformations and equivariance in unbounded KK-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend unbounded Kasparov theory to encompass conformal group and quantum group equivariance. This new framework allows us to treat conformal actions on both manifolds and noncommutative spaces. As examples, we present unbounded representatives of Kasparov's $\gamma$-element for the real and complex Lorentz groups and display the conformal $SL_q(2)$-equivariance of the standard spectral triple of the Podle\'s sphere. In pursuing descent for conformally equivariant cycles, we are led to a new framework for representing Kasparov classes. Our new representatives are unbounded, possess a dynamical quality, and also include known twisted spectral triples. We define an equivalence relation on these new representatives whose classes form an abelian group surjecting onto KK. The technical innovation which underpins these results is a novel multiplicative perturbation theory. By these means, we obtain Kasparov classes from the bounded transform with minimal side conditions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sampling for Pauli Measurement-Based Shadow Tomography in Direct Fidelity Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A constant number of random Clifford measurements allows the classical shadow protocol to perform Direct Fidelity Estimation (DFE) with high precision. However, estimating properties of an unknown quantum state is expected to be more feasible with random Pauli measurements than with random Clifford measurements in the near future. Inspired by the importance sampling technique applied to sampling Pauli measurements for DFE, we show that similar strategies can be derived from classical shadows. Specifically, we describe efficient methods using Pauli measurements to perform DFE with GHZ and W states, establishing tighter bounds ($\approx \times 14.22$ for GHZ, $\approx \times 16$ for W) on the number of measurements required for desired precision.</description>
