      <title>Sparse Alignment Enhanced Latent Diffusion Transformer for Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) models have significantly improved speech quality and expressiveness, mainstream systems still suffer from issues related to speech-text alignment modeling: 1) models without explicit speech-text alignment modeling exhibit less robustness, especially for hard sentences in practical applications; 2) predefined alignment-based models suffer from naturalness constraints of forced alignments. This paper introduces \textit{S-DiT}, a TTS system featuring an innovative sparse alignment algorithm that guides the latent diffusion transformer (DiT). Specifically, we provide sparse alignment boundaries to S-DiT to reduce the difficulty of alignment learning without limiting the search space, thereby achieving high naturalness. Moreover, we employ a multi-condition classifier-free guidance strategy for accent intensity adjustment and adopt the piecewise rectified flow technique to accelerate the generation process. Experiments demonstrate that S-DiT achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS speech quality and supports highly flexible control over accent intensity. Notably, our system can generate high-quality one-minute speech with only 8 sampling steps. Audio samples are available at https://sditdemo.github.io/sditdemo/.</description>

      <title>Clip-TTS: Contrastive Text-content and Mel-spectrogram, A High-Huality Text-to-Speech Method based on Contextual Semantic Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional text-to-speech (TTS) methods primarily focus on establishing a mapping between phonemes and mel-spectrograms. However, during the phoneme encoding stage, there is often a lack of real mel-spectrogram auxiliary information, which results in the encoding process lacking true semantic understanding. At the same time, traditional TTS systems often struggle to balance the inference speed of the model with the quality of the synthesized speech. Methods that generate high-quality synthesized speech tend to have slower inference speeds, while faster inference methods often sacrifice speech quality. In this paper, I propose Clip-TTS, a TTS method based on the Clip architecture. This method uses the Clip framework to establish a connection between text content and real mel-spectrograms during the text encoding stage, enabling the text encoder to directly learn the true semantics of the global context, thereby ensuring the quality of the synthesized speech. In terms of model architecture, I adopt the basic structure of Transformer, which allows Clip-TTS to achieve fast inference speeds. Experimental results show that on the LJSpeech and Baker datasets, the speech generated by Clip-TTS achieves state-of-the-art MOS scores, and it also performs excellently on multi-emotion datasets.Audio samples are available at: https://ltydd1314.github.io/.</description>

      <title>CS-Dialogue: A 104-Hour Dataset of Spontaneous Mandarin-English Code-Switching Dialogues for Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a single conversation, presents significant challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Existing Mandarin-English code-switching datasets often suffer from limitations in size, spontaneity, and the lack of full-length dialogue recordings with transcriptions, hindering the development of robust ASR models for real-world conversational scenarios. This paper introduces CS-Dialogue, a novel large-scale Mandarin-English code-switching speech dataset comprising 104 hours of spontaneous conversations from 200 speakers. Unlike previous datasets, CS-Dialogue provides full-length dialogue recordings with complete transcriptions, capturing naturalistic code-switching patterns in continuous speech. We describe the data collection and annotation processes, present detailed statistics of the dataset, and establish benchmark ASR performance using state-of-the-art models. Our experiments, using Transformer, Conformer, and Branchformer, demonstrate the challenges of code-switching ASR, and show that existing pre-trained models such as Whisper still have the space to improve. The CS-Dialogue dataset will be made freely available for all academic purposes.</description>

      <title>DualSpec: Text-to-spatial-audio Generation via Dual-Spectrogram Guided Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-audio (TTA), which generates audio signals from textual descriptions, has received huge attention in recent years. However, recent works focused on text to monaural audio only. As we know, spatial audio provides more immersive auditory experience than monaural audio, e.g. in virtual reality. To address this issue, we propose a text-to-spatial-audio (TTSA) generation framework named DualSpec.Specifically, it first trains variational autoencoders (VAEs) for extracting the latent acoustic representations from sound event audio. Then, given text that describes sound events and event directions, the proposed method uses the encoder of a pretrained large language model to transform the text into text features. Finally, it trains a diffusion model from the latent acoustic representations and text features for the spatial audio generation. In the inference stage, only the text description is needed to generate spatial audio. Particularly, to improve the synthesis quality and azimuth accuracy of the spatial sound events simultaneously, we propose to use two kinds of acoustic features. One is the Mel spectrograms which is good for improving the synthesis quality, and the other is the short-time Fourier transform spectrograms which is good at improving the azimuth accuracy. We provide a pipeline of constructing spatial audio dataset with text prompts, for the training of the VAEs and diffusion model. We also introduce new spatial-aware evaluation metrics to quantify the azimuth errors of the generated spatial audio recordings. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate spatial audio with high directional and event consistency.</description>

      <title>Combining TF-GridNet and Mixture Encoder for Continuous Speech Separation for Meeting Transcription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-life applications of automatic speech recognition (ASR) require processing of overlapped speech. A common method involves first separating the speech into overlap-free streams on which ASR is performed. Recently, TF-GridNet has shown impressive performance in speech separation in real reverberant conditions. Furthermore, a mixture encoder was proposed that leverages the mixed speech to mitigate the effect of separation artifacts. In this work, we extended the mixture encoder from a static two-speaker scenario to a natural meeting context featuring an arbitrary number of speakers and varying degrees of overlap. We further demonstrate its limits by the integration with separators of varying strength including TF-GridNet. Our experiments result in a new state-of-the-art performance on LibriCSS using a single microphone. They show that TF-GridNet largely closes the gap between previous methods and oracle separation independent of mixture encoding. We further investigate the remaining potential for improvement.</description>

      <title>NeuroVoz: a Castillian Spanish corpus of parkinsonian speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The screening of Parkinson's Disease (PD) through speech is hindered by a notable lack of publicly available datasets in different languages. This fact limits the reproducibility and further exploration of existing research.
  To address this gap, this manuscript presents the NeuroVoz corpus consisting of 112 native Castilian-Spanish speakers, including 58 healthy controls and 54 individuals with PD, all recorded in ON state. The corpus showcases a diverse array of speech tasks: sustained vowels; diadochokinetic tests; 16 Listen-and-Repeat utterances; and spontaneous monologues.
  The dataset is also complemented with subjective assessments of voice quality performed by an expert according to the GRBAS scale (Grade/Roughness/Breathiness/Asthenia/Strain), as well as annotations with a thorough examination of phonation quality, intensity, speed, resonance, intelligibility, and prosody.
  The corpus offers a substantial resource for the exploration of the impact of PD on speech. This data set has already supported several studies, achieving a benchmark accuracy of 89% for the screening of PD. Despite these advances, the broader challenge of conducting a language-agnostic, cross-corpora analysis of Parkinsonian speech patterns remains open.</description>

      <title>Breaking Down Power Barriers in On-Device Streaming ASR: Insights and Solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Power consumption plays a crucial role in on-device streaming speech recognition, significantly influencing the user experience. This study explores how the configuration of weight parameters in speech recognition models affects their overall energy efficiency. We found that the influence of these parameters on power consumption varies depending on factors such as invocation frequency and memory allocation. Leveraging these insights, we propose design principles that enhance on-device speech recognition models by reducing power consumption with minimal impact on accuracy. Our approach, which adjusts model components based on their specific energy sensitivities, achieves up to 47% lower energy usage while preserving comparable model accuracy and improving real-time performance compared to leading methods.</description>

      <title>Robots Have Been Seen and Not Heard: Effects of Consequential Sounds on Human-Perception of Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robots make compulsory machine sounds, known as `consequential sounds', as they move and operate. As robots become more prevalent in workplaces, homes and public spaces, understanding how sounds produced by robots affect human-perceptions of these robots is becoming increasingly important to creating positive human robot interactions (HRI). This paper presents the results from 182 participants (858 trials) investigating how human-perception of robots is changed by consequential sounds. In a between-participants study, participants in the sound condition were shown 5 videos of different robots and asked their opinions on the robots and the sounds they made. This was compared to participants in the control condition who viewed silent videos. Consequential sounds correlated with significantly more negative perceptions of robots, including increased negative `associated affects', feeling more distracted, and being less willing to colocate in a shared environment with robots.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Multi-Stuttered Speech Classification: Leveraging Whisper's Encoder for Efficient Parameter Reduction in Automated Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05784v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The automated classification of stuttered speech has significant implications for timely assessments providing assistance to speech language pathologists. Despite notable advancements in the field, the cases in which multiple disfluencies occur in speech require attention. We have taken a progressive approach to fill this gap by classifying multi-stuttered speech more efficiently. The problem has been addressed by firstly curating a dataset of multi-stuttered disfluencies from open source dataset SEP-28k audio clips. Secondly, employing Whisper, a state-of-the-art speech recognition model has been leveraged by using its encoder and taking the problem as multi label classification. Thirdly, using a 6 encoder layer Whisper and experimenting with various layer freezing strategies, a computationally efficient configuration of the model was identified. The proposed configuration achieved micro, macro, and weighted F1-scores of 0.88, 0.85, and 0.87, correspondingly on an external test dataset i.e. Fluency-Bank. In addition, through layer freezing strategies, we were able to achieve the aforementioned results by fine-tuning a single encoder layer, consequently, reducing the model's trainable parameters from 20.27 million to 3.29 million. This research study unveils the contribution of the last encoder layer in the identification of disfluencies in stuttered speech. Consequently, it has led to a computationally efficient approach, 83.7% less parameters to train, making the proposed approach more adaptable for various dialects and languages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present SONIQUE, a model for generating background music tailored to video content. Unlike traditional video-to-music generation approaches, which rely heavily on paired audio-visual datasets, SONIQUE leverages unpaired data, combining royalty-free music and independent video sources. By utilizing large language models (LLMs) for video understanding and converting visual descriptions into musical tags, alongside a U-Net-based conditional diffusion model, SONIQUE enables customizable music generation. Users can control specific aspects of the music, such as instruments, genres, tempo, and melodies, ensuring the generated output fits their creative vision. SONIQUE is open-source, with a demo available online.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Simultaneous Speech-To-Speech Translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Hibiki, a decoder-only model for simultaneous speech translation. Hibiki leverages a multistream language model to synchronously process source and target speech, and jointly produces text and audio tokens to perform speech-to-text and speech-to-speech translation. We furthermore address the fundamental challenge of simultaneous interpretation, which unlike its consecutive counterpart, where one waits for the end of the source utterance to start translating, adapts its flow to accumulate just enough context to produce a correct translation in real-time, chunk by chunk. To do so, we introduce a weakly-supervised method that leverages the perplexity of an off-the-shelf text translation system to identify optimal delays on a per-word basis and create aligned synthetic data. After supervised training, Hibiki performs adaptive, simultaneous speech translation with vanilla temperature sampling. On a French-English simultaneous speech translation task, Hibiki demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in translation quality, speaker fidelity and naturalness. Moreover, the simplicity of its inference process makes it compatible with batched translation and even real-time on-device deployment. We provide examples as well as models and inference code.</description>

      <title>TALKPLAY: Multimodal Music Recommendation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present TalkPlay, a multimodal music recommendation system that reformulates the recommendation task as large language model token generation. TalkPlay represents music through an expanded token vocabulary that encodes multiple modalities - audio, lyrics, metadata, semantic tags, and playlist co-occurrence. Using these rich representations, the model learns to generate recommendations through next-token prediction on music recommendation conversations, that requires learning the associations natural language query and response, as well as music items. In other words, the formulation transforms music recommendation into a natural language understanding task, where the model's ability to predict conversation tokens directly optimizes query-item relevance. Our approach eliminates traditional recommendation-dialogue pipeline complexity, enabling end-to-end learning of query-aware music recommendations. In the experiment, TalkPlay is successfully trained and outperforms baseline methods in various aspects, demonstrating strong context understanding as a conversational music recommender.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank and Sparse Model Merging for Multi-Lingual Speech Recognition and Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language diversity presents a significant challenge in speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, such as automatic speech recognition and translation. Traditional multi-task training approaches aim to address this by jointly optimizing multiple speech recognition and translation tasks across various languages. While models like Whisper, built on these strategies, demonstrate strong performance, they still face issues of high computational cost, language interference, suboptimal training configurations, and limited extensibility. To overcome these challenges, we introduce LoRS-Merging (low-rank and sparse model merging), a novel technique designed to efficiently integrate models trained on different languages or tasks while preserving performance and reducing computational overhead. LoRS-Merging combines low-rank and sparse pruning to retain essential structures while eliminating redundant parameters, mitigating language and task interference, and enhancing extensibility. Experimental results across a range of languages demonstrate that LoRS-Merging reduces the word error rate by 10% and improves BLEU scores by 4% compared to conventional multi-lingual multi-task training baselines. Our findings suggest that model merging, particularly LoRS-Merging, is a scalable and effective complement to traditional multi-lingual training strategies for S2T applications.</description>

Abstract: We introduce NotaGen, a symbolic music generation model aiming to explore the potential of producing high-quality classical sheet music. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), NotaGen adopts pre-training, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning paradigms (henceforth referred to as the LLM training paradigms). It is pre-trained on 1.6M pieces of music, and then fine-tuned on approximately 9K high-quality classical compositions conditioned on "period-composer-instrumentation" prompts. For reinforcement learning, we propose the CLaMP-DPO method, which further enhances generation quality and controllability without requiring human annotations or predefined rewards. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of CLaMP-DPO in symbolic music generation models with different architectures and encoding schemes. Furthermore, subjective A/B tests show that NotaGen outperforms baseline models against human compositions, greatly advancing musical aesthetics in symbolic music generation.</description>
