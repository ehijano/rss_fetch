      <title>Shrinkage MMSE estimators of covariances beyond the zero-mean and stationary variance assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tackle covariance estimation in low-sample scenarios, employing a structured covariance matrix with shrinkage methods. These involve convexly combining a low-bias/high-variance empirical estimate with a biased regularization estimator, striking a bias-variance trade-off. Literature provides optimal settings of the regularization amount through risk minimization between the true covariance and its shrunk counterpart. Such estimators were derived for zero-mean statistics with i.i.d. diagonal regularization matrices accounting for the average sample variance solely. We extend these results to regularization matrices accounting for the sample variances both for centered and non-centered samples. In the latter case, the empirical estimate of the true mean is incorporated into our shrinkage estimators. Introducing confidence weights into the statistics also enhance estimator robustness against outliers. We compare our estimators to other shrinkage methods both on numerical simulations and on real data to solve a detection problem in astronomy.</description>

      <title>FOXSI-2: Upgrades of the Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager for its Second Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI) sounding rocket payload flew for the second time on 2014 December 11. To enable direct Hard X-Ray (HXR) imaging spectroscopy, FOXSI makes use of grazing-incidence replicated focusing optics combined with fine-pitch solid-state detectors. FOXSI's first flight provided the first HXR focused images of the Sun. For FOXSI's second flight several updates were made to the instrument including updating the optics and detectors as well as adding a new Solar Aspect and Alignment System (SAAS). This paper provides an overview of these updates as well as a discussion of their measured performance.</description>

      <title>A Field-Mill Proxy Climatology for the Lightning Launch Commit Criteria at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and NASA Kennedy Space Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lightning Launch Commit Criteria (LLCC) are a set of complex rules to avoid natural and rocket-triggered lightning strikes to in-flight space launch vehicles. The LLCC are the leading source of scrubs and delays to space launches from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) and NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC). An LLCC climatology would be useful for designing launch concept of operations, mission planning, long-range forecasting, training, and setting LLCC improvement priorities. Unfortunately, an LLCC climatology has not been available for CCAFS/KSC. Attempts have been made to develop such a climatology, but they have not been entirely successful. The main shortfall has been the lack of a long continuous record of LLCC evaluations. Even though CCAFS/KSC is the world's busiest spaceport, the record of LLCC evaluations is not detailed enough to create the climatology. As a potential solution, the research in this study developed a proxy climatology of LLCC violations by using the long continuous record of surface electric field mills at CCAFS/KSC.</description>

      <title>The \v{d}Alembert solution in hyperboloidal foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explicitly construct the analogue of the \v{d}Alembert solution to the 1+1 wave equation in an hyperboloidal setting. This hyperboloidal \v{d}Alembert solution is used, in turn, to gain intuition into the behaviour of solutions to the wave equation in a hyperboloidal foliation and to explain some apparently anomalous behaviour observed in numerically constructed solutions discussed in the literature.</description>

      <title>HST Survey of the Orion Nebula Cluster in ACS/Visible and WFC3/IR Bands. IV. A Bayesian multicolor study of stellar parameters in the ONC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have performed a comprehensive study of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) combining the photometric data obtained by the two \textit{HST} Treasury programs that targeted this region. To consistently analyze the rich dataset obtained in a wide variety of filters, we adopted a Bayesian approach to fit the Spectral Energy Distribution of the sources, deriving mass, age, extinction, distance, and accretion for each source in the region. The three dimensional study of mass distribution for bona-fide cluster members shows that mass segregation in the ONC extends to sub-solar masses, while the age distribution strongly supports the idea that star formation in the ONC is best described by a major episode of star formation that happened $\sim 1$ Myr ago. For masses $\gtrsim 0.1$ \Msun, our derived empirical initial mass function (IMF) is in good agreement with a Chabrier system IMF. Both the accretion luminosity (\Lacc) and mass accretion rates (\dMacc) are best described by broken power-law relations. This suggests that for the majority of young circumstellar disks in this cluster the excess emission may be dominated by X-ray-driven photoevaporation by the central star rather than external photoevaporation. If this is the case, the slopes of the power-law relations may be largely determined by the initial conditions set at the onset of the star formation process, which may be quite similar between regions that eventually form clusters of different sizes.</description>

      <title>Calibration of VELC detectors on-board Aditya-L1 mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aditya-L1 is the first Indian space mission to explore the Sun and solar atmosphere with seven multi-wavelength payloads, with Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) being the prime payload. It is an internally occulted coronagraph with four channels to image the Sun at 5000 \AA~ in the field of view 1.05 - 3 \rsun, and to pursue spectroscopy at 5303 \AA, 7892 \AA~ and 10747 \AA~ channels in the FOV (1.05 - 1.5 \rsun). In addition, spectropolarimetry is planned at 10747 \AA~ channel. Therefore, VELC has three sCMOS detectors and one InGaAs detector. In this article, we aim to describe the technical details and specifications of the detectors achieved by way of thermo-vacuum calibration at the CREST campus of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore, India. Furthermore, we report the estimated conversion gain, full-well capacity, and readout noise at different temperatures. Based on the numbers, it is thus concluded that it is essential to operate the sCMOS detectors and InGaAs detectors at $-5^{\circ}$ and $-17^{\circ}$ C, respectively, at the spacecraft level.</description>

      <title>Radon Concentration Measurement with a High-Sensitivity Radon Detector at the Yemilab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radiation emitted from radon is a critical background in rare event search experiments conducted at the Yemi Underground Laboratory (Yemilab) in Jeongseon, Korea. A Radon Reduction System(RRS) has been developed and installed in Yemilab to reduce radon concentration in the air. The RRS primarily provides a purified air of 50 m3/h to the cleanroom used to assemble crystal detectors in the AMoRE, a neutrinoless double beta decay search experiment. RRS can reduce the radon level by a factor of 300, so a high-sensitivity radon detector was required. A highly sensitive radon detector was constructed using a 70 L chamber with a large PIN photodiode to measure radon concentration in the purified air. The radon detector shows an excellent resolution of 72 keV (FWHM) for 6.003 MeV alphas from 218Po decay and a sensitivity down to 23.8 +- 2.1 mBq/m3 with a boil-off N2 gas sample. The radon concentration level from the RRS measured by the radon detector was below 0.29 Bq/m3 with a reduction factor of about 300.</description>

      <title>Automated Discovery of Anomalous Features in Ultra-Large Planetary Remote Sensing Datasets using Variational Autoencoders</title>

Abstract: The NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) has returned petabytes of lunar high spatial resolution surface imagery over the past decade, impractical for humans to fully review manually. Here we develop an automated method using a deep generative visual model that rapidly retrieves scientifically interesting examples of LRO surface imagery representing the first planetary image anomaly detector. We give quantitative experimental evidence that our method preferentially retrieves anomalous samples such as notable geological features and known human landing and spacecraft crash sites. Our method addresses a major capability gap in planetary science and presents a novel way to unlock insights hidden in ever-increasing remote sensing data archives, with numerous applications to other science domains. We publish our code and data along with this paper.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Optical Wavelength Data on Atmospheric Retrievals of Exoplanet Transmission Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanet transmission spectra provide rich information about the chemical composition, clouds and temperature structure of exoplanet atmospheres. Most exoplanet transmission spectra only span infrared wavelengths ($\gtrsim$ 1 $\rm{\mu m}$), which can preclude crucial atmospheric information from shorter wavelengths. Here, we explore how retrieved atmospheric parameters from exoplanet transmission spectra change with the addition of optical data. From a sample of 14 giant planets with transit spectra from 0.3-4.5 $\rm{\mu m}$, primarily from the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes, we apply a free chemistry retrieval to planetary spectra for wavelength ranges of 0.3-4.5 $\rm{\mu m}$, 0.6-4.5 $\rm{\mu m}$, and 1.1-4.5 $\rm{\mu m}$. We analyse the posterior distributions of these retrievals and perform an information content analysis, finding wavelengths below 0.6 $\rm{\mu m}$ are necessary to constrain cloud scattering slope parameters ($\log{a}$ and $\gamma$) and alkali species Na and K. There is limited improvement in the constraints on the remaining atmospheric parameters. Across the population, we find limb temperatures are retrieved colder than planetary equilibrium temperatures but have an overall good agreement with Global Circulation Models. As JWST extends to a minimum wavelength of 0.6 $\rm{\mu m}$, we demonstrate that exploration into complementing JWST observations with optical HST data is important to further our understanding of aerosol properties and alkali abundances in exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>SIDE-real: Truncated marginal neural ratio estimation for Supernova Ia Dust Extinction with real data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first fully simulation-based hierarchical analysis of the light curves of a population of low-redshift type Ia supernovae (SNae Ia). Our hardware-accelerated forward model, released in the Python package slicsim, includes stochastic variations of each SN's spectral flux distribution (based on the pre-trained BayeSN model), extinction from dust in the host and in the Milky Way, redshift, and realistic instrumental noise. By utilising truncated marginal neural ratio estimation (TMNRE), a neural network-enabled simulation-based inference technique, we implicitly marginalise over 4000 latent variables (for a set of $\approx 100$ SNae Ia) to efficiently infer SN Ia absolute magnitudes and host-galaxy dust properties at the population level while also constraining the parameters of individual objects. Amortisation of the inference procedure allows us to obtain coverage guarantees for our results through Bayesian validation and frequentist calibration. Furthermore, we show a detailed comparison to full likelihood-based inference, implemented through Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, on simulated data and then apply TMNRE to the light curves of 86 SNae Ia from the Carnegie Supernova Project, deriving marginal posteriors in excellent agreement with previous work. Given its ability to accommodate arbitrarily complex extensions to the forward model -- e.g. different populations based on host properties, redshift evolution, complicated photometric redshift estimates, selection effects, and non-Ia contamination -- without significant modifications to the inference procedure, TMNRE has the potential to become the tool of choice for cosmological parameter inference from future, large SN Ia samples.</description>

      <title>Novelty Detection on Radio Astronomy Data using Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce SigNova, a new semi-supervised framework for detecting anomalies in streamed data. While our initial examples focus on detecting radio-frequency interference (RFI) in digitized signals within the field of radio astronomy, it is important to note that SigNova's applicability extends to any type of streamed data. The framework comprises three primary components. Firstly, we use the signature transform to extract a canonical collection of summary statistics from observational sequences. This allows us to represent variable-length visibility samples as finite-dimensional feature vectors. Secondly, each feature vector is assigned a novelty score, calculated as the Mahalanobis distance to its nearest neighbor in an RFI-free training set. By thresholding these scores we identify observation ranges that deviate from the expected behavior of RFI-free visibility samples without relying on stringent distributional assumptions. Thirdly, we integrate this anomaly detector with Pysegments, a segmentation algorithm, to localize consecutive observations contaminated with RFI, if any. This approach provides a compelling alternative to classical windowing techniques commonly used for RFI detection. Importantly, the complexity of our algorithm depends on the RFI pattern rather than on the size of the observation window. We demonstrate how SigNova improves the detection of various types of RFI (e.g., broadband and narrowband) in time-frequency visibility data. We validate our framework on the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) telescope and simulated data and the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA).</description>

      <title>Exploring Time Delay Interferometry Ranging as a Practical Ranging Approach in the Bayesian Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time Delay Interferometry (TDI) is an indispensable step in the whole data processing procedure of space-based gravitational wave detection, as it mitigates the overwhelming laser frequency noise, which would otherwise completely bury the gravitational wave signals. Knowledge on the inter-spacecraft optical paths (i.e. delays) is one of the key elements of TDI. Conventional method for inter-spacecraft ranging mainly relies on the pseudo-random noise (PRN) code signal modulated onto the lasers. To ensure the reliability and robustness of this ranging information, it would be highly beneficial to develop other methods which could serve as cross-validations or backups. This paper explores the practical implementation of an alternative data-driven approach - time delay interferometry ranging (TDIR) - as a ranging technique independent of the PRN signal. Distinguished from previous research, our TDIR algorithm significantly relaxes the stringent requirement for clock synchronization imposed by traditional TDI procedure. By framing TDIR as a Bayesian parameter estimation problem and employing a general polynomial parametrization, we demonstrate our algorithm with simulated data based on the numerical orbit of Taiji. In the presence of laser frequency noise and secondary noises, the estimated median values of delays are only 5.28 ns away from the ground truths, capable of suppressing laser frequency noise to the desired level. Additionally, we have also analysed the requirements of mitigating optical bench noise and clock noise on TDIR, and presented an illustrative example for the impact of laser locking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High angular resolution imaging is an increasingly important capability in contemporary astrophysics. Of particular relevance to emerging fields such as the characterisation of exoplanetary systems, imaging at the required spatial scales and contrast levels results in forbidding challenges in the correction of atmospheric phase errors, which in turn drives demanding requirements for precise wavefront sensing. Asgard is the next-generation instrument suite at the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), targeting advances in sensitivity, spectral resolution and nulling interferometry. In this paper, we describe the requirements and designs of three core modules: Heimdallr, a beam combiner for fringe tracking, low order wavefront correction and visibility science; Baldr, a Zernike wavefront sensor to correct high order atmospheric aberrations; and Solarstein, an alignment and calibration unit. In addition, we draw generalisable insights for designing such system and discuss integration plans.</description>

      <title>The Aemulus Project VI: Emulation of beyond-standard galaxy clustering statistics to improve cosmological constraints</title>

Abstract: There is untapped cosmological information in galaxy redshift surveys in the non-linear regime. In this work, we use the AEMULUS suite of cosmological $N$-body simulations to construct Gaussian process emulators of galaxy clustering statistics at small scales ($0.1-50 \: h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$) in order to constrain cosmological and galaxy bias parameters. In addition to standard statistics -- the projected correlation function $w_\mathrm{p}(r_\mathrm{p})$, the redshift-space monopole of the correlation function $\xi_0(s)$, and the quadrupole $\xi_2(s)$ -- we emulate statistics that include information about the local environment, namely the underdensity probability function $P_\mathrm{U}(s)$ and the density-marked correlation function $M(s)$. This extends the model of AEMULUS III for redshift-space distortions by including new statistics sensitive to galaxy assembly bias. In recovery tests, we find that the beyond-standard statistics significantly increase the constraining power on cosmological parameters of interest: including $P_\mathrm{U}(s)$ and $M(s)$ improves the precision of our constraints on $\Omega_m$ by 27%, $\sigma_8$ by 19%, and the growth of structure parameter, $f \sigma_8$, by 12% compared to standard statistics. We additionally find that scales below $\sim6 \: h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ contain as much information as larger scales. The density-sensitive statistics also contribute to constraining halo occupation distribution parameters and a flexible environment-dependent assembly bias model, which is important for extracting the small-scale cosmological information as well as understanding the galaxy-halo connection. This analysis demonstrates the potential of emulating beyond-standard clustering statistics at small scales to constrain the growth of structure as a test of cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>The JWST Early Release Science Program for Direct Observations of Exoplanetary Systems IV: NIRISS Aperture Masking Interferometry Performance and Lessons Learned</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a performance analysis for the aperture masking interferometry (AMI) mode on board the James Webb Space Telescope Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (JWST/NIRISS). Thanks to self-calibrating observables, AMI accesses inner working angles down to and even within the classical diffraction limit. The scientific potential of this mode has recently been demonstrated by the Early Release Science (ERS) 1386 program with a deep search for close-in companions in the HIP 65426 exoplanetary system. As part of ERS 1386, we use the same data set to explore the random, static, and calibration errors of NIRISS AMI observables. We compare the observed noise properties and achievable contrast to theoretical predictions. We explore possible sources of calibration errors and show that differences in charge migration between the observations of HIP 65426 and point-spread function calibration stars can account for the achieved contrast curves. Lastly, we use self-calibration tests to demonstrate that with adequate calibration NIRISS F380M AMI can reach contrast levels of $\sim9-10$ mag at $\gtrsim \lambda/D$. These tests lead us to observation planning recommendations and strongly motivate future studies aimed at producing sophisticated calibration strategies taking these systematic effects into account. This will unlock the unprecedented capabilities of JWST/NIRISS AMI, with sensitivity to significantly colder, lower-mass exoplanets than lower-contrast ground-based AMI setups, at orbital separations inaccessible to JWST coronagraphy.</description>

      <title>Improved Weak Lensing Photometric Redshift Calibration via StratLearn and Hierarchical Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrepancies between cosmological parameter estimates from cosmic shear surveys and from recent Planck cosmic microwave background measurements challenge the ability of the highly successful $\Lambda$CDM model to describe the nature of the Universe. To rule out systematic biases in cosmic shear survey analyses, accurate redshift calibration within tomographic bins is key. In this paper, we improve photo-$z$ calibration via Bayesian hierarchical modeling of full galaxy photo-$z$ conditional densities, by employing $\textit{StratLearn}$, a recently developed statistical methodology, which accounts for systematic differences in the distribution of the spectroscopic training/source set and the photometric target set. Using realistic simulations that were designed to resemble the KiDS+VIKING-450 dataset, we show that $\textit{StratLearn}$-estimated conditional densities improve the galaxy tomographic bin assignment, and that our $\textit{StratLearn}$-Bayesian framework leads to nearly unbiased estimates of the target population means. This leads to a factor of $\sim 2$ improvement upon the previously best photo-$z$ calibration method. Our approach delivers a maximum bias per tomographic bin of $\Delta \langle z \rangle = 0.0095 \pm 0.0089$, with an average absolute bias of $0.0052 \pm 0.0067$ across the five tomographic bins.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: impact of bandpass, polarization angle and calibration uncertainties on small-scale power spectrum analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects due to mismatches in passbands, polarization angles, and temperature and polarization calibrations in the context of the upcoming cosmic microwave background experiment Simons Observatory (SO). Using the SO multi-frequency likelihood, we estimate the bias and the degradation of constraining power in cosmological and astrophysical foreground parameters assuming different levels of knowledge of the instrumental effects. We find that incorrect but reasonable assumptions on the values of all the systematics examined here can have important effects in cosmological analyses, hence requiring marginalization approaches at likelihood level. When doing so, we find that the most relevant effect is due to bandpass shifts. When marginalizing over them, the posteriors of parameters describing astrophysical microwave foregrounds (such as radio point sources or dust) get degraded, while cosmological parameters constraints are not significantly affected. Marginalization over polarization angles with up to 0.25$^\circ$ uncertainty causes an irrelevant bias $\lesssim 0.05 \sigma$ in all parameters. Marginalization over calibration factors in polarization broadens the constraints on the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_\mathrm{eff}$ by a factor 1.2, interpreted here as a proxy parameter for non standard model physics targeted by high-resolution CMB measurements.</description>
