      <title>Boson peak in covalent network glasses: Isostaticity and marginal stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The boson peak (BP) stands as a key feature in understanding glasses and amorphous materials. It directly underlies their anomalous material properties, including thermal behaviors such as excess specific heat and low thermal conductivity, as well as mechanical characteristics such as nonaffine elasticity and fragile plasticity. Despite its importance, understanding of the BP remains limited in covalent network glasses. The most promising concepts are isostaticity and marginal stability, which have been established in theories of rigidity percolation and the jamming transition. While these concepts, supported by comprehensive data, account for the BP in packing-based glasses, comparable explanations have not yet been demonstrated for covalent network glasses. Here we study silica glass, a prototypical covalent network glass, using molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the BP in silica glass is governed by near-isostatic constraints and marginal stability, supporting their universality across diverse glassy systems. Furthermore, we reveal that these principles manifest as a wavenumber-independent band in the dynamical structure factor, and we demonstrate consistency with inelastic X-ray scattering data on silica glass. Our results provide a unified, experimentally testable framework for deciphering the BP and for refining the interpretation of scattering data in amorphous materials.</description>

      <title>The total energy approach for calculating the specific heat of liquids and glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent development of the calculation of specific heat ($C$) of liquids and glasses by first-principles molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is reviewed. Liquid and glass states have common properties in that there is no periodicity and the atom relaxation has an important role in their thermodynamic properties. These properties have, for a long time, hindered the construction of an appropriate theory of $C$ for these states. The total energy approach based on the density-functional theory (DFT) provides a universal method to calculate $C$, irrespective of the material states. However, aside from the convergence problem, even DFT-based MD simulations give different values for a thermodynamic property of liquids and glasses, depending on the setup of MD simulations. The essential problem is atom relaxation, which affects the relationship between the energy and temperature $T$. The temperature is determined by the equilibrium state, but there are many metastable states for glasses. Metastable states are stable within their relaxation times. We encounter the difficult problem of hysteresis, which is the most profound consequence of irreversibility. Irreversibility occurs even for quasistatic processes. This is the most difficult and confusing point in the thermodynamics literature. Here, a consistent treatment of both equilibrium properties and irreversibility in adiabatic MD simulations, which has no frictional term, is given by taking multi-timescales into account. A leading principle to determine the equilibrium is provided by the second law of thermodynamics. The basic ideas and the usefulness of the total energy approach in real calculations are presented.</description>

      <title>A Replica Stoner Theory for Dirty Ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the effect of disorder on a ferromagnetic metal with repulsive interactions. We assume that, in the clean limit, the ferromagnetic state can be described by Stoner mean-field theory and study how disorder affects the the system by using a combined replica + Stoner mean-field approach. At zero temperature, we find that a replica-symmetric ferromagnetic mean-field solution exists in the presence of disorder with a modified Stoner criteria where the ferromagnetism is enhanced by disorder. At finite temperature, a Landau theory is employed to construct the phase diagram, revealing that beyond a critical disorder strength, a spin-glass phase may exist between the high-temperature paramagnetic phase and the low-temperature ferromagnetic phase. For weak (repulsive) interaction where the system is non-ferromagnetic in the clean limit, the possibility of a disordered-induced ferromagnetic ground state is observed both at zero temperature and finite temperature. The potential applicability of this framework to realistic materials is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Microscopic and collective signatures of feature learning in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature extraction - the ability to identify relevant properties of data - is a key factor underlying the success of deep learning. Yet, it has proved difficult to elucidate its nature within existing predictive theories, to the extent that there is no consensus on the very definition of feature learning. A promising hint in this direction comes from previous phenomenological observations of quasi-universal aspects in the training dynamics of neural networks, displayed by simple properties of feature geometry. We address this problem within a statistical-mechanics framework for Bayesian learning in one hidden layer neural networks with standard parameterization. Analytical computations in the proportional limit (when both the network width and the size of the training set are large) can quantify fingerprints of feature learning, both collective ones (related to manifold geometry) and microscopic ones (related to the weights). In particular, (i) the distance between different class manifolds in feature space is a nonmonotonic function of the temperature, which we interpret as the equilibrium counterpart of a phenomenon observed under gradient descent (GD) dynamics, and (ii) the microscopic learnable parameters in the network undergo a finite data-dependent displacement with respect to the infinite-width limit, and develop correlations. These results indicate that nontrivial feature learning is at play in a regime where the posterior predictive distribution is that of Gaussian process regression with a trivially rescaled prior.</description>

      <title>Prediction of EDS Maps from 4DSTEM Diffraction Patterns Using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between atomic structure (order) and chemical composition (chemistry) is critical for advancing materials science, yet traditional spectroscopic techniques can be slow and damaging to sensitive samples. Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) captures detailed diffraction patterns across scanned regions, providing rich structural information, while energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) offers complementary chemical data. In this work, we develop a machine learning framework that predicts EDS spectra directly from 4D-STEM diffraction patterns, reducing beam exposure and acquisition time. A convolutional neural network (CNN) accurately infers elemental compositions, particularly for elements with strong diffraction contrast or higher concentrations, such as Oxygen and Tellurium. Both extrapolation and interpolation strategies demonstrate consistent performance, with improved predictions when additional structural context is available. Visual and cross-correlation analyses confirm the model's ability to capture global and local compositional trends. This approach establishes a data-driven pathway to non-destructive, high-throughput materials characterization.</description>

      <title>Stability of many-body localization in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered quantum many-body systems pose one of the central challenges in condensed matter physics and quantum information science, as their dynamics are generally intractable for classical computation. Many-body localization (MBL), hypothesized to evade thermalization indefinitely under strong disorder, exemplifies this difficulty. Here, we study the stability of MBL in two dimensions using ultracold atoms in optical lattices with variable system sizes up to $24\times 24$ sites, well beyond the classically simulable regime. Using the imbalance as a probe, we trace the long-time dynamics under two distinctive disorder potentials: quasiperiodic and random disorder. For random disorder, the MBL crossover point shifts to higher disorder strength with increasing system size, consistent with the avalanche scenario. In contrast, with quasiperiodic disorder, we observe no clear system size dependence, suggesting possible stability of MBL in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Renormalizable Graph Embeddings For Multi-Scale Network Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In machine learning, graph embedding algorithms seek low-dimensional representations of the input network data, thereby allowing for downstream tasks on compressed encodings. Recently, within the framework of network renormalization, multi-scale embeddings that remain consistent under an arbitrary aggregation of nodes onto block-nodes, and consequently under an arbitrary change of resolution of the input network data, have been proposed. Here we investigate such multi-scale graph embeddings in the modified context where the input network is not entirely observable, due to data limitations or privacy constraints. This situation is typical for financial and economic networks, where connections between individual banks or firms are hidden due to confidentiality, and one has to probabilistically reconstruct the underlying network from aggregate information. We first consider state-of-the-art network reconstruction techniques based on the maximum-entropy principle, which is designed to operate optimally at a fixed resolution level. We then discuss the limitations of these methods when they are used as graph embeddings to yield predictions across different resolution levels. Finally, we propose their natural 'renormalizable' counterparts derived from the distinct principle of scale invariance, yielding consistent graph embeddings for multi-scale network reconstruction. We illustrate these methods on national economic input-output networks and on international trade networks, which can be naturally represented at multiple levels of industrial and geographic resolution, respectively.</description>

      <title>Multicritical Infection Spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The contact process is a simple infection spreading model showcasing an out-of-equilibrium phase transition between a macroscopically active and an inactive phase. Such absorbing state phase transitions are often sensitive to the presence of quenched disorder. Traditionally, a phase transition in the disordered contact process is either triggered by dilution or by locally varying the infection rate. However, when both factors play an important role, a multicritical point emerges that remains poorly understood. Here, we study the multicritical contact process by large-scale Monte Carlo simulations in two and three dimensions. The multicritical behavior is found to be universal and exhibits ultra-slow, activated dynamical scaling, with exponents consistent with those predicted by the strong disorder renormalization group method. This finding indicates that the multicritical contact process belongs to the same universality class as the multicritical quantum Ising model, opening future directions to measure quantum entanglement properties via classical simulations.</description>

      <title>Distinct weak asymmetric interactions shape human brain functions as probability fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The functional computation of the human brain arises from the collective behaviour of the underlying neural network. The emerging technology enables the recording of population activity in neurons, and the theory of neural networks is expected to explain and extract functional computations from the data. Thermodynamically, a large proportion of the whole-body energy is consumed by the brain, and functional computation of the human brain seems to involve high energy consumption. The human brain, however, does not increase its energy consumption with its function, and most of its energy consumption is not involved in specific brain function: how can the human brain perform its wide repertoire of functional computations without drastically changing its energy consumption? Here, we present a mechanism to perform functional computation by subtle modification of the interaction network among the brain regions. We first show that, by analyzing the data of spontaneous and task-induced whole-cerebral-cortex activity, the probability fluxes, which are the microscopic irreversible measure of state transitions, exhibit unique patterns depending on the task being performed, indicating that the human brain function is a distinct sequence of the brain state transitions. We then fit the parameters of Ising spin systems with asymmetric interactions, where we reveal that the symmetric interactions among the brain regions are strong and task-independent, but the antisymmetric interactions are subtle and task-dependent, and the inferred model reproduces most of the observed probability flux patterns. Our results indicate that the human brain performs its functional computation by subtly modifying the antisymmetric interaction among the brain regions, which might be possible with a small amount of energy.</description>

      <title>Activity propagation with Hebbian learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of Hebbian learning on the contact process, a paradigmatic model for infection spreading, which has been also proposed as a simple model to capture the dynamics of inter-regional brain activity propagation as well as population spreading. Each of these contexts calls for an extension of the contact process with local learning. We introduce Hebbian learning as a positive or negative reinforcement of the activation rate between a pair of sites after each successful activation event. Learning can happen either in both directions motivated by social distancing (mutual learning model), or in only one of the directions motivated by brain and population dynamics (source or target learning models). Hebbian learning leads to a rich class of emergent behavior, where local incentives can lead to the opposite global effects. In general, positive reinforcement (increasing activation rates) leads to a loss of the active phase, while negative reinforcement (reducing activation rates) can turn the inactive phase into a globally active phase. In two dimensions and above, the effect of negative reinforcement is twofold: it promotes the spreading of activity, but at the same time gives rise to the appearance of effectively immune regions, entailing the emergence of two distinct critical points. Positive reinforcement can lead to Griffiths effects with non-universal power-law scaling, through the formation of random loops of activity, a manifestation of the ``ant mill" phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Solvable Quantum Circuits in Tree+1 Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We devise tractable models of unitary quantum many-body dynamics on tree graphs, as a first step towards a deeper understanding of dynamics in non-Euclidean spaces. To this end, we first demonstrate how to construct strictly local quantum circuits that preserve the symmetries of trees, such that their dynamical light cones grow isotropically. For trees with coordination number z, such circuits can be built from z-site gates. We then introduce a family of gates for which the dynamics is exactly solvable; these satisfy a set of constraints that we term 'tree-unitarity'. Notably, tree-unitarity reduces to the previously-established notion of dual-unitarity for z = 2, when the tree reduces to a line. Among the unexpected features of tree-unitarity is a trade-off between 'maximum butterfly velocity' dynamics of out-of-time-order correlators and the existence of non-vanishing correlation functions in multiple directions, a tension absent in one-dimensional dual-unitary models and their Euclidean generalizations. We connect the existence of (a wide class of) solvable dynamics with non-maximal butterfly velocity directly to a property of the underlying circuit geometry called $\delta$-hyperbolicity, and argue that such dynamics can only arise in non-Euclidean geometries. We give various examples of tree-unitary gates, discuss dynamical correlations, out-of-time-order correlators, and entanglement growth, and show that the kicked Ising model on a tree is a physically-motivated example of maximum-velocity tree-unitary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions between Accuracy Regimes in L2 regularized Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Increasing the L2 regularization of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) causes a first-order phase transition into the under-parametrized phase -- the so-called onset-of learning. We explain this transition via the scalar (Ricci) curvature of the error landscape. We predict new transition points as the data complexity is increased and, in accordance with the theory of phase transitions, the existence of hysteresis effects. We confirm both predictions numerically. Our results provide a natural explanation of the recently discovered phenomenon of '\emph{grokking}' as DNN models getting stuck in a local minimum of the error surface, corresponding to a lower accuracy phase. Our work paves the way for new probing methods of the intrinsic structure of DNNs in and beyond the L2 context.</description>

      <title>Structure-Dynamics Correlation and Its Link to Fragility and Dynamic Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12773v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between structure, dynamics, and fragility, the rate at which the relaxation time grows with decreasing temperature, is central to unravelling the glass transition. Fragility is often associated with dynamic heterogeneity, implying that if structure influences dynamics, more fragile systems should exhibit stronger structure dynamics correlations. In this study, we test the generality of this assumption using: Lennard Jones (LJ) and Weeks Chandler Andersen (WCA) systems, where fragility is tuned via density, and a modified LJ (q,p) system, where fragility is varied by changing the potential softness. We define a structural order parameter based on a mean field caging potential and analyse energy barriers at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. While the macroscopic free energy barrier slope correlates with fragility, the microscopic free energy barrier does not show a consistent trend. Instead, it exhibits a strong correlation with a structure dynamics correlation measure obtained from isoconfigurational ensemble simulations. Interestingly, the two systems showing the highest structure dynamics correlation, LJ at rho = 1.1 and the (8,5) model, are respectively the least and most fragile within their classes. These systems exhibit broad mobility distributions, large non Gaussian parameters, yet low four point susceptibilities, suggesting a decoupling between spatial correlation length and mobility contrast. Both systems lie in the enthalpy dominated regime and are close to the spinodal, pointing to mechanical instability as a source of heterogeneity. Our results reveal that structure dynamics correlation is more closely linked to the contrast in individual particle mobility than to the spatial extent of dynamic correlations that typically scale with fragility.</description>
