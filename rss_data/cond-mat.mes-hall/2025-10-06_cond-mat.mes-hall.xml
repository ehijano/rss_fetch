      <title>Symmetry in magnetoelectric electromagnetism and magnetoelectric meta-atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While in electromagnetism we have space-time symmetry, magnetoelectric (ME) processes are characterized by space-time symmetry breaking. Our goal is to show that quantum vacuum fields with both time reversal and space inversion symmetry breaking (so-called ME fields) can be observed in subwavelength regions of electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The sources of ME fields are ME meta-atoms, subwavelength elements made of magnetic insulators, where the dynamical ME behavior is due to modulations and topological coupling of magnetization and electric polarization. The interaction between EM and ME systems occurs through virtual structures, ME virtual photons. Experimentally, ME quantum vacuum states can be detected in a microwave cavity. The topic of these studies concerns fundamental aspects of ME quantum electrodynamics (MEQED).</description>

      <title>A Physical Unclonable Function Based on Variations of Write Times in STT-MRAM due to Manufacturing Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A physical unclonable function (PUF) utilizes the unclonable random variations in a device's responses to a set of inputs to produce a unique "biometric" that can be used for authentication. The variations are caused by unpredictable, unclonable and random manufacturing defects. Here, we show that the switching time of a magnetic tunnel junction injected with a spin-polarized current generating spin transfer torque is sensitive to the nature of structural defects introduced during manufacturing and hence can be the basis of a PUF. We use micromagnetic simulations to study the switching times under a constant current excitation for six different (commonly encountered) defect morphologies in spin-transfer-torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) to establish the viability of a PUF.</description>

      <title>Ginzburg-Landau theory of spin pumping through an antiferromagnetic layer near the N\'{e}el temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin pumping is a microwave-driven means for injecting spins from a ferromagnet into the adjacent target material. The insertion of a thin antiferromagnetic layer between the ferromagnet and the target material is known to enhance the spin pumping signal. Here, in view of describing dynamic fluctuations of the N\'{e}el order parameter, we develop Ginzburg-Landau theory of the spin pumping in a ferromagnet/antiferromagnet/heavy metal trilayer in the vicinity of the antiferromagnetic N\'{e}el temperature $T_{\rm N}$. When there exists an interfacial exchange interaction between the ferromagnetic spins and the antiferromagnetic N\'{e}el order parameter at the ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interface, we find a strongly frequency-dependent enhancement of the pumped spin current that is peaked at $T_{\rm N}$. The present finding offers an explanation for the enhanced spin pumping with strong frequency dependence observed in a Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$/CoO/Pt system.</description>

      <title>Classification of electromagnetic responses by quantum geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear charge current $j_a=\sigma_{abc}E_bE_c$ of Bloch electrons in quantum materials under an electric field can be well characterized by the quantum geometry, as most exemplified by the extrinsic and intrinsic nonlinear Hall effects induced by the Berry curvature dipole and the quantum metric dipole, respectively. Nevertheless, a unified quantum geometric description for the bilinear charge current $j_a=\sigma_{ab,c}E_bB_c$ of Bloch electrons driven by the electromagnetic fields, including the ordinary Hall effect (OHE), the magnetononlinear Hall effect (MNHE), and the planar Hall effect (PHE), remains elusive. Herein, we show that this bilinear conductivity, as contributed by the orbital minimal coupling and the spin Zeeman coupling of the applied magnetic field, respectively, can be classified by the conventional quantum geometry and the recently proposed Zeeman quantum geometry, where the symmetry constraint from the fundamental response equation is encoded. Specifically, we uncover that the intrinsic orbital and spin bilinear currents--responsible for the orbital and spin MNHEs--are governed by the quantum metric quadrupole and the Zeeman quantum metric dipole, respectively. In contrast, the extrinsic orbital and spin bilinear currents, which are linear in the relaxation time $\tau$ and lead to the orbital and spin PHEs, are governed by the Berry curvature quadrupole and the Zeeman Berry curvature dipole, respectively. Counterintuitively, we find that the OHE due to the Lorentz force can also include an interband contribution from the quantum metric quadrupole. After building the quantum geometric classification of this bilinear current, we study the rarely known spin PHE with the surface Dirac cone of three-dimensional topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Weak localization and antilocalization corrections to nonlinear transport: a semiclassical Boltzmann treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear transport regime is manifested in the nonlinear current-voltage characteristic of the system. An example of such a nonlinear regime is a setup in which current is injected into the sample and the measured voltage drop is quadratic in the injected current. Such a quadratic nonlinear regime requires inversion symmetry to be broken. This is the same symmetry condition as one needs to observe weak antilocalization, which can be prominent in two-dimensional systems. Here, we study the effects of weak (anti)localization on second-order nonlinear transport in two-dimensional systems using the semiclassical Boltzmann approach. We solve for quasiparticle distribution function up to the second order in the applied external electric field and calculate linear and nonlinear conductivity tensors for a toy model. We find that localization effects could lead to a sign change of the nonlinear conductivity tensor -- a phenomenon observed in single-layer graphene devices.</description>

      <title>Magnetocaloric effect for the altermagnetic candidate MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate magnetocaloric effect for single crystals of MnTe altermagnet at the transition to the state with spontaneous spin polarization, i.e. well below the N\'eel temperature of MnTe. The isothermal magnetic entropy change $\Delta S$ is calculated from the experimental magnetization curves by using Maxwell relation. We observe well-defined magnetocaloric effect as a narrow $\Delta S$ peak around the cricital temperature $T_c\approx 81$~K, which is accompanied by sharp magnetization jump. This behavior is unusual for standard ferromagnetic transitions, so it confirms the predicted spin-orbit-induced spin polarization in the MnTe altermagnetic state.</description>

      <title>Using Landau quantization to probe disorder in semiconductor heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding scattering mechanisms in semiconductor heterostructures is crucial to reducing sources of disorder and ensuring high yield and uniformity in large spin qubit arrays. Disorder of the parent two-dimensional electron or hole gas is commonly estimated by the critical, percolation-driven density associated with the metal-insulator transition. However, a reliable estimation of the critical density within percolation theory is hindered by the need to measure conductivity with high precision at low carrier densities, where experiments are most difficult. Here, we connect experimentally percolation density and quantum Hall plateau width, in line with an earlier heuristic intuition, and offer an alternative method for characterizing semiconductor heterostructure disorder.</description>

      <title>Dissipation properties of anomalous Hall effect: intrinsic vs. extrinsic magnetic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comparative study of anomalous-Hall current injection and anisotropic current injection (through planar Hall effect) are studied in Hall devices contacted to a lateral load circuit. Hall currents are injected into the load circuit from three different kinds of magnetic Hall bars: Mn5Si3 altermagnet, Co75Gd25 ferrimagnet, and Ni80Fe20 ferromagnet. The current, the voltage and the power are measured as a function of the load resistance and the Hall angle. It is observed that the power dissipated for the three kinds of materials fellow the same law as a function of load resistance and Hall angle, at the leading order in the Hall angle. Since the anomalous Hall effect in the altermagnetic Hall-bar is due to the intrinsic topological structure (i.e. due to the presence of a Berry phase in the reciprocal space), these observations suggest that the dissipative properties of anomalous Hall effect are dominated by the injection of electric charges accumulated at the edges (including electric screening), instead of the very mechanism responsible for it.</description>

      <title>Deconstruction of the anisotropic magnetic interactions from spin-entangled optical excitations in van der Waals antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-optical excitations in antiferromagnetic d systems can originate from a multiplicity of light-spin and spin-spin interactions, as the light and spin degrees of freedom can be entangled. This is exemplified in van der Waals systems with attendant strong anisotropy between in-plane and out- of-plane directions, such as MnPS3 and NiPS3 films studied here. The rich interplay between the magnetic ordering and sub-bandgap optical transitions poses a challenge to resolve the mechanisms driving spin-entangled optical transitions, as well as the single-particle bandgap itself. Here we employ a high-fidelity ab initio theory to find a realistic estimation of the bandgap by elucidating the atom- and orbital-resolved contributions to the fundamental sub-bands. We further demonstrate that the spin-entangled excitations, observable as photoluminescence and absorption resonances, originate from an on-site spin-flip transition confined to a magnetic atom (Mn or Ni). The evolution of the spin-flip transition</description>

      <title>Polarization dependence of spin-electric transitions in molecular exchange qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-optical experiments are emerging as a powerful technique to probe magnetic transitions in molecular spin systems. However, the simultaneous presence of the electric- and magnetic-dipole induced transitions poses the challenge of discriminating between these two contributions. Besides, the identification of the spin-electric transitions can hardly rely on the peak intensity, because of the current uncertainties on the value of the spin-electric coupling in most molecular compounds. Here, we compute the polarizations required for electric- and magnetic-dipole induced transitions through spin-Hamiltonian models of molecular spin triangles. We show that the polarization allows a clear discrimination between the two kinds of transitions. In addition, it allows one to identify the physical origin of the zero-field splitting in the ground multiplet, a debated issue with significant implications on the coherence properties of the spin qubit implemented in molecular spin triangles.</description>

      <title>Spatial uniformity of g-tensor and spin-orbit interaction in germanium hole spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holes in Ge/SiGe heterostructures are now a leading platform for semiconductor spin qubits, thanks to the high confinement quality, two-dimensional arrays, high tunability, and larger gate structure dimensions. One limiting factor for the operation of large arrays of qubits is the considerable variation in qubit frequencies or properties resulting from the strongly anisotropic $g$-tensor. We study the $g$-tensors of six and seven qubits in an array with a Y geometry across two devices. We report a mean distribution of the tilts of the $g$-tensor's out-of-plane principal axis of around $1.1 \deg$, where nearby quantum dots are more likely to have a similar tilt. Independently of this tilt, and unlike simple theoretical predictions, we find a strong in-plane $g$-tensor anisotropy with strong correlations between neighboring quantum dots. Additionally, in one device where the principal axes of all g-tensors are aligned along the [100] crystal direction, we extract the spin-flip tunneling vector from adjacent dot pairs and find a pattern that is consistent with a uniform Dresselhaus-like spin-orbit field. The Y arrangement of the gate layout and quantum dots allows us to rule out local factors like electrostatic confinement shape or local strain as the origin of the preferential direction. Our results reveal long-range correlations in the spin-orbit interaction and $g$-tensors that were not previously predicted or observed, and could prove critical to reliably understand $g$-tensors in germanium quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Four Moir\'e materials at One Magic Angle in Helical Quadrilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce helical twisted quadrilayer graphene (HTQG), four graphene sheets rotated by the same small angle, as a versatile and experimentally accessible platform for correlated topological matter. HTQG consists of three moir\'e lattices, formed by interference between adjacent graphene layers, that are twisted relative to each other. Lattice relaxation produces four types of large-scale commensurate domains. The domains are characterized by the stacking of the three moir\'e lattices and come in two types: Type-I "Bernal" stacking and Type-II "rhombohedral" stacking. Domain walls between adjacent stackings often host topologically protected edge states, forming networks at the supermoir\'e and super-supermoir\'e scales. Remarkably, all four moir\'e substructures have narrow bands at the same magic angle $\theta \approx 2.3^\circ$, allowing their correlated phases to be simultaneously targeted in device manufacturing. We argue that the Type-I domains are especially suitable for realizing robust superconductivity which emerges from doping topological insulators, and Chern insulators in $C = \pm 2$ bands.</description>

      <title>Slow-phonon control of spin Edelstein effect in Rashba $d$-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets have zero net magnetization yet feature spin-split bands that host spin-polarized states. Here, we investigate how slow lattice vibrations (phonons) influence both the intrinsic and externally induced spin polarizations in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets. For the induced spin polarizations, we employ a Rashba continuum model with electron-phonon coupling (EPC) treated at the static-Holstein level and analyze the spin Edelstein effect using the Kubo linear-response formalism. We find that moderate-to-strong EPC progressively suppresses the induced polarization via both intraband and interband channels, with a critical coupling marking the onset of complete spin Edelstein depolarization. The depolarization transition arises from a phonon-induced energy renormalization that pushes the spin-split bands anisotropically above the chemical potential, leading to a complete collapse of the Fermi surface. While (de)polarization can occur even in the Rashba non-altermagnetic phase, it remains isotropic. The presence of altermagnetism makes it anisotropic and breaks the conventional antisymmetry between spin susceptibilities that occurs with pure spin-orbit coupling, rendering the effect highly relevant for spintronic applications. We further investigate how the phonon coupling to the altermagnetic order, Rashba spin-orbit strength, and carrier doping collectively tune the depolarization transition. Our findings demonstrate that phonon scattering (e.g., through various substrates) offers a powerful means for on-demand control of spin polarization, enabling reversible switching between spin-polarized and depolarized states -- a key functionality for advancing spin logic architectures and optimizing next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets host unconventional spin-polarized bands despite zero net magnetization, but controlling their spin structure remains challenging. We propose a multi-field approach to engineer spin polarization in $d$-wave altermagnets using gating, optical driving, and in-plane electric fields, which enable tunable and switchable polarizations along multiple directions. Optical driving induces out-of-plane ($z$) polarization, while gating and in-plane fields generate $x$- and $y$-polarizations via the Edelstein effect, all of which are experimentally detectable. We further find that spin- and band-selective doping induces chiral optical activity, a feature unique to altermagnets. Our approach provides a versatile route for full control of spin polarization in altermagnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a highly linear superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) amplifier based on a double-loop (Bi-SQUID) architecture incorporating three superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (S-N-S) junctions. Fabricated using niobium-gold technology, the device exhibits robust operation at liquid helium temperatures, with a superconducting transition temperature of 8.5 K. The flux-to-voltage transfer function demonstrates sharp, symmetric, and highly linear behavior at temperatures up to 5 K. Bi-SQUIDs featuring our single-element S-N-S design represent an interesting and original approach to this field, as they demonstrate a numerically estimated spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) linearity exceeding 60 dB, achieved in a single element, simplifying the requirements in terms of arrays containing hundreds of junctions. These results highlight the potential of proximity-based Bi-SQUIDs for compact, low-noise, and highly linear cryogenic amplifiers in quantum sensing, magnetometry, and biomedical diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast dynamics of coherent exciton-polaritons in van der Waals semiconductor metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enabling coherent light-matter interactions is a critical step toward next-generation quantum technologies. However, achieving this under ambient temperature conditions remains challenging due to rapid dephasing in optically excited systems. Optical metasurfaces based on quasi-bound states in the continuum have recently emerged as a powerful platform for reaching the strong light-matter coupling regime in flat, subwavelength thickness devices. Here, we investigate ultrafast exciton-polariton dynamics in self-hybridized WS$_2$ thin-film metasurfaces. Using hyperspectral momentum-resolved imaging, we reconstruct the highly anisotropic exciton-polariton dispersion, with a transition from positive to negative effective mass along orthogonal symmetry axes. Femtosecond pump-probe and multidimensional spectroscopy reveal detuning-dependent polariton dynamics with a coherence time up to ~110 fs, and allow direct observation of the coherent dynamics through ultrafast Rabi oscillations with ~45 fs period. We describe this behaviour with a three-eigenstate model that couples the photonic resonance with both bright and dark excitons, extending the conventional two-state picture of strong coupling. Our results establish van der Waals metasurfaces as a promising platform for next-generation polaritonic devices, enabling coherent quantum transfer of matter excitations at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Electrically modulated light-emitting diodes driven by resonant and antiresonant tunneling between Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ electrodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring the electron tunneling mechanisms in diverse materials systems constitutes a versatile strategy for tailoring the properties of optoelectronic devices. In this domain, bipolar vertical tunneling junctions composed of van der Waals materials with vastly different electronic band structures enable simultaneous injection of electrons and holes into an optically active material, providing a universal blueprint for light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Efficient modulation of the injection efficiency has previously been demonstrated by creating resonant states within the energy barrier formed by the luminescent material. Here, we present an alternative approach towards resonant tunneling conditions by fabricating tunneling junctions composed entirely from gapped materials: Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ as electrodes, hBN as a tunneling barrier, and monolayer WSe$_2$ as a luminescent medium. The characterization of such LEDs revealed a nonmonotonous evolution of the electroluminescence intensity with the tunneling bias. The dominant role driving the characteristics of the electron tunneling was associated with the relative alignment of the density of states in Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ electrodes. The unique device architecture introduced here presents a universal pathway towards LEDs operating at room temperature with electrically modulated emission intensity.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Atomistic Disorder for Scalable Electron Shuttling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron shuttling is emerging as a key enabler of scalable silicon spin-qubit quantum computing, but fidelities are limited by atomistic disorder. We introduce a multiscale simulation framework combining time-dependent finite-element electrostatics and atomistic tight-binding to capture the impact of random alloying and interface roughness on the valley splitting and phase of shuttled electrons. We find that shuttling fidelities are strongly suppressed by interface roughness, with a sharp anomaly near the atomic-layer scale, setting quantitative guidelines to realize scalable shuttling.</description>

      <title>Sliding multiferroicity in hexagonal stacked CrI3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing new multiferroics at the two-dimensional (2D) limit with energy-efficient magnetoelectric coupling can inform the interplay physics of novel orders and advance on-chip high-performance computing applications. Here we apply stacking order engineering to create a new type of 2D multiferroics, namely sliding multiferroics, based on polar hexagonal stacked (H-stacked) CrI3. This new stacking order removes structural inversion symmetry and gives rise to room temperature sliding ferroelectricity, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, second harmonic generation spectroscopy and electrical transport measurements. Building upon the gate-dependent reflective magnetic circular dichroism, first-principles calculations, and modeling, sliding ferroelectricity is shown to interplay with an emergent interfacial ferromagnetism via interlayer spin-polarized charge transfer. This coupling mechanism results in non-volatile magnetic switching by as low as 0.4V across the H-stacked CrI3. Our demonstration introduces polar stacking order engineering of 2D magnets as a general approach to create non-volatile 2D multiferroics with efficient magnetoelectric coupling, paving the way for low-power electronics and spintronics at the atomically thin limit.</description>

Abstract: Electron quantum optics explores coherent single-electron charge pulse propagation in electronic nanoscale circuits akin to table-top photon setups. While past experiments focused on normal-state conductors, incorporating superconductors holds promise for exploiting the electron-hole degree of freedom in quantum sensing applications and quantum information processing. Here, we propose and analyze an on-demand and tunable mechanism for converting single-electron pulses into holes through Andreev processes on a superconductor. We develop a Floquet-Nambu scattering formalism to demonstrate the dynamic conversion of charge pulses and the controllable generation of coherent electron-hole superpositions through interferometric magnetic flux control based on the chiral edge states of a quantum Hall sample. Our discussion covers optimal conditions in realistic scenarios, affirming the feasibility of our proposal with current technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive Floquet-Nambu theory to describe the time-dependent quantum transport in mesoscopic circuits involving superconductors. The central object of our framework is the first-order correlation function, which accounts for the excitations that are generated by a time-dependent voltage and their coherent scattering off the interface with a superconductor. We analyze the time-dependent current generated by periodic voltage pulses and how it depends on the excitation energies of the voltage drive compared to the gap of the superconductor. Our general formalism allows us to identify the conditions for the excitations that are scattered off the superconductor to become coherent electron-hole superpositions. To this end, we consider the purity of the outgoing states, which characterizes their ability to carry quantum information. To illustrate our formalism, we apply it to a system composed of chiral quantum Hall edge states connected to a superconductor, and we calculate the current in the outgoing lead and the purity of the outgoing states for Lorentzian and harmonic voltage drives. Our framework paves the way for systematic investigations of time-dependent scattering problems involving superconductivity, and it may help interpret future experiments in electron quantum optics with superconductors.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the theory of surface plasmon polaritons on a magnetic Weyl semimetal conical tip. We show that the axion term in the effective electrodynamics modifies the surface plasmon polariton dispersion relation and allows all modes with a given sign of the orbital angular momentum to be focused at the end of the tip. This is in contrast with normal metals, in which only one mode can reach the end. We discuss how this orbital angular momentum nanofocusing expands the potential of technologies that use this degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Interactions of Wigner Crystal in Magnetic Field and Berry Curvature: Multi-Particle Tunneling through Complex Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how an out-of-plane magnetic field $B({\bf r})$ and a Berry curvature $\Omega({\bf k})$ modify the exchange interactions in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal (WC) using a semi-classical large-$r_s$ expansion. When only a magnetic field is present, ring-exchange processes arise from multi-particle tunneling through {\it complex} trajectories which constitute {\it complex instanton} solutions of the coordinate-space path integral. To leading order in $B$, each exchange constant $J_a$ acquires an Aharonov-Bohm phase along the zero-field tunneling trajectory. When a Berry curvature is present, the multi-particle tunneling must be considered in a complexified phase space $({\bf r}, {\bf k})$. To leading order in $\Omega$, $J_a$ acquires a Berry phase along a {\it purely imaginary} momentum-space trajectory. When $B$ and $\Omega$ are both present, in addition to having both Aharonov-Bohm and Berry phases, the exchange magnitude $|J_a|$ is also modified due to an effective-mass renormalization. These effects could be relevant for the WC and proximate phases recently observed in rhombohedral multilayer graphene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a symmetry classification for a general class of quantum feedback control. For successive feedback control with a non-adaptive sequence of bare measurements (i.e., with positive Kraus operators), we prove that the symmetry classification collapses to the ten-fold AZ$^\dagger$ classes, specifying the allowed topology of CPTP maps associated with feedback control. We demonstrate that a chiral Maxwell's demon with Gaussian measurement errors exhibits quantized winding numbers. Moreover, for general (non-bare) measurements, we explicitly construct a protocol that falls outside the ten-fold classification. These results broaden and clarify the principles in engineering topological aspects of quantum control robust against disorder and imperfections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has emerged as a rich field of study, with applications ranging from $PT$-symmetry breaking and skin effects to non-Hermitian topological phase transitions. Yet most studies remain restricted to small-scale or classically tractable systems. While quantum computing has shown strong performance in Hermitian eigenproblems, its extension to the non-Hermitian regime remains largely unexplored. Here, we develop a quantum algorithm to address general non-Hermitian eigenvalue problems, specifically targeting eigenvalues near a given line in the complex plane -- thereby generalizing previous results on ground state energy and spectral gap estimation for Hermitian matrices. Our method combines a fuzzy quantum eigenvalue detector with a divide-and-conquer strategy to efficiently isolate relevant eigenvalues. This yields a provable exponential quantum speedup for non-Hermitian eigenproblems. Furthermore, we discuss the broad applications in detecting spontaneous $PT$-symmetry breaking, estimating Liouvillian gaps, and analyzing classical Markov processes. These results highlight the potential of quantum algorithms in tackling challenging problems across quantum physics and beyond.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement patterns reveal essential information on many-body states and provide a way to classify quantum phases of matter. However, experimental studies of many-body entanglement remain scarce due to their unscalable nature. The present work aims to mitigate this theoretical and experimental divide by introducing reduced fluctuations of observables, consisting of a sum of on-site operators, as a scalable experimental probe of the entanglement entropy. Specifically, we illustrate by Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations in spin chains that the reduced fluctuations exhibit the same size scaling properties as the entanglement entropy. Generalizing previous observations restricted to special systems with conserved quantities, our work introduces experimentally feasible protocol to extract entanglement scaling laws.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17378v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Is it feasible to alter the ground state properties of a material by engineering its electromagnetic environment? Inspired by theoretical predictions, experimental realizations of such cavity-controlled properties without optical excitation are beginning to emerge. Here, we devised and implemented a novel platform to realize cavity-altered materials. Single crystals of hyperbolic van der Waals (vdW) compounds provide a resonant electromagnetic environment with enhanced density of photonic states and prominent mode confinement. We interfaced hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with the molecular superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br ($\kappa$-ET). The frequencies of infrared (IR) hyperbolic modes of hBN match the IR-active carbon-carbon stretching molecular resonance of ($\kappa$-ET) implicated in superconductivity. Nano-optical data supported by first-principles molecular Langevin dynamics simulations confirm the presence of resonant coupling between the hBN hyperbolic cavity modes and the carbon-carbon stretching mode in ($\kappa$-ET). Meissner effect measurements via magnetic force microscopy demonstrate a strong suppression of superfluid density near the hBN/($\kappa$-ET) interface. Non-resonant control heterostructures, including RuCl$_3$/($\kappa$-ET) and hBN/$\text{Bi}_2\text{Sr}_2\text{CaCu}_2\text{O}_{8+x}$, do not display the superfluid suppression. These observations suggest that hBN/($\kappa$-ET) realizes a cavity-altered superconducting ground state. Our work highlights the potential of dark cavities devoid of external photons for engineering electronic ground state properties of complex quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Tuning Thermal Conductivity and Electron-Phonon Interactions in Carbon and Boron Nitride Moir\'e Diamanes via Twist Angle Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the effect of interlayer twist angle on lattice thermal conductivity (LTC) and band gap renormalization in boron nitride and carbon Moir\'e diamanes. Moment tensor potentials were used for calculating energies and forces of interatomic interactions. The methods based on the solution of Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) for phonons and the GreenKubo (GK) formula were utilized to calculate LTC. The 20-40 % difference in LTC values obtained with GK and BTE-based methods showed the importance of high-order anharmonic contributions to LTC. Significant reduction (by 4.5 - 9 times) of the in-plane LTC with the twist angle increase caused by the growth of structural disorder was observed in the Moir\'e diamanes. This growth of disorder also leads to higher band gap renormalization (induced by classical nuclei motion) in the structures with higher twist angles. Significant band gap renormalization values obtained considering the quantum nuclear effects are caused by the high phonon frequencies related to the bonds with hydrogen atoms on the Moir\'e diamanes surfaces.

Abstract: Significant advances in silicon spin qubits highlight the potential of silicon quantum dots for scalable quantum computing, given their compatibility with industrial fabrication and long coherence times. In particular, phosphorus (P)-doped spin qubits possess excellent coherence and have demonstrated high-fidelity two-qubit gates exceeding 99.9%. However, scaling P-donor systems is challenging due to crosstalk caused by the uniformity of individual P donors and the low tolerance for imprecise atomic placement. Stochastic placement can lead to multiple donors located within a small region (diameter &lt;3 nm), forming a so-called donor cluster. Notably, in cluster-based systems, high-fidelity multi-qubit quantum gates and all-to-all connectivity have recently been demonstrated experimentally on nuclear spin qubits. In this work, we propose a scalable cluster-array architecture for nuclear spin qubits and a corresponding control protocol. We analyze crosstalk-induced errors, a major error source, during primitive operations under various parameters, showing that they can be suppressed through device design and control optimization. We evaluate the fidelities of intra- and inter-cluster multi-qubit gates between nuclear spins, confirming the feasibility of our architecture and establishing design requirements and parameter targets. The local all-to-all connectivity within clusters provides unique flexibility for quantum error correction. Our scalable scheme provides a path toward large-scale spin-based quantum processors.</description>
