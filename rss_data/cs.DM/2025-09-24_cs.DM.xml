      <title>A Scalable Lift-and-Project Differentiable Approach For the Maximum Cut Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scalable framework for solving the Maximum Cut (MaxCut) problem in large graphs using projected gradient ascent on quadratic objectives. Notably, while our approach is differentiable and leverages GPUs for gradient-based optimization, it is not a machine learning method and does not require training data beyond the given problem formulation. Starting from a continuous relaxation of the classical quadratic binary formulation, we present a parallelized strategy that explores multiple initialization vectors in batch, offering an efficient and memory-friendly alternative to traditional solvers. We analyze the relaxed objective, showing it is convex and has fixed-points corresponding to local optima -- particularly at boundary points -- highlighting a key challenge in non-convex optimization. To address this, we introduce a lifted quadratic formulation that over-parameterizes the solution space, allowing the algorithm to escape poor fixed-points. We also provide a theoretical characterization of these lifted fixed-points. Finally, we propose DECO, a dimension-alternating algorithm that switches between the unlifted and lifted formulations, leveraging their complementary strengths along with importance-based degree initialization and a population-based evolutionary hyper-parameter search. Experiments on diverse graph families show that our methods attain comparable or superior performance relative to recent training-data-intensive, dataless, and GPU-accelerated sampling approaches.</description>

      <title>No-go theorem for quantum realization of extremal correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of quantum correlations is central to quantum information and foundations. The paradigmatic case of Bell scenarios considers product measurements implemented on a multipartite state. The more general case of contextuality scenarios--where the measurements do not have to be of product form or even on a composite system--has been studied for the case of projective measurements. While it is known that in any Bell scenario extremal indeterministic correlations (e.g., Popescu-Rohrlich or PR boxes) are unachievable quantumly, the case of general contextuality scenarios has remained open. Here we study quantum realizations of extremal correlations in arbitrary contextuality scenarios and prove that, for all such scenarios, no extremal indeterministic correlation can be achieved using projective quantum measurements, i.e., there exists no quantum state and no set of projective measurements, for any contextuality scenario, that can achieve such correlations. This no-go result follows as a corollary of a more general no-go theorem that holds when the most general set of quantum measurements (i.e., positive operator-valued measures, or POVMs) is taken into account. This general no-go theorem entails that no non-trivial quantum realization of an extremal indeterministic correlation exists, i.e., any "quantum" realization must be simulable by classical randomness. We discuss implications of this no-go theorem and the open questions it raises.</description>

      <title>G\"odel Test: Can Large Language Models Solve Easy Conjectures?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent announcements from frontier AI model labs have highlighted strong results on high-school and undergraduate math competitions. Yet it remains unclear whether large language models can solve new, simple conjectures in more advanced areas of mathematics. We propose the G\"odel Test: evaluating whether a model can produce correct proofs for very simple, previously unsolved conjectures. To this end, we study the performance of GPT-5 on five conjectures in combinatorial optimization. For each problem, we provided one or two source papers from which the conjecture arose, withheld our own conjecture, and then assessed the model's reasoning in detail. On the three easier problems, GPT-5 produced nearly correct solutions; for Problem 2 it even derived a different approximation guarantee that, upon checking, refuted our conjecture while providing a valid solution. The model failed on Problem 4, which required combining results from two papers. On Problem 5, a harder case without a validated conjecture, GPT-5 proposed the same algorithm we had in mind but failed in the analysis, suggesting the proof is more challenging than expected. Although our sample is small, the results point to meaningful progress on routine reasoning, occasional flashes of originality, and clear limitations when cross-paper synthesis is required. GPT-5 may represent an early step toward frontier models eventually passing the G\"odel Test.</description>

      <title>Tight eigenvalue bound on the traveling salesman problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A lower bound on the solution to the traveling salesman problem is provided, which is expressed in terms of eigenvalues related to the distance matrix for the problem. This bound has many interesting properties such as transforming appropriately under affine distance transformations and is notably tight for various families of traveling salesman problems with arbitrarily many cities. It is also computed for some real world traveling salesman problems. The eigenvalues in the bound are further related to the Schoenberg criterion from Euclidean geometry. Graph theoretic applications to the Hamiltonian cycle and path problems are given by the fact that the new bound entails necessary graph eigenvalue conditions for a graph to be Hamiltonian or traceable. Various non-trivial families of Cayley graphs saturate these Hamiltonicity conditions, thus in a sense providing almost counterexamples to the famous conjecture that all Cayley graphs are Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Rice-like complexity lower bounds for Boolean and uniform automata networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automata networks are a versatile model of finite discrete dynamical systems composed of interacting entities (the automata), able to embed any directed graph as a dynamics on its space of configurations (the set of vertices, representing all the assignments of a state to each entity). In this world, virtually any question is decidable by a simple exhaustive search. We lever the Rice-like complexity lower bound, stating that any non-trivial monadic second order logic question on the graph of its dynamics is NP-hard or coNP-hard (given the automata network description), to bounded alphabets (including the Boolean case). This restriction is particularly meaningful for applications to "complex systems", where each entity has a restricted set of possible states (its alphabet). For the deterministic case, trivial questions are solvable in constant time, hence there is a sharp gap in complexity for the algorithmic solving of concrete problems on them. For the non-deterministic case, non-triviality is defined at bounded cliquewidth, which offers a structure to establish metatheorems of complexity lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Automorphism groups of graphs of bounded Hadwiger number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.14300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the structure of automorphism groups of finite graphs of bounded Hadwiger number. Our proof includes a structural analysis of finite edge-transitive graphs. In particular, we show that for connected, $K_{h+1}$-minor-free, edge-transitive, twin-free, finite graphs the non-abelian composition factors of the automorphism group have bounded order. We use this to show that the automorphism groups of finite graphs of bounded Hadwiger number are obtained by repeated group extensions using abelian groups, symmetric groups and groups of bounded order.</description>

      <title>Maximum Reachability Orientation of Mixed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We aim to find orientations of mixed graphs optimizing the total reachability, a problem that has applications in causality and biology. For given a digraph $D$, we use $P(D)$ for the set of ordered pairs of distinct vertices in $V(D)$ and we define $\kappa_D:P(D)\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ by $\kappa_D(u,v)=1$ if $v$ is reachable from $u$ in $D$, and $\kappa_D(u,v)=0$, otherwise. We use $R(D)=\sum_{(u,v)\in P(D)}\kappa_D(u,v)$.
  Now, given a mixed graph $G$, we aim to find an orientation $\vec{G}$ of $G$ that maximizes $R(\vec{G})$. Hakimi, Schmeichel, and Young proved that the problem can be solved in polynomial time when restricted to undirected inputs. They inquired about the complexity in mixed graphs.
  We answer this question by showing that this problem is NP-hard, and, moreover, APX-hard.
  We then develop a finer understanding of how quickly the problem becomes difficult when going from undirected to mixed graphs. To this end, we consider the parameterized complexity of the problem with respect to the number $k$ of preoriented arcs of $G$, a poorly understood form of parameterization.
  We show that the problem can be solved in time $n^{O(k)}$ and that a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation can be computed in time $f(k,\epsilon)n^{O(1)}$ for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>Some short notes on oriented line graphs and related matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Oriented line graph, introduced by Kotani and Sunada (2000), is closely related to Hashimato's non-backtracking matrix (1989). It is known that for regular graphs $G$, the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the oriented line graph $\vec{L}(G)$ of $G$ are the reciprocals of the poles of the Ihara zeta function of $G$. We determine the characteristic polynomials of the adjacency matrix of the underlying undirected graph of $\vec{L}(G)$ and the skew-symmetric adjacency matrix (and Hermitian adjacency matrix) of $\vec{L}(G)$ for $d$-regular graphs $G$ with $d\geq 3$.
  A locally bijective (resp. injective) homomorphism from a graph $G$ to a graph $H$ is a mapping $\psi\colon V(G)\to V(H)$ such that for every vertex $v$ of $G$, the restriction of $\psi$ to the neighborhood $N_G(v)$ is a bijection (resp. injection) from $N_G(v)$ to $N_H(\psi(v))$ (Fiala and Kratochv\'il, 2008). An out-neighborhood bijective (resp. injective) homomorphism from a directed graph $\vec{G}$ to a directed graph $\vec{H}$ is a mapping $\psi\colon V(\vec{G})\to V(\vec{H})$ such that for every vertex $v$ of $\vec{G}$, the restriction of $\psi$ to the out-neighborhood $N_{\vec{G}}^+(v)$ is a bijection (resp. injection) from $N_{\vec{G}}^+(v)$ to $N_{\vec{H}}^+(\psi(v))$ (Antony and Shalu, 2025). We prove that the existence of a locally bijective (resp. injective) homomorphism from a graph $G$ of minimum degree at least 3 to a graph $H$ is equivalent to the existence of an out-neighborhood bijective (resp. injective) homomorphism from $\vec{L}(G)$ to $\vec{L}(H)$. We also prove some results on the coloring variants distance-two coloring and star coloring.</description>
