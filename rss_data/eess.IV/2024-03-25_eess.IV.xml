      <title>Subjective Quality Assessment of Compressed Tone-Mapped High Dynamic Range Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos are able to represent wider ranges of contrasts and colors than Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) videos, giving more vivid experiences. Due to this, HDR videos are expected to grow into the dominant video modality of the future. However, HDR videos are incompatible with existing SDR displays, which form the majority of affordable consumer displays on the market. Because of this, HDR videos must be processed by tone-mapping them to reduced bit-depths to service a broad swath of SDR-limited video consumers. Here, we analyze the impact of tone-mapping operators on the visual quality of streaming HDR videos. To this end, we built the first large-scale subjectively annotated open-source database of compressed tone-mapped HDR videos, containing 15,000 tone-mapped sequences derived from 40 unique HDR source contents. The videos in the database were labeled with more than 750,000 subjective quality annotations, collected from more than 1,600 unique human observers. We demonstrate the usefulness of the new subjective database by benchmarking objective models of visual quality on it. We envision that the new LIVE Tone-Mapped HDR (LIVE-TMHDR) database will enable significant progress on HDR video tone mapping and quality assessment in the future. To this end, we make the database freely available to the community at https://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/LIVE_TMHDR/index.html</description>

      <title>Integrating multiscale topology in digital pathology with pyramidal graph convolutional networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have emerged as a powerful alternative to multiple instance learning with convolutional neural networks in digital pathology, offering superior handling of structural information across various spatial ranges - a crucial aspect of learning from gigapixel H&amp;E-stained whole slide images (WSI). However, graph message-passing algorithms often suffer from oversmoothing when aggregating a large neighborhood. Hence, effective modeling of multi-range interactions relies on the careful construction of the graph. Our proposed multi-scale GCN (MS-GCN) tackles this issue by leveraging information across multiple magnification levels in WSIs. MS-GCN enables the simultaneous modeling of long-range structural dependencies at lower magnifications and high-resolution cellular details at higher magnifications, akin to analysis pipelines usually conducted by pathologists. The architecture's unique configuration allows for the concurrent modeling of structural patterns at lower magnifications and detailed cellular features at higher ones, while also quantifying the contribution of each magnification level to the prediction. Through testing on different datasets, MS-GCN demonstrates superior performance over existing single-magnification GCN methods. The enhancement in performance and interpretability afforded by our method holds promise for advancing computational pathology models, especially in tasks requiring extensive spatial context.</description>

      <title>Improving cross-domain brain tissue segmentation in fetal MRI with synthetic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmentation of fetal brain tissue from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in the study of in utero neurodevelopment. However, automated tools face substantial domain shift challenges as they must be robust to highly heterogeneous clinical data, often limited in numbers and lacking annotations. Indeed, high variability of the fetal brain morphology, MRI acquisition parameters, and superresolution reconstruction (SR) algorithms adversely affect the model's performance when evaluated out-of-domain. In this work, we introduce FetalSynthSeg, a domain randomization method to segment fetal brain MRI, inspired by SynthSeg. Our results show that models trained solely on synthetic data outperform models trained on real data in out-ofdomain settings, validated on a 120-subject cross-domain dataset. Furthermore, we extend our evaluation to 40 subjects acquired using lowfield (0.55T) MRI and reconstructed with novel SR models, showcasing robustness across different magnetic field strengths and SR algorithms. Leveraging a generative synthetic approach, we tackle the domain shift problem in fetal brain MRI and offer compelling prospects for applications in fields with limited and highly heterogeneous data.</description>

      <title>WEEP: A method for spatial interpretation of weakly supervised CNN models in computational pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning enables the modelling of high-resolution histopathology whole-slide images (WSI). Weakly supervised learning of tile-level data is typically applied for tasks where labels only exist on the patient or WSI level (e.g. patient outcomes or histological grading). In this context, there is a need for improved spatial interpretability of predictions from such models. We propose a novel method, Wsi rEgion sElection aPproach (WEEP), for model interpretation. It provides a principled yet straightforward way to establish the spatial area of WSI required for assigning a particular prediction label. We demonstrate WEEP on a binary classification task in the area of breast cancer computational pathology. WEEP is easy to implement, is directly connected to the model-based decision process, and offers information relevant to both research and diagnostic applications.</description>

      <title>Global Control for Local SO(3)-Equivariant Scale-Invariant Vessel Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized 3D vascular models can aid in a range of diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment-planning tasks relevant to cardiovascular disease management. Deep learning provides a means to automatically obtain such models. Ideally, a user should have control over the exact region of interest (ROI) to be included in a vascular model, and the model should be watertight and highly accurate. To this end, we propose a combination of a global controller leveraging voxel mask segmentations to provide boundary conditions for vessels of interest to a local, iterative vessel segmentation model. We introduce the preservation of scale- and rotational symmetries in the local segmentation model, leading to generalisation to vessels of unseen sizes and orientations. Combined with the global controller, this enables flexible 3D vascular model building, without additional retraining. We demonstrate the potential of our method on a dataset containing abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Our method performs on par with a state-of-the-art segmentation model in the segmentation of AAAs, iliac arteries and renal arteries, while providing a watertight, smooth surface segmentation. Moreover, we demonstrate that by adapting the global controller, we can easily extend vessel sections in the 3D model.</description>

      <title>Ultrasound Imaging based on the Variance of a Diffusion Restoration Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite today's prevalence of ultrasound imaging in medicine, ultrasound signal-to-noise ratio is still affected by several sources of noise and artefacts. Moreover, enhancing ultrasound image quality involves balancing concurrent factors like contrast, resolution, and speckle preservation. Recently, there has been progress in both model-based and learning-based approaches addressing the problem of ultrasound image reconstruction. Bringing the best from both worlds, we propose a hybrid reconstruction method combining an ultrasound linear direct model with a learning-based prior coming from a generative Denoising Diffusion model. More specifically, we rely on the unsupervised fine-tuning of a pre-trained Denoising Diffusion Restoration Model (DDRM). Given the nature of multiplicative noise inherent to ultrasound, this paper proposes an empirical model to characterize the stochasticity of diffusion reconstruction of ultrasound images, and shows the interest of its variance as an echogenicity map estimator. We conduct experiments on synthetic, in-vitro, and in-vivo data, demonstrating the efficacy of our variance imaging approach in achieving high-quality image reconstructions from single plane-wave acquisitions and in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>StreamingT2V: Consistent, Dynamic, and Extendable Long Video Generation from Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models enable the generation of high-quality videos that follow text instructions, making it easy to create diverse and individual content. However, existing approaches mostly focus on high-quality short video generation (typically 16 or 24 frames), ending up with hard-cuts when naively extended to the case of long video synthesis. To overcome these limitations, we introduce StreamingT2V, an autoregressive approach for long video generation of 80, 240, 600, 1200 or more frames with smooth transitions. The key components are:(i) a short-term memory block called conditional attention module (CAM), which conditions the current generation on the features extracted from the previous chunk via an attentional mechanism, leading to consistent chunk transitions, (ii) a long-term memory block called appearance preservation module, which extracts high-level scene and object features from the first video chunk to prevent the model from forgetting the initial scene, and (iii) a randomized blending approach that enables to apply a video enhancer autoregressively for infinitely long videos without inconsistencies between chunks. Experiments show that StreamingT2V generates high motion amount. In contrast, all competing image-to-video methods are prone to video stagnation when applied naively in an autoregressive manner. Thus, we propose with StreamingT2V a high-quality seamless text-to-long video generator that outperforms competitors with consistency and motion.

      <title>Diffusion Attack: Leveraging Stable Diffusion for Naturalistic Image Attacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Virtual Reality (VR), adversarial attack remains a significant security threat. Most deep learning-based methods for physical and digital adversarial attacks focus on enhancing attack performance by crafting adversarial examples that contain large printable distortions that are easy for human observers to identify. However, attackers rarely impose limitations on the naturalness and comfort of the appearance of the generated attack image, resulting in a noticeable and unnatural attack. To address this challenge, we propose a framework to incorporate style transfer to craft adversarial inputs of natural styles that exhibit minimal detectability and maximum natural appearance, while maintaining superior attack capabilities.</description>

      <title>Geometric Generative Models based on Morphological Equivariant PDEs and GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Content and image generation consist in creating or generating data from noisy information by extracting specific features such as texture, edges, and other thin image structures. We are interested here in generative models, and two main problems are addressed. Firstly, the improvements of specific feature extraction while accounting at multiscale levels intrinsic geometric features; and secondly, the equivariance of the network to reduce its complexity and provide a geometric interpretability. To proceed, we propose a geometric generative model based on an equivariant partial differential equation (PDE) for group convolution neural networks (G-CNNs), so called PDE-G-CNNs, built on morphology operators and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Equivariant morphological PDE layers are composed of multiscale dilations and erosions formulated in Riemannian manifolds, while group symmetries are defined on a Lie group. We take advantage of the Lie group structure to properly integrate the equivariance in layers, and are able to use the Riemannian metric to solve the multiscale morphological operations. Each point of the Lie group is associated with a unique point in the manifold, which helps us derive a metric on the Riemannian manifold from a tensor field invariant under the Lie group so that the induced metric has the same symmetries. The proposed geometric morphological GAN (GM-GAN) is obtained by using the proposed morphological equivariant convolutions in PDE-G-CNNs to bring nonlinearity in classical CNNs. GM-GAN is evaluated on MNIST data and compared with GANs. Preliminary results show that GM-GAN model outperforms classical GAN.</description>

      <title>Piecewise-Linear Manifolds for Deep Metric Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised deep metric learning (UDML) focuses on learning a semantic representation space using only unlabeled data. This challenging problem requires accurately estimating the similarity between data points, which is used to supervise a deep network. For this purpose, we propose to model the high-dimensional data manifold using a piecewise-linear approximation, with each low-dimensional linear piece approximating the data manifold in a small neighborhood of a point. These neighborhoods are used to estimate similarity between data points. We empirically show that this similarity estimate correlates better with the ground truth than the similarity estimates of current state-of-the-art techniques. We also show that proxies, commonly used in supervised metric learning, can be used to model the piecewise-linear manifold in an unsupervised setting, helping improve performance. Our method outperforms existing unsupervised metric learning approaches on standard zero-shot image retrieval benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Single-pixel edge enhancement of object via convolutional filtering with localized vortex phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microscopy is an essential tool in imaging research, and the edge-enhanced microscope by using the vortex filter is of particular interest as an optical information processing that highlights amplitude and phase edges of object in all directions. The application of this technique is not limited to the visible range, but edge enhancement of object in invisible wavelength is also crucial for near-infrared fluorescence and electronic circuit inspection through silicon semiconductors. One disadvantage of near-infrared imaging is that digital cameras such as CCD and CMOS become much more expensive than cameras for the visible spectrum. As an cost-effective method to implement invisible edge enhancement, the Fourier single-pixel imaging has already been proposed without using a camera, but using a single-pixel detector. However, this method requires 3 or 4 times more single-pixel measurements due to the three-phase or four-phase shift to detect optical complex amplitude in Fourier domain. In response, we propose a method for single-pixel edge enhancement of object via convolutional filtering with a localized vortex phase, eliminating the extra single-pixel measurements required by the phase-shifting method. Our simulation results show that the correlation coefficient between the ideal edges of an object and the edge enhanced by our proposed method is 0.95, indicating that our method is effective way to detect the edges. This novel and effective approach for enhancing and detecting the edges of object can be valuable in various invisible imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Transfer CLIP for Generalizable Image Denoising</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image denoising is a fundamental task in computer vision. While prevailing deep learning-based supervised and self-supervised methods have excelled in eliminating in-distribution noise, their susceptibility to out-of-distribution (OOD) noise remains a significant challenge. The recent emergence of contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model has showcased exceptional capabilities in open-world image recognition and segmentation. Yet, the potential for leveraging CLIP to enhance the robustness of low-level tasks remains largely unexplored. This paper uncovers that certain dense features extracted from the frozen ResNet image encoder of CLIP exhibit distortion-invariant and content-related properties, which are highly desirable for generalizable denoising. Leveraging these properties, we devise an asymmetrical encoder-decoder denoising network, which incorporates dense features including the noisy image and its multi-scale features from the frozen ResNet encoder of CLIP into a learnable image decoder to achieve generalizable denoising. The progressive feature augmentation strategy is further proposed to mitigate feature overfitting and improve the robustness of the learnable decoder. Extensive experiments and comparisons conducted across diverse OOD noises, including synthetic noise, real-world sRGB noise, and low-dose CT image noise, demonstrate the superior generalization ability of our method.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Model based Rate-Distortion for Image Downscaling Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Image Downscaling Assessment by Rate-Distortion (IDA-RD), a novel measure to quantitatively evaluate image downscaling algorithms. In contrast to image-based methods that measure the quality of downscaled images, ours is process-based that draws ideas from rate-distortion theory to measure the distortion incurred during downscaling. Our main idea is that downscaling and super-resolution (SR) can be viewed as the encoding and decoding processes in the rate-distortion model, respectively, and that a downscaling algorithm that preserves more details in the resulting low-resolution (LR) images should lead to less distorted high-resolution (HR) images in SR. In other words, the distortion should increase as the downscaling algorithm deteriorates. However, it is non-trivial to measure this distortion as it requires the SR algorithm to be blind and stochastic. Our key insight is that such requirements can be met by recent SR algorithms based on deep generative models that can find all matching HR images for a given LR image on their learned image manifolds. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our IDA-RD measure.</description>

Abstract: Computer vision in agriculture is game-changing with its ability to transform farming into a data-driven, precise, and sustainable industry. Deep learning has empowered agriculture vision to analyze vast, complex visual data, but heavily rely on the availability of large annotated datasets. This remains a bottleneck as manual labeling is error-prone, time-consuming, and expensive. The lack of efficient labeling approaches inspired us to consider self-supervised learning as a paradigm shift, learning meaningful feature representations from raw agricultural image data. In this work, we explore how self-supervised representation learning unlocks the potential applicability to diverse agriculture vision tasks by eliminating the need for large-scale annotated datasets. We propose a lightweight framework utilizing SimCLR, a contrastive learning approach, to pre-train a ResNet-50 backbone on a large, unannotated dataset of real-world agriculture field images. Our experimental analysis and results indicate that the model learns robust features applicable to a broad range of downstream agriculture tasks discussed in the paper. Additionally, the reduced reliance on annotated data makes our approach more cost-effective and accessible, paving the way for broader adoption of computer vision in agriculture.</description>

Abstract: Transformers have widely adopted attention networks for sequence mixing and MLPs for channel mixing, playing a pivotal role in achieving breakthroughs across domains. However, recent literature highlights issues with attention networks, including low inductive bias and quadratic complexity concerning input sequence length. State Space Models (SSMs) like S4 and others (Hippo, Global Convolutions, liquid S4, LRU, Mega, and Mamba), have emerged to address the above issues to help handle longer sequence lengths. Mamba, while being the state-of-the-art SSM, has a stability issue when scaled to large networks for computer vision datasets. We propose SiMBA, a new architecture that introduces Einstein FFT (EinFFT) for channel modeling by specific eigenvalue computations and uses the Mamba block for sequence modeling. Extensive performance studies across image and time-series benchmarks demonstrate that SiMBA outperforms existing SSMs, bridging the performance gap with state-of-the-art transformers. Notably, SiMBA establishes itself as the new state-of-the-art SSM on ImageNet and transfer learning benchmarks such as Stanford Car and Flower as well as task learning benchmarks as well as seven time series benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Purpose: Current 3D Magnetic Resonance Spin TomogrAphy in Time-domain (MR-STAT) protocols use transient-state, gradient-spoiled gradient-echo sequences that are prone to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pulsation artifacts when applied to the brain. This study aims at developing a 3D MR-STAT protocol for whole-brain relaxometry that overcomes the challenges posed by CSF-induced ghosting artifacts. Method: We optimized the flip-angle train within the Cartesian 3D MR-STAT framework to achieve two objectives: (1) minimization of the noise level in the reconstructed quantitative maps, and (2) reduction of the CSF-to-white-matter signal ratio to suppress CSF signal and the associated pulsation artifacts. The optimized new sequence was tested on a gel/water-phantom to evaluate the accuracy of the quantitative maps, and on healthy volunteers to explore the effectiveness of the CSF artifact suppression and robustness of the new protocol. Results: A new optimized sequence with both high parameter encoding capability and low CSF intensity was proposed and initially validated in the gel/water-phantom experiment. From in-vivo experiments with five volunteers, the proposed CSF-suppressed sequence shows no CSF ghosting artifacts and overall greatly improved image quality for all quantitative maps compared to the baseline sequence. Statistical analysis indicated low inter-subject and inter-scan variability for quantitative parameters in gray matter and white matter (1.6%-2.4% for T1 and 2.0%-4.6% for T2), demonstrating the robustness of the new sequence. Conclusion: We presented a new 3D MR-STAT sequence with CSF suppression that effectively eliminates CSF pulsation artifacts. The new sequence ensures consistently high-quality, 1mm^3 whole-brain relaxometry within a rapid 5.5-minute scan time.</description>

      <title>Image super-resolution via dynamic network</title>

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) depend on deep network architectures to extract accurate information for image super-resolution. However, obtained information of these CNNs cannot completely express predicted high-quality images for complex scenes. In this paper, we present a dynamic network for image super-resolution (DSRNet), which contains a residual enhancement block, wide enhancement block, feature refinement block and construction block. The residual enhancement block is composed of a residual enhanced architecture to facilitate hierarchical features for image super-resolution. To enhance robustness of obtained super-resolution model for complex scenes, a wide enhancement block achieves a dynamic architecture to learn more robust information to enhance applicability of an obtained super-resolution model for varying scenes. To prevent interference of components in a wide enhancement block, a refinement block utilizes a stacked architecture to accurately learn obtained features. Also, a residual learning operation is embedded in the refinement block to prevent long-term dependency problem. Finally, a construction block is responsible for reconstructing high-quality images. Designed heterogeneous architecture can not only facilitate richer structural information, but also be lightweight, which is suitable for mobile digital devices. Experimental results shows that our method is more competitive in terms of performance and recovering time of image super-resolution and complexity.

      <title>On Image Search in Histopathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pathology images of histopathology can be acquired from camera-mounted microscopes or whole slide scanners. Utilizing similarity calculations to match patients based on these images holds significant potential in research and clinical contexts. Recent advancements in search technologies allow for implicit quantification of tissue morphology across diverse primary sites, facilitating comparisons and enabling inferences about diagnosis, and potentially prognosis, and predictions for new patients when compared against a curated database of diagnosed and treated cases. In this paper, we comprehensively review the latest developments in image search technologies for histopathology, offering a concise overview tailored for computational pathology researchers seeking effective, fast and efficient image search methods in their work.</description>

      <title>Predicting Generalization of AI Colonoscopy Models to Unseen Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09920v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\textbf{Background}$: Generalizability of AI colonoscopy algorithms is important for wider adoption in clinical practice. However, current techniques for evaluating performance on unseen data require expensive and time-intensive labels.
  $\textbf{Methods}$: We use a "Masked Siamese Network" (MSN) to identify novel phenomena in unseen data and predict polyp detector performance. MSN is trained to predict masked out regions of polyp images, without any labels. We test MSN's ability to be trained on data only from Israel and detect unseen techniques, narrow-band imaging (NBI) and chromendoscoy (CE), on colonoscopes from Japan (354 videos, 128 hours). We also test MSN's ability to predict performance of Computer Aided Detection (CADe) of polyps on colonoscopies from both countries, even though MSN is not trained on data from Japan.
  $\textbf{Results}$: MSN correctly identifies NBI and CE as less similar to Israel whitelight than Japan whitelight (bootstrapped z-test, |z| &gt; 496, p &lt; 10^-8 for both) using the label-free Frechet distance. MSN detects NBI with 99% accuracy, predicts CE better than our heuristic (90% vs 79% accuracy) despite being trained only on whitelight, and is the only method that is robust to noisy labels. MSN predicts CADe polyp detector performance on in-domain Israel and out-of-domain Japan colonoscopies (r=0.79, 0.37 respectively). With few examples of Japan detector performance to train on, MSN prediction of Japan performance improves (r=0.56).
  $\textbf{Conclusion}$: Our technique can identify distribution shifts in clinical data and can predict CADe detector performance on unseen data, without labels. Our self-supervised approach can aid in detecting when data in practice is different from training, such as between hospitals or data has meaningfully shifted from training. MSN has potential for application to medical image domains beyond colonoscopy.</description>
