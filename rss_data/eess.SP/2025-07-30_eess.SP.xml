      <title>DOA Estimation via Continuous Aperture Arrays: MUSIC and CRLB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation using continuous aperture array (CAPA) is studied. Compared to the conventional spatially discrete array (SPDA), CAPA significantly enhances the spatial degrees-of-freedoms (DoFs) for DOA estimation, but its infinite-dimensional continuous signals render the conventional estimation algorithm non-applicable. To address this challenge, a new multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is proposed for CAPAs. In particular, an equivalent continuous-discrete transformation is proposed to facilitate the eigendecomposition of continuous operators. Subsequently, the MUSIC spectrum is accurately approximated using the Gauss-Legendre quadrature, effectively reducing the computational complexity. Furthermore, the Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for DOA estimation using CAPAs are analyzed for both cases with and without priori knowledge of snapshot signals. It is theoretically proved that CAPAs significantly improve the DOA estimation accuracy compared to traditional SPDAs. Numerical results further validate this insight and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MUSIC algorithm for CAPA. The proposed method achieves near-optimal estimation performance while maintaining a low computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Transmission With Machine Language Tokens: A Paradigm for Task-Oriented Agent Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement in large foundation models is propelling the paradigm shifts across various industries. One significant change is that agents, instead of traditional machines or humans, will be the primary participants in the future production process, which consequently requires a novel AI-native communication system tailored for agent communications. Integrating the ability of large language models (LLMs) with task-oriented semantic communication is a potential approach. However, the output of existing LLM is human language, which is highly constrained and sub-optimal for agent-type communication. In this paper, we innovatively propose a task-oriented agent communication system. Specifically, we leverage the original LLM to learn a specialized machine language represented by token embeddings. Simultaneously, a multi-modal LLM is trained to comprehend the application task and to extract essential implicit information from multi-modal inputs, subsequently expressing it using machine language tokens. This representation is significantly more efficient for transmission over the air interface. Furthermore, to reduce transmission overhead, we introduce a joint token and channel coding (JTCC) scheme that compresses the token sequence by exploiting its sparsity while enhancing robustness against channel noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces transmission overhead for downstream tasks while enhancing accuracy relative to the SOTA methods.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Nonseparable Fractional Fourier Transform: Theory and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-dimensional (1D) fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) generalizes the 1D Fourier transform, offering significant advantages in time-frequency analysis of non-stationary signals. To extend the benefits of the 1D FRFT to higher-dimensional signals, 2D FRFTs, such as the 2D separable FRFT (SFRFT), gyrator transform (GT), and coupled FRFT (CFRFT), have been developed. However, existing 2D FRFTs suffer from several limitations: (1) a lack of theoretical uniformity and general applicability, (2) an inability to handle 2D non-stationary signals with nonseparable terms, and (3) failure to maintain a consistent 4D rotational relationship with the 2D Wigner distribution (WD), which is essential for ensuring geometric consistency and symmetry in time-frequency analysis. These limitations restrict the methods' performance in practical applications, such as radar, communication, sonar, and optical imaging, in which nonseparable terms frequently arise. To address these challenges, we introduce a more general definition of the 2D FRFT, termed the 2D nonseparable FRFT (NSFRFT). The 2D NSFRFT has four degrees of freedom, includes the 2D SFRFT, GT, and CFRFT as special cases, and maintains a more general 4D rotational relationship with the 2D WD. We derive its properties and present three discrete algorithms, two of which are fast algorithms with computational complexity $O(N^2 \log N)$ comparable to that of the 2D SFRFT. Numerical simulations and experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the 2D NSFRFT in applications such as image encryption, decryption, filtering, and denoising.</description>

      <title>Trainable Joint Time-Vertex Fractional Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address limitations of the graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) Wiener filtering and the traditional joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform (JFRFT) Wiener filtering, this study proposes a filtering method based on the hyper-differential form of the JFRFT. The gradient backpropagation mechanism is employed to enable the adaptive selection of transform order pair and filter coefficients. First, leveraging the hyper-differential form of the GFRFT and the fractional Fourier transform, the hyper-differential form of the JFRFT is constructed and its properties are analyzed. Second, time-varying graph signals are divided into dynamic graph sequences of equal span along the temporal dimension. A spatiotemporal joint representation is then established through vectorized reorganization, followed by the joint time-vertex Wiener filtering. Furthermore, by rigorously proving the differentiability of the transform orders, both the transform orders and filter coefficients are embedded as learnable parameters within a neural network architecture. Through gradient backpropagation, their synchronized iterative optimization is achieved, constructing a parameters-adaptive learning filtering framework. This method leverages a model-driven approach to learn the optimal transform order pair and filter coefficients. Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework improves the time-varying graph signals denoising performance, while reducing the computational burden of the traditional grid search strategy.</description>

      <title>Causal Link Discovery with Unequal Edge Error Tolerance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for causal discovery with asymmetric error control, called Neyman-Pearson causal discovery. Despite the importance of applications where different types of edge errors may have different importance, current state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms do not differentiate between the types of edge errors, nor provide any finite-sample guarantees on the edge errors. Hence, this framework seeks to minimize one type of error while keeping the other below a user-specified tolerance level. Using techniques from information theory, fundamental performance limits are found, characterized by the R\'enyi divergence, for Neyman-Pearson causal discovery. Furthermore, a causal discovery algorithm is introduced for the case of linear additive Gaussian noise models, called epsilon-CUT, that provides finite-sample guarantees on the false positive rate, while staying competitive with state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Affine Invariant Semi-Blind Receiver: Joint Channel Estimation and High-Order Signal Detection for Multiuser Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) systems with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) are foundational for downlink multi-user (MU) communication in future wireless networks, for their ability to enhance spectral efficiency and support a large number of users simultaneously. However, high user density intensifies severe inter-user interference (IUI) and pilot overhead. Consequently, existing blind and semi-blind channel estimation (CE) and signal detection (SD) algorithms suffer performance degradation and increased complexity, especially when further challenged by frequency-selective channels and high-order modulation demands. To this end, this paper proposes a novel semi-blind joint channel estimation and signal detection (JCESD) method. Specifically, the proposed approach employs a hybrid precoding architecture to suppress IUI. Furthermore we formulate JCESD as a non-convex constellation fitting optimization exploiting constellation affine invariance. Few pilots are used to achieve coarse estimation for initialization and ambiguity resolution. For high-order modulations, a data augmentation mechanism utilizes the symmetry of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations to increase the effective number of samples. To address frequency-selective channels, CE accuracy is then enhanced via an iterative refinement strategy that leverages improved SD results. Simulation results demonstrate an average throughput gain of 11\% over widely used pilot-based methods in MU scenarios, highlighting the proposed method's potential to improve spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Analysis of Behavioral Hardware Impairments in Cell-Free Massive MIMO-OFDM Uplink: Centralized Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO is a key 6G technology, offering superior spectral and energy efficiency. However, its dense deployment of low-cost access points (APs) makes hardware impairments unavoidable. While narrowband impairments are well-studied, their impact in wideband systems remains unexplored. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of hardware impairments, such as nonlinear distortion in low-noise amplifiers, phase noise, in-phase-quadrature imbalance, and low-resolution analog-to-digital converters, on uplink spectral efficiency in cell-free massive MIMO. Using an OFDM waveform and centralized processing, APs share channel state information for joint uplink combining. Leveraging Bussgang decomposition, we derive a distortion-aware combining vector that optimizes spectral efficiency by modeling distortion as independent colored noise.</description>

      <title>Impact of Phase Noise and Power Amplifier Non-Linearities on Downlink Cell-Free Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is a key enabler for the sixth generation (6G) of mobile networks, offering significant spectral and energy efficiency gains through user-centric operation of distributed access points (APs). However, its reliance on low-cost APs introduces inevitable hardware impairments, whose combined impact on wideband downlink systems remains unexplored when analyzed using behavioral models. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the downlink spectral efficiency (SE) in cell-free massive MIMO-OFDM systems under practical hardware impairments, including phase noise and third-order power amplifier nonlinearities. Both centralized and distributed precoding strategies are examined. By leveraging the Bussgang decomposition, we derive an SE expression and quantify the relative impact of impairments through simulations. Our results reveal that phase noise causes more severe degradation than power amplifier distortions, especially in distributed operation, highlighting the need for future distortion-aware precoding designs.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Resource Allocation for Multi-Operator Cell-Free Massive MIMO in V-CRAN Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) implemented in virtualized cloud radio access networks (V-CRAN) has emerged as a promising architecture to enhance spectral efficiency (SE), network flexibility, and energy efficiency (EE) in next-generation wireless systems. In this work, we develop a holistic optimization framework for the efficient deployment of cell-free massive MIMO in V-CRAN with multiple mobile network operators (MNOs). Specifically, we formulate a set of mixed-integer programming (MIP) models to jointly optimize access point (AP) selection, user equipment (UE) association, cloud resource allocation, and MNO assignment while minimizing the maximum total power consumption (TPC) across MNOs. We consider two different scenarios based on whether UEs can be assigned to arbitrary MNOs or not. The numerical results demonstrate the impact of different deployment assumptions on power consumption, highlighting that flexible UE-MNO assignment significantly reduces TPC. The findings provide key insights into optimizing resource management in cell-free massive MIMO V-CRAN, paving the way for energy-efficient wireless network implementations.</description>

      <title>Edge Agentic AI Framework for Autonomous Network Optimisation in O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of AI agents within legacy Radio Access Network (RAN) infrastructure poses significant safety and reliability challenges for future 6G networks. This paper presents a novel Edge AI framework for autonomous network optimisation in Open RAN environments, addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1) a persona-based multi-tools architecture enabling distributed, context-aware decision-making; (2) proactive anomaly detection agent powered by traffic predictive tool; and (3) a safety, aligned reward mechanism that balances performance with operational stability. Integrated into the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), our framework leverages multimodal data fusion, including network KPIs, a traffic prediction model, and external information sources, to anticipate and respond to dynamic network conditions. Extensive evaluation using realistic 5G scenarios demonstrates that the edge framework achieves zero network outages under high-stress conditions, compared to 8.4% for traditional fixed-power networks and 3.3% for large language model (LLM) agent-based approaches, while maintaining near real-time responsiveness and consistent QoS. These results establish that, when equipped with the right tools and contextual awareness, AI agents can be safely and effectively deployed in critical network infrastructure, laying the framework for intelligent and autonomous 5G and beyond network operations.</description>

      <title>EcoFL: Resource Allocation for Energy-Efficient Federated Learning in Multi-RAT ORAN Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed model training on edge devices while preserving data privacy. However, FL deployments in wireless networks face significant challenges, including communication overhead, unreliable connectivity, and high energy consumption, particularly in dynamic environments. This paper proposes EcoFL, an integrated FL framework that leverages the Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) architecture with multiple Radio Access Technologies (RATs) to enhance communication efficiency and ensure robust FL operations. EcoFL implements a two-stage optimisation approach: an RL-based rApp for dynamic RAT selection that balances energy efficiency with network performance, and a CNN-based xApp for near real-time resource allocation with adaptive policies. This coordinated approach significantly enhances communication resilience under fluctuating network conditions. Experimental results demonstrate competitive FL model performance with 19\% lower power consumption compared to baseline approaches, highlighting substantial potential for scalable, energy-efficient collaborative learning applications.</description>

      <title>Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) for 6G: Properties, Features, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is an emerging waveform candidate for future sixth generation (6G) systems offering a range of promising features, such as enhanced robustness in heterogeneous and high-mobility environments, as well as inherent suitability for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) applications. In addition, unlike other candidates such as orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation, AFDM provides several unique advantages that strengthen its relevance to practical deployment and standardization in 6G. Notably, as a natural generalization of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), strong backward compatibility with existing conventional systems is guaranteed, while also offering novel possibilities in waveform design, for example to enable physical-layer security through its inherent chirp parametrization. In all, this article provides an overview of AFDM, emphasizing its suitability as a candidate waveform for 6G standardization. First, we provide a concise introduction to the fundamental properties and unique characteristics of AFDM, followed by highlights of its advantageous features, and finally a discussion of its potential and challenges in 6G standardization efforts and representative requirements.</description>

      <title>CRB-Rate Tradeoff for Bistatic ISAC with Gaussian Information and Deterministic Sensing Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a bistatic integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system, consisting of a multi-antenna base station (BS), a multi-antenna sensing receiver, a single-antenna communication user (CU), and a point target to be sensed. Specifically, the BS transmits a superposition of Gaussian information and deterministic sensing signals. The BS aims to deliver information symbols to the CU, while the sensing receiver aims to estimate the target's direction-of-arrival (DoA) with respect to the sensing receiver by processing the echo signals. For the sensing receiver, we assume that only the sequences of the deterministic sensing signals and the covariance matrix of the information signals are perfectly known, whereas the specific realizations of the information signals remain unavailable. Under this setup, we first derive the corresponding Cram\'er-Rao bounds (CRBs) for DoA estimation and propose practical estimators to accurately estimate the target's DoA. Subsequently, we formulate the transmit beamforming design as an optimization problem aiming to minimize the CRB, subject to a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement at the CU and a maximum transmit power constraint at the BS. When the BS employs only Gaussian information signals, the resulting beamforming optimization problem is convex, enabling the derivation of an optimal solution. In contrast, when both Gaussian information and deterministic sensing signals are transmitted, the resulting problem is non-convex and a locally optimal solution is acquired by exploiting successive convex approximation (SCA). Finally, numerical results demonstrate that employing Gaussian information signals leads to a notable performance degradation for target sensing and the proposed transmit beamforming design achieves a superior ISAC performance boundary compared with various benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>A Novel Framework for Near-Field Covert Communications with RIS and RSMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the near field (NF) covert communication with the aid of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS). In particular, the RIS operates in the NF of both the legitimate user and the passive adversary, enhancing the legitimate users received signal while suppressing the adversarys detection capability. Whereas, the base station (BS) applies RSMA to increase the covert communication rate composed of a private and a shared rate component. To characterize system covertness, we derive closed form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP), outage probability (OP), and optimal detection threshold for the adversary. We formulate a non-convex joint beamforming optimization problem at the BS and RIS under unit-modulus constraints to maximize the covert rate. To tackle this, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, where the BS beamformer is designed using a two-stage iterative method based on successive convex approximation (SCA). Additionally, two low-complexity techniques are introduced to further reduce the adversarys received power. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively improves the covert communication rate, highlighting the potential of near field RSMA-RIS integration in covert communication.</description>

      <title>Zak-OTFS Based Coded Random Access for Uplink mMTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a grant-free coded random access (CRA) scheme for uplink massive machine-type communications (mMTC), based on Zak-orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS) modulation in the delay-Doppler domain. The scheme is tailored for doubly selective wireless channels, where conventional orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based CRA suffers from unreliable inter-slot channel prediction due to time-frequency variability. By exploiting the predictable nature of Zak-OTFS, the proposed approach enables accurate channel estimation across slots, facilitating reliable successive interference cancellation across user packet replicas. A fair comparison with an OFDM-based CRA baseline shows that the proposed scheme achieves significantly lower packet loss rates under high mobility and user density. Extensive simulations over the standardized Veh-A channel confirm the robustness and scalability of Zak-OTFS-based CRA, supporting its applicability to future mMTC deployments.</description>

      <title>Site-Specific Location Calibration and Validation of Ray-Tracing Simulator NYURay at Upper Mid-Band Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ray-tracing (RT) simulators are essential for wireless digital twins, enabling accurate site-specific radio channel prediction for next-generation wireless systems. Yet, RT simulation accuracy is often limited by insufficient measurement data and a lack of systematic validation. This paper presents site-specific location calibration and validation of NYURay, NYU's in-house ray tracer, at upper mid-band frequencies (6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz). We propose a location calibration algorithm that corrects GPS-induced position errors by optimizing transmitter-receiver (TX-RX) locations to align simulated and measured power delay profiles, improving TX-RX location accuracy by 42.3% for line-of-sight (LOS) and 13.5% for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Validation across 18 TX-RX locations shows excellent RT accuracy in path loss prediction, with path loss exponent (PLE) deviations under 0.14. While RT underestimates delay spread and angular spreads, their cumulative distributions remain statistically similar. The validated NYURay advances RT validation and provides reliable channel statistics for 6G deployment.</description>

      <title>Distributed Iterative ML and Message Passing for Grant-Free Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell-Free (CF) Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MaMIMO) is considered one of the leading candidates for enabling next-generation wireless communication. With the growing interest in the Internet of Things (IoT), the Grant-Free (GF) access scheme has emerged as a promising solution to support massive device connectivity. The integration of GF and CF-MaMIMO introduces significant challenges, particularly in designing distributed algorithms for activity detection and pilot contamination mitigation. In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm that addresses these challenges. Our method first employs a component-wise iterative distributed Maximum Likelihood (ML) approach for activity detection, which considers both the pilot and data portions of the received signal. This is followed by a Pseudo-Prior Hybrid Variational Bayes and Expectation Propagation (PP-VB-EP) algorithm for joint data detection and channel estimation. Compared to conventional VB-EP, the proposed PP-VB-EP demonstrates improved convergence behavior and reduced sensitivity to initialization, especially when data symbols are drawn from a finite alphabet. The pseudo prior used in PP-VB-EP acts as an approximated posterior and serves as a regularization term that prevents the Message Passing (MP) algorithm from diverging. To compute the pseudo prior in a distributed fashion, we further develop a distributed version of the Variable-Level Expectation Propagation (VL-EP) algorithm.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Saturation in Two-Timescale RIS-assisted Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers wireless communication assisted by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), focusing on the two-timescale approach, in which the RIS phase shifts are optimized based on channel statistics to mitigate the overheads associated with channel estimation. It is shown that, while the power captured by the RIS scales linearly with the number of its elements, the two-timescale beamforming gain upon re-radiation towards the receiver saturates rapidly as the number of RIS elements increases, for a broad class of power angular spectra (PAS). The ultimate achievable gain is determined by the decay rate of the PAS in the angular domain, which directly influences how rapidly spatial correlations between RIS elements diminish. The implications of this saturation on the effectiveness of RIS-assisted communications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Pilot-to-Data Power Ratio in RIS-Assisted Multiantenna Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimization of the \gls{pdpr} is a recourse that helps wireless systems to acquire channel state information while minimizing the pilot overhead. While the optimization of the \gls{pdpr} in cellular networks has been studied extensively, the effect of the \gls{pdpr} in \gls{ris}-assisted networks has hardly been examined. This paper tackles this optimization when the communication is assisted by a RIS whose phase shifts are adjusted on the basis of the statistics of the channels. For a setting representative of a macrocellular deployment, the benefits of optimizing the PDPR are seen to be significant over a broad range of operating conditions. These benefits, demonstrated through the ergodic minimum mean squared error, for which a closed-form solution is derived, become more pronounced as the number of RIS elements and/or the channel coherence grow large.</description>

      <title>Efficient Pain Recognition via Respiration Signals: A Single Cross-Attention Transformer Multi-Window Fusion Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21886v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pain is a complex condition affecting a large portion of the population. Accurate and consistent evaluation is essential for individuals experiencing pain, and it supports the development of effective and advanced management strategies. Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and support clinical decision-making, aiming to reduce distress and prevent functional decline. This study has been submitted to the \textit{Second Multimodal Sensing Grand Challenge for Next-Gen Pain Assessment (AI4PAIN)}. The proposed method introduces a pipeline that leverages respiration as the input signal and incorporates a highly efficient cross-attention transformer alongside a multi-windowing strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that respiration is a valuable physiological modality for pain assessment. Moreover, experiments revealed that compact and efficient models, when properly optimized, can achieve strong performance, often surpassing larger counterparts. The proposed multi-window approach effectively captures both short-term and long-term features, as well as global characteristics, thereby enhancing the model's representational capacity.</description>

      <title>Joint Multitarget Detection and Tracking with mmWave Radar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate targets detection and tracking with mmWave radar is a key sensing capability that will enable more intelligent systems, create smart, efficient, automated system. This paper proposes an end-to-end detection-estimation-track framework named MNOMP-SPA-KF consisting of the target detection and estimation module, the data association (DA) module and the target tracking module. In the target estimation and detection module, a low complexity, super-resolution and constant false alarm rate (CFAR) based two dimensional multisnapshot Newtonalized orthogonal matching pursuit (2D-MNOMP) is designed to extract the multitarget's radial distances and velocities, followed by the conventional (Bartlett) beamformer to extract the multitarget's azimuths. In the DA module, a sum product algorithm (SPA) is adopted to obtain the association probabilities of the existed targets and measurements by incorporating the radial velocity information. The Kalman filter (KF) is implemented to perform target tracking in the target tracking module by exploiting the asymptotic distribution of the estimators. To improve the detection probability of the weak targets, extrapolation is also coupled into the MNOMP-SPA-KF. Numerical and real data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the MNOMP-SPA-KF algorithm, compared to other benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <title>Faster-Than-Nyquist Equalization with Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling aims at improving the spectral efficiency of wireless communication systems by exceeding the boundaries set by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. 50 years after its first introduction in the scientific literature, wireless communications have significantly changed, but spectral efficiency remains one of the key challenges. To adopt FTN signaling, inter-symbol interference (ISI) patterns need to be equalized at the receiver. Motivated by the pattern recognition capabilities of convolutional neural networks with skip connections, we propose such deep learning architecture for ISI equalization and symbol demodulation in FTN receivers. We investigate the performance of the proposed model considering quadrature phase shift keying modulation and low density parity check coding, and compare it to a set of benchmarks, including frequency-domain equalization, a quadratic-programming-based receiver, and an equalization scheme based on a deep neural network. We show that our receiver outperforms any benchmark, achieving error rates comparable to those in additive white Gaussian noise channel, and higher effective throughput, thanks to the increased spectral efficiency of FTN signaling. With a compression factor of 60% and code rate 3/4, the proposed model achieves a peak effective throughput of 2.5 Mbps at just 10dB of energy per bit over noise power spectral density ratio, with other receivers being limited by error floors due to the strong inter-symbol interference. To promote reproducibility in deep learning for wireless communications, our code is open source at the repository provided in the references.</description>

      <title>Advancing Brainwave-Based Biometrics: A Large-Scale, Multi-Session Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of brainwave-based biometrics has gained attention for its potential to revolutionize user authentication through hands-free interaction, resistance to shoulder surfing, continuous authentication, and revocability. However, current research often relies on single-session or limited-session datasets with fewer than 55 subjects, raising concerns about the generalizability of the findings. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale study using a public brainwave dataset comprising 345 subjects and over 6,007 sessions (an average of 17 per subject) recorded over five years using three headsets. Our results reveal that deep learning approaches significantly outperform hand-crafted feature extraction methods. We also observe Equal Error Rates (EER) increases over time (e.g., from 6.7% after 1 day to 14.3% after a year). Therefore, it is necessary to reinforce the enrollment set after successful login attempts. Moreover, we demonstrate that fewer brainwave measurement sensors can be used, with an acceptable increase in EER, which is necessary for transitioning from medical-grade to affordable consumer-grade devices. Finally, we compared our results to prior work and existing biometric standards. While our performance is on par with or exceeds previous approaches, it still falls short of industrial benchmarks. Based on the results, we hypothesize that further improvements are possible with larger training sets. To support future research, we have open-sourced our analysis code.</description>

      <title>A Neural Network-aided Low Complexity Chase Decoder for URLLC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) demand decoding algorithms that simultaneously offer high reliability and low complexity under stringent latency constraints. While iterative decoding schemes for LDPC and Polar codes offer a good compromise between performance and complexity, they fall short in approaching the theoretical performance limits in the typical URLLC short block length regime. Conversely, quasi-ML decoding schemes for algebraic codes, like Chase-II decoding, exhibit a smaller gap to optimum decoding but are computationally prohibitive for practical deployment in URLLC systems. To bridge this gap, we propose an enhanced Chase-II decoding algorithm that leverages a neural network (NN) to predict promising perturbation patterns, drastically reducing the number of required decoding trials. The proposed approach combines the reliability of quasi-ML decoding with the efficiency of NN inference, making it well-suited for time-sensitive and resource-constrained applications.</description>

      <title>On the Feasibility of Distributed Phase Synchronization for Coherent Signal Superposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze the feasibility of distributed phase synchronization for coherent signal superposition, a fundamental enabler for paradigms such as coherent over-the-air computation (OAC), distributed beamforming, and interference alignment, under mobility and hardware impairments. With the focus on coherent OAC, we introduce phase-coded pilots (PCPs), a strategy where the radios communicate with each other to eliminate the round-trip phase change in the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) to align the phase of the received symbol at a desired angle. In this study, considering a carrier frequency offset (CFO)-resilient multi-user procedure, we derive the statistics of the phase deviations to assess how fast the phase coherency degrades. Our results show that residual CFO is a major factor determining the duration of phase coherency, in addition to the non-negligible effects of mobility and the number of nodes in the network. We also provide a proof-of-concept demonstration for coherent signal superposition by using off-the-shelf radios to demonstrate the feasibility of PCPs in practice.</description>

      <title>On Purely Data-Driven Massive MIMO Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of learning-based detectors for massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems has been hindered by the inherent complexities arising from the problem's high dimensionality. To enhance scalability, most previous studies have adopted model-driven methodologies that integrate deep neural networks (DNNs) within existing iterative detection frameworks. However, these methods often lack flexibility and involve substantial computational complexity. In this paper, we introduce ChannelNet, a purely data-driven learning-based massive MIMO detector that overcomes these limitations. ChannelNet exploits the inherent symmetry of MIMO systems by incorporating channel-embedded layers and antenna-wise shared feature processors. These modules maintain equivariance to antenna permutations and enable ChannelNet to scale efficiently to large numbers of antennas and high modulation orders with low computational complexity, specifically $\mathcal{O}(N_t N_r)$, where $N_t$ and $N_r$ denote the numbers of transmit and receive antennas, respectively. Theoretically, ChannelNet can approximate any continuous permutation-symmetric function and the optimal maximum likelihood detection (ML) function with arbitrary precision under any continuous channel distribution. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ChannelNet consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art detectors across different numbers of antennas, modulation schemes, and channel distributions, all while significantly reducing computational overhead. This study highlights the potential of purely data-driven designs in advancing efficient and scalable detectors for massive MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Energy Saving in Cell-Free Massive MIMO ISAC for Ultra-Reliable Target-Aware Actuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10315v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-reliable target-aware actuation-where timely and accurate sensing information is used to trigger critical actions in emerging 6G sensing-based applications-demands tight integration of sensing and communication under stringent reliability and latency constraints. This paper investigates integrated sensing and communication(ISAC)in a downlink CF-mMIMO system supporting multi-static sensing and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). We propose a joint power and blocklength allocation algorithm to minimize the E2E energy consumption while meeting communication and sensing requirements.E2E energy consumption includes transmission, sensing receivers, and processing for both sensing and communication. The non-convex optimization problem is solved using a combination of FPP-SCA, concave-convex programming (CCP), and fractional programming techniques. We consider two types of target detectors:clutter-aware and clutter-unaware, each with distinct complexity and performance trade-offs.A computational complexity analysis based on giga-operations per second (GOPS) is conducted to quantify the processing requirements of communication and sensing tasks. We perform a comprehensive performance evaluation under various communication and sensing requirements, and benchmark our approach against two alternatives: one minimizing only transmission energy for ISAC and one minimizing E2E energy only for URLLC without sensing integration. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves enhanced detection capability with less E2E energy consumption. Additionally, we examine the trade-offs between detector complexity, the number of antenna elements per access point(AP), and the number of sensing APs. Clutter-aware detectors, although more complex, require fewer antennas and sensing receive APs to meet detection requirements, thus yielding up to 40% energy savings.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Beyond Diagonal RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) is a promising architecture for further improving spectral efficiency (SE) with low cost and power consumption. However, conventional RIS has inevitable limitations due to its capability of only reflecting signals. In contrast, beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), with its ability to both reflect and transmit signals, has gained great attention. This correspondence focuses on using BD-RIS to improve the sum SE of CF mMIMO systems. This requires completing the beamforming design under the transmit power constraints and unitary constraints of the BD-RIS, by optimizing active and passive beamformer simultaneously. To tackle this issue, we introduce an alternating optimization algorithm that decomposes it using fractional programming and solves the subproblems alternatively. Moreover, to address the challenge introduced by the unitary constraint on the beamforming matrix of the BD-RIS, a manifold optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the problem optimally. Simulation results show that BD-RISs outperform RISs comprehensively, especially in the case of the full connected architecture which achieves the best performance, enhancing the sum SE by around 40% compared to ideal RISs.</description>

      <title>EEG-CLIP : Learning EEG representations from natural language descriptions</title>

Abstract: Deep networks for electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding are often only trained to solve one specific task, such as pathology or age decoding. A more general task-agnostic approach is to train deep networks to match a (clinical) EEG recording to its corresponding textual medical report and vice versa. This approach was pioneered in the computer vision domain matching images and their text captions and subsequently allowed to do successful zero-shot decoding using textual class prompts. In this work, we follow this approach and develop a contrastive learning framework, EEG-CLIP, that aligns the EEG time series and the descriptions of the corresponding clinical text in a shared embedding space. We investigated its potential for versatile EEG decoding, evaluating performance in a range of few-shot and zero-shot settings. Overall, we show that EEG-CLIP manages to non-trivially align text and EEG representations. Our work presents a promising approach to learn general EEG representations, which could enable easier analyses of diverse decoding questions through zero-shot decoding or training task-specific models from fewer training examples. The code for reproducing our results is available at https://github.com/tidiane-camaret/EEGClip</description>

      <title>TolerantECG: A Foundation Model for Imperfect Electrocardiogram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential and effective tool for diagnosing heart diseases. However, its effectiveness can be compromised by noise or unavailability of one or more leads of the standard 12-lead recordings, resulting in diagnostic errors or uncertainty. To address these challenges, we propose TolerantECG, a foundation model for ECG signals that is robust to noise and capable of functioning with arbitrary subsets of the standard 12-lead ECG. TolerantECG training combines contrastive and self-supervised learning frameworks to jointly learn ECG signal representations alongside their corresponding knowledge-retrieval-based text report descriptions and corrupted or lead-missing signals. Comprehensive benchmarking results demonstrate that TolerantECG consistently ranks as the best or second-best performer across various ECG signal conditions and class levels in the PTB-XL dataset, and achieves the highest performance on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.</description>

      <title>Unscented Kalman Filter with a Nonlinear Propagation Model for Navigation Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unscented Kalman filter is a nonlinear estimation algorithm commonly used in navigation applications. The prediction of the mean and covariance matrix is crucial to the stable behavior of the filter. This prediction is done by propagating the sigma points according to the dynamic model at hand. In this paper, we introduce an innovative method to propagate the sigma points according to the nonlinear dynamic model of the navigation error state vector. This improves the filter accuracy and navigation performance. We demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approach using real sensor data recorded by an autonomous underwater vehicle during several scenarios.</description>
