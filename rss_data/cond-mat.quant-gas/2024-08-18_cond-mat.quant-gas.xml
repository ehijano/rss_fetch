      <title>Dynamics of the unitary Bose gas near a narrow Feshbach resonance: universal coherent atom-molecule oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quench experiments on a unitary Bose gas around a broad Feshbach resonance have led to the discovery of universal dynamics. This universality is manifested in the measured atomic momentum distributions where, asymptotically, a quasi-equilibrated metastable state is found in which both the momentum distribution and the time scales are determined by the particle density. In this paper we present counterpart studies but for the case of a very narrow Feshbach resonance of $^{133}$Cs atoms having a width of 8.3 mG. In dramatic contrast to the behavior reported earlier, a rapid quench of an atomic condensate to unitarity is observed to ultimately lead to coherent oscillations involving dynamically produced condensed and non-condensed molecules and atoms. The same characteristic frequency, determined by the Feshbach coupling, is observed in all types of particles. To understand these quench dynamics and how these different particle species are created, we develop a beyond Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov dynamical framework including a new type of cross correlation between atoms and molecules. This leads to a quantitative consistency with the measured frequency. Our results, which can be applied to the general class of bosonic superfluids associated with narrow Feshbach resonances, establish a new paradigm for universal dynamics dominated by quantum many-body interactions.</description>

      <title>Stability of Majorana zero modes with quantum optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I analyze the emergence of Majorana zero modes (MZM) in a one dimensional ultracold fermionic system confined by an optical lattice inside a high-Q cavity. This forms a quantum optical lattice due to the cavity backaction, with emergent long range interactions controlled by the light pumped into the system and thus long range pairing. I investigate the possibility of formation and emergence of edge modes using exact diagonalization and singular value decomposition of the Hamiltonian in the Majorana representation, while computing the mass gap of the MZM. I find that under certain conditions MZM appear distinctively. This MZM have potential applications for quantum information as they are topologically protected analogous to the behaviour of the Kitaev chain.</description>

      <title>Proposal for simulating quantum spin models with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction using Rydberg atoms, and construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states</title>

Abstract: We have developed a method to simulate quantum spin models with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) using Rydberg atom quantum simulators. Our approach involves a two-photon Raman transition and a transformation to the spin-rotating frame, both of which are feasible with current experimental techniques. As a model that can be simulated in our setup but not in solid-state systems, we consider an $S=1/2$ spin chain with a Hamiltonian consisting of the DMI and Zeeman energy. We study the magnetization curve in the ground state of this model and quench dynamics. Further, we show the existence of quantum many-body scar states and asymptotic quantum many-body scar states. The observed nonergodicity in this model demonstrates the importance of the highly tunable DMI that can be realized by the proposed quantum simulator.</description>

      <title>Information theoretic measures on quantum droplets in ultracold atomic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Shannon entropy, Fisher information, R\'enyi entropy, and Tsallis entropy to study the quantum droplet phase in Bose-Einstein condensates. In the beyond mean-field description, the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with Lee-Huang-Yang correction gives a family of quantum droplets with different chemical potentials. At the larger value of chemical potential, quantum droplet with sharp-top probability density distribution starts to form while it becomes flat top for a smaller value of chemical potential. We show that entropic measures can distinguish the shape change of the probability density distributions and thus can identify the onset of the droplet phase. During the onset of droplet phase, the Shannon entropy decreases gradually with the decrease of chemical potential and attains a minimum in the vicinity where a smooth transition from flat-top to sharp-top QDs occurs. At this stage, the Shannon entropy increases abruptly with the lowering of chemical potential. We observe an opposite trend in the case of Fisher information. These results are found to be consistent with the R\'enyi and Tsallis entropic measures.</description>

      <title>Stability of quasicrystalline ultracold fermions to dipolar interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic potentials can be used to interpolate between localization and delocalization in one dimension. With the rise of optical platforms engineering dipolar interactions, a key question is the stability of quasicrystalline phases under these long-range interactions. In this work, we study repulsive ultracold dipolar fermions in a quasiperiodic optical lattice to characterize the behavior of interacting quasicrystals. We simulate the full time evolution of the typical experimental protocols used to probe quasicrystalline order and localization properties. We extract experimentally measurable dynamical observables and correlation functions to characterize the three phases observed in the noninteracting setting: localized, intermediate, and extended. We then study the stability of such phases to repulsive dipolar interactions. We find that dipolar interactions can completely alter the shape of the phase diagram by stabilizing the intermediate phase, mostly at the expense of the extended phase. Moreover, in the strongly interacting regime, a resonance-like behavior characterized by density oscillations appears. Remarkably, strong dipolar repulsions can also localize particles even in the absence of quasiperiodicity if the primary lattice is sufficiently deep. Our work shows that dipolar interactions in a quasiperiodic potential can give rise to a complex, tuneable coexistence of localized and extended quantum states.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of spin helices in the diluted one-dimensional $XX$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by discrepancies between recent cold atom experiments and the associated theory, we explore the effect of immobile holes on the quantum dynamics of $x$-$z$ spin helices in the one-dimensional $XX$ model. We calculate the exact spin dynamics by mapping onto a system of non-interacting fermions, averaging over the distribution of holes. At small hole densities we find that the helical spin pattern decays exponentially, with a pitch dependence that agrees with the experiments. At large hole densities we instead find persistent oscillations. While our analytic approach does not generalize to the $XXZ$ model with arbitrary anisotropies, we validate a matrix product state technique which might be used to model the experiments in those settings.</description>

      <title>Dipolar ordering transitions in many-body quantum optics: Analytical diagrammatic approach to equilibrium quantum spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum spin models with a large number of interaction partners per spin are frequently used to describe modern many-body quantum optical systems like arrays of Rydberg atoms, atom-cavity systems or trapped ion crystals. For theoretical analysis the mean-field (MF) ansatz is routinely applied. However, besides special cases of all-to-all or strong long range interactions, the MF ansatz provides only approximate results. Here we present a systematic correction to MF theory based on diagrammatic perturbation theory for quantum spin correlators in thermal equilibrium. Our analytic results are universally applicable for any lattice geometry and spin-length S. We provide pre-computed and easy-to-use building blocks for Ising, Heisenberg and transverse field Ising models in the symmetry-unbroken regime. We showcase the quality and simplicity of the method by computing magnetic phase boundaries and excitations gaps. We also treat the Dicke-Ising model of ground-state superradiance where we show that corrections to the MF phase boundary vanish.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz</title>

Abstract: The recently proposed exact quantum solution for two $\delta$-function-interacting particles with a mass-ratio $3\!:\!1$ in a hard-wall box [Y. Liu, F. Qi, Y. Zhang and S. Chen, iScience 22, 181 (2019)] violates the conventional necessary condition for a Bethe Ansatz integrability, the condition being that the system must be reducible to a superposition of semi-transparent mirrors that is invariant under all the reflections it generates. In this article, we found a way to relax this condition: some of the semi-transparent mirrors of a known self-invariant mirror superposition can be replaced by the perfectly reflecting ones, thus breaking the self-invariance. The proposed name for the method is \emph{Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz} (Asymmetric BA). As a worked example, we study in detail the bound states of the nominally non-integrable system comprised of a bosonic dimer in a $\delta$-well. Finally, we show that the exact solution of the Liu-Qi-Zhang-Chen problem is a particular instance of the the Asymmetric BA.</description>

Abstract: Cold atoms in optical lattice represent a quantum system of fundamental importance as they enable the study of many-body physics in a controllable way. It is thus essential to develop theoretical and experimental tools to explore quantum correlation in such systems to advance our understanding of many-body interactions. While previous works have identified some profound aspects of quantum entanglement via e.g. entanglement entropy, there exists a critical demand to have an experimentally accessible tool to investigate many-body quantum entanglement in a broad context. We present an entanglement criterion characterizing collective entanglement among lattice sites and enabling experimental observation readily. Our criterion witnesses phase transitions such as Mott insulator--superfluid and Mott insulator--charge density wave transitions in a measurable way and can be experimentally tested via Raman scattering or time-of-flight expansion approach thus within the reach of current technology.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Schultz-Mattis constraints for the insulating phases of the one-dimensional SU($N$) Kondo lattice model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of the insulating phases of the SU($N$)-generalization of the one-dimensional Kondo lattice model is investigated by means of non-perturbative approaches. By extending the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) argument to multi-component fermion systems with translation and global SU($N$) symmetries, we derive two indices which depend on the filling and the ``SU($N$)-spin'' (representation) of the local moments. These indices strongly constrain possible insulating phases; for instance, when the local moments transform in the $N$-dimensional (defining) representation of SU($N$), a featureless Kondo insulator is possible only at filling $f= 1-1/N$. To obtain further insight into the insulating phases suggested by the LSM argument, we derive low-energy effective theories by adding an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange interaction among the local moments [the SU($N$) Kondo-Heisenberg model]. A conjectured global phase diagram of the SU($N$) Kondo lattice model as a function of the filling and the Kondo coupling is then obtained by a combination of different analytical approaches.</description>

      <title>Robust double Bragg diffraction via detuning control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new theoretical model and numerical optimization of double Bragg diffraction (DBD), a widely used technique in atom interferometry. We derive an effective two-level-system Hamiltonian based on the Magnus expansion in the so-called "quasi-Bragg regime", where most Bragg-pulse atom interferometers operate. Furthermore, we extend the theory to a five-level description to account for Doppler detuning. Using these derived effective Hamiltonians, we investigate the impacts of AC-Stark shift and polarization errors on the double Bragg beam-splitter, along with their mitigations through detuning control. Notably, we design a linear detuning sweep that demonstrates robust efficiency exceeding 99.5% against polarization errors up to 8.5%. Moreover, we develop an artificial intelligence-aided optimal detuning control protocol, showcasing enhanced robustness against both polarization errors and Doppler effects. This protocol achieves an average efficiency of 99.92% for samples with a finite momentum width of 0.05$\hbar k_L$ within an extended polarization error range of up to 10%.</description>
