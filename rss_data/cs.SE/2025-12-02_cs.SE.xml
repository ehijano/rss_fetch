      <title>Injecting Sustainability in Software Architecture: A Rapid Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sustainability has evolved from an emerging concern into a fundamental responsibility in software design, development, and operation. Research increasingly explores how sustainability can be systematically integrated into existing software engineering practices. Building on an industry-academia collaboration, we contribute to this discourse by conducting a mixed-method empirical study. We combine a rapid review of secondary studies with a focus group of practitioners. The review identifies challenges and opportunities in embedding sustainability in software architecture, while the focus group enriches and compares these findings. Based on the literature and industry synthesis, we derive five tangible takeaways to inform architects working in the field, and to guide our industry partners in the integration of sustainability concerns in architecture practices.</description>

      <title>Generating Verifiable CoT from Execution-Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teaching language models to reason about code execution remains a fundamental challenge. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise, current synthetic training data suffers from a critical weakness: the reasoning steps are often plausible-sounding explanations generated by teacher models, not verifiable accounts of what the code actually does. This creates a troubling failure mode where models learn to mimic superficially convincing but logically flawed reasoning patterns.
  We address this by grounding CoT generation directly in program execution traces. Our pipeline instruments code to capture its dynamic behavior, then narrates these verified execution traces into natural language rationales that are correct by construction. This execution-grounded approach ensures every reasoning step reflects what the program genuinely computes, eliminating logical hallucinations at the source. We evaluate our method on code reasoning tasks (forward reasoning on CruxEval and LiveCodeBench-Exec, backward reasoning on CruxEval-Input), as well as code generation and explanation tasks from HumanEval. Models trained on our bi-directional trace-grounded data achieve substantial improvements, with gains of up to 30 points on output prediction and 28 points on input prediction over base models, alongside improved explanation and code generation, demonstrating that verifiable reasoning fundamentally enhances model capabilities. https://github.ibm.com/IBM-Research-AI/Verified-Code-CoT</description>

      <title>Asm2SrcEval: Evaluating Large Language Models for Assembly-to-Source Code Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assembly-to-source code translation is a critical task in reverse engineering, cybersecurity, and software maintenance, yet systematic benchmarks for evaluating large language models on this problem remain scarce. In this work, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of five state-of-the-art large language models on assembly-to-source translation. We assess model performance using a diverse set of metrics capturing lexical similarity (BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR), semantic alignment (BERTScore), fluency (Perplexity), and efficiency (time prediction). Our results reveal clear trade-offs: while certain models excel in text similarity metrics, others demonstrate lower perplexity or faster inference times. We further provide qualitative analyses of typical model successes and failure cases, highlighting challenges such as control flow recovery and identifier reconstruction. Taken together, our benchmark offers actionable insights into the strengths and limitations of current large language models for program translation, establishing a foundation for future research in combining accuracy with efficiency for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Errors in LLM Reasoning Traces: An Empirical Study of Code Execution Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding a program's runtime reasoning behavior, meaning how intermediate states and control flows lead to final execution results, is essential for reliable code generation, debugging, and automated reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) can accurately predict program outputs, most prior work has focused on output accuracy and performance, treating reasoning as a black box. As a result, little is known about the structure or failure modes of their reasoning traces. To address this gap, we conduct the first empirical study on runtime behavior inference with reasoning LLMs, aiming to uncover and characterize errors in their reasoning traces. We curate a benchmark from HumanEval Plus and LiveCodeBench, containing 427 code snippets. For each snippet, we test three input types: regular, edge, and invalid. Twelve input values are selected per snippet, each paired with its ground-truth execution result. We evaluate four state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs. Our results show that these models reach accuracies between 85 percent and 98 percent across input types. We also analyze the produced reasoning traces and develop a taxonomy with nine categories of inference errors. Finally, we explore tool-augmented reasoning. Using failures in the Computation Errors category as a case study, our experiments show that this approach corrects 58 percent of such errors, demonstrating the potential of tool support for improving LLM reasoning.</description>

      <title>CodeFlowLM: Incremental Just-In-Time Defect Prediction with Pretrained Language Models and Exploratory Insights into Defect Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces CodeFlowLM, an incremental learning framework for Just-In-Time Software Defect Prediction (JIT-SDP) that leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs). Unlike traditional online learners, CodeFlowLM employs continual fine-tuning to address concept drift, class imbalance, and verification latency without retraining from scratch. We evaluated encoder-only and encoder-decoder PLMs (notably CodeT5+ and UniXCoder) in JIT-SDP scenarios within and between projects, comparing them with the incremental baseline BORB. The results show that CodeFlowLM achieves up to 68% G-Mean gains, confirming its superior adaptability and robustness in evolving software environments. We further extend the analysis to Just-in-Time Defect Localization (JIT-DL), benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro against attention-based models. GPT-5 delivers comparable performance for Recall@20% and Effort@20% with higher stability, although attention-based methods retain an advantage in fine-grained ranking metrics (Top-k, IFA). A qualitative error analysis reveals that most false positives arise from (1) human-like conservative bias, (2) insufficient contextual information in diff-based prompts, and (3) potential dataset mislabeling in JIT-Defects4J. These findings highlight both the promise and the current limitations of LLM reasoning in defect localization. False negatives occur in smaller proportions. Overall, CodeFlowLM significantly advances the state of the art in incremental JIT-SDP, demonstrating superior adaptability and robustness in evolving software environments. Furthermore, our exploratory analysis of LLMs in JIT-DL not only benchmarks their performance against established attention-based models but also provides critical insights into the current limitations of prompt-based defect reasoning.</description>

      <title>ng-reactive-lint: Smarter Linting for Angular Apps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reactivity is central to Angular applications, yet subtle misuse of Observables, Signals, and change-detection often leads to performance regressions that are difficult to diagnose. Although Angular 17 introduced a unified, signal-first model, most enterprise codebases still rely heavily on legacy RxJS patterns that create unpredictable update flows, memory leaks, and excessive change cycles. To address these issues, we developed ng-reactive-lint, a deterministic static analysis tool that understands Angular's component semantics, lifecycle hooks, template bindings, and reactivity patterns. Unlike generic ESLint or RxJS plugins, ng-reactive-lint performs framework-aware analysis to detect high-impact anti-patterns and provide actionable, context-specific fixes. Evaluation across five large real-world projects showed reductions of up to threefold in unnecessary change detection cycles and up to 75% lower peak memory usage. The tool offers a practical, automated path to adopting modern Angular reactivity at scale.</description>

      <title>Progressive Code Integration for Abstractive Bug Report Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bug reports are often unstructured and verbose, making it challenging for developers to efficiently comprehend software issues. Existing summarization approaches typically rely on surface-level textual cues, resulting in incomplete or redundant summaries, and they frequently ignore associated code snippets, which are essential for accurate defect diagnosis. To address these limitations, we propose a progressive code-integration framework for LLM-based abstractive bug report summarization. Our approach incrementally incorporates long code snippets alongside textual content, overcoming standard LLM context window constraints and producing semantically rich summaries. Evaluated on four benchmark datasets using eight LLMs, our pipeline outperforms extractive baselines by 7.5%-58.2% and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art abstractive methods, highlighting the benefits of jointly leveraging textual and code information for enhanced bug comprehension.</description>

      <title>Framework-Aware Code Generation with API Knowledge Graph-Constructed Data: A Study on HarmonyOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of software frameworks with limited resources (such as HarmonyOS), large language models (LLMs) often exhibit poor code generation performance because they lack sufficient exposure to such environments during pre-training. Although LLMs can usually maintain correct logical structures across programming languages, they frequently struggle when dealing with framework-specific APIs or syntax, resulting in errors. This indicates that while pre-training equips LLMs with general algorithmic capabilities, they remain unfamiliar with the distinctive syntax and API usage of underrepresented frameworks. As a result, even advanced commercial models like GPT-4o cannot reliably generate correct code without prior adaptation. To address this issue, we propose APIKG4SYN, a framework designed to exploit API knowledge graphs for the construction of API-oriented question-code pairs, specifically tailored for low-resource frameworks without requiring executable code. APIKG4SYN integrates both single-API and multi-API knowledge, where the latter is derived through uncertainty estimation (UE)-driven Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), enabling the creation of a diverse and informative dataset for fine-tuning LLMs. Using HarmonyOS as a case study, we build the first benchmark for HarmonyOS code generation. Experimental results show that fine-tuning Qwen with APIKG4SYN raises pass@1 accuracy to 25.00%, compared with 17.59% for the baseline GPT model. These results confirm that API-oriented data significantly enhance LLM performance in low-resource software development scenarios.</description>

      <title>Bias Testing and Mitigation in Black Box LLMs using Metamorphic Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified concerns about subtle social biases embedded in their outputs. Existing guardrails often fail when faced with indirect or contextually complex bias-inducing prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a unified framework for both systematic bias evaluation and targeted mitigation. Our approach introduces six novel Metamorphic Relations (MRs) that, based on metamorphic testing principles, transform direct bias-inducing inputs into semantically equivalent yet adversarially challenging variants. These transformations enable an automated method for exposing hidden model biases: when an LLM responds inconsistently or unfairly across MR-generated variants, the underlying bias becomes detectable. We further show that the same MRs can be used to generate diverse bias-inducing samples for fine-tuning, directly linking the testing process to mitigation. Using six state-of-the-art LLMs - spanning open-source and proprietary models - and a representative subset of 385 questions from the 8,978-item BiasAsker benchmark covering seven protected groups, our MRs reveal up to 14% more hidden biases compared to existing tools. Moreover, fine-tuning with both original and MR-mutated samples significantly enhances bias resiliency, increasing safe response rates from 54.7% to over 88.9% across models. These results highlight metamorphic relations as a practical mechanism for improving fairness in conversational AI.</description>

      <title>SAGE: Semantic-Aware Gray-Box Game Regression Testing with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid iteration cycles of modern live-service games make regression testing indispensable for maintaining quality and stability. However, existing regression testing approaches face critical limitations, especially in common gray-box settings where full source code access is unavailable: they heavily rely on manual effort for test case construction, struggle to maintain growing suites plagued by redundancy, and lack efficient mechanisms for prioritizing relevant tests. These challenges result in excessive testing costs, limited automation, and insufficient bug detection. To address these issues, we propose SAGE, a semanticaware regression testing framework for gray-box game environments. SAGE systematically addresses the core challenges of test generation, maintenance, and selection. It employs LLM-guided reinforcement learning for efficient, goal-oriented exploration to automatically generate a diverse foundational test suite. Subsequently, it applies a semantic-based multi-objective optimization to refine this suite into a compact, high-value subset by balancing cost, coverage, and rarity. Finally, it leverages LLM-based semantic analysis of update logs to prioritize test cases most relevant to version changes, enabling efficient adaptation across iterations. We evaluate SAGE on two representative environments, Overcooked Plus and Minecraft, comparing against both automated baselines and human-recorded test cases. Across all environments, SAGE achieves superior bug detection with significantly lower execution cost, while demonstrating strong adaptability to version updates.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Analogy-Based Software Effort Estimation with Firefly Algorithm Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analogy-Based Estimation (ABE) is a popular method for non-algorithmic estimation due to its simplicity and effectiveness. The Analogy-Based Estimation (ABE) model was proposed by researchers, however, no optimal approach for reliable estimation was developed. Achieving high accuracy in the ABE might be challenging for new software projects that differ from previous initiatives. This study (conducted in June 2024) proposes a Firefly Algorithm-guided Analogy-Based Estimation (FAABE) model that combines FA with ABE to improve estimation accuracy. The FAABE model was tested on five publicly accessible datasets: Cocomo81, Desharnais, China, Albrecht, Kemerer and Maxwell. To improve prediction efficiency, feature selection was used. The results were measured using a variety of evaluation metrics; various error measures include MMRE, MAE, MSE, and RMSE. Compared to conventional models, the experimental results show notable increases in prediction precision, demonstrating the efficacy of the Firefly-Analogy ensemble.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Software Engineering: A Reproducibility Crisis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific progress, yet its state in large language model (LLM)-based software engineering (SE) research remains poorly understood. This paper presents the first large-scale, empirical study of reproducibility practices in LLM-for-SE research. We systematically mined and analyzed 640 papers published between 2017 and 2025 across premier software engineering, machine learning, and natural language processing venues, extracting structured metadata from publications, repositories, and documentation. Guided by four research questions, we examine (i) the prevalence of reproducibility smells, (ii) how reproducibility has evolved over time, (iii) whether artifact evaluation badges reliably reflect reproducibility quality, and (iv) how publication venues influence transparency practices. Using a taxonomy of seven smell categories: Code and Execution, Data, Documentation, Environment and Tooling, Versioning, Model, and Access and Legal, we manually annotated all papers and associated artifacts. Our analysis reveals persistent gaps in artifact availability, environment specification, versioning rigor, and documentation clarity, despite modest improvements in recent years and increased adoption of artifact evaluation processes at top SE venues. Notably, we find that badges often signal artifact presence but do not consistently guarantee execution fidelity or long-term reproducibility. Motivated by these findings, we provide actionable recommendations to mitigate reproducibility smells and introduce a Reproducibility Maturity Model (RMM) to move beyond binary artifact certification toward multi-dimensional, progressive evaluation of reproducibility rigor.</description>

      <title>Code Comments for Quantum Software Development Kits: An Empirical Study on Qiskit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is gaining attention from academia and industry. With the quantum Software Development Kits (SDKs), programmers can develop quantum software to explore the power of quantum computing. However, programmers may face challenges in understanding quantum software due to the non-intuitive quantum mechanics. To facilitate software development and maintenance, code comments offered in quantum SDKs serve as a natural language explanation of program functionalities and logical flows. Despite their importance, scarce research systematically reports their value and provides constructive guidelines for programmers. To address this gap, our paper focuses on Qiskit, one of the most popular quantum SDKs, and presents CC4Q, the first dataset of code comments for quantum computing. CC4Q incorporates 9677 code comment pairs and 21970 sentence-level code comment units, the latter of which involve heavy human annotation. Regarding the annotation, we validate the applicability of the developer-intent taxonomy used in classical programs, and also propose a new taxonomy considering quantum-specific knowledge. We conduct an empirical study comprehensively interpreting code comments from three perspectives: comment structure and coverage, developers' intentions, and associated quantum topics. Our findings uncover key differences in code comments between classical and quantum software, and also outline quantum-specific knowledge relevant to quantum software development.</description>

      <title>FC-ADL: Efficient Microservice Anomaly Detection and Localisation Through Functional Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microservices have transformed software architecture through the creation of modular and independent services. However, they introduce operational complexities in service integration and system management that makes swift and accurate anomaly detection and localisation challenging. Despite the complex, dynamic, and interconnected nature of microservice architectures, prior works that investigate metrics for anomaly detection rarely include explicit information about time-varying interdependencies. And whilst prior works on fault localisation typically do incorporate information about dependencies between microservices, they scale poorly to real world large-scale deployments due to their reliance on computationally expensive causal inference. To address these challenges we propose FC-ADL, an end-to-end scalable approach for detecting and localising anomalous changes from microservice metrics based on the neuroscientific concept of functional connectivity. We show that by efficiently characterising time-varying changes in dependencies between microservice metrics we can both detect anomalies and provide root cause candidates without incurring the significant overheads of causal and multivariate approaches. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve top detection and localisation performance across a wide degree of different fault scenarios when compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we illustrate the scalability of our approach by applying it to Alibaba's extremely large real-world microservice deployment.</description>

      <title>The Software Infrastructure Attitude Scale (SIAS): A Questionnaire Instrument for Measuring Professionals' Attitudes Toward Technical and Sociotechnical Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Recent software engineering (SE) research has highlighted the need for sociotechnical research, implying a demand for customized psychometric scales. Objective: We define the concepts of technical and sociotechnical infrastructure in software engineering, and develop and validate a psychometric scale that measures attitudes toward them. Method: Grounded in theories of infrastructure, attitudes, and prior work on psychometric measurement, we defined the target constructs and generated scale items. The scale was administered to 225 software professionals and evaluated using a split sample. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on one half of the sample to uncover the underlying factor structure and performed a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the other half to validate the structure. Further analyses with the whole sample assessed face, criterion-related, and discriminant validity. Results: EFA supported a two-factor structure (technical and sociotechnical infrastructure), accounting for 65% of the total variance with strong loadings. CFA confirmed excellent model fit. Face and content validity were supported by the item content reflecting cognitive, affective, and behavioral components. Both subscales were correlated with job satisfaction, perceived autonomy, and feedback from the job itself, supporting convergent validity. Regression analysis supported criterion-related validity, while the Heterotrait-Monotrait ratio of correlations (HTMT), the Fornell-Larcker criterion, and model comparison all supported discriminant validity. Discussion: The resulting scale is a valid instrument for measuring attitudes toward technical and sociotechnical infrastructure in software engineering research. Our work contributes to ongoing efforts to integrate psychological measurement rigor into empirical and behavioral software engineering research.</description>

      <title>The AI Attribution Paradox: Transparency as Social Strategy in Open-Source Software Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI coding assistants have transformed software development, raising questions about transparency and attribution practices. We examine the "AI attribution paradox": how developers strategically balance acknowledging AI assistance with managing community scrutiny. Analyzing 14,300 GitHub commits across 7,393 repositories from 2023-2025, we investigated attribution strategies and community responses across eight major AI tools. Results reveal widespread AI usage (95.2% of commits) but strategic attribution: only 29.5% employ explicit disclosure, with dramatic tool variation (Claude 80.5% versus Copilot 9.0%). Explicit attribution triggers modest scrutiny (23% more questions and 21% more comments) but tool choice matters 20-30 times more for predicting reception. Community sentiment remains neutral regardless of attribution type, suggesting curiosity rather than hostility. Temporal analyses show rapid norm evolution: explicit attribution increased from near-zero in early 2024 to 40% by late 2025, indicating community adaptation. These findings illuminate attribution as strategic communication rather than simple transparency, advancing understanding of algorithmic accountability and norm formation during technological transitions. We discuss implications for developers navigating disclosure decisions, platforms designing attribution mechanisms, and researchers studying emergent practices in AI-augmented collaborative work.</description>

      <title>Staying or Leaving? How Job Satisfaction, Embeddedness and Antecedents Predict Turnover Intentions of Software Professionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Voluntary turnover is common in the software industry, increasing recruitment and onboarding costs and the risk of losing organizational and tacit knowledge. Objective: This study investigates how job satisfaction, work-life balance, job embeddedness, and their antecedents, including job quality, personality traits, attitudes toward technical and sociotechnical infrastructure, and perceptions of organizational justice, relate to software professionals' turnover intentions. Method: We conducted a geographically diverse cross-sectional survey of software professionals (N = 224) and analyzed the data using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Our model includes both reflective and formative constructs and tests 15 hypotheses grounded in occupational psychology and software engineering literature. Results: Job satisfaction and embeddedness were significantly negatively associated with software professionals' turnover intentions, while work-life balance showed no direct effect. The strongest antecedents for job satisfaction were work-life balance and job quality, while organizational justice was the strongest predictor of job embeddedness. Discussion: The resulting PLS-SEM model has considerably higher explanatory power for key outcome variables than previous work conducted in the software development context, highlighting the importance of both psychological (e.g., job satisfaction, job embeddedness) and organizational (e.g., organizational justice, job quality) factors in understanding turnover intentions of software professionals. Our results imply that improving job satisfaction and job embeddedness is the key to retaining software professionals. In turn, enhancing job quality, supporting work-life balance, and ensuring high organizational justice can improve job satisfaction and embeddedness, indirectly reducing turnover intentions.</description>

      <title>Neural Variable Name Repair: Learning to Rename Identifiers for Readability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developers routinely work with source files whose variable names are generic or misleading, and with teams moving quickly, many functions are left undocumented. This slows comprehension, increases the risk of subtle bugs, and makes it harder for both humans and large language models (LLMs) to reason about code. We study variable name repair: given a real C++ function where all occurrences of one local or parameter name have been replaced by a placeholder (e.g. ID 1), the goal is to generate a natural, descriptive replacement name. We automatically construct this task from the C++ portion of BigCode's The Stack by parsing functions with Tree-sitter, masking a single identifier, and treating the original name as supervision. On top of Llama 3.1-8B, we build a pipeline with (i) warmup and dropout schedules for more stable fine-tuning, (ii) LoRA adapters for efficient specialization on identifier repair, and (iii) a dual-encoder reranker over top-k generator candidates. We evaluate using exact match, Top-5 Hit, and an embedding-based partial similarity score (0-100) that gives credit for near synonyms and format variants (e.g., jsonValue vs. json). On a held-out set of 200 C++ functions, a zero-shot Llama 3.1 baseline reaches 6.1 percent exact match. Our best LoRA-tuned model (with warmup and dropout) achieves 43.1 percent exact match, 50.2 percent Top-5 Hit, and an 82.03 partial-match score. A dual encoder reranker further improves selection quality without modifying the underlying generator, suggesting that task-specific fine-tuning plus reranking is a promising approach for practical identifier repair tools.</description>

      <title>Beyond Greenfield: AI-Driven Productivity in Documentation and Brownfield Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brownfield engineering work involving legacy systems, incomplete documentation, and fragmented architectural knowledge poses unique challenges for the effective use of large language models (LLMs). Prior research has largely focused on greenfield or synthetic tasks, leaving a gap in structured workflows for complex, context-heavy environments. This paper introduces the Discover-Define-Deliver (D3) Framework, a disciplined LLM-assisted workflow that combines role-separated prompting strategies with applied best practices for navigating ambiguity in brownfield systems. The framework incorporates a dual-agent prompting architecture in which a Builder model generates candidate outputs and a Reviewer model provides structured critique to improve reliability. I conducted an exploratory survey study with 52 software practitioners who applied the D3 workflow to real-world engineering tasks such as legacy system exploration, documentation reconstruction, and architectural refactoring. Respondents reported perceived improvements in task clarity, documentation quality, and cognitive load, along with self-estimated productivity gains. In this exploratory study, participants reported a weighted average productivity improvement of 26.9%, reduced cognitive load for approximately 77% of participants, and reduced rework for 83% during the Define phase. As these findings are self-reported and not derived from controlled experiments, they should be interpreted as preliminary evidence of practitioner sentiment rather than causal effects. The results highlight both the potential and limitations of structured LLM workflows for legacy engineering systems and motivate future controlled evaluations.</description>

      <title>LLM-as-a-Judge for Scalable Test Coverage Evaluation: Accuracy, Operational Reliability, and Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing software test coverage at scale remains a bottleneck in QA pipelines. We present LLM-as-a-Judge (LAJ), a production-ready, rubric-driven framework for evaluating Gherkin acceptance tests with structured JSON outputs. Across 20 model configurations (GPT-4, GPT-5 with varying reasoning effort, and open-weight models) on 100 expert-annotated scripts over 5 runs (500 evaluations), we provide the first comprehensive analysis spanning accuracy, operational reliability, and cost. We introduce the Evaluation Completion Rate (ECR@1) to quantify first-attempt success, revealing reliability from 85.4% to 100.0% with material cost implications via retries. Results show that smaller models can outperform larger ones: GPT-4o Mini attains the best accuracy (6.07 MAAE), high reliability (96.6% ECR@1), and low cost ($1.01 per 1K), yielding a 78x cost reduction vs. GPT-5 (high reasoning) while improving accuracy. Reasoning effort is model-family dependent: GPT-5 benefits from increased reasoning (with predictable accuracy-cost tradeoffs), whereas open-weight models degrade across all dimensions as reasoning increases. Overall, cost spans 175x ($0.45-$78.96 per 1K). We release the dataset, framework, and code to support reproducibility and deployment.</description>

      <title>LAURA: Enhancing Code Review Generation with Context-Enriched Retrieval-Augmented LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code review is critical for ensuring software quality and maintainability. With the rapid growth in software scale and complexity, code review has become a bottleneck in the development process because of its time-consuming and knowledge-intensive nature and the shortage of experienced developers willing to review code. Several approaches have been proposed for automatically generating code reviews based on retrieval, neural machine translation, pre-trained models, or large language models (LLMs). These approaches mainly leverage historical code changes and review comments. However, a large amount of crucial information for code review, such as the context of code changes and prior review knowledge, has been overlooked. This paper proposes an LLM-based review knowledge-augmented, context-aware framework for code review generation, named LAURA. The framework integrates review exemplar retrieval, context augmentation, and systematic guidance to enhance the performance of ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek v3 in generating code review comments. Besides, given the extensive low-quality reviews in existing datasets, we also constructed a high-quality dataset. Experimental results show that for both models, LAURA generates review comments that are either completely correct or at least helpful to developers in 42.2% and 40.4% of cases, respectively, significantly outperforming SOTA baselines. Furthermore, our ablation studies demonstrate that all components of LAURA contribute positively to improving comment quality.</description>

      <title>BackportBench: A Multilingual Benchmark for Automated Backporting of Patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many modern software projects evolve rapidly to incorporate new features and security patches. It is important for users to update their dependencies to safer versions, but many still use older, vulnerable package versions because upgrading can be difficult and may break their existing codebase. Software developers can mitigate this problem by backporting security patches to older releases. However, manually backporting is time-consuming and error-prone. The effectiveness of existing automated backporting techniques on general software remains unclear since they typically target only code-hunk or function-level patch porting scenarios and are evaluated with imperfect metrics.
  To facilitate the development and evaluation of automated backporting techniques, we introduce BackportBench, the first comprehensive benchmark suite for patch backporting problem. BackportBench is a multilingual benchmark that contains 202 patch backporting problems from PyPI, Maven, and npm, each with executable Docker environments and relevant test cases. We evaluated existing patch porting methods and LLM-based techniques that have the potential to adapt to this task using BackportBench. The results show that the agentic method has outperformed traditional patch porting methods, especially on cases that require logical and structural changes. However, the performance varies across different programming languages. Based on the findings, we draw several implications for researchers and software practitioners in future work on automated backporting.</description>

      <title>Teaching an Online Multi-Institutional Research Level Software Engineering Course with Industry - an Experience Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covid has made online teaching and learning acceptable and students, faculty, and industry professionals are all comfortable with this mode. This comfort can be leveraged to offer an online multi-institutional research-level course in an area where individual institutions may not have the requisite faculty to teach and/or research students to enroll. If the subject is of interest to industry, online offering also allows industry experts to contribute and participate with ease. Advanced topics in Software Engineering are ideally suited for experimenting with this approach as industry, which is often looking to incorporate advances in software engineering in their practices, is likely to agree to contribute and participate. In this paper we describe an experiment in teaching a course titled "AI in Software Engineering" jointly between two institutions with active industry participation, and share our and student's experience. We believe this collaborative teaching approach can be used for offering research level courses in any applied area of computer science by institutions who are small and find it difficult to offer research level courses on their own.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many academic disciplines, software is created during the research process or for a research purpose. The crucial role of software for research is increasingly acknowledged. The application of software engineering to research software has been formalized as research software engineering, to create better software that enables better research. Despite this, large-scale studies of research software and its development are still lacking. To enable such studies, we present a dataset of 134,352 unique open research software projects and 134,154 source code repositories referenced in open access literature. Each dataset record identifies the referencing publication and lists source code repositories of the software project. For 122,425 source code repositories, the dataset provides metadata on latest versions, license information, programming languages and descriptive metadata files. We summarize the distributions of these features in the dataset and describe additional software metadata that extends the dataset in future work. Finally, we suggest examples of research that could use the dataset to develop a better understanding of research software practice in RSE research.</description>

      <title>GPTrace: Effective Crash Deduplication Using LLM Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuzzing is a highly effective method for uncovering software vulnerabilities, but analyzing the resulting data typically requires substantial manual effort. This is amplified by the fact that fuzzing campaigns often find a large number of crashing inputs, many of which share the same underlying bug. Crash deduplication is the task of finding such duplicate crashing inputs and thereby reducing the data that needs to be examined. Many existing deduplication approaches rely on comparing stack traces or other information that is collected when a program crashes. Although various metrics for measuring the similarity of such pieces of information have been proposed, many do not yield satisfactory deduplication results. In this work, we present GPTrace, a deduplication workflow that leverages a large language model to evaluate the similarity of various data sources associated with crashes by computing embedding vectors and supplying those as input to a clustering algorithm. We evaluate our approach on over 300 000 crashing inputs belonging to 50 ground truth labels from 14 different targets. The deduplication results produced by GPTrace show a noticeable improvement over hand-crafted stack trace comparison methods and even more complex state-of-the-art approaches that are less flexible.</description>

      <title>When High-Performance Computing Meets Software Testing: Distributed Fuzzing using MPI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the integration of MPI-based synchronization techniques into distributed fuzzing frameworks, highlighting possible substantial performance improvements compared to traditional filesystem-based synchronization methods. By employing lightweight MPI primitives, reductions in communication latency are achieved, facilitating more efficient data exchanges across distributed fuzzing nodes. Experimental results obtained over standard benchmarks demonstrate enhanced coverage progression from the early stages of the fuzzing process, which could be beneficial if fuzzing is employed in CI/CD pipelines at any stage of software development. Furthermore, the coordinated exchange of input corpora among clusters of fuzzers effectively addresses coverage stagnation, enabling a sustained exploration of complex and deep execution paths. Overall, the adoption of MPI-based synchronization approaches shows promising potential for significantly enhancing the scalability and efficacy of distributed fuzz testing.</description>

      <title>Package Dashboard: A Cross-Ecosystem Framework for Dual-Perspective Analysis of Software Packages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software supply chain attacks have revealed blind spots in existing SCA tools, which are often limited to a single ecosystem and assess either software artifacts or community activity in isolation. This fragmentation across tools and ecosystems forces developers to manually reconcile scattered data, undermining risk assessments. We present Package Dashboard, a cross-ecosystem framework that provides a unified platform for supply chain analysis, enabling a holistic, dual-perspective risk assessment by integrating package metadata, vulnerability information, and upstream community health metrics. By combining dependency resolution with repository analysis, it reduces cognitive load and improves traceability. Demonstrating the framework's versatility, a large-scale study of 374,000 packages across five Linux distributions shows its ability to uncover not only conventional vulnerabilities and license conflicts but also overlooked risks such as archived or inaccessible repositories. Ultimately, Package Dashboard provides a unified view of risk, equipping developers and DevSecOps engineers with actionable insights to strengthen the transparency, trustworthiness, and traceability of open-source ecosystems. Package Dashboard is publicly available at https://github.com/n19htfall/PackageDashboard, and a demonstration video can be found at https://youtu.be/y9ncftP8KPQ. Besides, the online version is available at https://pkgdash.osslab-pku.org.</description>

      <title>MIT Lincoln Laboratory: A Case Study on Improving Software Support for Research Projects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software plays an ever increasing role in complex system development and prototyping, and in recent years, MIT Lincoln Laboratory has sought to improve both the effectiveness and culture surrounding software engineering in execution of its mission. The Homeland Protection and Air Traffic Control Division conducted an internal study to examine challenges to effective and efficient research software development, and to identify ways to strengthen both the culture and execution for greater impact on our mission. Key findings of this study fell into three main categories: project attributes that influence how software development activities must be conducted and managed, potential efficiencies from centralization, opportunities to improve staffing and culture with respect to software practitioners. The study delivered actionable recommendations, including centralizing and standardizing software support tooling, developing a common database to help match the right software talent and needs to projects, and creating a software stakeholder panel to assist with continued improvement.</description>

      <title>Generating REST API Tests With Descriptive Names</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated test generation has become a key technique for ensuring software quality, particularly in modern API-based architectures. However, automatically generated test cases are typically assigned non-descriptive names (e.g., test0, test1), which reduces their readability and hinders their usefulness during comprehension and maintenance. In this work, we present three novel deterministic techniques to generate REST API test names. We then compare eight techniques in total for generating descriptive names for REST API tests automatically produced by the fuzzer EvoMaster, using 10 test cases generated for 9 different open-source APIs. The eight techniques include rule-based heuristics and large language model (LLM)-based approaches. Their effectiveness was empirically evaluated through two surveys (involving up to 39 people recruited via LinkedIn). Our results show that a rule-based approach achieves the highest clarity ratings among deterministic methods, performs on par with state-of-the-art LLM-based models such as Gemini and GPT-4o, and significantly outperforms GPT-3.5.
  To further evaluate the practical impact of our results, an industrial case study was carried out with practitioners who actively use EvoMaster at Volkswagen AG. A developer questionnaire was then carried out based on the use of EvoMaster on four different APIs by four different users, for a total of 74 evaluated test cases. Feedback from practitioners further confirms that descriptive names produced by this approach improve test suite readability.
  These findings highlight that lightweight, deterministic techniques can serve as effective alternatives to computationally expensive and security-sensitive LLM-based approaches for automated system-level test naming, providing a practical step toward more developer-friendly API test generation.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of Agent Developer Practices in AI Agent Frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a surge of interest in agents, leading to the rapid growth of agent frameworks. Agent frameworks are software toolkits and libraries that provide standardized components, abstractions, and orchestration mechanisms to simplify agent development. Despite widespread use of agent frameworks, their practical applications and how they influence the agent development process remain underexplored. Different agent frameworks encounter similar problems during use, indicating that these recurring issues deserve greater attention and call for further improvements in agent framework design. Meanwhile, as the number of agent frameworks continues to grow and evolve, more than 80% of developers report difficulties in identifying the frameworks that best meet their specific development requirements. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of LLM-based agent frameworks, exploring real-world experiences of developers in building AI agents. To compare how well the agent frameworks meet developer needs, we further collect developer discussions for the ten previously identified agent frameworks, resulting in a total of 11,910 discussions. Finally, by analyzing these discussions, we compare the frameworks across five dimensions: development efficiency, functional abstraction, learning cost, performance optimization, and maintainability, which refers to how easily developers can update and extend both the framework itself and the agents built upon it over time. Our comparative analysis reveals significant differences among frameworks in how they meet the needs of agent developers. Overall, we provide a set of findings and implications for the LLM-driven AI agent framework ecosystem and offer insights for the design of future LLM-based agent frameworks and agent developers.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study on the Security Vulnerabilities of GPTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equipped with various tools and knowledge, GPTs, one kind of customized AI agents based on OpenAI's large language models, have illustrated great potential in many fields, such as writing, research, and programming. Today, the number of GPTs has reached three millions, with the range of specific expert domains becoming increasingly diverse. However, given the consistent framework shared among these LLM agent applications, systemic security vulnerabilities may exist and remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we present an empirical study on the security vulnerabilities of GPTs. Building upon prior research on LLM security, we first adopt a platform-user perspective to conduct a comprehensive attack surface analysis across different system components. Then, we design a systematic and multidimensional attack suite with the explicit objectives of information leakage and tool misuse based on the attack surface analysis, thereby concretely demonstrating the security vulnerabilities that various components of GPT-based systems face. Finally, we accordingly propose defense mechanisms to address the aforementioned security vulnerabilities. By increasing the awareness of these vulnerabilities and offering critical insights into their implications, this study seeks to facilitate the secure and responsible application of GPTs while contributing to developing robust defense mechanisms that protect users and systems against malicious attacks.</description>

      <title>Chain of Unit-Physics: A Primitive-Centric Approach to Scientific Code Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic large language models are proposed as autonomous code generators for scientific computing, yet their reliability in high-stakes problems remains unclear. Developing computational scientific software from natural-language queries remains challenging broadly due to (a) sparse representation of domain codes during training and (b) the limited feasibility of RLHF with a small expert community. To address these limitations, this work conceptualizes an inverse approach to code design, embodied in the Chain of Unit-Physics framework: a first-principles (or primitives)-centric, multi-agent system in which human expert knowledge is encoded as unit-physics tests that explicitly constrain code generation. The framework is evaluated on a nontrivial combustion task, used here as a representative benchmark for scientific problem with realistic physical constraints. Closed-weight systems and code-focused agentic variants fail to produce correct end-to-end solvers, despite tool and web access, exhibiting four recurrent error classes: interface (syntax/API) hallucinations, overconfident assumptions, numerical/physical incoherence, and configuration fragility. Open-weight models with chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding reduce interface errors but still yield incorrect solutions. On the benchmark task, the proposed framework converges within 5-6 iterations, matches the human-expert implementation (mean error of $3.1\times10^{-3}$ %), with a $\sim$33.4 % faster runtime and a $\sim$30 % efficient memory usage at a cost comparable to mid-sized commercial APIs, yielding a practical template for physics-grounded scientific code generation. As datasets and models evolve, zero-shot code accuracy will improve; however, the Chain of Unit-Physics framework goes further by embedding first-principles analysis that is foundational to scientific codes.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Cannot Reliably Detect Vulnerabilities in JavaScript: The First Systematic Benchmark and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Researchers have proposed numerous methods to detect vulnerabilities in JavaScript, especially those assisted by Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the actual capability of LLMs in JavaScript vulnerability detection remains questionable, necessitating systematic evaluation and comprehensive benchmarks. Unfortunately, existing benchmarks suffer from three critical limitations: (1) incomplete coverage, such as covering a limited subset of CWE types; (2) underestimation of LLM capabilities caused by unreasonable ground truth labeling; and (3) overestimation due to unrealistic cases such as using isolated vulnerable files rather than complete projects.
  In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, three principles for constructing a benchmark for JavaScript vulnerability detection that directly address these limitations: (1) comprehensiveness, (2) no underestimation, and (3) no overestimation. Guided by these principles, we propose FORGEJS, the first automatic benchmark generation framework for evaluating LLMs' capability in JavaScript vulnerability detection. Then, we use FORGEJS to construct ARENAJS-the first systematic benchmark for LLM-based JavaScript vulnerability detection-and further propose JUDGEJS, an automatic evaluation framework.
  We conduct the first systematic evaluation of LLMs for JavaScript vulnerability detection, leveraging JUDGEJS to assess seven popular commercial LLMs on ARENAJS. The results show that LLMs not only exhibit limited reasoning capabilities, but also suffer from severe robustness defects, indicating that reliable JavaScript vulnerability detection with LLMs remains an open challenge.</description>

      <title>In-context Inverse Optimality for Fair Digital Twins: A Preference-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) are increasingly used as autonomous decision-makers in complex socio-technical systems. Their mathematically optimal decisions often diverge from human expectations, exposing a persistent gap between algorithmic and bounded human rationality. This work addresses this gap by proposing a framework that operationalizes fairness as a learnable objective within optimization-based Digital Twins. We introduce a preference-driven learning pipeline that infers latent fairness objectives directly from human pairwise preferences over feasible decisions. A novel Siamese neural network is developed to generate convex quadratic cost functions conditioned on contextual information. The resulting surrogate objectives align optimization outcomes with human-perceived fairness while maintaining computational efficiency. The approach is demonstrated on a COVID-19 hospital resource allocation scenario. This study provides an actionable path toward embedding human-centered fairness in the design of autonomous decision-making systems.</description>

      <title>A City upon a Hill: Casting Light on a Real Experimental Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.12800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: The overall scientific community is proposing measures to improve the reproducibility and replicability of experiments. Reproducibility is relatively easy to achieve. However, replicability is considerably more complex in both the sciences and Empirical Software Engineering (ESE). Several strategies, e.g., replication packages and families of experiments, have been proposed to improve replication in ESE, with limited success. We wonder whether the failures are due to some mismatch, i.e., the researchers' needs are not satisfied by the proposed replication procedures.
  Objectives: Find out how experimental researchers conduct \textit{experiments in practice}.
  Methods: We carried out an ethnography study within a SE Research Group. Our main activity was to observe/approach the experimental researchers in their day-to-day settings for two years. Their preferred literature and experimental materials were studied. We used individual and group interviews to gain understanding and examine unclear topics in-depth.
  Results: We have created conceptual and process models that represent how experimentation is really conducted in the Research Group. Models fit the community's procedures and terminology at a high level, but they become particular in their minute details.
  Conclusion: The actual experimental process differs from textbooks in several points, namely: (1) Number and diversity of activities, (2) existence of different roles, (3) the granularity of the concepts used by the roles, and (4) the viewpoints that different sub-areas or families of experiments have about the overall process.</description>

      <title>Using weakest application conditions to rank graph transformations for graph repair</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08788v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When using graphs and graph transformations to model systems, consistency is an important concern. While consistency has primarily been viewed as a binary property, i.e., a graph is consistent or inconsistent with respect to a set of constraints, recent work has presented an approach to consistency as a graduated property. This allows living with inconsistencies for a while and repairing them when necessary. For repairing inconsistencies in a graph, we use graph transformation rules with so-called {\em impairment-indicating and repair-indicating application conditions} to understand how much repair gain certain rule applications would bring. Both types of conditions can be derived from given graph constraints. Our main theorem shows that the difference between the number of actual constraint violations before and after a graph transformation step can be characterized by the difference between the numbers of violated impairment-indicating and repair-indicating application conditions. This theory forms the basis for algorithms with look-ahead that rank graph transformations according to their potential for graph repair. An evaluation shows that graph repair can be well supported by rules with these new types of application conditions in terms of effectiveness and scalability.</description>

      <title>On the Quality of AI-Generated Source Code Comments: A Comprehensive Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the quality of source code comments automatically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). While AI-based comment generation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce developers' documentation effort, prior studies have been limited by small datasets or by relying solely on traditional Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, which are insufficient to capture documentation quality. To address these limitations, we conducted a large-scale empirical study on 142 classes and 273 methods created after the training cut-off of the evaluated models. For each code element, we generated Javadoc comments using three LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek-V3). A qualitative assessment of the comments-performed independently by two experts-showed that 58.8% were equivalent to, and 27.7% superior to, the original comments. A quantitative analysis using BLEU, ROUGE-L, and METEOR confirmed that IR-based metrics do not reliably reflect human evaluations, revealing the need for new documentation-specific metrics. Finally, correlation analyses indicated slightly positive relationships between code properties (size, complexity, coupling) and comment quality, confirming that LLMs benefit from richer contextual information.</description>

      <title>SmartC2Rust: Iterative, Feedback-Driven C-to-Rust Translation via Large Language Models for Safety and Equivalence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Memory safety vulnerabilities remain prevalent in today's software systems and one promising solution to mitigate them is to adopt memory-safe languages such as Rust. Due to legacy code written in memory unsafe C, there is strong motivation to translate legacy C code into Rust. Prior works have already shown promise in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for such translations. However, significant challenges persist for LLM-based translation: the translated code often fails to compile, let alone reduce unsafe statements and maintain the semantic functionalities due to inherent limitations of LLMs such as limited token size and inconsistent outputs. In this paper, we design an automated C-to-Rust translation system, called SmartC2Rust, to segment and convert the C code to Rust with memory safety and semantic equivalence. The key insight is to iteratively refine the output Rust code with additional feedback, e.g., compilation errors, segmentation contexts, semantic discrepancies, and memory unsafe statements. Such feedback will gradually improve the quality of generated Rust code, thus mitigating unsafety, inconsistency, and semantic issues. Our evaluation shows that SmartC2Rust significantly decreases the unsafe statements and outperforms prior works in security and semantic equivalence.</description>

      <title>SWE-RL: Advancing LLM Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning on Open Software Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent DeepSeek-R1 release has demonstrated the immense potential of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While DeepSeek-R1 and other follow-up work primarily focus on applying RL to competitive coding and math problems, this paper introduces SWE-RL, the first approach to scale RL-based LLM reasoning for real-world software engineering. Leveraging a lightweight rule-based reward (e.g., the similarity score between ground-truth and LLM-generated solutions), SWE-RL enables LLMs to autonomously recover a developer's reasoning processes and solutions by learning from extensive open-source software evolution data -- the record of a software's entire lifecycle, including its code snapshots, code changes, and events such as issues and pull requests. Trained on top of Llama 3, our resulting reasoning model, Llama3-SWE-RL-70B, achieves a 41.0% solve rate on SWE-bench Verified -- a human-verified collection of real-world GitHub issues. To our knowledge, this is the best performance reported for medium-sized (&lt;100B) LLMs to date, even comparable to leading proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o. Surprisingly, despite performing RL solely on software evolution data, Llama3-SWE-RL has even emerged with generalized reasoning skills. For example, it shows improved results on five out-of-domain tasks, namely, function coding, library use, code reasoning, mathematics, and general language understanding, whereas a supervised-finetuning baseline even leads to performance degradation on average. Overall, SWE-RL opens up a new direction to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through reinforcement learning on massive software engineering data.</description>

      <title>A Semantic-based Optimization Approach for Repairing LLMs: Case Study on Code Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12899v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are widely used in software engineering for code generation, but they may produce erroneous code. Rather than repairing outputs, a more thorough remedy is to address underlying model failures. LM repair offers a lightweight solution: it requires minimal data, lowers computational cost, and limits side effects. Unlike full retraining, LM repair focuses on applying tailored updates to targeted neurons, making it suitable for limited resources, high-performance demands, or strict safety requirements. In this paper, we propose Semantic Targeting for Analytical Repair (STAR), a novel semantic-based optimization method for repairing LLMs. STAR realizes the main operations of repairing LMs in an optimization process, including locating ``buggy neurons'', solving ``neuron patches'', and patching ``buggy neurons''. The neuron patches are computed with a solid semantic-based analytical formula, which directly bridges the changes to logits with the deltas of neurons, by steering latent representations. Compared to the prior work of LM repair (MINT) and standard optimization methods (SGD), STAR integrates their strengths while mitigating their limitations. By reformulating LM repair as an optimization process, STAR may solve multiple failures together, significantly improving the usefulness. Evaluated on coding tasks using popular code LMs, STAR demonstrates superior effectiveness compared with the state-of-the-art. Besides, STAR exhibits better efficiency. In terms of side effects, namely the balance between generalization and specificity, STAR outperforms prior work by a significant margin. Additionally, we conducted assessments on the overfitting risk of LM repair as well as the cumulative impact. Further, we analyzed the differences with pipeline-based methods and explained the reason why STAR is better and how it mitigated the common limitations of LM repair.</description>

Abstract: Fragile web tests, primarily caused by locator breakages, are a persistent challenge in web development. Hence, researchers have proposed techniques for web-element re-identification in which algorithms utilize a range of element properties to relocate elements on updated versions of websites based on similarity scoring. In this paper, we replicate the original studies of the most recent propositions in the literature, namely the Similo algorithm and its successor, VON Similo. We also acknowledge and reconsider assumptions related to threats to validity in the original studies, which prompted additional analysis and the development of mitigation techniques. Our analysis revealed that VON Similo, despite its novel approach, tends to produce more false positives than Similo. We mitigated these issues through algorithmic refinements and optimization algorithms that enhance parameters and comparison methods across all Similo variants, improving the accuracy of Similo on its original benchmark by 5.62%. Moreover, we extend the replicated studies by proposing a larger evaluation benchmark (23x bigger than the original study) as well as a novel approach that combines the strengths of both Similo and VON Similo, called HybridSimilo. The combined approach achieved a gain comparable to the improved Similo alone. Results on the extended benchmark show that HybridSimilo locates 98.8% of elements with broken locators in realistic testing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Requirements Coverage-Guided Minimization for Natural Language Test Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20004</link>

Abstract: As software systems evolve, test suites tend to grow in size and often contain redundant test cases. Such redundancy increases testing effort, time, and cost. Test suite minimization (TSM) aims to eliminate such redundancy while preserving key properties such as requirement coverage and fault detection capability. In this paper, we propose RTM (Requirement coverage-guided Test suite Minimization), a novel TSM approach designed for requirement-based testing (validation), which can effectively reduce test suite redundancy while ensuring full requirement coverage and a high fault detection rate (FDR) under a fixed minimization budget. Based on common practice in critical systems where functional safety is important, we assume test cases are specified in natural language and traced to requirements before being implemented. RTM preprocesses test cases using three different preprocessing methods, and then converts them into vector representations using seven text embedding techniques. Similarity values between vectors are computed utilizing three distance functions. A Genetic Algorithm, whose population is initialized by coverage-preserving initialization strategies, is then employed to identify an optimized subset containing diverse test cases matching the set budget.
  We evaluate RTM on an industrial automotive system dataset comprising $736$ system test cases and $54$ requirements. Experimental results show that RTM consistently outperforms baseline techniques in terms of FDR across different minimization budgets while maintaining full requirement coverage. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of test suite redundancy levels on the effectiveness of TSM, providing new insights into optimizing requirement-based test suites under practical constraints.</description>

      <title>MERA Code: A Unified Framework for Evaluating Code Generation Across Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in LLMs have enhanced task automation in software engineering; however, current evaluations primarily focus on natural language tasks, overlooking code quality. Most benchmarks prioritize high-level reasoning over executable code and real-world performance, leaving gaps in understanding true capabilities and risks associated with these models in production. To address this issue, we propose MERA Code, a new addition to the MERA benchmark family, specifically focused on evaluating code for the latest code generation LLMs in Russian. This benchmark includes 11 evaluation tasks that span 8 programming languages. Our proposed evaluation methodology features a taxonomy that outlines the practical coding skills necessary for models to complete these tasks. The benchmark comprises an open-source codebase for users to conduct MERA assessments, a scoring system compatible with various programming environments, and a platform featuring a leaderboard and submission system. We evaluate open LLMs and frontier API models, analyzing their limitations in terms of practical coding tasks in non-English languages. We are publicly releasing MERA to guide future research, anticipate groundbreaking features in model development, and standardize evaluation procedures.</description>

      <title>Automated Program Repair of Uncompilable Student Code</title>

Abstract: A significant portion of student programming submissions in CS1 learning environments are uncompilable, limiting their use in student modeling and downstream knowledge tracing. Traditional modeling pipelines often exclude these cases, discarding observations of student learning. This study investigates automated program repair as a strategy to recover uncompilable code while preserving students' structural intent for use in student modeling. Within this framework, we assess large language models (LLMs) as repair agents under high- and low-context prompting conditions. Repairs were evaluated for compilability, edit distance, and preservation of students' original structure and logic. While all models produced compilable repairs, they differed in how well they preserve students' control flow and code structure, affecting their pedagogical utility. By recovering uncompilable submissions, this work enables richer and more comprehensive analyses of learners' coding processes and development over time.</description>

      <title>From Code Foundation Models to Agents and Applications: A Practical Guide to Code Intelligence</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have fundamentally transformed automated software development by enabling direct translation of natural language descriptions into functional code, driving commercial adoption through tools like Github Copilot (Microsoft), Cursor (Anysphere), Trae (ByteDance), and Claude Code (Anthropic). While the field has evolved dramatically from rule-based systems to Transformer-based architectures, achieving performance improvements from single-digit to over 95\% success rates on benchmarks like HumanEval. In this work, we provide a comprehensive synthesis and practical guide (a series of analytic and probing experiments) about code LLMs, systematically examining the complete model life cycle from data curation to post-training through advanced prompting paradigms, code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and autonomous coding agents. We analyze the code capability of the general LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA) and code-specialized LLMs (StarCoder, Code LLaMA, DeepSeek-Coder, and QwenCoder), critically examining the techniques, design decisions, and trade-offs. Further, we articulate the research-practice gap between academic research (e.g., benchmarks and tasks) and real-world deployment (e.g., software-related code tasks), including code correctness, security, contextual awareness of large codebases, and integration with development workflows, and map promising research directions to practical needs. Last, we conduct a series of experiments to provide a comprehensive analysis of code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, covering scaling law, framework selection, hyperparameter sensitivity, model architectures, and dataset comparisons.</description>

      <title>LuGo: an Enhanced Quantum Phase Estimation Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a cardinal algorithm in quantum computing that plays a crucial role in various applications, including cryptography, molecular simulation, and solving systems of linear equations. However, the standard implementation of QPE faces challenges related to time complexity and circuit depth, which limit its practicality for large-scale computations. We introduce LuGo, a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of QPE by reducing circuit duplication, as well as using parallelization techniques to achieve faster generation of the QPE circuit and gate reduction. We validate the effectiveness of our framework by generating quantum linear solver circuits, which require both QPE and inverse QPE, to solve linear systems of equations. LuGo achieves significant improvements in both computational efficiency and hardware requirements without compromising on accuracy. Compared to a standard QPE implementation, LuGo reduces time consumption to generate a circuit that solves a $2^6\times 2^6$ system matrix by a factor of $50.68$ and over $31\times$ reduction of quantum gates and circuit depth, with no fidelity loss on an ideal quantum simulator. We demonstrated the versatility and scalability of LuGo enabled HHL algorithm by simulating a canonical Hele-Shaw fluid problem using a quantum simulator. With these advantages, LuGo paves the way for more efficient implementations of QPE, enabling broader applications across several quantum computing domains.</description>

      <title>The SWE-Bench Illusion: When State-of-the-Art LLMs Remember Instead of Reason</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12286v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable and widely adopted, benchmarks play a central role in assessing their practical utility. For example, SWE-Bench Verified has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating LLMs' software engineering abilities, particularly their aptitude for resolving real-world GitHub issues. Recent LLMs show impressive performance on SWE-Bench, leading to optimism about their capacity for complex coding tasks. However, current evaluation protocols may overstate these models' true capabilities. It is crucial to distinguish LLMs' generalizable problem-solving ability and other learned artifacts. In this work, we introduce two diagnostic tasks: file path identification from issue descriptions alone and ground truth function reproduction with only the current file context and issue description to probe models' underlying knowledge. We present empirical evidence that performance gains on SWE-Bench-Verified may be partially driven by memorization rather than genuine problem-solving. We show that state-of-the-art models achieve up to 76% accuracy in identifying buggy file paths using only issue descriptions, without access to repository structure. This performance is merely up to 53% on tasks from repositories not included in SWE-Bench, pointing to possible data contamination or memorization. Similar patterns are also observed for the function reproduction task, where the verbatim similarity is much higher on SWE-Bench Verified than on other similar coding benchmarks (up to 35% consecutive 5-gram accuracy on SWE-Bench Verified and Full, but only up to 18% for tasks in other benchmarks). These findings raise concerns about the validity of existing results and underscore the need for more robust, contamination-resistant benchmarks to reliably evaluate LLMs' coding abilities.</description>

      <title>Is General-Purpose AI Reasoning Sensitive to Data-Induced Cognitive Biases? Dynamic Benchmarking on Typical Software Engineering Dilemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human cognitive biases in software engineering can lead to costly errors. While general-purpose AI (GPAI) systems may help mitigate these biases due to their non-human nature, their training on human-generated data raises a critical question: Do GPAI systems themselves exhibit cognitive biases? To investigate this, we present the first dynamic benchmarking framework to evaluate data-induced cognitive biases in GPAI within software engineering workflows. Starting with a seed set of 16 hand-crafted realistic tasks, each featuring one of 8 cognitive biases (e.g., anchoring, framing) and corresponding unbiased variants, we test whether bias-inducing linguistic cues unrelated to task logic can lead GPAI systems from correct to incorrect conclusions. To scale the benchmark and ensure realism, we develop an on-demand augmentation pipeline relying on GPAI systems to generate task variants that preserve bias-inducing cues while varying surface details. This pipeline ensures correctness (88-99% on average, according to human evaluation), promotes diversity, and controls reasoning complexity by leveraging Prolog-based reasoning. We evaluate leading GPAI systems (GPT, LLaMA, DeepSeek) and find a consistent tendency to rely on shallow linguistic heuristics over more complex reasoning. All systems exhibit bias sensitivity (6-35%), which increases with task complexity (up to 49%) and highlights risks in AI-driven software engineering.</description>
