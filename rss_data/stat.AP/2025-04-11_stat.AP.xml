      <title>NFL Draft Modelling: Loss Functional Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the NFL draft, teams must strategically balance immediate player impact against long-term value, presenting a complex optimization challenge for draft capital management. This paper introduces a framework for evaluating the fairness and efficiency of draft pick trades using norm-based loss functions. Draft pick valuations are modelled by the Weibull distribution. Utilizing these valuation techniques, the research identifies key trade-offs between aggressive, immediate-impact strategies and conservative, risk-averse approaches. Ultimately, this framework serves as a valuable analytical tool for assessing NFL draft trade fairness and value distribution, aiding team decision-makers and enriching insights within the sports analytics community.</description>

      <title>Penalized Linear Models for Highly Correlated High-Dimensional Immunophenotyping Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction and identification of variables associated with outcomes or disease states are critical for advancing diagnosis, prognosis, and precision medicine in biomedical research. Regularized regression techniques, such as lasso, are widely employed to enhance interpretability by reducing model complexity and identifying significant variables. However, when applying to biomedical datasets, e.g., immunophenotyping dataset, there are two major challenges that may lead to unsatisfactory results using these methods: 1) high correlation between predictors, which leads to the exclusion of important variables with included predictors in variable selection, and 2) the presence of skewness, which violates key statistical assumptions of these methods. Current approaches that fail to address these issues simultaneously may lead to biased interpretations and unreliable coefficient estimates. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel two-step approach, the Bootstrap-Enhanced Regularization Method (BERM). BERM outperforms existing two-step approaches and demonstrates consistent performance in terms of variable selection and estimation accuracy across simulated sparsity scenarios. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of BERM by applying it to a human immunophenotyping dataset identifying important immune parameters associated the autoimmune disease, type 1 diabetes.</description>

      <title>Effective treatment allocation strategies under partial interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interference occurs when the potential outcomes of a unit depend on the treatment of others. Interference can be highly heterogeneous, where treating certain individuals might have a larger effect on the population's overall outcome. A better understanding of how covariates explain this heterogeneity may lead to more effective interventions. In the presence of clusters of units, we assume that interference occurs within clusters but not across them. We define novel causal estimands under hypothetical, stochastic treatment allocation strategies that fix the marginal treatment probability in a cluster and vary how the treatment probability depends on covariates, such as a unit's network position and characteristics. We illustrate how these causal estimands can shed light on the heterogeneity of interference and on the network and covariate profile of influential individuals. For experimental settings, we develop standardized weighting estimators for our novel estimands and derive their asymptotic distribution. We design an inferential procedure for testing the null hypothesis of interference homogeneity with respect to covariates. We validate the performance of the estimator and inferential procedure through simulations.We then apply the novel estimators to a clustered experiment in China to identify the important characteristics that drive heterogeneity in the effect of providing information sessions on insurance uptake.</description>

      <title>A GARMA Framework for Unit-Bounded Time Series Based on the Unit-Lindley Distribution with Application to Renewable Energy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Unit-Lindley is a one-parameter family of distributions in $(0,1)$ obtained from an appropriate transformation of the Lindley distribution. In this work, we introduce a class of dynamical time series models for continuous random variables taking values in $(0,1)$ based on the Unit-Lindley distribution. The models pertaining to the proposed class are observation-driven ones for which, conditionally on a set of covariates, the random component is modeled by a Unit-Lindley distribution. The systematic component aims at modeling the conditional mean through a dynamical structure resembling the classical ARMA models. Parameter estimation in conducted using partial maximum likelihood, for which an asymptotic theory is available. Based on asymptotic results, the construction of confidence intervals, hypotheses testing, model selection, and forecasting can be carried on. A Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed partial maximum likelihood approach. Finally, an application considering forecasting of the proportion of net electricity generated by conventional hydroelectric power in the United States is presented. The application show the versatility of the proposed method compared to other benchmarks models in the literature.</description>

      <title>Sequential Filtering Techniques for Simultaneous Tracking and Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The number of resident space objects is rising at an alarming rate. Mega-constellations and breakup events are proliferating in most orbital regimes, and safe navigation is becoming increasingly problematic. It is important to be able to track RSOs accurately and at an affordable computational cost. Orbital dynamics are highly nonlinear, and current operational methods assume Gaussian representations of the objects' states and employ linearizations which cease to hold true in observation-free propagation. Monte Carlo-based filters can provide a means to approximate the a posteriori probability distribution of the states more accurately by providing support in the portion of the state space which overlaps the most with the processed observations. Moreover, dynamical models are not able to capture the full extent of realistic forces experienced in the near-Earth space environment, and hence fully deterministic propagation methods may fail to achieve the desired accuracy. By modeling orbital dynamics as a stochastic system and solving it using stochastic numerical integrators, we are able to simultaneously estimate the scale of the process noise incurred by the assumed uncertainty in the system, and robustly track the state of the spacecraft. In order to find an adequate balance between accuracy and computational cost, we propose three algorithms which are capable of tracking a space object and estimating the magnitude of the system's uncertainty. The proposed filters are successfully applied to a LEO scenario, demonstrating the ability to accurately track a spacecraft state and estimate the scale of the uncertainty online, in various simulation setups.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Multi-Criteria Decision-Making for Circularity Performance of Modern Methods of Construction Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The construction industry faces increasingly more significant pressure to reduce resource consumption, minimise waste, and enhance environmental performance. Towards the transition to a circular economy in the construction industry, one of the challenges is the lack of a standardised assessment framework and methods to measure circularity at the product level. To support a more sustainable and circular construction industry through robust and enhanced scenario analysis, this paper integrates probabilistic analysis into the coupled assessment framework; this research addresses uncertainties associated with multiple criteria and diverse stakeholders in the construction industry to enable more robust decision-making support on both circularity and sustainability performance. By demonstrating the application in three real-world MMC products, the proposed framework offers a novel approach to simultaneously assess the circularity and sustainability of MMC products with robustness and objectiveness.</description>

      <title>From Winter Storm Thermodynamics to Wind Gust Extremes: Discovering Interpretable Equations from Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliably identifying and understanding temporal precursors to extreme wind gusts is crucial for early warning and mitigation. This study proposes a simple data-driven approach to extract key predictors from a dataset of historical extreme European winter windstorms and derive simple equations linking these precursors to extreme gusts over land. A major challenge is the limited training data for extreme events, increasing the risk of model overfitting. Testing various mitigation strategies, we find that combining dimensionality reduction, careful cross-validation, feature selection, and a nonlinear transformation of maximum wind gusts informed by Generalized Extreme Value distributions successfully reduces overfitting. These measures yield interpretable equations that generalize across regions while maintaining satisfactory predictive skill. The discovered equations reveal the association between a steady drying low-troposphere before landfall and wind gust intensity in Northwestern Europe.</description>

      <title>A Partially Pooled NSUM Model: Detailed estimation of CSEM trafficking prevalence in Philippine municipalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective policy and intervention strategies to combat human trafficking for child sexual exploitation material (CSEM) production require accurate prevalence estimates. Traditional Network Scale Up Method (NSUM) models often necessitate standalone surveys for each geographic region, escalating costs and complexity. This study introduces a partially pooled NSUM model, using a hierarchical Bayesian framework that efficiently aggregates and utilizes data across multiple regions without increasing sample sizes. We developed this model for a novel national survey dataset from the Philippines and we demonstrate its ability to produce detailed municipal-level prevalence estimates of trafficking for CSEM production. Our results not only underscore the model's precision in estimating hidden populations but also highlight its potential for broader application in other areas of social science and public health research, offering significant implications for resource allocation and intervention planning.</description>

      <title>Quantifying sleep apnea heterogeneity using hierarchical Bayesian modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a breathing disorder during sleep that affects millions of people worldwide. The diagnosis of OSA often occurs through an overnight polysomnogram (PSG) sleep study that generates a massive amount of physiological data. However, despite the evidence of substantial heterogeneity in the expression and symptoms of OSA, diagnosis and scientific analysis of severity typically focus on a single summary statistic, the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI). To address the limitations inherent in such analyses, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach to analyze PSG data. Our approach produces an interpretable vector of random effect parameters for each patient that govern sleep-stage dynamics, rates of OSA events, and impacts of OSA events on subsequent sleep-stage dynamics. We propose a novel approach for using these random effects to produce a Bayes optimal cluster of patients under K-means loss. We use the proposed approach to analyze data from the APPLES study. This analysis produces clinically interesting groups of patients with sleep apnea and a novel finding of an association between OSA expression and cognitive performance that is missed by an AHI-based analysis.</description>

      <title>On misconceptions about the Brier score in binary prediction models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Brier score is a widely used metric evaluating overall performance of predictions for binary outcome probabilities in clinical research. However, its interpretation can be complex, as it does not align with commonly taught concepts in medical statistics. Consequently, the Brier score is often misinterpreted, sometimes to a significant extent, a fact that has not been adequately addressed in the literature. This commentary aims to explore prevalent misconceptions surrounding the Brier score and elucidate the reasons these interpretations are incorrect.</description>

      <title>NNN: Next-Generation Neural Networks for Marketing Mix Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present NNN, a Transformer-based neural network approach to Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) designed to address key limitations of traditional methods. Unlike conventional MMMs which rely on scalar inputs and parametric decay functions, NNN uses rich embeddings to capture both quantitative and qualitative aspects of marketing and organic channels (e.g., search queries, ad creatives). This, combined with its attention mechanism, enables NNN to model complex interactions, capture long-term effects, and potentially improve sales attribution accuracy. We show that L1 regularization permits the use of such expressive models in typical data-constrained settings. Evaluating NNN on simulated and real-world data demonstrates its efficacy, particularly through considerable improvement in predictive power. Beyond attribution, NNN provides valuable, complementary insights through model probing, such as evaluating keyword or creative effectiveness, enhancing model interpretability.</description>
