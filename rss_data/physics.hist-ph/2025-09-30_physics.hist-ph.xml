      <title>Comment on Galina Weinstein's article entitled "Convergences and Divergences: Einstein Poincar\'e and Special Relativity"</title>

Abstract: In 2024, after thirty years of research on this subject, I published a book entitled: Poincar\'e, Einstein and the discovery of special relativity. An end to the controversy (Ginoux2024). In September 2025, Galina Weinstein published a review of this book entitled: Convergences and Divergences: Einstein Poincar\'e and Special Relativity (arXiv:2509.09361) in which she aimed "to show how Einstein's ether-free, principle-based kinematics marked out a path that, unlike its contemporaries, became the canonical form of special relativity.'' To this end, she claimed to reconstruct "in a novel way, the 1905 derivations of Einstein and Poincar\'e, highlighting their contrasting paths''. In her paper, she proposed a mathematical presentation of "the 1905 derivations of Poincar\'e and Einstein''. And then, she pretended to trace "their similarities and, more importantly, their differences.'' Unfortunately, Weinstein's review of my book contains a number of mistakes, falsehoods and misleading criticisms that I would like to point out here. To this aim, I will follow the structure of Weinstein's paper and show section by section all the erroneous historical facts she has reported.</description>

      <title>From statistical dependence to the space of possible superdeterministic theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bell's theorem demonstrates that any physical theory that is consistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics, and which satisfies some apparently innocuous assumptions, must violate the principle of local causality. It may therefore be possible to maintain local causality by rejecting one of these other assumptions instead. One possibility that has recently received significant attention involves rejecting the principle of statistical independence (SI). In this paper, we consider the frequency interpretation of SI, which states that $\rho(\lambda) \approx \rho(\lambda | Z)$, where $\rho(\lambda)$ is the relative frequency of an element of an ensemble being in the state $\lambda$, and $Z$ is a label that separates the ensemble into apparently randomly selected sub-ensembles. SI is violated when the sub-ensemble frequency $\rho(\lambda | Z)$ fails to be representative of the ensemble frequency $\rho(\lambda)$. We argue that physical theories that systematically violate SI should all be understood as superdeterministic. This perspective on SI sheds light on a number of issues that are being debated in the superdeterminism literature, especially concerning its scope and philosophical consequences. Regarding scope, we argue that superdeterministic theories fall into three categories, deterministic theories with fine-tuned initial conditions, fluke theories, and nomic exclusion theories. We also argue that retrocausal and invariant set theories need not violate SI, which is contrary to how they are normally presented. Regarding philosophical implications, we argue that superdeterminism is incompatible with free will according to some prominent compatibilist accounts. We also argue that although superdeterminism is conspiratorial, it is not unscientific, but pre-scientific.</description>
