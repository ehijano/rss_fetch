      <title>Wormholes with low energy density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In spite of their speculative nature, traversable wormholes are a topic of interest that started with the Einstein-Rosen bridge in 1935 and became a major research area with the introduction of the Morris-Thorne wormhole in 1988. It is also become apparent in time that such wormholes are likely to be compact stellar objects, akin to neutron stars. Although widely discussed, wormholes having a low energy density may therefore not be massive enough to exist on a macroscopic scale. Important examples are wormholes based on a noncommutative-geometry background and wormholes supported by the negative energy density sourced by the Casimir effect. The main goal of this paper is to invoke $f(Q)$ modified gravity to provide the extra degrees of freedom to help overcome these obstacles.</description>

      <title>Test of a theory of the Mott quantum-measurement problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mott problem asks: Is there a microphysical mechanism - based only on Schroedinger's equation - that explains why an alpha particle emitted in a spherically symmetric nuclear decay produces a non-spherically-symmetric single track in a cloud chamber? This is a variant of the more general quantum measurement problem. Earlier, I proposed such a mechanism, drawing on quantum-mechanical Coulomb scattering and the thermal behavior of supersaturated vapors. I found that the probability that a track originates at distance R from the decay source is proportional to 1/R^2, with a proportionality constant that I expressed in terms of more fundamental parameters but was unable to estimate at the time. I tested the 1/R^2 law opportunistically using cloud chamber video from the Internet. Here, I draw on chemical physics to independently estimate the proportionality constant. The estimate is within a factor 1-2 of a value extracted directly from the data.</description>
