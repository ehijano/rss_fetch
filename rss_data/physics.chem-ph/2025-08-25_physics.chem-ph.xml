      <title>Selectively enabling linear combination of atomic orbital coefficients to improve linear method optimizations in variational Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second order stochastic optimization methods, such as the linear method, couple the updates of different parameters and, in so doing, allow statistical uncertainty in one parameter to affect the update of other parameters. In simple tests, we demonstrate that the presence of unimportant orbital optimization parameters, even when initialized to zero, seriously degrade the statistical quality of the linear method's update for important orbital parameters. To counteract this issue, we develop an expand-and-prune selective linear combination of atomic orbitals algorithm that removes unimportant parameters from the variational set on the fly. In variational Monte Carlo orbital optimizations in propene, butene, and pentadiene, we find that large fractions of the parameters can be safely removed, and that doing so can increase the efficacy of the overall optimization.</description>

      <title>A universal machine learning model for the electronic density of states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last few years several ``universal'' interatomic potentials have appeared, using machine-learning approaches to predict energy and forces of atomic configurations with arbitrary composition and structure, with an accuracy often comparable with that of the electronic-structure calculations they are trained on. Here we demonstrate that these generally-applicable models can also be built to predict explicitly the electronic structure of materials and molecules. We focus on the electronic density of states (DOS), and develop PET-MAD-DOS, a rotationally unconstrained transformer model built on the Point Edge Transformer (PET) architecture, and trained on the Massive Atomistic Diversity (MAD) dataset. We demonstrate our model's predictive abilities on samples from diverse external datasets, showing also that the DOS can be further manipulated to obtain accurate band gap predictions. A fast evaluation of the DOS is especially useful in combination with molecular simulations probing matter in finite-temperature thermodynamic conditions. To assess the accuracy of PET-MAD-DOS in this context, we evaluate the ensemble-averaged DOS and the electronic heat capacity of three technologically relevant systems: lithium thiophosphate (LPS), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and a high entropy alloy (HEA). By comparing with bespoke models, trained exclusively on system-specific datasets, we show that our universal model achieves semi-quantitative agreement for all these tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning can be performed using a small fraction of the bespoke data, yielding models that are comparable to, and sometimes better than, fully-trained bespoke models.</description>

      <title>Water structuring at stacked graphene interfaces unveiled by machine-learning molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wettability of monolayer and multilayer graphene remains a topic of longstanding debate. Here, we combined first-principles molecular dynamics simulations accelerated with the atomic cluster expansion machine learning interatomic potential to investigate how substrate, graphene layer number, and intercalated water molecules influence graphene's wettability. Simulated vibrational sum-frequency generation (vSFG) spectra revealed that the experimentally observed hydrophilic behavior of monolayer graphene on hydrophilic substrates arose not from wetting transparency, but from signal cancellation induced by intercalated water. Energetic analyses further showed that intercalated water molecules were thermodynamically favorable for monolayer graphene on hydrophilic substrates, but not for multilayer systems, leading to changes in the vSFG response in line with experimental observations. These results offer a mechanistic understanding of graphene-water interactions and have broad implications for the design of graphene-based interfaces and devices.</description>

      <title>Nodal error behind discrepancies between coupled cluster and diffusion Monte Carlo: AcOH dimer case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The small magnitude and long-range character of non-covalent interactions pose a significant challenge for computational quantum chemical and electronic-structure methods alike. State-of-the-art coupled cluster (CC) theory and benchmark-grade diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) are ideally positioned to tackle these problems, but concerning differences between both methods have been reported in numerous studies of the interaction energy of non-covalently bound dimers. Given that the basic theoretical frameworks underpinning both methods are exact in principle, the error must arise from one or several of the approximations required to make the calculations computationally tractable. Here we carry out a rigorous and systematic case study of the effect of each of these approximations using the acetic acid dimer as a convenient testing ground. Thanks to the use of stringently optimized backflow wave functions we are able to find that the $\sim 0.8$ kcal mol$^{-1}$ discrepancy is dominated by a &gt;0.5 kcal mol-1 fixed-node error incurred by the Slater-Jastrow DMC result, while errors in the CC calculations only account for up to ~0.2 kcal mol-1. This finding, likely applicable to other non-covalent systems, helps establish that CC should be regarded as the benchmark for these systems, and can potentially guide the search for pragmatic solutions to the fixed-node problem in the future.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Modified Zeeman Effect via Spin-Polariton Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the electronic spin Zeeman effect for an effective spin-1/2-system subject to both strong coupling to a low-frequency optical cavity and an external static magnetic field. Specifically, we address the interplay between the cavity magnetic field component in a cavity Zeeman interaction and the canonical spin Zeeman interaction from the perspective of an effective spin-polariton Hamiltonian. The latter is derived from the minimal coupling Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian beyond the common dipole approximation via first-order quasi-degenerate perturbation theory. We find the spin Zeeman effect to be modified in the presence of the cavity field due to the formation of spin-polariton states, which result from an intricate interplay of cavity and external magnetic fields in our model. Spin-polariton signatures are discussed in the context of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy along with cavity-induced modifications of the electronic g-factor.</description>

      <title>A General Molecular-Scale Dynamic Memristor Model Based on Non-equilibrium Charge Transport Kinetics and Its Information Processing Capability in Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium molecular-scale dynamics, where fast electron transport couples with slow chemical state evolution, underpins the complex behaviors of molecular memristors, yet a general model linking these dynamics to neuromorphic computing remains elusive. We introduce a dynamic memristor model that integrates Landauer and Marcus electron transport theories with the kinetics of slow processes, such as proton/ion migration or conformational changes. This framework reproduces experimental conductance hysteresis and emulates synaptic functions like short-term plasticity (STP) and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). By incorporating the model into a reservoir computing (RC) architecture, we show that computational performance optimizes when input frequency and bias mapping range align with the molecular system's intrinsic kinetics. This chemistry-centric, bottom-up approach provides a theoretical foundation for molecular-scale neuromorphic computing, demonstrating how non-equilibrium molecular-scale dynamics can drive information processing in the post-Moore era.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous spiral patterns etched on Germanium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin metal film on Germanium, in the presence of water, results in a remarkable pattern forming system. Here we present an analysis of spirals spontaneously etched on the Ge surface. We obtain measurements of the growth dynamics of the spirals and measurements of the local strain field in the metal film. Both indicate that the near geometric order of the pattern originates from the unique far field of a singularity - a crystal defect. The measured engraving profile is found in quantitative agreement with a model of metal catalyzed corrosion of the Ge surface. Specifically, local etch depth is inversely proportional to the normal velocity of the Ge-metal contact line. The growth mechanism combines crack propagation, reaction diffusion dynamics, and thin film mechanical instabilities, and illustrates how a defect's long range field can impose geometric order in a non-equilibrium growth process. General features relevant to other pattern forming systems are the coupling of chemistry and mechanics and the singularity driven order.</description>

      <title>Molecular Tools for Non-Planar Surface Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) investigations of on-surface chemistry on passivated silicon have only shown in-plane chemical reactions, and studies on bare silicon are limited in facilitating additional reactions post-molecular-attachment. Here, we enable subsequent reactions on Si(100) through selectively adsorbing 3D, silicon-specific "molecular tools". Following an activation step, the molecules present an out-of-plane radical that can function both to donate or accept molecular fragments, thereby enabling applications across multiple scales, e.g., macroscale customizable silicon-carbon coatings or nanoscale tip-mediated mechanosynthesis. Creation of many such molecular tools is enabled by broad molecular design criteria that facilitate reproducibility, surface specificity, and experimental verifiability. These criteria are demonstrated using a model molecular tool tetrakis(iodomethyl)germane ($Ge(CH_{2}I)_{4}$; TIMe-Ge), with experimental validation by SPM and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and theoretical support by density functional theory (DFT) investigations. With this framework, a broad and diverse range of new molecular engineering capabilities are enabled on silicon.</description>

      <title>Ambient-Pressure Superconductivity from Boron Icosahedral Superatoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a new family of XB$_{12}$, boron-rich compounds formed by interconnected B$_{12}$ icosahedra and electropositive guest atoms ($X$). These structures emerged from first-principles crystal structure prediction at 50 GPa, as part of a pressure-quenching strategy to discover superconductors that could be synthesized under pressure and retained at ambient conditions. The resulting structures are thermodynamically competitive, dynamically stable at zero pressure, and - when $X$ is a mono- or trivalent element - metallic and superconducting. Predicted critical temperatures reach up to 42 K for CsB$_{12}$, rivaling MgB$_2$, the highest-$T_c$ ambient-pressure conventional superconductor.
  We interpret the XB$_{12}$ phase as a superatomic crystal: the B$_{12}$ units retain their molecular identity while forming extended crystalline networks. Their delocalized orbitals support doping without structural destabilization, while their covalent bonding promotes strong electron-phonon coupling. Unlike MgB$_2$, where superconductivity is driven by a narrow subset of phonon modes, the XB$_{12}$ compounds exhibit broad, mode- and momentum-distributed coupling through both intra- and inter-superatomic vibrations. Our results highlight the XB$_{12}$ family as a promising platform for metastable superconductivity and demonstrate the potential of superatoms as functional building blocks in solid-state materials design.</description>

      <title>Optical formation of ultracold NaK$_2$ ground state molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the rovibronic transitions in NaK$_2$ between its electronic ground state $1^2A'$ and its second excited state $3^2A'$, to identify possible pathways for the creation of ultracold ground-state triatomic molecules. Our methodology relies on the computation of potential energy surfaces and transition dipole moment surfaces for the relevant electronic states using ab initio methods. Rovibrational energy levels and wave functions are determined using the discrete variable representation approach. A double-well structure of the potential energy surface is identified for both states, and the related transition strengths between the rovibrational levels are derived. Our calculations show that the formation of ultracold ground-state NaK$_2$ molecules is expected when starting from an excited electronic state of NaK$_2$, which can be created by photoassociation of NaK and K observed by optical means by Cao et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 2024, 132, 093403).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using molecular orbital theory, we introduce magnetism in pure-carbon, charge-neutral fullerene monolayers which are otherwise non-magnetic. By controlling either molecular or lattice symmetry, we can realise highly-tuneable magnetic fullerene monolayers. We demonstrate a general design principle based on group theory analysis and explain the origin of magnetism using two representative systems with $S_4$ and $C_3$ molecular symmetries. Moreover, for building blocks that lack appropriate molecular symmetry, we can enforce crystalline symmetry to induce magnetism as well. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of realising our proposed magnetic fullerene monolayers by examining a previously synthesised C$_{60}$ system. Our work opens a new direction in introducing magnetism in non-magnetic building blocks by enforcing either molecular or lattice symmetry.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Heuristic for Molecular Docking on Neutral-Atom Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular docking is a critical computational method in drug discovery used to predict the binding conformation and orientation of a ligand within a protein's binding site. Mapping this challenge onto a graph-based problem, specifically the Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) problem, allows it to be addressed by specialized hardware such as neutral-atom quantum processors. However, a significant bottleneck has been the size mismatch between biologically relevant molecular systems and the limited capacity of near-term quantum devices. In this work, we overcome this scaling limitation by the use of a novel divide-and-conquer heuristic introduced in Cazals et al. This algorithm enables the solution of large-scale MWIS problems by decomposing a single, intractable graph instance into smaller sub-problems that can be solved sequentially on a neutral-atom quantum emulator, incurring only a linear computational overhead. We demonstrate the power of this approach by solving a 540-node MWIS problem representing the docking of an inhibitor to the Tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ Converting Enzyme--thiol-containing Aryl Sulfonamide (TACE-AS) complex. Our work enables the application of quantum methods to more complex and physically realistic molecular systems than previously possible, paving the way for tackling large-scale docking challenges on near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Lost Data in Electron Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this study is to estimate the amount of lost data in electron microscopy and to analyze the extent to which experimentally acquired images are utilized in peer-reviewed scientific publications. Analysis of the number of images taken on electron microscopes at a core user facility and the number of images subsequently included in peer-reviewed scientific journals revealed low efficiency of data utilization. More than 90% of electron microscopy data generated during routine instrument operation remain unused. Of the more than 150000 electron microscopy images evaluated in this study, only approximately 3500 (just over 2%) were made available in publications. Thus, the amount of lost data in electron microscopy can be estimated as &gt;90% (in terms of data being recorded but not being published in peer-reviewed literature). On the one hand, these results highlight a shortcoming in the optimal use of microscopy images; on the other hand, they indicate the existence of a large pool of electron microscopy data that can facilitate research in data science and the development of AI-based projects. The considerations important to unlock the potential of lost data are discussed in the present article.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional hyperspectral imaging with optical microcombs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical frequency combs have revolutionised time and frequency metrology [1, 2]. The advent of microresonator-based frequency combs ('microcombs' [3-5]) is set to lead to the miniaturisation of devices that are ideally suited to a wide range of applications, including microwave generation [6, 7], ranging [8-10], the precise calibration of astronomical spectrographs [11], neuromorphic computing [12, 13], high-bandwidth data communications[14], and quantum-optics [15, 16] platforms. Here, we introduce a new microcomb application for three-dimensional imaging. Our method can simultaneously determine the chemical identity and full three-dimensional geometry, including size, shape, depth, and spatial coordinates, of particulate matter ranging from micrometres to millimetres in size across nearly $10^5$ distinct image pixels. We demonstrate our technique using millimetre-sized plastic specimens (i.e. microplastics measuring less than 5 mm). We combine amplitude and phase analysis and achieve a throughput exceeding $1.2~10^6$ pixels per second with micrometre-scale precision. Our method leverages the defining feature of microcombs - their large line spacing - to enable precise spectral diagnostics using microcombs with a repetition frequency of 1 THz. Our results suggest scalable operation over several million pixels and nanometre-scale axial resolution. Coupled with its high-speed, label-free and multiplexed capabilities, our approach provides a promising basis for environmental sensing, particularly for the real-time detection and characterisation of microplastic pollutants in aquatic ecosystems [17].</description>

      <title>Breaking the Quadrillion Determinant Barrier in Numerically Exact Configuration Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combinatorial scaling of configuration interaction (CI) has long restricted its applicability to only the simplest molecular systems. Here, we report the first numerically exact CI calculation exceeding one quadrillion ($10^{15}$) determinants, enabled by categorical compression within the small-tensor-product distributed active space (STP-DAS) framework. As a demonstration, we converged the relativistic complete active space CI (CASCI) ground state of HBrTe involving over $10^{15}$ complex-valued 2-spinor determinants in under 34.5 hours (time-to-completion) using 1000 nodes, representing the largest CASCI calculation reported to date. Additionally, we achieved $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$-build times of just 5 minutes for systems with approximately 150 billion complex-valued 2-spinor determinants using only a few compute nodes. Extensive benchmarks confirm that the method retains numerical exactness with drastically reduced resource demands. Compared to previous state-of-the-art CI calculations, this work represents a 3-orders-of-magnitude increase in CI space, a 6-orders-of-magnitude increase in FLOP count, and a 6-orders-of-magnitude improvement in computational speed. By introducing a numerically exact, categorically compressed representation of the CI expansion vectors and reformulating the $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$-build accordingly, we eliminate memory bottlenecks associated with storing excitation lists and CI vectors while significantly reducing computational cost. A compression-compatible preconditioner further enhances performance by generating compressed CI expansion vectors throughout Davidson iterations. This work establishes a new computational frontier for numerically exact CI methods, enabling chemically and physically accurate simulations of strongly correlated, spin-orbit coupled systems previously thought to be beyond reach.</description>

      <title>Exact static linear response of excited states from ensemble density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following a recent work [E. Fromager, J. Phys. Chem. A 2025, 129, 4, 1143-1155] on the ensemble density functional theory (DFT) of excited electronic energy levels, we derive in this paper the ensuing static linear response theory, thus allowing for an in-principle exact evaluation of excited-state density-density linear response functions in a completely frequency-independent setting. Once individual-state components of the inverse ensemble linear response function have been introduced, a working Dyson-type equation naturally emerges for each state, individually. By considering the zero-weight limit of the theory, which infinitesimally deviates from standard Kohn--Sham DFT, exact excited-state corrections to ground-state linear response DFT can be identified. They involve the first-order weight derivatives of the ensemble Hartree-exchange-correlation (Hxc) potential and kernel, thus confirming the importance in ensemble DFT of both weight and density-functional derivatives of the ensemble Hxc energy functional.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap: From Resolving Theoretical Foundations of Chiral(ity)-Induced Spin Selectivity to Pioneering Implementations in Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chiral(ity)-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, where electrons passing through a chiral medium acquire significant spin-polarization at ambient temperatures, has been widely observed experimentally, yet its theoretical foundations remain actively debated. Open questions persist regarding whether CISS originates from helical geometry or more general chirality, and whether a unified mechanism can account for phenomena across solid-state and soft-matter systems, mesoscopic films, and single molecules. Clarifying the interrelations between existing models is essential to determine if a universal picture of CISS can be found or whether system-specific models are required, and if so, where their common starting point should lie for a workable classification of CISS manifestations. Despite this theoretical fragmentation, recent studies of CISS effects in electron transfer systems, magnetic field sensitivity and coherence of radical pair reactions, polarized electroluminescence in chiral hybrid perovskites, DNA-based biosensors, and enantioselective detection, highlight its broad conceptual relevance and potential applications in spintronics, molecular sensors, and quantum information processing. In this review, we help bridge the gap between theory, experiment, and implementation, with a particular focus on prospects for quantum sensing and metrology. We outline fundamental frameworks of CISS, clarifying what constitutes the `chiral', the `induced', and the `spin-selectivity' that makes up CISS, before going on to survey key model realizations and their assumptions. We examine some of the emerging quantum sensing applications and assess the model-specific implications, in particular exemplifying these in the context of spin-correlated radical pairs, which offer a promising, tunable, and biomimetic platform for emerging molecular quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Angular Momentum Generation in Thermally Driven Chiral Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The appearance of angular momentum in the nuclear motion of molecular systems lacking inversion symmetry under imposed thermal gradients presents a novel mechanism with potential implications for spintronics, magnetic response, and energy transport in such systems. Here we explore this phenomenon, using theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to study angular momentum generation in several driven chiral molecular models. We demonstrate that significant vibrational angular momentum can be induced under both mechanical and thermal driving, with magnitude comparable to that induced in optically driven chiral phonons. We find that generation of angular momentum is a common and general phenomenon in driven chiral structures, highlighting the role of symmetry-breaking in the (non-equilibrium) internal atomic motion of such systems.</description>

      <title>Gaussian-Based Periodic Grand Canonical Density Functional Theory with Implicit Solvation for Computational Electrochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical method for grand canonical density functional theory (DFT) tailored to solid-state systems, employing Gaussian-type orbitals as the primary basis. Our approach directly minimizes the grand canonical free energy using the density matrix as the sole variational parameter, while self-consistently updating the electron number between self-consistent field iterations. To enable realistic electrochemical modeling, we integrate this approach with implicit solvation models. Our solvation scheme introduces less than 50% overhead relative to gas-phase calculations. Compared to existing plane wave-based implementations, our method shows improved robustness in grand canonical simulations. We validate the approach by modeling corrosion at silver surfaces, finding excellent agreement with previous studies. This work lays the groundwork for future wavefunction-based simulations beyond DFT under electrochemical operando conditions.</description>

      <title>SpinAdaptedSecondQuantization.jl 1.0 -- A Simple and Pedagogical Approach to Symbolic Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of new electronic structure methods is a very time consuming and error prone process when done by hand. SpinAdaptedSecondQuantization is an open-source Julia package we have developed for working with automated electronic structure theory development. The code focuses on being user-friendly and extensible, allowing for easy use of both user- and pre-defined fermionic and/or bosonic operators, tensors, and orbital spaces. This allows the code to be used to efficiently investigate and prototype new electronic structure methods for many different types of systems. This includes both exotic systems with wave functions consisting of different kinds of particles at once, as well as new parametrizations for traditional many-electron systems. The code is spin-adapted, working directly with spin-adapted fermionic operators, and can easily be used to derive common electronic structure theory equations and expressions, such as the coupled cluster energy, ground and excited state equations, one- and two-electron density matrices, etc. Additionally, the code can translate expressions into code, accelerating the process of going from ideas to implemented methods.</description>

      <title>Giant mobility of surface-trapped ionic charges following liquid tribocharging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sliding motion of aqueous droplets on hydrohobic surfaces leads to charge separation at the trailing edge, with implications from triple-line friction to hydrovoltaic energy generation. Charges deposited on the solid surface have been attributed to ions or electrons ripped off from the liquid drop. However, the dynamics and exact physicochemical nature of these surface-trapped charges remains poorly explored. Here, we take advantage of a scanning-based electrostatic mapping technique, to directly quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface deposited charges in the wake of droplets sliding on hydrophobic surfaces. We confirm the ionic nature of these interfacially trapped charges, and evidence that they undergo very fast bidimensional diffusive transport, gliding with low friction at the solid/gas interface. We interpret our observations in the framework of molecular dynamics simulation of hydrated ions adsorbed on solid surfaces, revealing a peculiar transport mechanism limited by purely interfacial friction of the ionic solvation shell with the solid surface. By uncovering the unexpected dynamics of these ionic puddles - a distinct state of interfacial ionic matter - our findings have general implications for molecular-scale ionic transport, electrified matter and wetting dynamics at interfaces.</description>
