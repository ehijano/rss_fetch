      <title>Charged Static AdS Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the first binary black hole solutions of Einstein-Maxwell theory in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space. The attractive force between the two black holes is balanced by the addition of a background electric field, sourced at the conformal boundary. There is a continuous family of bulk solutions for a given boundary profile and temperature, suggesting there is continuous non-uniqueness. We investigate the charges of the solutions and verify numerically that they satisfy a first law of black hole mechanics relation.</description>

      <title>Landscape of QCD Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The moduli space of covariantly constant gauge fields is infinite-dimensional and describes non-perturbative solutions of the Yang-Mills equation of superposed chromomagnetic flux tubes (vortices) of opposite magnetic charges. These gauge field configurations are stretched along the potential valleys of a constant energy density and are separated by potential barriers between classically degenerate vacua that are forming a complicated potential landscape of the QCD vacuum. It is suggested that the solutions describe the condensate of dense chromomagnetic vortices representing a dual analog of the Cooper pairs condensate in a superconductor.</description>

      <title>Hagedorn temperature in holography: world-sheet and effective approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide general results on the Hagedorn temperature of planar, strongly coupled confining gauge theories holographically dual to type II superstring models on curved backgrounds with Ramond-Ramond and Kalb-Ramond fluxes and non-trivial dilaton. For exact backgrounds the Hagedorn temperature is determined up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO) in an expansion in $\alpha'$; in all the other cases the results can be safely trusted up to NNLO. To reach these goals we exploit two complementary approaches. On the one hand, we perform an extrapolation to the Hagedorn regime of world-sheet results obtained from the semiclassical quantization of string configurations winding around the compact Euclidean time direction. En passant, we provide a detailed derivation of the fermionic part of the world-sheet spectrum, which is hard to find in the literature. On the other hand, we perturbatively solve the equations of motion for the thermal scalar field corresponding to the lightest mode of the winding string, which in flat space becomes tachyonic above the Hagedorn temperature. The interplay between different approaches is surely convenient, but we provide insights about a possible derivation of the whole NNLO correction to the Hagedorn temperature from a pure world-sheet perspective; furthermore, we determine the effective mass of the thermal scalar from the world-sheet in full generality.</description>

      <title>Weyl cohomology and the conformal anomaly in the presence of torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using cohomological methods, we identify both trivial and nontrivial contributions to the conformal anomaly in the presence of vectorial torsion in $d=2,4$ dimensions. In both cases, our analysis considers two scenarios: one in which the torsion vector transforms in an affine way, i.e., it is a gauge potential for Weyl transformations, and the other in which it is invariant under the Weyl group. An important outcome for the former case in both $d=2,4$ is the presence of anomalies of a "mixed" nature in relation to the classification of Deser and Schwimmer. For invariant torsion in $d=4$, we also find a new type of anomaly which we dub $\Psi$-anomaly. Taking these results into account, we integrate the different anomalies to obtain renormalized anomalous effective actions. Thereafter, we recast such actions in the covariant nonlocal and local forms, the latter being easier to work with. Along the way, we pause to comment on the physical usefulness of these effective actions, in particular to obtain renormalized energy-momentum tensors and thermodynamics of $2d$ black holes.</description>

      <title>Darboux Soft Hair in 3D Asymptotically Flat Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a fully on-shell solution space for three-dimensional Einstein's gravity in asymptotically flat spacetimes using a finite coordinate transformation. This space is parametrized by four unconstrained codimension-one functions that parameterize geometrical deformations of the null infinity cylinder, known as Darboux soft hair. The symplectic form of the theory in terms of these functions adopts a Darboux form at the corner, thereby yielding two copies of the Heisenberg algebra. Utilizing a series of field redefinitions of boundary charges, we construct various Lie algebras, including four Kac-Moody algebras, four Virasoro algebras, and two centrally extended BMS$_3$ algebras. Intriguingly, we show that the bulk theory possesses a well-defined action principle without the need for any boundary Lagrangian in the Darboux frame. Conversely, in the hydrodynamics frame, a well-defined action principle with the Dirichlet boundary condition results in two Schwarzian actions at null infinity.</description>

      <title>Soft synchronous gauge: principal value prescription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synchronous gauge in gravity ($g_{0 \lambda} = - \delta_{0 \lambda}$) is ill-defined due to the singularity at $p_0 = 0$ in the graviton propagator. Previously we studied "softening" this gauge by considering instead the gauge $n^\lambda g_{\lambda \mu} = 0$, $n^\lambda = (1, - \varepsilon (\partial^j \partial_j )^{- 1} \partial^k ) $ in the limit $\varepsilon \to 0$. We now explore the possibility of using a principal value prescription (not in the standard Cauchy sense), which amounts, roughly speaking, to replacing singularities $p_0^{-j} \Rightarrow [ (p_0 + i \varepsilon )^{-j} + (p_0 - i \varepsilon )^{-j} ] / 2$, which then behave like distributions. We show that such a propagator follows upon adding to the action a gauge-violating term of a general form, which reduces to $ \sim \int f_\lambda \Lambda^{\lambda \mu} f_\mu \d^4 x $ with a constant operator $\Lambda^{\lambda \mu}$ depending on $\partial$ and a metric functional $f_\lambda$. The contribution of Faddeev-Popov's ghosts to the effective action is analysed. For the required intermediate regularization, the discrete structure of the theory at small distances is implied. It is shown that the ghost contribution can be disregarded in the limit $ \varepsilon \to 0$.</description>

      <title>Swampland Program for Hypergeometric Inflation Scenarios in Rescaled Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate hypergeometric stringy corrections in the swampland program for rescaled gravity. Precisely, we study inflationary models from Gauss-Bonnet hypergeometric scalar couplings via the falsification scenario. We first derive generalized exponential potentials from such hypergeometric behaviors. Then, we examine certain selected scalar potentials by computing the relevant cosmological quantities using the slow-roll mechanism. Choosing specific points in the corresponding moduli space, we provide viable findings corroborated by Planck observational data and checked by the swampland criteria.</description>

      <title>The Nambu-Goto string as higher-derivative Liouville theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I propose a generalization of the Liouville action which corresponds to the Nambu-Goto string like the usual Liouville action corresponds to the Polyakov string. The two differ by higher-derivative terms which are negligible classically but revive quantumly. Based on the equivalence with the four-derivative action I argue that the Nambu-Goto string in four dimensions is described by the (4,3) minimal model analogously to the critical Ising model on a dynamical lattice. While critical indices are the same as in the usual Liouville theory, the domain of applicability becomes broader.</description>

      <title>Infinite and finite consistent truncations on deformed generalised parallelisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a manifold $\mathbb{M}$ admitting a maximally supersymmetric consistent truncation, we show how to formulate new consistent truncations by restricting to a set of Kaluza-Klein modes on $\mathbb{M}$ invariant under some subgroup of the group of isometries of $\mathbb{M}$. These truncations may involve either finite or infinite sets of modes. We provide their global description using exceptional generalised geometry to construct a `deformed' generalised parallelisation starting with that on $\mathbb{M}$. This allows us to explicitly embed known consistent truncations directly into exceptional generalised geometry/exceptional field theory, and to obtain the equations governing situations where the consistent truncation retains an infinite tower of modes.</description>

      <title>A String Theoretic Derivation of Gibbons-Hawking Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an attempt of string theoretic derivation of the Gibbons-Hawking entropy. Despite not admitting a de Sitter vacuum, the string theory, by the power of open-close correspondence, captures the Gibbons-Hawking entropy as the entropy of Chan-Paton species on a de Sitter-like state obtained via $D$-branes. Moreover, this derivation sheds a new light at the origin of the area-form, since the equality takes place for a critical 't Hooft coupling for which the species entropy of open strings saturates the area-law unitarity bound.</description>

      <title>Volume of a rotating black hole in 2+1 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we apply the technique for maximal volume estimation of a black hole developed by Christodoulou and Rovelli for Schwarzchild blackhole and by Zhang et al for non rotating BTZ black hole, to the case of a rotating black hole in 2+1 dimensions. We derive the equation of the maximal hypersurface for the rotating BTZ blackhole using the Lagrangian formulation demonstrated by Christodoulou and Rovelli . Further we use maximization technique illustrated earlier by Bengtsson et al for Kerr black hole to arrive at the similar result for our case. We argue that the maximum contribution to the volume of the hypersurface comes from what we call the steady state radius, which we show depends on mass M and the AdS length scale. We demonstrate that this steady state radius can be arrived at using independent considerations of vanishing extrinsic curvature. We show that the volume of this segment of the maximal hypersurface, the CR volume, depends on mass, AdS length scale and angular momentum J. We further compute the entropy of a scalar field living on the maximal hypersurface for a near extremal black hole and show that it is proportional to the horizon entropy of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Effects of charge on the interior volume of BTZ black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10167v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we extend the variational technique for maximal volume estimation of a black hole developed by Christodoulou and Rovelli (CR) to the case of a charged BTZ black hole in 2+1 dimensions. The technique involves a study of the equation of motion of a hypothetical particle moving in an auxiliary manifold defined by spacetime variables. We then compare this estimation with the volume computed using maximization method and extrinsic curvature method. The charge Q of the black hole appears as a log term in the metric and hence an analytical solution for the volume does not exist. So first we compute the steady state radius and the volume for limiting case when the charge Q is very small i.e. Q &lt;&lt; 1 and then carry out a numerical analysis to solve for the volume for more generic values of the charge. We find that the volume grows monotonically with the advance time. We further investigate the functional behaviour of the entropy of a massless scalar field living on the maximal hypersurface of a near extremal black hole. We show that this volume entropy exhibits a very different functional form compared to the horizon entropy.</description>

      <title>The Superpotential Method and the Amplification of Inflationary Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superpotential method is a reconstruction technique which has proven useful to build exact cosmological solutions. We here employ the superpotential method in order to reconstruct the features necessary for the inflaton potential to drive inflation and lead to the amplification of the curvature perturbations. Such an amplification, at wavelengths shorter than those observed in the CMB, is necessary in order to have a significant formation of Primordial Black Holes after inflation ends. The technique is applied to the cases of a minimally coupled inflaton, to the non-minimal coupling case and to f(R) theories of gravity. For such theories, a model dependent analysis of the features leading to the scalar spectrum enhancement is also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose integral representations and analytical solutions for the propagator of the $1+1$ dimensional Salpeter Hamiltonian, describing a relativistic quantum particle with no spin. We explore the exact Green function and an exact solution for a given initial condition, and also find the asymptotic solutions in some limiting cases. The analytical extension of the Hamiltonian in the complex plane allows us to formulate the equivalent stochastic problem, namely the B\"aumer equation. This equation describes \textit{relativistic} stochastic processes with time-changing anomalous diffusion. This B\"aumer propagator corresponds to the Green function of a relativistic diffusion process that interpolates between Cauchy distributions for small times and Gaussian diffusion for large times, providing a framework for stochastic processes where anomalous diffusion is time-dependent.</description>

We consider Hermiticity and renormalizability a criterion to define the derivative Elko-Higgs interaction as the suitable candidate for a dark coupling. Then, the free parameters of the model are fixed by cosmological constraints on the dark matter abundance, bounds on the Higgs invisible decays, and limits on the electron-dark matter scattering mediated by the Higgs.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity for 1-matric quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the notion of Krylov complexity, a measure of operator growth, within the framework of 1-matrix quantum mechanics (1-MQM). Krylov complexity quantifies how an operator evolves over time by expanding it in a series of nested commutators with the Hamiltonian. We analyze the Lanczos coefficients derived from the correlation function, revealing their linear growth even in this integrable system. This growth suggests a link to chaotic behavior, typically unexpected in integrable systems. Our findings in both ground and thermal states of 1-MQM provide new insights into the nature of complexity in quantum mechanical models and lay the groundwork for further studies in more complex holographic theories.</description>

      <title>Even- and odd-parity stabilities of black holes in Einstein-Aether gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Einstein-Aether theories with a timelike unit vector field, we study the linear stability of static and spherically symmetric black holes against both even- and odd-parity perturbations. For this purpose, we formulate a gauge-invariant black hole perturbation theory in the background Aether-orthogonal frame where the spacelike property of hypersurfaces orthogonal to the timelike Aether field is always maintained even inside the metric horizon. Using a short-wavelength approximation with large radial and angular momenta, we show that, in general, there are three dynamical degrees of freedom arising from the even-parity sector besides two propagating degrees of freedom present in the odd-parity sector. The propagation speeds of even-parity perturbations and their no-ghost conditions coincide with those of tensor, vector, and scalar perturbations on the Minkowski background, while the odd sector contains tensor and vector modes with the same propagation speeds as those in the even-parity sector (and hence as those on the Minkowski background). Thus, the consistent study of black hole perturbations in the Aether-orthogonal frame on static and spherically symmetric backgrounds does not add new small-scale stability conditions to those known for the Minkowski background in the literature.</description>

      <title>The high temperature QCD static potential beyond leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the leading and next-to-leading corrections to the real-time QCD static potential in a high temperature medium in the region where bound states transit from narrow resonances to wide ones. We find sizable contributions to both the real and the imaginary part of the potential. The calculation involves both loop diagrams calculated in the Hard Thermal Loop (HTL) effective theory and power corrections to the HTL Lagrangian calculated in QCD. We compare our results with recent lattice data.</description>

      <title>Minimizing the tensor/scalar ratio in single-field inflation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit a class of simple single-field inflation models and demonstrate that they can readily produce a negligible tensor/scalar ratio $r$. Motivated by recent work suggesting the need to introduce higher order operators to stabilise unregulated potentials, as well as by work indicating that such terms can have significant effects on observable predictions, we explicitly construct corrected versions of the quadratic hilltop potential that are motivated by an effective field theory expansion. We employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and optimization techniques to sample viable models and minimize $r$. We find that such potentials can readily lower $r$ values below projected CMB-S4 sensitivity, while still remaining within observable constraints on $n_s$. Furthermore, we find that the minimum $r$ reached for each order of the expansion considered is well-described by a power law $r_{min}(q) \propto q^{-B}$ before asymptoting to a value of $r_{min} \sim 10^{-11}$, where $q$ is the order to which the expansion of $V(\phi)$ is carried out.</description>

      <title>Novel Skyrmion and spin wave solutions in superconducting ferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coexistence of Ferromagnetism and superconductivity in so called ferromagnetic superconductors is an intriguing phenomenon which may lead to novel physical effects as well as applications. Here in this work we have explored the interplay of topological excitations, namely vortices and skyrmions, in ferromagnetic superconductors using a field theoretic description of such systems. In particular, numerical solutions for the continuous spin field compatible to a given vortex profile are determined in absence and presence of a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) term. The solutions show that the spin configuration is like a skyrmion but intertwined with the vortex structure -- the radius of the the skyrmion-like solution depends on the penetration depth and also the polarity of the skyrmion depends on the sign of the winding number. Thus our solution describes a novel topological structure -- namely a skyrmion-vortex composite. We have also determined the spin wave solutions in such systems in presence and absence of a vortex. In absence of vortex frequency and wave vector satisfy a cubic equation which leads to various interesting features. In particular, we have shown that in the low frequency regime the minimum in dispersion relation shifts from $k=0$ to a non zero $k$ value depending on the parameters. We also discuss the nature of spin wave dispersion in the $\omega \sim \Tilde{m}$ regime which shows a similar pattern in the dispersion curve. The group velocity of the spin wave would change it's sign across such a minimum which is unique to FMSC. Also, the spin wave modes around the local minimum looks like roton mode in superfluid and hence called a magnetic roton. In presence of a vortex, the spin wave amplitude is shown to vary spatially such that the profile looks like that of a N\'eel Skyrmion. Possible experimental signature of both solutions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Generalized Entropy Implies Varying-G: Horizon Area Dependent Field Equations and Black Hole-Cosmology Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is modified, ambiguity often arises concerning whether the Hawking temperature or the thermodynamic mass should be modified. The common practice, however, is to keep the black hole solution the same as that in general relativity. On the other hand, if Jacobson's method of deriving Einstein equations from thermodynamic is valid in the general settings, then given a generalized entropy one should first derive the corresponding modified gravity, and then look for the compatible black hole solution before investigating its thermodynamics. We comment on some properties and subtleties in this approach. In particular, we point out that generically generalized entropy would lead to a varying effective gravitational "constant" theory, where $G_\text{eff}$ depends on the horizon area. We discuss in what ways such theories are discernible from general relativity despite its seemingly jarring differences, and how to make sense of area-dependent field equations. As a consequence we show that in the Jacobson's approach, the standard quantum gravitational logarithmic correction to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is equivalent to a running gravitational "constant". A horizon area dependent $G_\text{eff}$ could also lead to a coupling between black hole masses and cosmological expansion, a scenario that has been studied recently in the literature, but so far lacks strong theoretical motivation. In the Tsallis case, we show that the thermodynamic mass for a Schwarzschild black hole is just a constant multiple of its ADM mass, which is considerably simpler than the approach not utilizing the Jacobson's method.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a massive scalar field non-minimally coupled with gravity is considered. Assuming a regular and spherically symmetric background, specifically a regular black hole solution, the energy-momentum tensor is calculated. Using the Thermo Field Dynamics (TFD) formalism and its topological structure, the corresponding Stefan-Boltzmann law and Casimir effect are investigated. The results for the regular black hole are compared with those obtained for the Schwarzschild black hole.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking: From the Effective Action to Cosmological Phase Transitions in the Standard Model and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary objective of this work is to investigate the cosmological phase transitions in the early Universe, with a focus on the electroweak phase transition in the Standard Model and its extensions. In the Standard Model, the spontaneously broken electroweak symmetry at zero temperature is restored in the early Universe due to finite-temperature effects. This phenomenon is studied using the effective potential at finite temperatures, which determines the true vacuum state of the theory. Symmetry restoration at high temperatures is also studied by the finite-temperature field theory introduced to derive the Feynman rules at finite temperatures using the imaginary-time formalism. Furthermore, we present the theory of cosmological phase transitions, focusing on the concepts of thermal tunneling and bubble nucleation. We additionally discuss the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe to formulate the conditions for baryogenesis and describe electroweak baryogenesis. Therefore, the one-loop effective potential in the Standard Model at finite temperatures is derived in detail including the ring corrections to study further the electroweak baryogenesis. Our results indicate that the electroweak phase transition is not strong enough to explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe. On the other hand, the real singlet extensions of the Standard Model describe a strong enough electroweak phase transition and the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe. These extensions are also discussed including a dimension-six operator, which originates from an effective field theory. In particular, the parameter space of this singlet extension is examined extensively, while it is restricted by numerous phenomenological constraints, such as the invisible Higgs decay width.</description>

      <title>Symplectic double groupoids and the generalized K\"ahler potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A description of the fundamental degrees of freedom underlying a generalized K\"ahler manifold, which separates its holomorphic moduli from the space of compatible metrics in a similar way to the K\"ahler case, has been sought since its discovery in 1984. In this paper, we describe a full solution to this problem for arbitrary generalized K\"ahler manifolds, which involves the new concept of a holomorphic symplectic Morita 2-equivalence between double symplectic groupoids, equipped with a Lagrangian bisection of its real symplectic core. Essentially, any generalized K\"ahler manifold has an associated holomorphic symplectic manifold of quadruple dimension and equipped with an anti-holomorphic involution; the metric is determined by a Lagrangian submanifold of its fixed point locus. This finally resolves affirmatively a long-standing conjecture by physicists concerning the existence of a generalized K\"ahler potential.
  We demonstrate the theory by constructing explicitly the above Morita 2-equivalence and Lagrangian bisection for the well-known generalized K\"ahler structures on compact even-dimensional semisimple Lie groups, which have until now escaped such analysis. We construct the required holomorphic symplectic manifolds by expressing them as moduli spaces of flat connections on surfaces with decorated boundary, through a quasi-Hamiltonian reduction.</description>

      <title>A quantum deformation of the ${\mathcal N}=2$ superconformal algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unital associative algebra ${\mathcal{SV}ir\!}_{q,k}$, having $q$ and $k$ as complex parameters, generated by the elements $K^\pm_m$ ($\pm m\geq 0$), $T_m$ ($m\in \mathbb{Z}$), and $G^\pm_m$ ($m\in \mathbb{Z}+{1\over 2}$ in the Neveu-Schwarz sector, $m\in \mathbb{Z}$ in the Ramond sector), satisfying relations which are at most quartic. Calculations of some low-lying Kac determinants are made, providing us with a conjecture for the factorization property of the Kac determinants. The analysis of the screening operators gives a supporting evidence for our conjecture. It is shown that by taking the limit $q\rightarrow 1$ of ${\mathcal{SV}ir\!}_{q,k}$ we recover the ordinary ${\mathcal N}=2$ superconformal algebra. We also give a nontrivial Heisenberg representation of the algebra ${\mathcal{SV}ir\!}_{q,k}$, making a twist of the $U(1)$ boson in the Wakimoto representation of the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$, which naturally follows from the construction of ${\mathcal{SV}ir\!}_{q,k}$ by gluing the deformed $Y$-algebras of Gaiotto and Rap$\check{\mathrm{c}}$\'{a}k.</description>

      <title>$f(Q,L_m)$ gravity, and its cosmological implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we extend the $f(Q)$ symmetric teleparallel gravity by introducing an arbitrary coupling between the non-metricity $Q$ and matter Lagrangian $L_m$ in the Lagrangian density $f$ of the theory, which thus leads to the $f\left(Q,L_m\right)$ theory. This generalisation encompasses Coincident General Relativity (CGR) and the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to GR (STEGR). Using the metric formalism, we derive the field equation of the theory, which generalizes the field equations of $f(Q)$ gravity. From the study of the covariant divergence of the field equations, it follows that the presence of the geometry-matter coupling leads to the non-conservation of the matter energy-momentum tensor. The cosmological implications of the theory are investigated in the case of a flat, homogeneous, and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker geometry. As a first step in this direction, we obtain the modified Friedmann equations for the $f(Q,L_m)$ gravity in a general form. Specific cosmological models are investigated for several choices of $f(Q,L_m)$, including $f(Q,L_m)=-\alpha Q + 2L_m + \beta$, and $f(Q,L_m)=- \alpha Q + (2L_m)^2 + \beta$, respectively. Comparative analyses with the standard $\Lambda$ CDM paradigm are carried out, and the observational implications of the models are investigated in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ring of invariant functions over the $N$-fold Cartesian product of copies of the compact Lie group $G=SU(2)$, modulo the action of conjugation by the diagonal subgroup, generalizing the group character ring. For $N=1$, an orthonormal basis for the space of invariant functions is given by the irreducible characters, and the structure constants under pointwise multiplication are the coefficients of the Clebsch-Gordan series for the reduction of angular momentum tensor products ($3j$ coefficients). For $N \ge 2$, the structure constants under pointwise multiplication of the corresponding invariants, which we term irreducible quasicharacters, are Racah $3(2N\!-\!1)j$ recoupling coefficients, which can be decomposed as products of $9j$ coefficients (for $N=2$, they are squares thereof). We identify the irreducible quasicharacters for $\times^N\! SU(2)$ with traces of representations of group elements, over totally coupled angular momentum states labelled by binary coupling trees $T$ with $N$ leaves, $N\!-\!1$ internal vertices and associated intermediate edge labels. Using concrete spin chain realizations and projection techniques, we give explicit constructions for some low degree $N=2, 3$ and $4$ quasicharacters. In the case $N=2$, related methods are used to work out the expansions of products of generic, with elementary spin-$\textstyle{\frac 12}$, quasicharacters (equivalent to an \emph{ab initio} evaluation of certain basic $9j$ coefficients). We provide an appendix which summarizes formal properties of the quasicharacter calculus known from our previous work for both $SU(2)$ and for compact $G$ (J Math Phys 59 (8) 083505 (2018) and 62(3) 033514 (2021). In particular, we provide an explicit derivation for the $N=2$ angular momentum quasicharacter product rule.</description>

      <title>Energetic particles and high-energy processes in cosmological filaments and their astronomical implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale cosmic filaments connect galaxies, clusters and voids. They are permeated by magnetic fields with a variety of topologies. Cosmic rays with energies up to $10^{20}\;\!{\rm eV}$ can be produced in astrophysical environments associated with star-formation and AGN activities. The fate of these cosmic rays in filaments, which cannot be directly observed on Earth, are rarely studied. We investigate the high-energy processes associated with energetic particles (cosmic rays) in filaments, adopting an ecological approach that includes galaxies, clusters/superclusters and voids as key cosmological structures in the filament ecosystem. We derive the phenomenology for modelling interfaces between filaments and these structures, and investigate how the transfer and fate of energetic cosmic ray protons are affected by the magnetism of the interfaces. We consider different magnetic field configurations in filaments and assess the implications for cosmic ray confinement and survival against hadronic pion-producing and photo-pair interactions. Our analysis shows that the fate of the particles depends on the location of their origin within a filament ecosystem, and that filaments act as `highways', channelling cosmic rays between galaxies, galaxy clusters and superclusters. Filaments can also operate as cosmic `fly paper', capturing cosmic ray protons with energies up to $10^{18}\;\!{\rm eV}$ from cosmic voids. Our analysis predicts the presence of a population of $\sim 10^{12}-10^{16}\;\!{\rm eV}$ cosmic ray protons in filaments and voids accumulated continually over cosmic time. These protons do not suffer significant energy losses through photo-pair or pion-production, nor can they be cooled efficiently. Instead, they form a cosmic ray fossil record of the power generation history of the Universe.</description>

Abstract: Various gravity theories beyond general relativity have been rigorously investigated in the literature such as Horndeski and degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. In general, numerous model parameters are involved in such theories, which should be constrained to test the theories with experiments and observations. We construct the kurtosis consistency relations, calculated based on matter density fluctuations, in which the information of gravity theories is encoded. We derive two independent consistency relations that should hold in the framework of the DHOST theories and argue that such consistency relations would be useful for testing gravity theories.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by supersymmetry methods in general relativity, we study four-dimensional Lorentzian space-times with a complex Dirac spinor field satisfying a Killing-spinor-like equation where the Killing constant is promoted to a complex function. We call the resulting geometry a generalized Siklos space-time. After deriving a number of identities for complex spaces, we specialize to Lorentz signature, where we show that the Killing function must be real and that the corresponding Dirac spinor is Majorana (as long as the space-time is not conformally flat), and we obtain the local form of the metric. We show that the purely gravitational degrees of freedom correspond to waves, whereas the matter sources generically correspond, via Einstein's field equations, to a sum of pure radiation and a space-like perfect fluid. Consequently, we conclude that the physically relevant case is obtained when the Killing function is homogeneous on the wave surfaces.</description>

      <title>Two-parameter quantum groups and $R$-matrices: classical types</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct finite $R$-matrices for the first fundamental representation $V$ of two-parameter quantum groups $U_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})$ for classical $\mathfrak{g}$, both through the decomposition of $V\otimes V$ into irreducibles $U_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})$-submodules as well as by evaluating the universal $R$-matrix. The latter is crucially based on the construction of dual PBW-type bases of $U^{\pm}_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})$ consisting of the ordered products of quantum root vectors defined via $(r,s)$-bracketings and combinatorics of standard Lyndon words. We further derive explicit formulas for affine $R$-matrices, both through the Yang-Baxterization technique of [M.Ge, Y.Wu, K.Xue, "Explicit trigonometric Yang-Baxterization", Internat. J. Modern Phys. A 6 (1991), no.21, 3735-3779] and as the unique intertwiner between the tensor product of $V(u)$ and $V(v)$, viewed as modules over two-parameter quantum affine algebras $U_{r,s}(\widehat{\mathfrak{g}})$ for classical $\mathfrak{g}$. The latter generalizes the formulas of [M.Jimbo, "Quantum R matrix for the generalized Toda system", Comm. Math. Phys. 102 (1986), no. 4, 537-547] for one-parametric quantum affine algebras.</description>

      <title>Generalized Chern-Pontryagin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a new class of modified gravity models, that is, generalized four-dimensional Chern-Pontryagin models, whose action is characterized by an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar $R$ and the Chern-Pontryagin topological term ${}^*RR$, i.e., $f(R, {}^*RR)$. Within this framework, we derive the gravitational field equations and solve them for a particular model, $f(R, {}^*RR)=R+\beta ({}^*RR)^2$, considering two ansatzes: the slowly rotating metric and first-order perturbations of G\"{o}del-type metrics. For the former, we find a first-order correction to the frame-dragging effect boosted by the parameter $L$, which characterizes the departures from general relativity results. For the latter, G\"{o}del-type metrics hold unperturbed. We conclude this paper by displaying that generalized four-dimensional Chern-Pontryagin models admit a scalar-tensor representation, whose explicit form presents two scalar fields: $\Phi$, a dynamical degree of freedom, while the second, $\vartheta$, a non-dynamical degree of freedom. In particular, the scalar field $\vartheta$ emerges coupled with the Chern-Pontryagin topological term ${}^*RR$, i.e., $\vartheta {}^*RR$, which is nothing more than Chern-Simons term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a given closed two-form, we introduce the cone Yang-Mills functional which is a Yang-Mills-type functional for a pair $(A,B)$, a connection one-form $A$ and a scalar $B$ taking value in the adjoint representation of a Lie group. The functional arises naturally from dimensionally reducing the Yang-Mills functional over the fiber of a circle bundle with the two-form being the Euler class. We write down the Euler-Lagrange equations of the functional and present some of the properties of its critical solutions, especially in comparison with Yang-Mills solutions. We show that a special class of three-dimensional solutions satisfy a duality condition which generalizes the Bogomolny monopole equations. Moreover, we analyze the zero solutions of the cone Yang-Mills functional and give an algebraic classification characterizing principal bundles that carry such cone-flat solutions when the two-form is non-degenerate.</description>

      <title>Scalar probes on wormholes in Lovelock theories with unique vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:1812.02089v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new family of wormhole geometries in Lovelock theories with a unique vacuum, and study their stability under scalar field perturbations. As the solutions already known in the literature for Chern-Simons gravity on AdS, the new wormholes are characterized by a single integration constant $\rho_{0}$, that parameterizes the contribution to the mass coming from each boundary, which cancel each other, leading to a new example of "mass without mass". The stability of these new configurations, as well as other previously constructed in the literature is explored under scalar field perturbations. The stability is ensured provided the mass of the scalar perturbation is above a deformed Breitenlohner-Freedman bound which is sensitive to the value of $\rho_{0}$.</description>

      <title>The Gauge Theory of Measurement-Based Quantum Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.10098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurement-Based Quantum Computation (MBQC) is a model of quantum computation, which uses local measurements instead of unitary gates. Here we explain that the MBQC procedure has a fundamental basis in an underlying gauge theory. This perspective provides a theoretical foundation for global aspects of MBQC. The gauge transformations reflect the freedom of formulating the same MBQC computation in different local reference frames. The main identifications between MBQC and gauge theory concepts are: (i) the computational output of MBQC is a holonomy of the gauge field, (ii) the adaptation of measurement basis that remedies the inherent randomness of quantum measurements is effected by gauge transformations. The gauge theory of MBQC also plays a role in characterizing the entanglement structure of symmetry-protected topologically (SPT) ordered states, which are resources for MBQC. Our framework situates MBQC in a broader context of condensed matter and high energy theory.</description>

Abstract: The BPS spectrum of AdS/CFT exhibits multi-gravitons at low energies, while having black hole states at higher energies. This can be studied concretely in AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$ in terms of classical cohomologies, even in the quantum regimes at finite $1/N$. Recently, Chang and Lin found a threshold for non-graviton states in the $SU(2)$ maximal super-Yang-Mills theory. We explicitly construct and present this threshold cohomology.</description>

Abstract: We compute the leading (first-type Landau) singularities of a certain four-loop 7-point graph that is related to the 7-point ``ziggurat'' graph by the graphical moves familiar from equivalent circuit theory. We find perfect agreement with a subset of the ``heptagon symbol alphabet'' that has appeared in the context of planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory. The remaining heptagon symbol letters are found in its subleading Landau singularities, which we address in a companion paper.</description>

Abstract: We solve the Landau equations to find the singularities of nine three-loop 7-point graphs that arise as relaxations of the graph studied in arXiv:2211.16425. Along the way we establish that $Y{-}\Delta$ equivalence fails for certain branches of solutions to the Landau equations. We find two graphs with singularities outside the heptagon symbol alphabet; in particular they are not cluster variables of ${\rm Gr}(4,7)$. We compare maximal residues of scalar graphs exhibiting these singularities to those in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory in order to probe their cancellation from its amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Pseudo Entanglement Dynamics versus Fusion in CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fusion rules and operator product expansion (OPE) serve as crucial tools in the study of operator algebras within conformal field theory (CFT). Building upon the vision of using entanglement to explore the connections between fusion coefficients and OPE coefficients, we employ the replica method and Schmidt decomposition method to investigate the time evolution of entanglement entropy (EE) and pseudo entropy (PE) for linear combinations of operators in rational conformal field theory (RCFT). We obtain a formula that links fusion coefficients, quantum dimensions, and OPE coefficients. We also identify two definition schemes for linear combination operators. Under one scheme, the EE captures information solely for the heaviest operators, while the PE retains information for all operators, reflecting the phenomenon of pseudo entropy amplification. Irrespective of the scheme employed, the EE demonstrates a step-like evolution, illustrating the effectiveness of the quasiparticle propagation picture for the general superposition of locally excited states in RCFT. From the perspective of quasiparticle propagation, we observe spontaneous block-diagonalization of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem when quasiparticles enter the subsystem.</description>

      <title>Soft synchronous gauge in the perturbative gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An attempt to directly use the synchronous gauge ($g_{0 \lambda} = - \delta_{0 \lambda}$) in perturbative gravity leads to a singularity at $p_0 = 0$ in the graviton propagator. This is similar to the singularity in the propagator for Yang-Mills fields $A^a_\lambda$ in the temporal gauge ($A^a_0 = 0$). There the singularity was softened, obtaining this gauge as the limit at $\varepsilon \to 0$ of the gauge $n^\lambda A^a_\lambda = 0$, $n^\lambda = (1, - \varepsilon (\partial^j \partial_j )^{- 1} \partial^k ) $. Then the singularities at $p_0 = 0$ are replaced by negative powers of $p_0 \pm i \varepsilon$, and thus we bypass these poles in a certain way.
  Now consider a similar condition on $n^\lambda g_{\lambda \mu}$ in perturbative gravity, which becomes the synchronous gauge at $\varepsilon \to 0$. Unlike the Yang-Mills case, the contribution of the Faddeev-Popov ghosts to the effective action is nonzero, and we calculate it. In this calculation, an intermediate regularization is needed, and we assume the discrete structure of the theory at short distances for that. The effect of this contribution is to change the functional integral measure or, for example, to add non-pole terms to the propagator. This contribution vanishes at $\varepsilon \to 0$. Thus, we effectively have the synchronous gauge with the resolved singularities at $p_0 = 0$, where only the physical components $g_{j k}$ are active and there is no need to calculate the ghost contribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00129v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize Integration-By-Parts (IBP) and differential equations methods to de Sitter correlators related to inflation. While massive correlators in de Sitter spacetime are usually regarded as highly intricate, we find they have remarkably hidden concise structures from the perspective of IBP. We find the factorization of the IBP relations of each vertex integral family corresponding to $\mathrm{d} \tau_i$ integration. Furthermore, with a smart construction of master integrals, the universal formulas for iterative reduction and $\mathrm{d} \log$-form differential equations of arbitrary vertex integral family are presented and proved. These formulas dominate all tree-level de Sitter correlators and play a kernel role at the loop-level as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We relate the Lounesto classification of regular and singular spinors to the orbits of the $Spin(3,1)$ group in the space of Dirac spinors. We find that regular spinors are associated with the principal orbits of the spin group while singular spinors are associated with special orbits whose isotropy group is $C$. We use this to clarify some aspects of the classical and quantum theory of spinors restricted to a class in this classification. In particular, we show that the degrees of freedom of an ELKO field, which has been proposed as a candidate for dark matter, can be reexpressed as a Dirac field preserving locality. Alternatively after introducing the ELKO dual, it can be re-interpreted as four anticommuting Lorentz scalar fields with internal symmetry the spin representation of the Lorentz group. We also propose an interacting Lagrangian which can consistently describe all 6 classes of regular and singular spinors.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the topological numbers of rotating charged AdS black holes in both four- and five-dimensional gauged supergravity theories. Our analysis is conducted within the framework of the thermodynamical topological approach to black holes, utilizing the generalized off-shell Helmholtz free energy. We demonstrate that the number of rotation parameters plays a significant role in determining the topological numbers of five-dimensional rotating AdS black holes. Moreover, our findings indicate that the topological numbers of both four- and five-dimensional rotating AdS black holes are not influenced by the number of electric charge parameters. This highlights a distinct difference in how rotation and electric charge parameters impact the thermodynamic topological properties of these black holes.</description>

Abstract: Boundary effects play an interesting role in finite-size physical systems. In this work, we study the boundary-induced properties of 1+1-dimensional critical systems driven by inhomogeneous M\"obius-like quenches. We focus on the entanglement entropy in BCFTs with a large central charge and a sparse spectrum of low-dimensional operators. We find that the choice of boundary conditions leads to different scenarios of dynamical phase transitions. We also derive these results in a holographic description in terms of intersecting branes in AdS$_3$, and find a precise match.</description>

Abstract: We catalog all the electromagnetic-like dualities that exist between free dynamical bosonic fields of arbitrary symmetry type and mass on (anti-) de Sitter space in all dimensions, including dualities among the partially massless and shift symmetric fields. This generalizes to all these field types the well known fact that a massless $p$-form is dual to a massless $(D-p-2)$-form in $D$ spacetime dimensions. In the process, we describe the structure of the Weyl modules (the spaces of local operators linear in the fields and their derivative relations) for all the massive, partially massless and shift symmetric fields.</description>

      <title>Braiding Fibonacci anyons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fibonacci anyons provide the simplest possible model of non-Abelian fusion rules: [1] x [1] = [0] + [1]. We propose a conformal field theory construction of topological quantum registers based on Fibonacci anyons realized as quasiparticle excitations in the Z_3 parafermion fractional quantum Hall state. To this end, the results of Ardonne and Schoutens for the correlation function of n = 4 Fibonacci fields are extended to the case of arbitrary n (and 3 r electrons). Special attention is paid to the braiding properties of the obtained correlators. We explain in details the construction of a monodromy representation of the Artin braid group acting on n-point conformal blocks of Fibonacci anyons. For low n (up to n = 8), the matrices of braid group generators are displayed explicitly. A simple recursion formula makes it possible to extend without efforts the construction to any n. Finally, we construct N qubit computational spaces in terms of conformal blocks of 2N + 2 Fibonacci anyons.</description>

      <title>Higher-curvature gravity in AdS$_3$, holographic $c$-theorems and black hole microstates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct higher-derivative gravity theories in three dimensions that admit holographic $c$-theorems and exhibit a unique maximally symmetric vacuum, at arbitrary order $n$ in the curvature. We show that these theories exhibit special properties, the most salient ones being the decoupling of ghost modes around Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, the enhancement of symmetries at linearized level, and the existence of a one-parameter generalization of the Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole that, while being asymptotically AdS, is not of constant curvature but rather exhibits a curvature singularity. For such black holes, we provide a holographic derivation of their thermodynamics. This gives a microscopic picture of black hole thermodynamics for non-supersymmetric solutions, of non-constant curvature in higher-derivative theories of arbitrary order in the curvature.</description>

      <title>Covariant operator formalism for higher derivative systems: Vector spin-$0$ dual model as a prelude to generalized QED$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we extend the Kugo-Ojima-Nakanishi covariant operator formalism to quantize two higher derivative systems, considering their extended phase space structures. More specifically, the one describing spin-$0$ particles by a vector field and the generalized electrodynamics. We investigate the commutator structure of these theories and present the definition of their physical Hilbert subspaces. Remarkably, the correspondence principle demands a higher derivative structure for the auxiliary field Lagrangian. The first model presents a reducible gauge symmetry implying the necessity of two sets of auxiliary fields. The massless limit is also carefully analyzed. For the case of the generalized QED$_4$, we derive a set of suitable definitions for the physical Hilbert subspace to eliminate contributions from spurious modes and the problematic negative norm transverse excitations. However, preliminary discussions on the interacting regime are also developed to show that, in this case, the states with transverse ghost modes can be produced from ghost-free initial ones, meaning that they cannot be decoupled. Additionally, we reveal the very source of renormalization improvements in these kinds of theories and also establish a suitable specific interacting model compatible with a time-invariant positive norm subspace.</description>

      <title>An Infinite Family of Integrable Sigma Models Using Auxiliary Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of sigma models in two spacetime dimensions which are parameterized by an interaction function of one real variable. In addition to the physical group-valued field $g$, these models include an auxiliary vector field $v_\alpha$ which mediates interactions in a prescribed way. We prove that every model in this family is weakly integrable, in the sense that the classical equations of motion are equivalent to flatness of a Lax connection for any value of a spectral parameter. We also show that these models are strongly integrable, in the sense that the Poisson bracket of the Lax connection takes the Maillet form, which guarantees the existence of an infinite set of conserved charges in involution. This class of theories includes the principal chiral model (PCM) and all deformations of the PCM by functions of the energy-momentum tensor, such as $T \overline{T}$ and root-$T \overline{T}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that a complex coordinate transformation maps the Taub-NUT instanton metric to a Kerr-Schild metric. This metric involves a semi-infinite line defect as a gravitational analog of the Dirac string, much like the original metric. Also, it corresponds to self-dual dyon in electromagnetism through three versions of classical double copy, one of them being a novel nonlocal operator form. The relevance to Newman-Janis algorithm is briefly noted.</description>

      <title>AdS/CFT correspondence for the $O(N)$ invariant critical $\varphi^4$ model in 3-dimensions by the conformal smearing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a structure of a 4-dimensional bulk space constructed from the $O(N)$ invariant critical $\varphi^4$ model in 3-dimension using the conformal smearing. We calculate a bulk metric corresponding to the information metric and the bulk-to-boundary propagator for a composite scalar field $\varphi^2$ in the large $N$ expansion. We show that the bulk metric describes an asymptotic AdS space at both UV (near boundary) and IR (deep in the bulk) limits, which correspond to the asymptotic free UV fixed point and the Wilson-Fischer IR fixed point of the 3-dimensional $\varphi^4$ model, respectively. The bulk-to-boundary scalar propagator, on the other hand, encodes $\Delta_{\varphi^2}$ (the conformal dimension of $\varphi^2$) into its $z$ (a coordinate in the extra direction of the AdS space) dependence. Namely it correctly reproduces not only $\Delta_{\varphi^2}=1$ at UV fixed point but also $\Delta_{\varphi^2}=2$ at the IR fixed point for the boundary theory. Moreover, we confirm consistency with the GKP-Witten relation in the interacting theory that the coefficient of the $z^{\Delta_{\varphi^2}}$ term in $z\to 0$ limit agrees exactly with the two-point function of $\varphi^2$ including an effect of the $\varphi^4$ interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elko is a spin-half fermion with a two-fold Wigner degeneracy and Klein-Gordon dynamics. In this paper, we show that in a spatially flat FLRW space-time, slow-roll inflation can be initiated by the homogeneous Elko fields. The inflaton is a composite scalar field obtained by contracting the spinor field with its dual. This is possible because the background evolution as described by the Friedmann equation is completely determined by the scalar field. This approach has the advantage that we do not need to specify the initial conditions for every component of the spinor fields. We derive the equation of motion for the inflaton and also show that this solution is an attractor.</description>

      <title>A study of three butterflies: entanglement wedge method, OTOC and pole-skipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate two salient chaotic features, namely Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, in the context of an asymptotically Lifshitz black hole background with an arbitrary critical exponent. These features are computed using three methods: entanglement wedge method, out-of-time-ordered correlator computation and pole-skipping. We present a comparative study of the aforementioned features where all of these methods yield exactly similar results for the butterfly velocity and Lyapunov exponent. This establishes an equivalence between all three methods for probing chaos in the chosen gravity background. Furthermore, we evaluate the chaos at the classical level by computing the eikonal phase and Lyapunov exponent from the bulk gravity. These quantities emerge as nontrivial functions of the anisotropy index. By examining the classical eikonal phase, we uncover different scattering scenarios in the near-horizon and near-boundary regimes. We also discuss potential limitations regarding the choice of the turning point of the null geodesic in our approach.</description>

Abstract: Quantum information can provide a lens for characterizing the operational implications of spacetime physics. A well-known result in this area is that quantum entanglement is degraded in the vicinity of a black hole. This result treats the black hole and its spacetime as classical. But what if these were to be treated quantum-mechanically? Here, we show that quantum coherence in black hole, and thus spacetime, degrees of freedom can limit the degradation of entanglement, thereby improving the performance of nearby quantum communication protocols. This finding indicates that quantum features of spacetime could serve as resources for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Extremal Black Holes as Relativistic Systems with Kepler Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of gravitational waves emanating from inspiralling black hole binaries has triggered a renewed interest in the dynamics of relativistic two-body systems. The conservative part of the latter are given by Hamiltonian systems obtained from so called post-Newtonian expansions of the general relativistic description of black hole binaries. In this paper we study the general question of whether there exist relativistic binaries that display Kepler-like dynamics with elliptical orbits. We show that an orbital equivalence to the Kepler problem indeed exists for relativistic systems with a Hamiltonian of a Kepler-like form. This form is realised by extremal black holes with electric charge and scalar hair to at least first order in the post-Newtonian expansion for arbitrary mass ratios and to all orders in the post-Newtonian expansion in the test-mass limit of the binary. Moreover, to fifth post-Newtonian order, we show that Hamiltonians of the Kepler-like form can be related explicitly through a canonical transformation and time reparametrization to the Kepler problem, and that all Hamiltonians conserving a Laplace-Runge-Lenz-like vector are related in this way to Kepler.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scattering amplitudes involving multiple partons are plagued with infrared singularities. The soft singularities of the amplitude are captured by the soft function which is defined as the vacuum expectation value of Wilson line correlators. Renormalization properties of soft function allows us to write it as an exponential of the finite soft anomalous dimension. An efficient way to study the soft function is through a set of Feynman diagrams known as Cwebs (webs). We present the mixing matrices and exponentiated colour factors (ECFs) for the Cwebs at five loops that connect six Wilson lines, except those that are related by relabeling of Wilson lines. Further, we express these ECFs in terms of 29 basis colour factors. We also find that this basis can be categorized into two colour structures. Our results are the first key ingredients for the calculation of the soft anomalous dimension at five loops.</description>

      <title>Fate of homogeneous $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric scalar condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter, if represented by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric scalar field, can manifest as both particles and condensates. In this paper, we study the evolution of an oscillating homogeneous condensate of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric scalar field in a thermal plasma in an FLRW universe. We focus on the perturbative regime where the oscillation amplitude is sufficiently small so that parametric resonance is inefficient. This perturbative regime necessarily comprises the late stage of the condensate decay and determines its fate. The coupled coarse-grained equations of motion for the condensate, radiation, and spacetime are derived from first principles using nonequilibrium quantum field theory. We obtain analytical expressions for the relevant microscopic quantities that enter the equations of motion and solve the latter numerically. We find that there is always a nonvanishing relic abundance for a condensate with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that is not spontaneously broken. This is because its decay rate decreases faster than the Hubble parameter at late times due to either the amplitude dependence or the temperature dependence in the condensate decay rate. Consequently, accounting for the condensate contribution to the overall dark matter relic density is essential for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ scalar singlet dark matter.</description>

      <title>Schwinger mechanism of magnon-antimagnon pair production on magnetic field inhomogeneities and the bosonic Klein effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective field theory of low-energy exitations-magnons that describes antiferromagnets is mapped into scalar electrodynamics of a charged scalar field interacting with an external electromagnetic potential. In the presence of a constant inhomogeneous external magnetic field the latter problem is technically reduced to the problem of charged-particle creation from the vacuum by an electric potential step (x step). Magnetic moment plays here the role of the electric charge, and magnons and antimagnons differ from each other in the sign of the magnetic moment. In the framework of such a consideration, it is important to take into account the vacuum instability (the Schwinger effect) under the magnon-antimagnon production on magnetic field inhomogeneities (an analog of pair creation from the vacuum by electric-like fields). We demonstrate how to use the strong field QED with x steps developed by the authors (SPG and DMG) to study the magnon-antimagnon pair production on magnetic field inhomogeneities. Characteristics of the vacuum instability obtained for some magnetic steps that allows exact solving the Klein-Gordon equation are presented. In particular, we consider examples of magnetic steps with very sharp field derivatives that correspond to a regularization of the Klein step. In the case of smooth-gradient steps, we describe an universal behavior of the flux density of created magnon pairs. We also note that since the low-energy magnons are bosons with small effective mass, then for the first time maybe the opportunity will arise to observe the Schwinger effect in the case of the Bose statistics, in particular, the bosonic Klein effect in laboratory conditions. Moreover, it turns out that in the case of the Bose statistics appears a new mechanism for amplifying the effect of the pair creation, which we call statistically assisted Schwinger effect.</description>

      <title>Scattering Amplitudes of Massive Spin-2 Kaluza-Klein States with Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00770v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of the scattering of matter and gravitational Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes in five-dimensional gravity theories. We consider matter localized on a brane as well as in the bulk of the extra dimension for scalars, fermions and vectors respectively, and consider an arbitrary warped background. While naive power-counting suggests that there are amplitudes which grow as fast as ${\cal O}(s^3)$ [where $s$ is the center-of-mass scattering energy-squared], we demonstrate that cancellations between the various contributions result in a total amplitude which grows no faster than ${\cal O}(s)$. Extending previous work on the self-interactions of the gravitational KK modes, we show that these cancellations occur due to sum-rule relations between the couplings and the masses of the modes that can be proven from the properties of the mode equations describing the gravity and matter wavefunctions. We demonstrate that these properties are tied to the underlying diffeomorphism invariance of the five-dimensional theory. We discuss how our results generalize when the size of the extra dimension is stabilized via the Goldberger-Wise mechanism. Our conclusions are of particular relevance for freeze-out and freeze-in relic abundance calculations for dark matter models including a spin-2 portal arising from an underlying five-dimensional theory.</description>

Abstract: We propose the representation principle to study physical systems with a given symmetry. In the context of symmetry enriched topological orders, we give the appropriate representation category, the category of SET orders. For fusion n-category symmetries, we show that the category of SET orders encodes almost all information about the interplay between symmetry and topological orders, in a natural and canonical way. These information include defects and boundaries of SET orders, symmetry charges, explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking, stacking of SET orders, gauging of generalized symmetry, as well as quantum currents (SymTFT or symmetry TO). We also provide a detailed categorical algorithm to compute the generalized gauging. In particular, we proved that gauging is always reversible, as a special type of Morita-equivalence. The explicit data for ungauging, the inverse to gauging, is given.</description>

      <title>Action of the axial $U(1)$ non-invertible symmetry on the 't~Hooft line operator: A lattice gauge theory study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how the symmetry operator of the axial $U(1)$ non-invertible symmetry acts on the 't~Hooft line operator in the $U(1)$ gauge theory by employing the modified Villain-type lattice formulation. We model the axial anomaly by a compact scalar boson, the ``QED axion''. For the gauge invariance, the simple 't~Hooft line operator, which is defined by a line integral of the dual $U(1)$ gauge potential, must be ``dressed'' by the scalar and $U(1)$ gauge fields. A careful consideration on the basis of the anomalous Ward--Takahashi identity containing the 't~Hooft operator with the dressing factor and a precise definition of the symmetry operator on the lattice shows that the symmetry operator leaves no effect when it sweeps out a 't~Hooft loop operator. This result appears inequivalent with the phenomenon concluded in the continuum theory. In an appendix, we demonstrate that the half-space gauging of the magnetic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 1-form symmetry, when formulated in an appropriate lattice framework, leads to the same conclusion as above. A similar result is obtained for the axion string operator.</description>

      <title>Impact of Star Pressure on $\gamma$ in Modified Gravity beyond Post-Newtonian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00094v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a concrete example exhibiting marked deviation from the PPN approximation in a modified theory of gravity. Specifically, we derive the exact formula for the Robertson parameter $\gamma$ in Brans-Dicke gravity for compact mass sources, explicitly incorporating the pressure content of these sources. We achieve this by exploiting the $\textit integrability$ of the 00-component of the Brans-Dicke field equation. In place of the conventional PPN result $\gamma_{PPN}=\frac{\omega+1}{\omega+2}$, we obtain the analytical expression $\gamma_{\,exact}=\frac{\omega+1+(\omega+2)\varTheta}{\omega+2+(\omega+1)\varTheta}$ where $\varTheta$ is the ratio of the total pressure $P_\parallel^*+2P_\perp^*$ and total energy $E^*$ contained within the mass source. Our $\textit non\text{-}perturbative$ formula is valid for all field strengths and types of matter comprising the mass source. We draw four key conclusions: (1) The usual $\gamma_{PPN}$ formula is violated in the presence of pressure, viz. when $\varTheta\neq0$, revealing a limitation of the PPN approximation in Brans-Dicke gravity. (2) The PPN result mainly stems from the assumption of pressureless matter. Even in the weak-field star case, non-zero pressure leads to a violation of the PPN $\gamma$ formula. Conversely, the PPN result is a good approximation for low-pressure matter, i.e. when $\varTheta\approx0$, for all field strengths. (3) Observational constraints on $\gamma$ set $\textit joint$ bounds on $\omega$ and $\varTheta$, with the latter representing a global characteristic of a mass source. If the equation of state of matter in the mass source approaches the ultra-relativistic form, entailing $\varTheta\simeq1$, $\gamma_{\,exact}$ converges to 1 $\textit irrespective$ of $\omega$. (4) In a broader context, our findings indicate the latent significance of considering the interior structure of stars in observational astronomy.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on degeneracy of non-canonical inflation driven by quartic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, the quartic inflationary potential $V(\phi)=\frac{\lambda}{4}\phi^4$ in non-canonical framework with a power-law Lagrangian is investigated. We demonstrate that the predictions of this potential in non-canonical framework align with the observational data of Planck 2018. We determine how the predictions of the model vary with changes in the non-canonical parameter $\alpha$ and the number of $e$-folds $N$. The sound speed, non-Gaussianity parameter, scalar spectral index, and tensor-to-scalar ratio are all influenced by $\alpha$. However, the scalar spectral index exhibits degeneracy with respect to changes in $\alpha$. It is found that, this degeneracy does not break through reheating consideration. But the length of the reheating epoch constrains the length of the inflation period and the value of $\alpha$. Therefore, we investigate relic gravitational waves (GWs) and show that, the degeneracy of the model with respect to the $\alpha$ parameter can be broken using the relic GWs. Additionally, the density of relic GWs falls within the sensitivity range of GWs detectors for the specific $e$-folds number between 55 and 55.7.</description>

      <title>Topological susceptibility and axion potential in two-flavor superconductive quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the potential of the axion, $a$, of Quantum Chromodynamics, in the two-flavor color superconducting phase of cold and dense quark matter. We adopt a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-like model. Our interaction contains two terms, one preserving and one breaking the $U(1)_A$ symmetry: the latter is responsible of the coupling of axions to quarks. We introduce two quark condensates, $h_L$ and $h_R$, describing condensation for left-handed and right-handed quarks respectively; we then study the loci of the minima of the thermodynamic potential, $\Omega$, in the $(h_L,h_R)$ plane, noticing how the instanton-induced interaction favors condensation in the scalar channel when the $\theta-$angle, $\theta=a/f_a$, vanishes. Increasing $\theta$ we find a phase transition where the scalar condensate rotates into a pseudo-scalar one. We present an analytical result for the topological susceptibility, $\chi$, in the superconductive phase, which stands both at zero and at finite temperature. Finally, we compute the axion mass and its self-coupling. In particular, the axion mass $m_a$ is related to the full topological susceptibility via $\chi=m_a^2 f_a^2$, hence our result for $\chi$ gives an analytical result for $m_a$ in the superconductive phase of high-density Quantum Chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics on a noncommutative plane through the lens of deformation quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A gauge invariant mathematical formalism based on deformation quantization is outlined to model an $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric system of a spin $1/2$ charged particle placed in a nocommutative plane under the influence of a vertical uniform magnetic field. The noncommutative involutive algebra $(C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{2})[[\vartheta]],*^r)$ of formal power series in $\vartheta$ with coefficients in the commutative ring $C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{2})$ was employed to construct the relevant observables, viz., SUSY Hamiltonian $H$, supercharge operator $Q$ and its adjoint $Q^{\dag}$ all belonging to the $2\times 2$ matrix algebra $\mathcal{M}_{2}(C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{2})[[\vartheta]],*^r)$ with the help of a family of gauge-equivalent star products $*^{r}$. The energy eigenvalues of the SUSY Hamiltonian all turned out to be independent of not only the gauge parameter $r$ but also the noncommutativity parameter $\vartheta$. The nontrivial Fermionic ground state was subsequently computed associated with the zero energy which indicates that supersymmetry remains unbroken in all orders of $\vartheta$. The Witten index for the noncommutative SUSY Landau problem turns out to be $-1$ corroborating the fact that there is no broken supersymmetry for the model we are considering.</description>

      <title>Healthy Horndeski cosmologies with torsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the full Horndeski theory with both curvature and torsion can support nonsingular, stable and subluminal cosmological solutions at all times. Thus, with torsion, the usual No-Go theorem that holds in a curved spacetime is avoided. In particular, it is essential to include the nonminimal derivative couplings of the $\mathcal{L}_{5}$ part of the Horndeski action ($G^{\mu\nu}\,\nabla_\mu \nabla_\nu \phi,$ and $(\nabla^2 \phi)^3$). Without the latter a No-Go already impedes the eternal subluminality of nonsingular, stable cosmologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10287v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we discuss the effect of light, non-gauge, bosonic degrees of freedom on the exterior spacetime of an exotic compact object. We show that such fields generically introduce large deviations from black hole spacetimes of General Relativity near and outside the surfaces of ultra-compact exotic objects unless one assumes they totally decouple from the standard model or new heavy fields. Hence, using black hole spacetimes of General Relativity to model ultra-compact exotic objects and their perturbations relies implicitly on this assumption or on the absence of such fields.</description>

      <title>Spin-independent interactions of Dirac Fermionic Dark Matter in the composite Higgs models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to recent measurements, dark matter magnetic dipole moment is strongly constrained. In the composite Higgs models the magnetic dipole moment of the Dirac dark matter fermion and its mass can be suppressed by the approximate U(1) symmetry. We consider E_6 inspired composite Higgs model (E_6CHM) with U(1) symmetry violating operators, which give rise to dark matter's mass and coupling constant to Higgs boson. The dependence of the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section on the E_6CHM parameters is explored. We argue that there are regions of the parameter space which are still safe from all current constraints and may lead to spectacular LHC signatures.</description>

      <title>Gauging modulated symmetries: Kramers-Wannier dualities and non-invertible reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modulated symmetries are internal symmetries that act in a non-uniform, spatially modulated way and are generalizations of, for example, dipole symmetries. In this paper, we systematically study the gauging of finite Abelian modulated symmetries in ${1+1}$ dimensions. Working with local Hamiltonians of spin chains, we explore the dual symmetries after gauging and their potential new spatial modulations. We establish sufficient conditions for the existence of an isomorphism between the modulated symmetries and their dual, naturally implemented by lattice reflections. For instance, in systems of prime qudits, translation invariance guarantees this isomorphism. For non-prime qudits, we show using techniques from ring theory that this isomorphism can also exist, although it is not guaranteed by lattice translation symmetry alone. From this isomorphism, we identify new Kramers-Wannier dualities and construct related non-invertible reflection symmetry operators using sequential quantum circuits. Notably, this non-invertible reflection symmetry exists even when the system lacks ordinary reflection symmetry. Throughout the paper, we illustrate these results using various simple toy models.</description>

Abstract: We give a mathematical definition of some path integrals, emphasizing those relevant to the quantization of symplectic manifolds (and more generally, Poisson manifolds) $\unicode{x2013}$ in particular, the coherent state path integral. We show that K\"{a}hler manifolds provide many computable examples and we emphasize those whose Bergman kernel is constant along the diagonal.</description>

      <title>Canonical quantization of the dark Dirac field and time asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform canonical quantization of the single-component, spin-zero field that was introduced by Dirac in 1971 and recently suggested as a candidate for dark matter by Bogomolny. The massive and massless cases are treated separately. Since in the massive case only positive-frequency modes are normalizable and regarded as physical, the mode expansion for the field involves annihilation operators only, making the quantization procedure particularly simple. The corresponding Hamiltonian turns out to be unambiguous, with no need for normal ordering. The positive-energy requirement imposed on the second-quantized system leads to equally acceptable Bose and Fermi choices for particle statistics. This suggests supersymmetric extension of original Dirac's theory in which Bose and Fermi single-component positive-energy Dirac fields are combined into a doublet whose members can transform into each other. Our model includes a Landau-Anderson-Higgs type potential which allows spontaneous selection of the universe with a given bose-to-fermi ratio of the positive-energy Dirac particles. The bosonic sector of proposed extension hints at the possibility of a dark, background Bose-Einstein condensate that endows the universe with its cosmological temporal asymmetry. In the massless case of Dirac's original theory, we explore the possibility of allowing the field expansion to involve both positive- and negative-frequency modes. This leads to the anticommutation relations for creation and annihilation operators associated with the negative energy solutions, resulting in supersymmetric behavior of the single-component field in the ultrarelativistic limit. Finally, we speculate on the possibility for the positive-energy Dirac particles to obey some exotic (such as non-abelian, Clifford) statistics in which the particles are neither created nor destroyed.</description>

      <title>Space-time symmetry breaking on non-geodesic leaves and a new form of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the permanent damage caused by the historical breakdown of full diffeomorphism invariance induced by a foliation. We focus on the case where the foliation is allowed to be non-geodesic after the interactions with the foliation switch off. Gravity and other forms of matter recover full diffeomorphism invariance only at the expense of introducing a new matter-like component, carrying the non-vanishing Hamiltonian (and momentum, as it turns out) left over from the violating past interactions. This matter form must be stress-free in the preferred frame; this is the only way a matter action can mimic the evolution of the leftover Hamiltonian (and momentum) driven by the Dirac hypersurface deformation algebra. Hence, if the preferred frame is non-geodesic, the equivalent matter component must have energy and a momentum current in this frame, but still no spatial stresses: an unusual form of "matter". It is equivalent to a fluid with anisotropic stress in some regimes, reducing to dust in others, or even displaying completely new features in extreme situations. Its stress energy tensor is conserved. We provide two examples based on accelerated frames: Rindler space-time and the canonical Schwarzchild frame.</description>

      <title>Insights into Gravitinos Abundance, Cosmic Strings and Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate D-term inflation within the framework of supergravity, employing the minimal Kahler potential. Our study reveals that this model can overcome the {\eta}-problem found in F-term models. Additionally, we explore reheating dynamics and gravitino production, emphasizing the interplay between reheating temperature, spectral index, and gravitino abundance. Our analysis indicates that gravitino production is sensitive to the equation of state during reheating, affecting the reheating temperature and subsequent dark matter relic density. Perturbation theory reveals that Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs) evolve according to second-order effects arising from first-order curvature perturbations. In fact, the spectral energy density of these waves is particularly relevant to Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations. Furthermore, we analyze gravitational waves generated by cosmic strings, providing critical constraints on early Universe dynamics and cosmic string properties. The dimensionless string tension significantly influences the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by cosmic strings post-inflation. Finally, the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by cosmic strings is influenced by the energy scales of inflation and string formation.</description>
