      <title>Efficient Synthesis for Two-Dimensional Strand Arrays with Row Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the theoretical problem of synthesizing multiple DNA strands under spatial constraints, motivated by large-scale DNA synthesis technologies. In this setting, strands are arranged in an array and synthesized according to a fixed global synthesis sequence, with the restriction that at most one strand per row may be synthesized in any synthesis cycle. We focus on the basic case of two strands in a single row and analyze the expected completion time under this row-constrained model. By decomposing the process into a Markov chain, we derive analytical upper and lower bounds on the expected synthesis time. We show that a simple laggard-first policy achieves an asymptotic expected completion time of (q+3)L/2 for any alphabet of size q, and that no online policy without look-ahead can asymptotically outperform this bound. For the binary case, we show that allowing a single-symbol look-ahead strictly improves performance, yielding an asymptotic expected completion time of 7L/3. Finally, we present a dynamic programming algorithm that computes the optimal offline schedule for any fixed pair of sequences. Together, these results provide the first analytical bounds for synthesis under spatial constraints and lay the groundwork for future studies of optimal synthesis policies in such settings.</description>

      <title>Distributed Detection under Stringent Resource Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper identifies the Stein-exponent of distributed detection when the sensor communicates to the decision center over a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) subject to one of three stringent communication constraints: 1) The number of channel uses of the DMC grows sublinearly in the number of source observations n; 2) The number of channel uses is n but a block-input cost constraint is imposed almost surely, which grows sublinearly in n; 3) The block-input constraint is imposed only on expectation. We identify a dichotomy in the Stein-exponent of all these setups depending on the structure of the DMC's transition law. Under any of these three constraints, when the DMC is partially-connected (i.e., some outputs cannot be induced by certain inputs) the Stein-exponent matches the exponent identified by Han and Kobayashi and by Shalaby and Papamarcou for the scenario where communication is of zero-rate but over a noiseless link. We prove our result by adapting Han's zero-rate coding strategy to partially-connected DMCs.
  In contrast, for fully-connected DMCs, in our scenarios 1) and 2) the Stein-exponent collapses to that of a local test at the decision center, rendering the remote sensor and communication useless. %To prove this result, we propose new converse proofs relying on change of measure arguments.
  In scenario 3), the sensor remains beneficial even for fully-connected DMCs, however also collapses compared to the case of a partially-connected DMC. Moreover, the Stein-exponent is larger when the expectation constraint is imposed only under the null hypothesis compared to when it is imposed under both hypotheses. To prove these results, we propose both new coding strategies and new converse proofs.</description>

      <title>The many faces of multivariate information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting higher-order structures from multivariate data has become an area of intensive study in complex systems science, as these multipartite interactions can reveal insights into fundamental features of complex systems like emergent phenomena. Information theory provides a natural language for exploring these interactions, as it elegantly formalizes the problem of comparing ``wholes" and ``parts" using joint, conditional, and marginal entropies. A large number of distinct statistics have been developed over the years, all aiming to capture different aspects of ``higher-order" information sharing. Here, we show that three of them (the dual total correlation, S-information, and O-information) are special cases of a more general function, $\Delta^{k}$ which is parameterized by a free parameter $k$. For different values of $k$, we recover different measures: $\Delta^{0}$ is equal to the S-information, $\Delta^{1}$ is equal to the dual total correlation, and $\Delta^{2}$ is equal to the negative O-information. Generally, the $\Delta^{k}$ function is arranged into a hierarchy of increasingly high-order synergies; for a given value of $k$, if $\Delta^{k}&gt;0$, then the system is dominated by interactions with order greater than $k$, while if $\Delta^{k}&lt;0$, then the system is dominated by interactions with order lower than $k$. $\Delta^{k}=0$ if the system is composed entirely of synergies of order-k. Using the entropic conjugation framework, we also find that the conjugate of $\Delta^{k}$, which we term $\Gamma^{k}$ is arranged into a similar hierarchy of increasingly high-order redundancies. These results provide new insights into the nature of both higher-order redundant and synergistic interactions, and helps unify the existing zoo of measures into a more coherent structure.</description>

      <title>Cardinality-consistent flag codes with longer type vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flag codes generalize constant dimension codes by considering sequences of nested subspaces with prescribed dimensions as codewords. A comprehensive construction, which unites cyclic orbit flag codes, yields two families of flag codes on $\mathbb{F}^n_q$ (where $n=sk+h$ with $s\geq 2$ and $0\leq h &lt; k$): optimum distance flag codes of the longest possible type vector $(1, 2, \ldots, k, n-k, \ldots, n-1)$ and flag codes with longer type vectors $(1, 2, \ldots, k+h, 2k+h, \ldots, (s-2)k+h, n-k, \ldots, n-1)$. These flag codes achieve the same cardinality $\sum^{s-1}_{i=1}q^{ik+h}+1$.</description>

      <title>From Antenna Abundance to Antenna Intelligence in 6G Gigantic MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current cellular systems achieve high spectral efficiency through Massive MIMO, which leverages an abundance of antennas to create favorable propagation conditions for multiuser spatial multiplexing. Looking towards future networks, the extrapolation of this paradigm leads to systems with many hundreds of antennas per base station, raising concerns regarding hardware complexity, cost, and power consumption. This article suggests more intelligent array designs that reduce the need for excessive antenna numbers. We revisit classical uniform array design principles and explain how their uniform spatial sampling leads to unnecessary redundancies in practical deployment scenarios. By exploiting non-uniform sparse arrays with site-specific antenna placements -- based on either pre-optimized irregular arrays or real-time movable antennas -- we demonstrate how superior multiuser MIMO performance can be achieved with far fewer antennas. These principles are inspired by previous works on wireless localization. We explain and demonstrate numerically how these concepts can be adapted for communications to improve the average sum rate and similar metrics. The results suggest a paradigm shift for future antenna array design, where antenna intelligence replaces sheer antenna count. This opens new opportunities for efficient, adaptable, and sustainable Gigantic MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna for Integrating Near-field Channel Estimation and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) introduces a new degree of freedom for future wireless communication systems by enabling the adaptive adjustment of antenna positions. Its large-range movement renders wireless channels transmission into the near-field region, which brings new performance enhancement for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). This paper proposes a novel multi-stage design framework for broadband near-field ISAC assisted by MA. The framework first divides the MA movement area into multiple subregions, and employs the Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm (NOMP) to achieve high-precision angle estimation in each subregion. Subsequently, a method called near-field localization via subregion ray clustering (LSRC) is proposed for identifying the positions of scatterers. This method finds the coordinates of each scatterer by jointly processing the angle estimates across all subregions. Finally, according to the estimated locations of the scatterers, the near-field channel estimation (CE) is refined for improving communication performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly enhance MA sensing accuracy and CE, providing an efficient solution for MA-aided near-field ISAC.</description>

      <title>On the Generalization Error of Differentially Private Algorithms Via Typicality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generalization error of stochastic learning algorithms from an information-theoretic perspective, with a particular emphasis on deriving sharper bounds for differentially private algorithms. It is well known that the generalization error of stochastic learning algorithms can be bounded in terms of mutual information and maximal leakage, yielding in-expectation and high-probability guarantees, respectively. In this work, we further upper bound mutual information and maximal leakage by explicit, easily computable formulas, using typicality-based arguments and exploiting the stability properties of private algorithms. In the first part of the paper, we strictly improve the mutual-information bounds by Rodr\'iguez-G\'alvez et al. (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2021). In the second part, we derive new upper bounds on the maximal leakage of learning algorithms. In both cases, the resulting bounds on information measures translate directly into generalization error guarantees.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Algorithm to Sample Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to sample random sparse matrices to be used as check matrices for quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. To ease the treatment, we mainly describe our algorithm as a technique to sample a dual-containing binary LDPC code, hence, a sparse matrix $\mathbf H\in\mathbb F_2^{r\times n}$ such that $\mathbf H\mathbf H^\top = \mathbf 0$. However, as we show, the algorithm can be easily generalized to sample dual-containing LDPC codes over non binary finite fields as well as more general quantum stabilizer LDPC codes.
  While several constructions already exist, all of them are somewhat algebraic as they impose some specific property (e.g., the matrix being quasi-cyclic). Instead, our algorithm is purely combinatorial as we do not require anything apart from the rows of $\mathbf H$ being sparse enough. In this sense, we can think of our algorithm as a way to sample sparse, self-orthogonal matrices that are as random as possible.
  Our algorithm is conceptually very simple and, as a key ingredient, uses Information Set Decoding (ISD) to sample the rows of $\mathbf H$, one at a time. The use of ISD is fundamental as, without it, efficient sampling would not be feasible. We give a theoretical characterization of our algorithm, determining which ranges of parameters can be sampled as well as the expected computational complexity. Numerical simulations and benchmarks confirm the feasibility and efficiency of our approach.</description>

      <title>Distribution Estimation with Side Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the classical problem of discrete distribution estimation using i.i.d. samples in a novel scenario where additional side information is available on the distribution. In large alphabet datasets such as text corpora, such side information arises naturally through word semantics/similarities that can be inferred by closeness of vector word embeddings, for instance. We consider two specific models for side information--a local model where the unknown distribution is in the neighborhood of a known distribution, and a partial ordering model where the alphabet is partitioned into known higher and lower probability sets. In both models, we theoretically characterize the improvement in a suitable squared-error risk because of the available side information. Simulations over natural language and synthetic data illustrate these gains.</description>

      <title>On the Optimality of Decode and Forward for Some Cooperative Broadcast Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article characterizes new boundary points on the capacity region of certain classes of more capable broadcast channels (BC) with uni-directional cooperation from the stronger to the weaker receiver. The new boundary points are achieved by a simple coding scheme that employs superposition coding at the transmitter with decode and forward at the stronger receiver. We evaluate our general result for Gaussian BCs and for a BC consisting of a binary erasure channel (BEC) to the stronger receiver and a binary symmetric channel (BSC) to the weaker receiver.</description>

      <title>Quantum CSS LDPC Codes based on Dyadic Matrices for Belief Propagation-based Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes provide a practical balance between error-correction capability and implementation complexity in quantum error correction (QEC). In this paper, we propose an algebraic construction based on dyadic matrices for designing both classical and quantum LDPC codes. The method first generates classical binary quasi-dyadic LDPC codes whose Tanner graphs have girth 6. It is then extended to the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) framework, where the two component parity-check matrices are built to satisfy the compatibility condition required by the recently introduced CAMEL-ensemble quaternary belief propagation decoder. This compatibility condition ensures that all unavoidable cycles of length 4 are assembled in a single variable node, allowing the mitigation of their detrimental effects by decimating that variable node.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Polynomial Codes for Efficient Matrix Chain Multiplication in Distributed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of computing matrix chain multiplications in a distributed computing cluster. In such systems, performance is often limited by the straggler problem, where the slowest worker dominates the overall computation latency. To resolve this issue, several coded computing strategies have been proposed, primarily focusing on the simplest case: the multiplication of two matrices. These approaches successfully alleviate the straggler effect, but they do so at the expense of higher computational complexity and increased storage needs at the workers. However, in many real-world applications, computations naturally involve long chains of matrix multiplications rather than just a single two-matrix product. Extending univariate polynomial coding to this setting has been shown to amplify the costs -- both computation and storage overheads grow significantly, limiting scalability. In this work, we propose two novel multivariate polynomial coding schemes specifically designed for matrix chain multiplication in distributed environments. Our results show that while multivariate codes introduce additional computational cost at the workers, they can dramatically reduce storage overhead compared to univariate extensions. This reveals a fundamental trade-off between computation and storage efficiency, and highlights the potential of multivariate codes as a practical solution for large-scale distributed linear algebra tasks.</description>

      <title>On the Algebraic Structure Underlying the Support Enumerators of Linear Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have introduced the concepts of support distribution and the support enumerator as refinements of the classical weight distribution and weight enumerator respectively, capturing coordinate level activity in linear block codes. More precisely, we have established formula for counting codewords in the linear code C whose i-th coordinate is nonzero. Moreover, we derived a MacWilliam's type identity, relating the normalized support enumerators of a linear code and its dual, explaining how coordinate information transforms under duality. Using this identity we deduce a condition for self duality based on the equality of support distributions. These results provide a more detailed understanding of code structure and complement classical weight based duality theory.</description>

      <title>Majority-Logic Decoding of Binary Locally Recoverable Codes: A Probabilistic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locally repairable codes (LRCs) were originally introduced to enable efficient recovery from erasures in distributed storage systems by accessing only a small number of other symbols. While their structural properties-such as bounds and constructions-have been extensively studied, the performance of LRCs under random erasures and errors has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study the error- and erasure-correction performance of binary linear LRCs under majority-logic decoding (MLD). Focusing on LRCs with fixed locality and varying availability, we derive explicit upper bounds on the probability of decoding failure over the memoryless Binary Erasure Channel (BEC) and Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). Our analysis characterizes the behavior of the bit-error rate (BER) and block-error rate (BLER) as functions of the locality and availability parameters. We show that, under mild growth conditions on the availability, the block decoding failure probability vanishes asymptotically, and that majority-logic decoding can successfully correct virtually all of error and erasure patterns of weight linear in the blocklength. The results reveal a substantial gap between worst-case guarantees and typical performance under stochastic channel models.</description>

      <title>LWM-Spectro: A Foundation Model for Wireless Baseband Signal Spectrograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The received in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) baseband signals inherently encode physical-layer and channel characteristics of wireless links. Learning robust and transferable representations directly from such raw signals, however, remains challenging due to heterogeneous communication systems, diverse propagation environments, and limited labeled data. To address this, we present LWM-Spectro, a transformer-based foundation model pretrained on large-scale I/Q data represented as time-frequency spectrograms. The model leverages self-supervised masked modeling, contrastive learning, and a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture to learn general-purpose wireless representations. These representations transfer effectively to downstream tasks such as modulation classification and joint SNR/mobility recognition, even with minimal supervision. Across tasks, LWM-Spectro consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning baselines in both few-shot and data-rich regimes, providing a unified foundation for wireless learning.</description>

      <title>Towards A Unified PAC-Bayesian Framework for Norm-based Generalization Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the generalization behavior of deep neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in modern statistical learning theory. Among existing approaches, PAC-Bayesian norm-based bounds have demonstrated particular promise due to their data-dependent nature and their ability to capture algorithmic and geometric properties of learned models. However, most existing results rely on isotropic Gaussian posteriors, heavy use of spectral-norm concentration for weight perturbations, and largely architecture-agnostic analyses, which together limit both the tightness and practical relevance of the resulting bounds. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose a unified framework for PAC-Bayesian norm-based generalization by reformulating the derivation of generalization bounds as a stochastic optimization problem over anisotropic Gaussian posteriors. The key to our approach is a sensitivity matrix that quantifies the network outputs with respect to structured weight perturbations, enabling the explicit incorporation of heterogeneous parameter sensitivities and architectural structures. By imposing different structural assumptions on this sensitivity matrix, we derive a family of generalization bounds that recover several existing PAC-Bayesian results as special cases, while yielding bounds that are comparable to or tighter than state-of-the-art approaches. Such a unified framework provides a principled and flexible way for geometry-/structure-aware and interpretable generalization analysis in deep learning.</description>

      <title>Efficient Incremental SLAM via Information-Guided and Selective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient incremental SLAM back-end that achieves the accuracy of full batch optimization while substantially reducing computational cost. The proposed approach combines two complementary ideas: information-guided gating (IGG) and selective partial optimization (SPO). IGG employs an information-theoretic criterion based on the log-determinant of the information matrix to quantify the contribution of new measurements, triggering global optimization only when a significant information gain is observed. This avoids unnecessary relinearization and factorization when incoming data provide little additional information. SPO executes multi-iteration Gauss-Newton (GN) updates but restricts each iteration to the subset of variables most affected by the new measurements, dynamically refining this active set until convergence. Together, these mechanisms retain all measurements to preserve global consistency while focusing computation on parts of the graph where it yields the greatest benefit. We provide theoretical analysis showing that the proposed approach maintains the convergence guarantees of full GN. Extensive experiments on benchmark SLAM datasets show that our approach consistently matches the estimation accuracy of batch solvers, while achieving significant computational savings compared to conventional incremental approaches. The results indicate that the proposed approach offers a principled balance between accuracy and efficiency, making it a robust and scalable solution for real-time operation in dynamic data-rich environments.</description>

      <title>VBO-MI: A Fully Gradient-Based Bayesian Optimization Framework Using Variational Mutual Information Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world tasks require optimizing expensive black-box functions accessible only through noisy evaluations, a setting commonly addressed with Bayesian optimization (BO). While Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) have recently emerged as scalable alternatives to Gaussian Processes (GPs), traditional BNN-BO frameworks remain burdened by expensive posterior sampling and acquisition function optimization. In this work, we propose {VBO-MI} (Variational Bayesian Optimization with Mutual Information), a fully gradient-based BO framework that leverages recent advances in variational mutual information estimation. To enable end-to-end gradient flow, we employ an actor-critic architecture consisting of an {action-net} to navigate the input space and a {variational critic} to estimate information gain. This formulation effectively eliminates the traditional inner-loop acquisition optimization bottleneck, achieving up to a {$10^2 \times$ reduction in FLOPs} compared to BNN-BO baselines. We evaluate our method on a diverse suite of benchmarks, including high-dimensional synthetic functions and complex real-world tasks such as PDE optimization, the Lunar Lander control problem, and categorical Pest Control. Our experiments demonstrate that VBO-MI consistently provides the same or superior optimization performance and computational scalability over the baselines.</description>

      <title>On the Maximum Toroidal Distance Code for Lattice-Based Public-Key Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a maximum toroidal distance (MTD) code for lattice-based public-key encryption (PKE). By formulating the encryption encoding problem as the selection of $2^\ell$ points in the discrete $\ell$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{Z}_q^\ell$, the proposed construction maximizes the minimum $L_2$-norm toroidal distance to reduce the decryption failure rate (DFR) in post-quantum schemes such as the NIST ML-KEM (Crystals-Kyber). For $\ell = 2$, we show that the MTD code is essentially a variant of the Minal code recently introduced at IACR CHES 2025. For $\ell = 4$, we present a construction based on the $D_4$ lattice that achieves the largest known toroidal distance, while for $\ell = 8$, the MTD code corresponds to $2E_8$ lattice points in $\mathbb{Z}_4^8$. Numerical evaluations under the Kyber setting show that the proposed codes outperform both Minal and maximum Lee-distance ($L_1$-norm) codes in DFR for $\ell &gt; 2$, while matching Minal code performance for $\ell = 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for constructing Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes that support fault-tolerant logical transversal $Z$-rotations. Using this framework, we obtain asymptotically good CSS codes that fault-tolerantly realize the logical transversal Clifford group. Furthermore, investigating CSS-T codes, we: (a) demonstrate asymptotically good CSS-T codes wherein the transversal $T$ realizes the logical transversal $S^{\dagger}$; (b) show that the condition $C_2 \ast C_1 \subseteq C_1^{\perp}$ is necessary but not sufficient for CSS-T codes; and (c) revise the characterizations of CSS-T codes wherein the transversal $T$ implements the logical identity and the logical transversal $T$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Composite Quantum Hypothesis Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates symmetric composite binary quantum hypothesis testing (QHT), where the goal is to determine which of two uncertainty sets contains an unknown quantum state. While asymptotic error exponents for this problem are well-studied, the finite-sample regime remains poorly understood. We bridge this gap by characterizing the sample complexity -- the minimum number of state copies required to achieve a target error level. Specifically, we derive lower bounds that generalize the sample complexity of simple QHT and introduce new upper bounds for various uncertainty sets, including of both finite and infinite cardinalities. Notably, our upper and lower bounds match up to universal constants, providing a tight characterization of the sample complexity. Finally, we extend our analysis to the differentially private setting, establishing the sample complexity for privacy-preserving composite QHT.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Orthogonality Barrier in Quantum LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are a widely deployed and well-established technology, forming the backbone of modern communication and storage systems. It is well known that, in this classical setting, increasing the girth of the Tanner graph while maintaining regular degree distributions leads simultaneously to good belief-propagation (BP) decoding performance and large minimum distance. In the quantum setting, however, this principle does not directly apply because quantum LDPC codes must satisfy additional orthogonality constraints between their parity-check matrices. When one enforces both orthogonality and regularity in a straightforward manner, the girth is typically reduced and the minimum distance becomes structurally upper bounded.
  In this work, we overcome this limitation by using permutation matrices with controlled commutativity and by restricting the orthogonality constraints to only the necessary parts of the construction, while preserving regular check-matrix structures. This design breaks the conventional trade-off between orthogonality, regularity, girth, and minimum distance, allowing us to construct quantum LDPC codes with large girth and without the usual distance upper bounds. As a concrete demonstration, we construct a girth-8, (3,12)-regular $[[9216,4612, \leq 48]]$ quantum LDPC code and show that, under BP decoding combined with a low-complexity post-processing algorithm, it achieves a frame error rate as low as $10^{-8}$ on the depolarizing channel with error probability $4 \%$.</description>

      <title>Beyond ISAC: Toward Integrated Heterogeneous Service Provisioning via Elastic Multi-Dimensional Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the growing complexity of vertical applications, current integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in wireless networks remains insufficient for supporting all required beyond communication services. To this end, future networks are evolving toward an integrated heterogeneous service provisioning (IHSP) platform, which seeks to integrate a broad range of heterogeneous services beyond the dual-function scope of ISAC. Nevertheless, this trend intensifies conflicts among concurrent heterogeneous service requirements under constrained resource sharing. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by the joint use of two novel elastic design strategies: compromised service value assessment and flexible multi-dimensional resource multiplexing. Consequently, we propose a value-prioritized elastic multi-dimensional multiple access (MDMA) mechanism for IHSP systems. First, we modify the Value-of-Service (VoS) metric by incorporating elastic parameters to characterize user-specific tolerance and compromise in response to various performance degradations under constrained resources. This VoS metric serves as the foundation for prioritizing services and enabling effective fairness service scheduling among concurrent competing demands. Next, we adapt the MDMA to elastically multiplex services using appropriate multiple access schemes across different resource domains. This protocol leverages user-specific interference tolerances and cancellation capabilities across different domains to reduce resource-demanding conflicts and co-channel interference within the same domain. Then, we maximize the system's VoS by jointly optimizing MDMA and power allocation. Since this problem is non-convex, we develop a monotonic optimization-assisted dynamic programming algorithm for the optimal solution and a VoS-prioritized successive convex approximation algorithm for efficient suboptimal computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models (FMs) have attracted increasing attention in the wireless communication domain. Leveraging the powerful multi-task learning capability, FMs hold the promise of unifying multiple tasks of wireless communication with a single framework. Nevertheless, existing wireless FMs face limitations in the uniformity to address multiple tasks with diverse inputs/outputs across different communication scenarios. In this paper, we propose a MUlti-taSk Environment-aware FM (MUSE-FM) with a unified architecture to handle multiple tasks in wireless communications, while effectively incorporating scenario information. Specifically, to achieve task uniformity, we propose a unified prompt-guided data encoder-decoder pair to handle data with heterogeneous formats and distributions across different tasks. Besides, we integrate the environmental context as a multi-modal input, which serves as prior knowledge of environment and channel distributions and facilitates cross-scenario feature extraction. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed MUSE-FM outperforms existing methods for various tasks, and its prompt-guided encoder-decoder pair facilitates few-shot adaptation to new task configurations. Moreover, the incorporation of environment information improves the ability to adapt to different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Trace Repair Never Loses to Classical Repair: Exact and Explicit Helper Nodes Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Repairing Reed-Solomon codes with low bandwidth is a central challenge in distributed storage. Following the trace-repair framework of Guruswami and Wootters (2017), recent works by Lin (2023) and Liu-Wan-Xing (2024) provided significant improvements in bandwidth using two distinct ideas. Lin constructed a trace-repair scheme that requires no contribution from a set of predetermined nodes $\mathscr{S}$, while Liu-Wan-Xing identified linear dependencies among the downloaded traces, relating the number of dependent traces to the dimension of a subspace $\mathscr{W}_k$. In this work, we fully utilize and unify these ideas. We compute the exact dimension of $\mathscr{W}_{k,\mathscr{S}}$ (a generalization of $\mathscr{W}_k$). We identify the trade-off between the set size $|\mathscr{S}|$ and the dimension $\dim(\mathscr{W}_{k,\mathscr{S}})$. We provide an algorithm to find the combination that results in the lowest bandwidth. Furthermore, we provide an explicit choice of the helper nodes for the repair. Finally, we prove that our optimized scheme never loses to the classical repair scheme, establishing a bandwidth guarantee of at most $k\log|\mathbb{F}|$ bits for all dimension $k$ and field $\mathbb{F}$, whenever the trace repair is applicable.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communication: Rate-Distortion Fundamental Limits of State Estimator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The state-dependent memoryless channel (SDMC) is employed to model the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where the transmitter conveys messages to the receiver while simultaneously estimating the state parameter of interest via the received echo signals. However, the performance of sensing has often been neglected in existing works. To address this gap, we establish the rate-distortion function for sensing performance in the SDMC model, which is defined based on standard information-theoretic principles to ensure clear operational meaning. In addition, we propose a modified Blahut-Arimoto type algorithm for solving the rate-distortion function and provide convergence proofs for the algorithm. We further define the capacity-rate-distortion tradeoff region, which unifies information-theoretic results for communication and sensing within a single optimization framework. Finally, we numerically evaluate the capacity-rate-distortion region and demonstrate the benefit of coding in terms of estimation rate for certain channels.</description>

      <title>Strong Singleton-Like Bounds, Quasi-Perfect Codes and Distance-Optimal Codes in the Sum-Rank Metric</title>

Abstract: Codes in the sum-rank metric have received many attentions in recent years, since they have wide applications in the multishot network coding, the space-time coding and the distributed storage. In this paper, by constructing covering codes in the sum-rank metric from covering codes in the Hamming metric, we derive new upper bounds on sizes, the covering radii and the block length functions of codes in the sum-rank metric. As applications, we present several strong Singleton-like bounds that are tighter than the classical Singleton-like bound when block lengths are large. In addition, we give the explicit constructions of the distance-optimal sum-rank codes of matrix sizes $s\times s$ and $2\times 2$ with minimum sum-rank distance four respectively by using cyclic codes in the Hamming metric. More importantly, we present an infinite families of quasi-perfect $q$-ary sum-rank codes with matrix sizes $2\times m$. Furthermore, we construct almost MSRD codes with larger block lengths and demonstrate how the Plotkin sum can be used to give more distance-optimal sum-rank codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antifragility is an economics term defined as measure of (monetary) benefits gained from the adverse events and variability of the markets. This paper integrates for the first time the antifragility into the network based on communication links with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) affected by a jamming attack. We analyze whether antifragility can be achieved for several jamming models. Beyond the link-level gains, the results reveal how antifragile RIS-assisted links can be integrated into multi-hop systems to improve end-to-end network resilience, connectivity, and throughput under adversarial effects.</description>

      <title>A new measure of dependence: Integrated $R^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18146v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel measure of dependence that captures the extent to which a random variable $Y$ is determined by a random vector $X$. The measure equals zero precisely when $Y$ and $X$ are independent, and it attains one exactly when $Y$ is almost surely a measurable function of $X$. We further extend this framework to define a measure of conditional dependence between $Y$ and $X$ given $Z$. We propose a simple and interpretable estimator with computational complexity comparable to classical correlation coefficients, including those of Pearson, Spearman, and Chatterjee. Leveraging this dependence measure, we develop a tuning-free, model-agnostic variable selection procedure and establish its consistency under appropriate sparsity conditions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets highlight the strong empirical performance of our methodology and demonstrate substantial gains over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Oscillator-Qudit Quantum Processors: stabilizer states, stabilizer codes, symplectic operations, and non-commutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04819</link>

Abstract: We construct stabilizer states and error-correcting codes on combinations of discrete- and continuous-variable systems, generalizing the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) quantum lattice formalism. Our framework absorbs the discrete phase space of a qudit into a hybrid phase space parameterizable entirely by the continuous variables of a harmonic oscillator. The unit cell of a hybrid quantum lattice grows with the qudit dimension, yielding a way to simultaneously measure an arbitrarily large range of non-commuting position and momentum displacements. Simple hybrid states can be obtained by applying a conditional displacement to a Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) state and a Pauli eigenstate, or by encoding some of the physical qudits of a stabilizer state into a GKP code. The states' oscillator-qudit entanglement cannot be generated using symplectic (i.e., Gaussian-Clifford) operations, distinguishing them as a resource from tensor products of oscillator and qudit stabilizer states.
  Simple hybrid codes can be thought of as subsystem GKP codes whose gauge factor is entangled with a qudit. Our numerical investigations suggest that such codes can sometimes outperform GKP codes against physical noise, and their decoders can be tuned to accommodate either more qudit or more oscillator errors. We also relate stabilizer codes to non-commutative tori, identifying that a general construction of such tori yields multi-mode multi-qudit extensions of GKP codes. We explicitly calculate these codes' logical dimension and logical operators by utilizing the Morita equivalence between their stabilizer and logical tori. We provide examples using commutation matrices, integer symplectic matrices, and binary codes.</description>

      <title>Structural asymmetry as a fraud signature: detecting collusion with Heron's Information Coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fraud in public procurement remains a persistent challenge, especially in large, decentralized systems like Brazil's Unified Health System. We introduce Heron's Information Coefficient (HIC), a geometric measure that quantifies how subgraphs deviate from the global structure of a network. Applied to over eight years of Brazilian bidding data for medical supplies, this measure highlights collusive patterns that standard indicators may overlook. Unlike conventional robustness metrics, the Heron coefficient focuses on the interaction between active and inactive subgraphs, revealing structural shifts that may signal coordinated behavior, such as cartel formation. Synthetic experiments support these findings, demonstrating strong detection performance across varying corruption intensities and network sizes. While our results do not replace legal or economic analyses, they offer an effective complementary tool for auditors and policymakers to monitor procurement integrity more effectively. This study demonstrates that simple geometric insight can reveal hidden dynamics in real-world networks better than other Information Theoretic metrics.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of the coupled entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coupled entropy, $H_\kappa,$ is proven to uniquely satisfy the requirement that a generalized entropy be a measure of the uncertainty at the scale, $\sigma,$ for a class of non-exponential distributions. The coupled stretched exponential distributions, including the generalized Pareto and Student's t distributions, are uniquely parameterized to quantify linear uncertainty with the scale and nonlinear uncertainty with the tail shape for a broad class of complex systems. Thereby, the coupled entropy optimizes the representation of the uncertainty due to linear sources. Lemmas for the composability and extensivity of the coupled entropy are proven. The uniqueness of the coupled entropy is further supported by demonstrating consistent thermodynamic relationships, which correspond to a model used for the momentum of high-energy particle collisions. Applications of the coupled entropy in measuring statistical complexity, training variational inference algorithms, and designing communication channels are reviewed.</description>
