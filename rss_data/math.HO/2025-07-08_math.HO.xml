      <title>Using Large Language Models to Study Mathematical Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The philosophy of mathematical practice (PMP) looks to evidence from working mathematics to help settle philosophical questions. One prominent program under the PMP banner is the study of explanation in mathematics, which aims to understand what sorts of proofs mathematicians consider explanatory and what role the pursuit of explanation plays in mathematical practice. In an effort to address worries about cherry-picked examples and file-drawer problems in PMP, a handful of authors have recently turned to corpus analysis methods as a promising alternative to small-scale case studies. This paper reports the results from such a corpus study facilitated by Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, a model whose reasoning capabilities, advances in hallucination control and large context window allow for the accurate analysis of hundreds of pages of text per query. Based on a sample of 5000 mathematics papers from arXiv.org, the experiments yielded a dataset of hundreds of useful annotated examples. Its aim was to gain insight on questions like the following: How often do mathematicians make claims about explanation in the relevant sense? Do mathematicians' explanatory practices vary in any noticeable way by subject matter? Which philosophical theories of explanation are most consistent with a large body of non-cherry-picked examples? How might philosophers make further use of AI tools to gain insights from large datasets of this kind? As the first PMP study making extensive use of LLM methods, it also seeks to begin a conversation about these methods as research tools in practice-oriented philosophy and to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of current models for such work.</description>

      <title>Integral Invariants and Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02878v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review and methodological article we discuss the main ideas of the integral invariants theory. This theory was originated by Poincare and Cartan. We show how ideas of this theory connect such a different fields of mathematical physics as Hamiltonian dynamics, optics and hydrodynamics. We focus our attention on the results that are rarely expounded in the literature.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Circles to Prove a Square: A Novel Geometric Proof of the Pythagorean Theorem Using Circular Segments and Area Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pythagorean Theorem has been proved in hundreds of ways, yet it inspires fresh insights through geometry and trigonometry. In this paper, we offer a new proof based on three circles that circumscribe the sides of a right triangle. Rather than invoke coordinate geometry, the argument relies purely on classical Euclidean constructions, trigonometric identities independent of the theorem itself, and a careful analysis of the areas of circular segments.
  The key idea is to evaluate the area of the semicircle built on the hypotenuse in two distinct ways: directly and as a combination of areas formed by overlapping circular segments and triangles constructed on the legs of the triangle, as shown in Figure 10. Thales' Theorem, inscribed angle theorem, basic trigonometric identities, and segment area formulas all play a role in a derivation that is both elementary and rigorous.
  To the author's knowledge, this specific approach, which combines circular symmetry, angle decomposition, and area comparison, has not appeared in the prior literature, including Loomis' comprehensive catalog [3] and the extensive database at Cut-the-Knot [4]. As such, it provides both a new perspective on an ancient theorem and an example of how classical tools can still yield original insights.</description>

      <title>Textual analysis of ancient Indian mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent analyses of Brahmagupta's discourse on the cyclic quadrilateral, and of Baudh\=ayana's approximate quadrature of the circle, have shown that it is useful to submit mathematical texts to a form of literary analysis. Several passages considered as obscure or objectionable may be explained in this way, by taking into account the elements of exposition and derivation of the results that the author has given, as well as his conceptual background. This approach aims at helping the reader set aside his preconceptions about what a mathematical text is supposed to be. In this paper, guidelines for further application of this method are outlined, with illustrations taken from our previous papers.</description>

      <title>Making mathematical online resources FAIR: at the example of small phylogenetic trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the process of taking an early 2000's mathematical library, the Small Phylogenetic Trees, and transforming it into a FAIR, modern, and sustainable repository for data from algebraic phylogenetics. This process is based on a three-fold strategy: (1) writing a software package which enables the user to reproduce results of the database; (2) setting up a user-friendly new website with cross links to theoretical publications, code snippets, and serialized output of computations; and (3) all-the-while documenting the steps we take in order to derive lessons learned which may be generalised to other such projects. This paper addresses (3). (1) is found in https://docs.oscar-system.org/dev/Experimental/AlgebraicStatistics/phylogenetics, and (2) is located at https://algebraicphylogenetics.org.</description>

      <title>An old number theory problem related to the Legendre symbol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02434v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is using a very simple constructive method to study an old number theory problem related to the Legendre symbol modulo $p$, and completely solved it. The proving method of the result is purely elementary and has been desired in the literature at least since 1927.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the story of the first Fields Medal awarded to Lars Ahlfors. It was smuggled out of Finland in 1944, pawned in Sweden during World War II, and returned to Helsinki in 2004. This article is based on an interview with Ahlfors' second daughter Vanessa Gruen, and established biographical sources.</description>

      <title>Score-based Diffusion Models via Stochastic Differential Equations -- a Technical Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is an expository article on the score-based diffusion models, with a particular focus on the formulation via stochastic differential equations (SDE). After a gentle introduction, we discuss the two pillars in the diffusion modeling -- sampling and score matching, which encompass the SDE/ODE sampling, score matching efficiency, the consistency models, and reinforcement learning. Short proofs are given to illustrate the main idea of the stated results. The article is primarily a technical introduction to the field, and practitioners may also find some analysis useful in designing new models or algorithms.</description>
