      <title>Notes on countable frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matthew de Brecht raised the question of whether countable frames are continuous lattices. We prove that the continuity of a countable frame implies the quasicontinuity of its corresponding spectrum in the dual specialization order. We further show that this question admits a positive answer if the frame's spectrum is a $T_1$ space or a Scott space. In general, we confirm the existence of non-continuous countable frames. This work also partially addresses an open problem proposed by Jimmie Lawson and Michael Mislove in 1990, which concerns the characterization of when the spectrums of spatial frames are Scott spaces.</description>

      <title>Co-Noetherian spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In non-Hausdorff topology, many spaces exhibit significant separation properties, such as sober spaces, well-filtered spaces and d-spaces. These properties serve to fundamentally classify T0 topological spaces. In this paper, we introduce and study a new class of topological spaces called co-Noetherian spaces, which can refine the classification of T0 spaces. We discuss some basic properties of co-Noetherian spaces and obtain an equivalent characterization of compactness under the strong topology. Additionally, we investigate the connections among KC-spaces, strong R-spaces and co-Noetherian spaces. Moreover, we establish an equivalence between the category of T0 co-Noetherian spaces with continuous mappings and a subcategory of the poset category. Finally, we provide counterexamples to show that the Hoare powerspace of a T0 space may fail to be co-Noetherian, and that the Smyth powerspace of a co-Noetherian space need not be co-Noetherian.</description>

      <title>S*-well-filtered spaces and d*-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Xu proposed a strongly well-filtered space in [24] and systematically investigated some of its properties and characterizations. In this paper, we introduce a new class of T0-spaces called S*-well-filtered spaces, which is strictly larger than the class of strongly well-filtered spaces. First, we establish some connections among S*-well-filtered spaces, d*-spaces and weak well-filtered spaces. Then it is demonstrated that for any dcpo P, the Scott space {\Sigma}P is a d*-space if and only if it is S*-well-filtered. Furthermore, some basic properties of S*-well-filtered spaces are discussed. We prove that if Y is an S*-well-filtered space, the function space TOP(X,Y) equipped with the Isbell topology may not be an S*-well-filtered space. Finally, we study the S*-well-filteredness of Smyth power spaces. In addition, Johnstone's non-sober dcpo example is shown to be S*-well-filtered yet it is not strongly well-filtered, thereby establishing an obvious distinction between these two classes of dcpos.</description>
