      <title>Extensions of the loop product and coproduct, the space of antipodal paths and resonances of closed geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the space of paths in a closed manifold $M$ with endpoints determined by an involution $f\colon M\to M$. If the involution is fixed point free and if $M$ is $2$-connected then this path space is the universal covering space of the component of non-contractible loops of the free loop space of $M/\mathbb{Z}_2$. On the homology of said path space we study string topology operations which extend the Chas-Sullivan loop product and the Goresky-Hingston loop coproduct, respectively. We study the case of antipodal involution on the sphere in detail and use Morse-Bott theoretic methods to give a complete computation of the extended loop product and the extended coproduct on even-dimensional spheres. These results are then applied to prove a resonance theorem for closed geodesics on real projective space.</description>

      <title>The Laplace-Beltrami spectrum on Naturally Reductive Homogeneous Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a formula for the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on functions for compact naturally reductive homogeneous spaces in terms of eigenvalues of a generalized Casimir operator and spherical representations. We apply this result to a large family of canonical variations of normal homogeneous metrics, thus allowing for the first time to study how the spectrum depends on the deformation parameters of the metric. As an application, we provide a formula for the full spectrum of compact positive homogeneous $3$-$(\alpha,\delta)$-Sasaki manifolds (a family of metrics which includes, in particular, all homogeneous $3$-Sasaki manifolds).
  The second part of the paper is devoted to the detailed computation and investigation of the spectrum of this family of metrics on the Aloff-Wallach manifold $W^{1,1}=SU(3)/S^{1}$; in particular, we provide a documented Python script that allows the explicit computation in any desired range. We recover Urakawa's eigenvalue computation for the $SU(3)$-normal homogeneous metric on $W^{1,1}$ as a limiting case and cover all the positively curved $SU(3)\times SO(3)$-normal homogeneous realizations discovered by Wilking. By doing so, we complete Urakawa's list of the first eigenvalue on compact, simply conntected, normal homogeneous spaces with positive sectional curvature.</description>

      <title>A mapping tori construction of strong HKT and generalized hyperk\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we provide a construction via mapping tori of (non Bismut flat) strong HKT and generalized hyperk\"ahler structures on compact manifolds. The skew-symmetric torsion is parallel, but the manifolds are not a product of a hyperk\"ahler manifold and a compact Lie group.</description>

      <title>Orientability of moduli spaces of Spin(7)-instantons and coherent sheaves on Calabi-Yau 4-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:1811.09658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns orientability of moduli spaces of Spin(7)-instantons on compact 8-manifolds $X$ with Spin(7)-structure for the Lie groups SU($m$) and U($m$), and of moduli spaces of coherent sheaves on Calabi-Yau 4-folds. Such orientations are needed to define enumerative invariants 'counting' Spin(7) instantons, or coherent sheaves on Calabi-Yau 4-folds $X$. The previous version of the paper, version 2, published in Advances in Mathematics 368 (2020), claimed to prove all these moduli spaces are orientable.
  VERSION 3 BEGINS WITH AN ERRATUM. THERE IS A MISTAKE IN THE PROOF OF THEOREM 1.11 OF VERSION 2, AND THE THEOREM ITSELF, ONE OF OUR MAIN RESULTS, IS FALSE. THE 8-MANIFOLD SU(3) IS A COUNTEREXAMPLE. COROLLARIES 1.12 AND 1.17 OF VERSION 2 DEPEND ON THEOREM 1.11, AND SO MAY ALSO BE FALSE, THOUGH WE DO NOT HAVE COUNTEREXAMPLES. OUR OTHER MAIN RESULT, THEOREM 1.15, IS UNAFFECTED BY THE MISTAKE. THE AUTHORS APOLOGIZE FOR THIS.
  Joyce-Upmeier arXiv:2503.20456 (197 pages) gives a new theory for studying orientability of moduli spaces using 'bordism categories'. Amongst other results they prove corrected versions of Theorem 1.11 and Corollaries 1.12 and 1.17, which hold with an extra assumption on $H^3(X,\mathbb Z)$.
  In version 3, we highlight and explain the mistakes, but we do not correct them, as this would take many pages. Except for Theorem 1.15, readers are advised to read, and cite, Joyce-Upmeier arXiv:2503.20456 instead of this paper.</description>

      <title>Urysohn 1-width for 4 and 5 manifolds with positive biRicci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was proved by Gromov-Lawson\cite{gl83} that complete three manifold with positive scalar curvature bounded below has finite Urysohn 1-width only depends on the uniform positive scalar curvature bounds. It is natural to ask the same question for the four manifolds. In this paper, we can show that closed four and five manifolds with positive biRicci curvature has finite Urysohn 1-width only depends on the curvature bounds. During the proof we can also observe that the fundamental group of those manifolds are virtually free. This gives a quick application that $T^{2}\times S^{2}$ can't admit positive biRicci curvature.</description>

      <title>Entropic curvature not comparable to other curvatures -- or is it?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider global $\theta$-curvatures of finite Markov chains with associated means $\theta$ in the spirit of the entropic curvature (based on the logarithmic mean) by Erbar-Maas and Mielke. As in the case of Bakry-\'Emery curvature, we also allow for a finite dimension parameter by making use of an adapted $\Gamma$ calculus for $\theta$-curvatures. We prove explicit positive lower curvature bounds (both finite- and infinite-dimensional) for finite abelian Cayley graphs. In the case of cycles, we provide also an upper curvature bound which shows that our lower bounds are asymptotically sharp (up to a logarithmic factor). Moreover, we prove new universal lower curvature bounds for finite Markov chains as well as curvature perturbation results (allowing, in particular, to compare entropic and Bakry-\'Emery curvatures). Finally, we present examples where entropic curvature differs significantly from other curvature notions like Bakry-\'Emery curvature or Ollivier Ricci and sectional curvatures.</description>

      <title>Geometric properties and offset surface construction for slant timelike-ruled surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates slant timelike-ruled surfaces and their evolute offsets in Minkowski 3-space $\mathbb{E}_{1}^{3}$. Using the symmetry of evolute curves, we derive a parametric formulation for skew timelike-ruled surfaces and establish conditions ensuring the coaxial alignment of the central normal with the ruling direction of the corresponding offset surface. The geometric properties are examined through the Blaschke and Darboux frames, leading to curvature characteristics and fundamental invariants. Special cases, such as timelike-developable and timelike-binormal surfaces, are analyzed with illustrative examples. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the differential geometry of timelike-ruled surfaces and their evolute offsets in Lorentzian space.</description>

      <title>A rigidity theorem for Einstein $4$-manifolds with semi-definite sectional curvature, and its consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any oriented $4$-dimensional Einstein metric with semi-definite sectional curvature satisfies the pointwise inequality \[ \frac{|s|}{\sqrt{6}}\geq|W^+|+|W^-|, \] where $s$, $W^+$ and $W^-$ are respectively the scalar curvature, the self-dual and anti-self-dual Weyl curvatures. We give a complete characterization of closed $4$-dimensional Einstein metrics with semi-definite sectional curvature saturating this pointwise inequality. We then present further consequences of this circle of ideas, in particular to the study of the geography of non-positively curved closed Einstein and Kaehler-Einstein $4$-manifolds. In the Kaehler-Einstein case, we obtain a sharp Gromov-Lueck type inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new stabilization phenomenon induced by degenerate diffusion is discovered in the context of pinned planar $p$-elasticae. It was known that in the non-degenerate regime $p\in(1,2]$, including the classical case of Euler's elastica, there are no local minimizers other than unique global minimizers. Here we prove that, in stark contrast, in the degenerate regime $p\in(2,\infty)$ there emerge uncountably many local minimizers with diverging energy.</description>

      <title>Bordism categories and orientations of gauge theory moduli spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the second paper of a series that develops a bordism-theoretic point of view on orientations in enumerative geometry. The first paper is arXiv:2312.06818. This paper focuses on those applications to gauge theory that can be established purely using formal arguments and calculations from algebraic topology.
  We prove that the orientability of moduli spaces of connections in gauge theory for all principal $G$-bundles $P\to X$ over compact spin $n$-manifolds at once is equivalent to the vanishing of a certain morphism $\Omega_n^{\rm Spin}(\mathcal L BG)\to{\mathbb Z}_2$ on the $n$-dimensional spin bordism group of the free loop space of the classifying space of $G,$ and we give a complete list of all compact, connected Lie groups $G$ for which this holds. Moreover, we apply bordism techniques to prove that mod-$8$ Floer gradings exist for moduli spaces of $G_2$-instantons for all principal SU(2)-bundles.
  We also prove that there are canonical orientations for all principal U$(m)$-bundles $P\to X$ over compact spin $8$-manifolds satisfying $c_2(P)-c_1(P)^2=0.$ The proof is based on an interesting relationship to principal $E_8$-bundles. These canonical orientations play an important role in many conjectures about Donaldson-Thomas type invariants on Calabi-Yau $4$-folds, and resolve an apparent paradox in these conjectures.</description>

      <title>Geometry and symmetries of Hermitian-Einstein and instanton connection moduli spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09474v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the geometry of the moduli spaces $\mathscr{M}_{\HE}^*(M^{2n})$ of Hermitian-Einstein irreducible connections on a vector bundle $E$ over a K\"ahler with torsion (KT) manifold $M^{2n}$ that admits holomorphic and $\h\nabla$-covariantly constant vector fields, where $\h\nabla$ is the connection with skew-symmetric torsion $H$. We demonstrate that such vector fields induce an action on $\mathscr{M}_{\HE}^*(M^{2n})$ that leaves both the metric and complex structure invariant. Moreover, if an additional condition is satisfied, the induced vector fields are covariantly constant with respect to the connection with skew-symmetric torsion $\h{\mathcal{ D}}$ on $\mathscr{M}_{\HE}^*(M^{2n})$. We demonstrate that in the presence of such vector fields, the geometry of $\mathscr{M}_{\HE}^*(M^{2n})$ can be modelled on that of holomorphic toric principal bundles with base space KT manifolds and give some examples.
  We also extend our analysis to the moduli spaces $\mathscr{M}_{\asd}^*(M^{4})$ of instanton connections on vector bundles over KT, bi-KT (generalised K\"ahler) and hyper-K\"ahler with torsion (HKT) manifolds $M^4$. We find that the geometry of $\mathscr{M}_{\asd}^*(S^3\times S^1)$ can be modelled on that of principal bundles with fibre $S^3\times S^1$ over Quaternionic K\"ahler manifolds with torsion (QKT). In addition motivated by applications to AdS/CFT, we explore the (superconformal) symmetry algebras of two-dimensional sigma models with target spaces such moduli spaces.</description>
