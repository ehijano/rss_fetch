      <title>Separability criteria based on realignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of entanglement in a bipartite state is a crucial issue in quantum information science. Based on realignment of density matrices and the vectorization of the reduced density matrices, we introduce a new set of separability criteria. The proposed separability criteria can detect more entanglement than the previous separability criteria. Moreover, we provide new criteria for detecting the genuine tripartite entanglement and lower bounds for the concurrence and convex-roof extended negativity. The advantages of results are demonstrated through detailed examples.</description>

      <title>Double-bracket quantum algorithms for quantum imaginary-time evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently preparing approximate ground-states of large, strongly correlated systems on quantum hardware is challenging and yet nature is innately adept at this. This has motivated the study of thermodynamically inspired approaches to ground-state preparation that aim to replicate cooling processes via imaginary-time evolution. However, synthesizing quantum circuits that efficiently implement imaginary-time evolution is itself difficult, with prior proposals generally adopting heuristic variational approaches or using deep block encodings. Here, we use the insight that quantum imaginary-time evolution is a solution of Brockett's double-bracket flow and synthesize circuits that implement double-bracket flows coherently on the quantum computer. We prove that our Double-Bracket Quantum Imaginary-Time Evolution (DB-QITE) algorithm inherits the cooling guarantees of imaginary-time evolution. Concretely, each step is guaranteed to i) decrease the energy of an initial approximate ground-state by an amount proportion to the energy fluctuations of the initial state and ii) increase the fidelity with the ground-state. Thus DB-QITE provides a means to systematically improve the approximation of a ground-state using shallow circuits.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal pure state estimation with adaptive Fisher-symmetric measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state estimation is important for various quantum information processes, including quantum communications, computation, and metrology, which require the characterization of quantum states for evaluation and optimization. We present a three-stage adaptive method for estimating $d$-dimensional pure quantum states using Fisher symmetric measurements (FSM) and a single-shot measurement basis. The result of this measurement is used to generate two FSMs that jointly estimate any pure state up to a null measure set. This estimate is used to adapt a third FMS, which provides the final estimate of the unknown state. Our approach achieves an average estimation infidelity very close to the Gill-Massar lower bound (GMB) without requiring prior information beyond the purity of the unknown state, extending the applicability of FSM to any unknown state. The total number of measurement outcomes of the method scale linearly as $7d-3$, avoiding the need for collective measurements on multiple copies of the unknown state. This work highlights the potential of adaptive estimation techniques in quantum state characterization while maintaining efficiency in the number of measurement outcomes.</description>

      <title>The SYK charging advantage as a random walk on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the charging dynamics of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models as quantum batteries, highlighting their capacity to achieve quantum charging advantages. By analytically deriving the scaling of the charging power in SYK batteries, we identify the two key mechanisms underlying this advantage: the use of operators scaling extensively with system size $N$ and the facilitation of operator delocalization by specific graph structures. A novel graph-theoretic framework is introduced in which the charging process is recast as a random walk on a graph, enabling a quantitative analysis of operator spreading. Our results establish rigorous conditions for the quantum advantage in SYK batteries and extend these insights to graph-based SYK models, revealing broader implications for energy storage and quantum dynamics. This work opens avenues for leveraging quantum chaos and complex network structures in optimizing energy transfer processes.</description>

      <title>Spin squeezing: Thermal behavior and distribution on excited states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spin-squeezing behavior under thermal effects in a one-dimensional transverse field XY model with spin-1/2. The exact solution of the model helps us to compute the spin-squeezing parameter as a function of temperature and also in all excited states with higher energy than the ground state. We find that below the thermal factorized field, h_f(T_{co}), there is no transition temperature. At the thermal factorized field, a transition from a thermal squeezed state to an unsqueezed state occurs at a specific temperature called the coherent temperature. Interestingly, we show that the finite temperature can create squeezed states from a state which at zero temperature is a coherent state. To complete our study, we also analyze the variation of the spin-squeezing parameter in the excited states and provide a behavioral analysis of the thermal spin-squeezing parameter.</description>

      <title>Generating graph states with a single quantum emitter and the minimum number of fusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph states are the key resources for measurement- and fusion-based quantum computing with photons, yet their creation is experimentally challenging. We optimize a hybrid graph-state generation scheme using a single quantum emitter and linear optics Bell-state measurements, called fusions. We first generate a restricted class of states from a single quantum emitter and then apply fusions to create a target graph state, where we use a dynamic programming approach to find the construction that requires the lowest possible number of fusions. Our analysis yields a lookup table for constructing $\sim 2.8\times 10^7$ non-isomorphic graph states with the minimum number of fusions. The lookup table covers all graph states with up to eight qubits and several other ones with up to 14 qubits. We present construction protocols of selected graph states and provide the lookup table. For large graph states that are not in the lookup table, we derive bounds for the required number of fusions using graph-theoretic properties. Finally, we use the lookup table to search for the best graph codes for loss-tolerant encodings, given a fixed number of fusions for their construction.</description>

      <title>Quantum Interference of Force with Entangled Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we experimentally demonstrate the quantum interference of force effect using pairs of entangled photons. Although photons are massless particles, they have linear momentum, and our experiments show that the quantum superposition of a positive momentum transfer with a null momentum transfer may result in a negative momentum transfer to an ensemble of quantum particles (photons), a behavior with no classical analogue. The momentum transfer to each photon is defined by the result of a polarization measurement performed in a second photon, initially entangled with it.</description>

      <title>A practical guide to feedback control for Pound-Drever-Hall laser linewidth narrowing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique for laser linewidth narrowing is widely used by AMO experimentalists. However, achieving a high-performance PDH locking requires substantial engineering experience, which is scattered across literature and often lacks a cohesive control-theory perspective. Excellent pedagogical papers exist on the theory of the PDH error signal but they rarely cover feedback control. General-purpose control theory literature seldom discuss PDH laser locking specifically. Although excellent PDH review articles provide thorough knowledge and practice on both aspects but they are not reader-friendly. We extend prior works by addressing component choice and loop tuning using modern tools like a vector network analyzer. We organize multifaceted engineering considerations systematically, grounded in feedback control principles. Our target reader is researchers setting up a PDH laser lock for the first time; we eschew advanced topics like minimizing residual amplitude modulation (RAM). Our guidance is illustrated by step-by-step optimization of the lock for a 1650 nm ECDL.</description>

      <title>Experimental certification of high-dimensional entanglement with randomized measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional entangled states offer higher information capacity and stronger resilience to noise compared with two-dimensional systems. However, the large number of modes and sensitivity to random rotations complicate experimental entanglement certification. Here, we experimentally certify three-dimensional entanglement in a five-dimensional two-photon state using 800 Haar-random measurements implemented via a 10-plane programmable light converter. We further demonstrate the robustness of this approach against random rotations, certifying high-dimensional entanglement despite arbitrary phase randomization of the optical modes. This method, which requires no common reference frame between parties, opens the door for high-dimensional entanglement distribution through long-range random links.</description>

      <title>Natural Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How should we model an observer within quantum mechanics or quantum field theory? How can classical physics emerge from a quantum model, and why should classical probability be useful? How can we model a selective measurement entirely within a closed quantum system? This paper sketches a new physical theory of probability based on an attempt to model classical information within a purely quantum system. We model classical information using a version of Zurek's theory of Quantum Darwinism, with emphasis on quantum information encoded using projection operators localised in spacetime. This version of Quantum Darwinism is compatible with quantum field theory, and does not require any artificial division of a quantum system into subsystems. The main innovation is our attempt to provide a physical explanation of probability. Decoherence is the physical mechanism behind Quantum Darwinism or the `branching of quantum worlds'. Assuming a type of perfect decoherence we construct a conventional probabilistic model for classical information. This, however, is not our theory of natural probability, and does not quite demonstrate the validity of Bayesian reasoning. Instead, our theory of natural probability arises from careful consideration of errors in decoherence: roughly speaking, we don't observe low probability events because they are swamped by quantum noise.</description>

      <title>Engineering qubit dynamics in open systems with photonic synthetic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of a quantum system interacting with an environment can be described as a unitary process acting on both the system and the environment. In this framework, the system's evolution can be predicted by tracing out the environmental degrees of freedom. Here, we establish a precise mapping between the global unitary dynamics and the quantum operation involving the system, wherein the system is a single qubit, and the environment is modeled as a discrete lattice space. This approach enables the implementation of arbitrary noise operations on single-polarization qubits using a minimal set of three liquid-crystal metasurfaces, whose transverse distribution of the optic axes can be patterned to reproduce the target process. We experimentally validate this method by simulating common noise processes, such as phase errors and depolarization.</description>

      <title>QuTiP 5: The Quantum Toolbox in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QuTiP, the Quantum Toolbox in Python, has been at the forefront of open-source quantum software for the last ten years. It is used as a research, teaching, and industrial tool, and has been downloaded millions of times by users around the world. Here we introduce the latest developments in QuTiP v5, which are set to have a large impact on the future of QuTiP and enable it to be a modern, continuously developed and popular tool for another decade and more. We summarize the code design and fundamental data layer changes as well as efficiency improvements, new solvers, applications to quantum circuits with QuTiP-QIP, and new quantum control tools with QuTiP-QOC. Additional flexibility in the data layer underlying all "quantum objects" in QuTiP allows us to harness the power of state-of-the-art data formats and packages like JAX, CuPy, and more. We explain these new features with a series of both well-known and new examples. The code for these examples is available in a static form on GitHub and will be available also in a continuously updated and documented notebook form in the qutip-tutorials package.</description>

      <title>States Violating Both Locality and Noncontextuality Inequalities in Quantum Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CHSH inequality is an inequality used to test locality in quantum theory and is recognized as one of Bell's inequalities. In contrast, the KCBS inequality is employed to test noncontextuality in quantum theory. While certain quantum states are known to violate these inequalities individually, it was previously assumed that no state could violate both inequalities simultaneously. This assumption is encapsulated in the concept of the `monogamy relation.' It describes a trade-off between nonlocality and contextuality: the violation of one inequality typically excludes the possibility of violating the other. However, Xue et al. demonstrated that simultaneous violations of both the CHSH and KCBS inequalities are possible with specific choices of observables. This discovery challenges the universal validity of the monogamy relation. It also suggests that the relationship between contextuality and nonlocality is more complex than previously understood. They further showed that numerous scenarios exist where both the CHSH inequality and a contextuality inequality involving more than five observables are violated. However, the number of such scenarios is finite.
  Building on this, we present two main results. The first is that there are infinitely many scenarios in which both the CHSH inequality and a contextuality inequality involving an odd number of observables are violated. This finding reveals the existence of infinitely many scenarios where the monogamy relation between the CHSH inequality and the noncontextuality inequality no longer holds. The second is that certain quantum states violate both the KCBS inequality and a nonlocality inequality distinct from the CHSH inequality. These insights deepen our understanding of the complex relationship between nonlocality and contextuality, and open avenues for exploring state-dependent inequalities and their physical implications.</description>

      <title>Nonlocality-Assisted Enhancement of Error-Free Communication in Noisy Classical Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The zero-error capacity of a noisy classical channel quantifies its ability to transmit information with absolute certainty, i.e., without any error. Unlike Shannon's standard channel capacity, which remains unaffected by pre-shared correlations, zero-error capacity can be enhanced through nonlocal correlations. In this work, we investigate zero-error communication utility of such correlations arising in the 2-2-m Bell scenario, where two parties have two inputs and m possible outcomes per input. For all m\geq2, we construct examples of noisy classical channels with zero zero-error capacity that, when assisted by extremal 2-2-m nonlocal correlations, can transmit one bit of information. While nonlocal correlations arising from quantum entangled states cannot achieve a positive zero-error capacity for these channels, they significantly enhance the probability of successfully transmitting a classical bit in a single use. Extending this analysis to the 2-m-2 Bell scenario, we identify channels with zero zero-error capacity that can nonetheless perfectly transmit log m bits of information when assisted by corresponding extremal nonlocal correlations. Our findings underscore the versatile utility of Bell nonlocal correlations in achieving zero-error communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Deutsch-Josza algorithm, one of the first and simplest quantum algorithms, is a natural candidate for small fault-tolerance experiments. We show that one can implement the Deutsch-Josza algorithm in a fault-tolerant manner using the smallest quantum error-detecting code -- the $[[4,2,2]]$ code -- without any ancillae. We implemented the algorithm on a trapped-ion quantum computer with and without fault-tolerant encoding and compared the results. With approximately $99 \%$ confidence, we found that the fault-tolerant implementation provides a noise reduction for all oracles. Averaged across all oracles, the reduction in error rate was nearly $90 \%$.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the mathematical properties of variational quantum ans\"atze is crucial for determining quantum advantage in Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs). A deeper understanding of ans\"atze not only enriches theoretical discussions but also facilitates the design of more efficient and robust frameworks for near-term applications. In this work, we address the challenge of balancing expressivity and trainability by utilizing a Hamming Weight Preserving (HWP) ansatz that confines quantum state evolution to a symmetry-preserving subspace. We rigorously establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for subspace universality of HWP ans\"atze, along with a comprehensive analysis of the trainability. These theoretical advances are validated via the accurate approximation of arbitrary unitary matrices in the HWP subspace. Furthermore, the practical utility of the HWP ansatz is substantiated for solving ground-state properties of Fermionic systems, achieving energy errors below $1\times 10^{-10}$Ha. This work highlights the critical role of symmetry-preserving ans\"atze in VQE research, offering insights that extend beyond supremacy debates and paving the way for more reliable and efficient quantum algorithms in the near term.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Quantum Communication for Quantum Data Centers with Reconfigurable Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC) enables scalability by interconnecting multiple QPUs. Among various DQC implementations, quantum data centers (QDCs), which utilize reconfigurable optical switch networks to link QPUs across different racks, are becoming feasible in the near term. However, the latency of cross-rack communications and dynamic reconfigurations poses unique challenges to quantum communication, significantly increasing the overall latency and exacerbating qubit decoherence. In this paper, we introduce a new optimization space to parallelize cross-rack communications and avoid frequent reconfigurations, which incurs additional in-rack communications that can be further minimized. Based on this, we propose a flexible scheduler that improves communication efficiency while preventing deadlocks and congestion caused by the flexibility. Through a comprehensive evaluation, we show that our approach reduces the overall latency by a factor of 8.02, thereby mitigating qubit decoherence, with a small overhead.</description>

      <title>Transfer of Fisher Information in Quantum Postselection Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Postselected weak measurement has shown significant potential for detecting small physical effects due to its unique weak-value-amplification phenomenon. Previous works suggest that Heisenberg-limit precision can be attained using only the optical coherent states. However, the measurement object is the distribution of postselection, limiting the practical applicability. Here, we demonstrate that the output photons can also reach the quantum scale by utilizing the Fisher information transfer effect. In addition, we consider the insertion of a power-recycling cavity and demonstrate its positive impact on the distribution of postselection. Our results enhance the quantum metrological advantages of the postselection strategy and broaden its application scope.</description>

      <title>Cutting is All You Need: Execution of Large-Scale Quantum Neural Networks on Limited-Qubit Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement in Quantum Computing (QC), particularly through Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, has spurred significant interest in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) applications. Despite their potential, fully-quantum QML algorithms remain impractical due to the limitations of current NISQ devices. Hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (HQNNs) have emerged as a viable alternative, leveraging both quantum and classical computations to enhance machine learning capabilities. However, the constrained resources of NISQ devices, particularly the limited number of qubits, pose significant challenges for executing large-scale quantum circuits.
  This work addresses these current challenges by proposing a novel and practical methodology for quantum circuit cutting of HQNNs, allowing large quantum circuits to be executed on limited-qubit NISQ devices. Our approach not only preserves the accuracy of the original circuits but also supports the training of quantum parameters across all subcircuits, which is crucial for the learning process in HQNNs. We propose a cutting methodology for HQNNs that employs a greedy algorithm for identifying efficient cutting points, and the implementation of trainable subcircuits, all designed to maximize the utility of NISQ devices in HQNNs. The findings suggest that quantum circuit cutting is a promising technique for advancing QML on current quantum hardware, since the cut circuit achieves comparable accuracy and much lower qubit requirements than the original circuit.</description>

      <title>Non-rotational measures in the Bargmann space, and entanglement of bipartite squeezed coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement of bipartite squeezed states generated by holomorphic Hermite functions of two complex variables is investigated using phase-space approach based on the Wigner distribution function. Orthogonality of the holomorphic Hermite functions implies the relationship between certain real parameter associated with the non-rotational measure in the Bargmann space and the squeezing parameter. The mutual relation between squeezing and entanglement is elucidated with the help of Peres-Horodecki positive partial transpose criterion formulated in the phase-space version for continuous-variable systems. The quantitative characteristics of the entanglement is determined using the log-negativity criterion. The oscillator-like model of a two-particle quantum-mechanical system is developed to illustrate the presented findings.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Multi-Parameter Sensing in a Single Mode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision metrology underpins scientific and technological advancements. Quantum metrology offers a pathway to surpass classical sensing limits by leveraging quantum states and measurement strategies. However, measuring multiple incompatible observables suffers from quantum backaction, where measurement of one observable pollutes a subsequent measurement of the other. This is a manifestation of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle for two non-commuting observables, such as position and momentum. Here, we demonstrate measurements of small changes in position and momentum where the uncertainties are simultaneously reduced below the standard quantum limit (SQL). We measure $\textit{modular observables}$ using tailored, highly non-classical states that ideally evade measurement backactions. The states are deterministically prepared in the single mode of the mechanical motion of a trapped ion using an optimal quantum control protocol. Our experiment uses grid states to measure small changes in position and momentum and shows a metrological gain of up to 5.1(5)~dB over the simultaneous SQL. Using an adaptive-phase estimation algorithm with Bayesian inference, we estimate these displacements with a combined variance of 2.6(1.1)~dB below the SQL. Furthermore, we examine simultaneously estimating $\textit{number}$ and $\textit{phase}$, which are the polar counterparts of position and momentum. This is performed by preparing a novel quantum resource -- number-phase states -- and we demonstrate a metrological gain over their SQL. The combination of quantum control and multi-parameter quantum metrology marks a significant step towards unprecedented precision with applications ranging from fundamental physics to advanced quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: The aim of the present note is to show that the method of our paper ArXiv:2408.11400 with minor extra efforts can be extended to obtain upper bounds for the Bures distance between quantum Gaussian states. We argue that these bounds are better adapted to the Bures distance and hence to the state estimation and learning with the Bures distance rather than that with the trace-norm distance.</description>

      <title>Enhancing low-temperature quantum thermometry via sequential measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a sequential measurement protocol for accurate low-temperature estimation. The resulting correlated outputs significantly enhance the low temperature precision compared to that of the independent measurement scheme. This enhancement manifests a Heisenberg scaling of the signal-to-noise ratio for small measurement numbers $N$. Detailed analysis reveals that the final precision is determined by the pair correlation of the sequential outputs, which produces a dependence $N^2$ on the signal-to-noise ratio. Remarkably, we find that quantum thermometry within the sequential protocol functions as a high-resolution quantum spectroscopy of the thermal noise, underscoring the pivotal role of the sequential measurements in enhancing the spectral resolution and the temperature estimation precision. Our methodology incorporates sequential measurement into low-temperature quantum thermometry, representing an important advancement in low-temperature measurement.</description>

      <title>Solid-state qubits in moire superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qubits are the fundamental units in quantum computing, but they are also pivotal for advancements in quantum communication and sensing. Currently, there are a variety of platforms for qubits, including cold atoms, superconducting circuits, point defects, and semiconductor quantum dots. In these systems, each qubit requires individual preparation, making identical replication a challenging task. Constructing and maintaining stable, scalable qubits remains a formidable challenge, especially for solid-state qubits. The race to identify the best one remains inconclusive, making the search for new qubits a welcome endeavor. Our study introduces moir\'e superlattices of twisted bilayer materials as a promising platform for qubits due to their tunability, natural patterns, and extensive materials library. Our first-principles calculations reveal that when the twist angle between the two layers is sufficiently small, these materials foster identical, localized quantum wells within the moir\'e superlattices. Each quantum well accommodates a few dispersionless bands and localized states, akin to the discrete energy levels of an alkali atom. Existing experimental techniques allow for individual initialization, manipulation, and readout of the local quantum states. The vast array of 2D materials provides a multitude of potential candidates for qubit exploration in such systems. Due to their inherent scalability and uniformity, our proposed qubits present significant advantages over conventional solid-state qubit systems.</description>

      <title>Computational Advantage in Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks: Myth or Reality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs) have gained attention for their potential to enhance computational performance by incorporating quantum layers into classical neural network (NN) architectures. However, a key question remains: Do quantum layers offer computational advantages over purely classical models? This paper explores how classical and hybrid models adapt their architectural complexity to increasing problem complexity. Using a multiclass classification problem, we benchmark classical models to identify optimal configurations for accuracy and efficiency, establishing a baseline for comparison. HQNNs, simulated on classical hardware (as common in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era), are evaluated for their scaling of floating-point operations (FLOPs) and parameter growth. Our findings reveal that as problem complexity increases, HQNNs exhibit more efficient scaling of architectural complexity and computational resources. For example, from 10 to 110 features, HQNNs show an 88.5% increase in FLOPs compared to 53.1% for classical models, despite simulation overheads. Additionally, the parameter growth rate is slower in HQNNs (81.4%) than in classical models (88.5%). These results highlight HQNNs' scalability and resource efficiency, positioning them as a promising alternative for solving complex computational problems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Security Analysis of the Key-Alternating Ciphers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the security of key-alternating ciphers (KAC), a generalization of Even-Mansour ciphers over multiple rounds, which serve as abstractions for many block cipher constructions, particularly AES. While the classical security of KAC has been extensively studied, little is known about its security against quantum adversaries. In this paper, we introduce the first nontrivial quantum key-recovery attack on multi-round KAC in a model where the adversary has quantum access to only one of the public permutations. Our attack applies to any $t$-round KAC, achieving quantum query complexity of $O(2^{\frac{t(t+1)n}{(t+1)^2+1}})$, where $n$ is the size of each individual key, in a realistic quantum threat model, compared to the classical bound of $O(2^{\frac{tn}{(t+1)}})$ queries given by Bogdanev et al. (EUROCRYPT 2012). Our quantum attack leverages a novel approach based on quantum walk algorithms. Additionally, using the quantum hybrid method in our new threat model, we extend the Even-Mansour lower bound of $\Omega(2^{\frac{n}{3}})$ given by Alagic et al. (EUROCRYPT 2022) to $\Omega(2^{\frac{(t-1)n}{t}})$ for the $t$-round KAC (for $t \geq 2$).</description>

      <title>Exact Model Reduction for Continuous-Time Open Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider finite-dimensional many-body quantum systems described by time-independent Hamiltonians and Markovian master equations, and present a systematic method for constructing smaller-dimensional, reduced models that exactly reproduce the time evolution of a set of initial conditions or observables of interest. Our approach exploits Krylov operator spaces and their extension to operator algebras, and may be used to obtain reduced linear models of minimal dimension, well-suited for simulation on classical computers, or reduced quantum models that preserve the structural constraints of physically admissible quantum dynamics, as required for simulation on quantum computers. Notably, we prove that the reduced quantum-dynamical generator is still in Lindblad form. By introducing a new type of observable-dependent symmetries, we show that our method provides a non-trivial generalization of techniques that leverage symmetries, unlocking new reduction opportunities. We quantitatively benchmark our method on paradigmatic open many-body systems of relevance to condensed-matter and quantum-information physics. In particular, we demonstrate how our reduced models can quantitatively describe decoherence dynamics in central-spin systems coupled to structured environments, magnetization transport in boundary-driven dissipative spin chains, and unwanted error dynamics on information encoded in a noiseless quantum code.</description>

      <title>Enhancing fidelity in teleportation of a two-qubit state via a quantum communication channel formed by spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg trimer chains due to a magnetic fieldxx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that two independent spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg trimer chains provide an effective platform for the quantum teleportation of any entangled two-qubit state through the quantum communication channel formed by two Heisenberg dimers. The reliability of this quantum channel is assessed by comparing the concurrences, which quantify a strength of the bipartite entanglement of the initial input state and the readout output state. Additionally, we rigorously calculate quantities fidelity and average fidelity to evaluate the quality of the teleportation protocol depending on temperature and magnetic field. It is evidenced that the efficiency of quantum teleportation of arbitrary entangled two-qubit state through this quantum communication channel can be significantly enhanced by moderate magnetic fields. This enhancement can be attributed to the magnetic-field-driven transition from a quantum antiferromagnetic phase to a quantum ferrimagnetic phase, which supports realization of a fully entangled quantum channel suitable for efficient quantum teleportation. The polymeric trimer chains Cu3(P2O6OH)2 are proposed as an experimental resource of this quantum communication channel, which provides an efficient platform for realization of the quantum teleportation up to moderate temperatures 40 K and extremely high magnetic fields 80 T.</description>

      <title>Predictive Window Decoding for Fault-Tolerant Quantum Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time decoding is a key ingredient in future fault-tolerant quantum systems, yet many decoders are too slow to run in real time. Prior work has shown that parallel window decoding schemes can scalably meet throughput requirements in the presence of increasing decoding times, given enough classical resources. However, windowed decoding schemes require that some decoding tasks be delayed until others have completed, which can be problematic during time-sensitive operations such as T gate teleportation, leading to suboptimal program runtimes. To alleviate this, we introduce a speculative window decoding scheme. Taking inspiration from branch prediction in classical computer architecture our decoder utilizes a light-weight speculation step to predict data dependencies between adjacent decoding windows, allowing multiple layers of decoding tasks to be resolved simultaneously. Through a state-of-the-art compilation pipeline and a detailed simulator, we find that speculation reduces application runtimes by 40% on average compared to prior parallel window decoders.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Generalization of Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While perturbation theories constitute a significant foundation of modern quantum system analysis, extending them from the Hermitian to the non-Hermitian regime remains a non-trivial task. In this work, we generalize the Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory to the non-Hermitian regime by employing a geometric formalism. This framework allows us to compute perturbative corrections to eigenstates and eigenvalues of Hamiltonians iteratively to any order. Furthermore, we observe that the recursion equation for the eigenstates resembles the form of the Girard-Newton formulas, which helps us uncover the general solution to the recursion equation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the perturbation method proposed in this paper reduces to the standard Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory in the Hermitian regime.</description>

Abstract: We numerically study the optimal control of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice. We present two generalizations of the gradient-based algorithm, GRAPE, in the non-linear case and for a two-dimensional lattice. We show how to construct such algorithms from Pontryagin's maximum principle. A wide variety of target states can be achieved with high precision by varying only the laser phases setting the lattice position. We discuss the physical relevance of the different results and the future directions of this work.</description>

      <title>Fast Laplace transforms on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While many classical algorithms rely on Laplace transforms, it has remained an open question whether these operations could be implemented efficiently on quantum computers. In this work, we introduce the Quantum Laplace Transform (QLT), which enables the implementation of $N\times N$ discrete Laplace transforms on quantum states encoded in $\lceil \log_2(N)\rceil$-qubits. In many cases, the associated quantum circuits have a depth that scales with $N$ as $O(\log(\log(N)))$ and a size that scales as $O(\log(N))$, requiring exponentially fewer operations and double-exponentially less computational time than their classical counterparts. These efficient scalings open the possibility of developing a new class of quantum algorithms based on Laplace transforms, with potential applications in physics, engineering, chemistry, machine learning, and finance.</description>

      <title>Scalable and shallow quantum circuits encoding probability distributions informed by asymptotic entanglement analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encoding classical data in a quantum state is a key prerequisite of many quantum algorithms. Recently matrix product state (MPS) methods emerged as the most promising approach for constructing shallow quantum circuits approximating input functions, including probability distributions, with only linear number of gates. We derive rigorous asymptotic expansions for the decay of entanglement across bonds in the MPS representation depending on the smoothness of the input function, real or complex. We also consider the dependence of the entanglement on localization properties and function support. Based on these analytical results we construct an improved MPS-based algorithm yielding shallow and accurate encoding quantum circuits. By using Tensor Cross Interpolation we are able to construct utility-scale quantum circuits in a compute- and memory-efficient way. We validate our methods on heavy-tailed distributions important in finance, including on L\'evy distributions. We test the performance of the resulting quantum circuits by executing and sampling from them on IBM quantum devices, for up to 64 qubits.</description>

      <title>Partial Wavefunction Collapse Under Repeated Weak Measurement of a non-Conserved Observable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two hallmarks of quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement are the ensemble-level conservation of the expectation value of the measured observable $A$ and the eventual, inevitable collapse of the system into some eigenstate of $A$. This requires that $A$ commutes with $H$, the system's Hamiltonian. In what we term "non-QND" measurement, $A$ does not commute with $H$ and these two characteristics clearly cannot be present as the system's dynamics prevent $\langle A \rangle$ from reaching a stable value. However, in this paper we find that under non-QND conditions, QND-like behavior can still arise, but is seen in the behavior of a secondary observable we call $B$, with the condition that $B$ commutes with both $A$ and $H$. In such cases, the expectation value of $B$ is conserved and the system at least partially collapses with respect to eigenstates of $B$. We show as an example how this surprising result applies to a Heisenberg chain, where we demonstrate that local measurements on a single site can reveal information about the entire system.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality reduction for closed-loop quantum gate calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical gate design typically makes use of high-dimensional parameterizations enabling sophisticated, highly expressive control pulses. Developing efficient experimental calibration methods for such gates is a long-standing challenge in quantum control, as on-device calibration requires the optimization of noisy experimental data over high-dimensional parameter spaces. To improve the efficiency of calibrations, we present a systematic method for reducing the dimensionality of the parameter space traversed in gate calibration, starting from an arbitrary high-dimensional pulse representation. We use this approach to design and calibrate an $X_{\pi/2}$ gate robust against amplitude and detuning errors, as well as an $X_{\pi/2}$ gate robust against coherent errors due to a spectator qubit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the estimation problem of the separation of two arbitrarily close incoherent point sources from the quantum Bayesian point of view, i.e., when a prior probability distribution function (PDF) on the separation is available. For the non-dispalced and displaced half-Gaussian prior PDF, we compare the performance of SPADE and direct imaging (DI) with the Bayesian minimum mean square error and by varying the prior PDF's parameters we discuss the regimes of superiority of either SPADE or DI.</description>

      <title>Superconductor-Insulator Transition in Weakly Monitored Josephson Junction Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control and manipulation of quantum states by measurements and bath engineering in open quantum systems, and associated phenomena, such as measurement-induced phase transitions, have emerged as new paradigms in many-body physics. Here, taking a prototypical example of Josephson junction arrays (JJAs), we show how repetitive monitoring can transform an insulating state in these systems to a superconductor and vice versa. To this end, we study the effects of continuous weak measurements and feedback control on isolated JJAs in the absence of any external thermal bath. The monitoring due to combined effect of measurements and feedback, inducing non-unitary evolution and dissipation, leads to a long-time steady state characterized by an effective temperature in a suitably defined semiclassical limit. However, we show that the quantum dissipation due to monitoring has fundamental differences with equilibrium quantum and/or thermal dissipation in the well-studied case of JJAs in contact with an Ohmic bath. In particular, using a variational approximation, and by considering the semiclassical, strong measurement/feedback and weak-coupling limits, we demonstrate that this difference can give rise to re-entrant steady-state phase transitions, resulting in transition from an effective low-temperature insulating normal state to superconducting state at intermediate temperature. Our work emphasizes the role of quantum feedback, that acts as an additional knob to control the effective temperature of non-equilibrium steady state leading to a phase diagram, not explored in earlier works on monitored and open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Zephyr quantum-assisted hierarchical Calo4pQVAE for particle-calorimeter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the approach of the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) era set to begin particle collisions by the end of this decade, it is evident that the computational demands of traditional collision simulation methods are becoming increasingly unsustainable. Existing approaches, which rely heavily on first-principles Monte Carlo simulations for modeling event showers in calorimeters, are projected to require millions of CPU-years annually -- far exceeding current computational capacities. This bottleneck presents an exciting opportunity for advancements in computational physics by integrating deep generative models with quantum simulations. We propose a quantum-assisted hierarchical deep generative surrogate founded on a variational autoencoder (VAE) in combination with an energy conditioned restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) embedded in the model's latent space as a prior. By mapping the topology of D-Wave's Zephyr quantum annealer (QA) into the nodes and couplings of a 4-partite RBM, we leverage quantum simulation to accelerate our shower generation times significantly. To evaluate our framework, we use Dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge 2022. Through the integration of classical computation and quantum simulation, this hybrid framework paves way for utilizing large-scale quantum simulations as priors in deep generative models.</description>

      <title>A simple model for longitudinal electron transport during and after laser excitation: Emergence of electron resistive transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-driven electron transport across a sample has garnered enormous attentions over several decades, as it provides a much faster way to control electron dynamics. Light is an electromagnetic wave, so how and why an electron can acquire a longitudinal velocity remains unanswered. Here we show that it is the magnetic field that steers the electron to the light propagation direction. But, quantitatively, our free-electron model is still unable to reproduce the experimental velocities. Going beyond the free electron mode and assuming the system absorbs all the photon energy, the theoretical velocity matches the experimental observation. We introduce a concept of the resistive transport, where electrons deaccelerate under a constant resistance after laser excitation. This theory finally explains why the experimental distance-versus-time forms a down-concave curve, and unifies ballistic and superdiffusive transports into a single resistive transport. We expect that our finding will motivate further investigations.</description>

      <title>Enlargement of symmetry groups in physics: a practitioner's guide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wigner's classification has led to the insight that projective unitary representations play a prominent role in quantum mechanics. The physics literature often states that the theory of projective unitary representations can be reduced to the theory of ordinary unitary representations by enlarging the group of physical symmetries. Nevertheless, the enlargement process is not always described explicitly: it is unclear in which cases the enlargement has to be done to the universal cover, a central extension, or to a central extension of the universal cover. On the other hand, in the mathematical literature, projective unitary representations were extensively studied, and famous theorems such as the theorems of Bargmann and Cassinelli have been achieved. The present article bridges the two: we provide a precise, step-by-step guide on describing projective unitary representations as unitary representations of the enlarged group. Particular focus is paid to the difference between algebraic and topological obstructions. To build the bridge mentioned above, we present a detailed review of the difference between group cohomology and Lie group cohomology. This culminates in classifying Lie group central extensions by smooth cocycles around the identity. Finally, the take-away message is a hands-on algorithm that takes the symmetry group of a given quantum theory as input and provides the enlarged group as output. This algorithm is applied to several cases of physical interest. We also briefly outline a generalization of Bargmann's theory to time-dependent phases using Hilbert bundles.</description>

      <title>Infinite Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operators for non-equilibrium quantum impurity problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An emergent numerical approach to solve quantum impurity problems is to encode the impurity path integral as a matrix product state. For time-dependent problems, the cost of this approach generally scales with the evolution time. Here we consider a common non-equilibrium scenario where an impurity, initially in equilibrium with a thermal bath, is driven out of equilibrium by a time-dependent force term. Despite that there is no time-translational invariance in the problem, we show that we could still make full use of the infinite matrix product state technique, resulting in a method whose cost is essentially independent of the evolution time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in the integrable case against exact diagonalization, and against existing calculations on the L-shaped Kadanoff-Baym contour in the general case. Our method could be a very competitive method for studying long-time non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, and be potentially used as an efficient impurity solver in the non-equilibrium dynamical mean field theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum-hydrodynamic modal perspective on plasmonic gap structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic gap structures are among the few configurations capable of generating extreme light confinement, finding applications in surface-enhanced spectroscopy, ultrasensitive detection, photocatalysis and more. Their plasmonic response undergoes a dramatic, quantum effect-driven transition as the gap size approaches zero. Modal analysis can reveal insights into the mechanisms governing this process, which are otherwise obscured by nonlocal damping effects. Here, we offer a fresh modal perspective on the transition of the plasmonic response using quantum hydrodynamic theory (QHT)-based quasinormal mode (QNM) analysis. Focusing on the bonding dipolar and charge-transfer plasmons of a nanosphere dimer, we examine the detailed mode transition through the touching regime as well as the asymptotic behavior compared with the classical results as the constituent nanoparticles either separate or overlap. The complex eigenfrequency particularly provides accurate information on the linewidth and quality factor of the plasmon modes. We introduce an index to characterize charge-transfer efficiency, especially for the charge-transfer plasmon. The significant role of nonlocal damping in the mode evolution is elucidated by our mode-resolved QHT-QNM analysis. The insights from our theoretical study provide an integrated understanding of mode evolution in plasmonic gap structures, which can further advance gap structure-based applications.</description>

      <title>Light-induced magnetic trapping for cold alkali atoms using a combined optical tweezers and nanofibre platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a magnetic trapping method for cold $^{87}$Rb atoms, utilising the light-induced magnetic fields from the evanescent field of an optical nanofibre (ONF) in conjunction with an optical tweezers. We calculate and plot the trapping potentials for both Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian modes of the optical tweezers, and quasi-linear polarisation of the ONF-guided field. Based on the optical powers in the tweezers beam and the ONF-guided mode, we analyse the trap depths and the distances of the trap minima from the surface of the nanofibre. We show that, by controlling the powers in both of the optical fields, one can vary the trap position over a few hundreds of nanometres, while also influencing the trap depth and trap frequencies. Such control over atom position is essential both for studying distance-dependent effects on atoms trapped near dielectric surfaces, and minimising these effects for quantum technology applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the framework recently proposed by Oppenheim et al. to model relativistic quantum fields coupled to relativistic, classical, stochastic fields (in particular, as a model of quantum matter coupled to ``classical gravity''). Perhaps surprisingly, we find that we can define and calculate scattering probabilities which are Lorentz-covariant and conserve total probability, at least at tree level. As a concrete example, we analyze $2 \to 2$ scattering of quantum matter mediated by a classical Yukawa field. Mapping this to a gravitational coupling in the non-relativistic limit, and assuming that we can treat large objects as point masses, we find that the simplest possible ``classical-quantum'' gravity theory constructed this way gives predictions for $2 \to 2$ gravitational scattering which are inconsistent with simple observations of, e.g., spacecraft undergoing slingshot maneuvers. We comment on lessons learned for attempts to couple quantum matter to ``non-quantum'' gravity, or more generally, for attempts to couple relativistic quantum and classical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In practice, qubit reset must be operated in an extremely short time, which incurs a thermodynamic cost within multiple orders of magnitude above the Landauer bound. We present a general framework to determine the minimal thermodynamic cost and the optimal protocol for arbitrary resetting speeds. Our study reveals the divergent behavior of minimal entropy production in the short-time limit depends on the convergence and divergence of the jump operators. For the convergent class, an inherent trade-off exists between the minimal required time and the set error probability, which hinders the Moore's law continuing in such cases. Moreover, we find the optimal protocol exhibits the similarity in the fast-driving regime for different times. To demonstrate our findings, we empoly fermionic and bosonic baths as examples. Our results suggest that the super-Ohmic bosonic heat bath is a suitable choice for qubit reset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Krylov complexity of thermofield double states in systems with mixed phase space, uncovering a direct correlation with the Brody distribution, which interpolates between Poisson and Wigner statistics. Our analysis spans two-dimensional random matrix models featuring (I) GOE-Poisson and (II) GUE-Poisson transitions and extends to higher-dimensional cases, including a stringy matrix model (GOE-Poisson) and the mass-deformed SYK model (GUE-Poisson). Krylov complexity consistently emerges as a reliable marker of quantum chaos, displaying a characteristic peak in the chaotic regime that gradually diminishes as the Brody parameter approaches zero, signaling a shift toward integrability. These results establish Krylov complexity as a powerful diagnostic of quantum chaos and highlight its interplay with eigenvalue statistics in mixed phase systems.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for classical and quantum uncertainty relations using stochastic representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) and kinetic uncertainty relations (KURs) provide tradeoff relations between measurement precision and thermodynamic cost such as entropy production and activity. Conventionally, these relations are derived using the Cram\'er-Rao inequality, which involves an auxiliary perturbation in deterministic differential equations governing the time evolution of the system's probability distribution. In this study, without relying on the previous formulation based on deterministic evolving equation, we demonstrate that all previously discovered uncertainty relations can be derived solely through the stochastic representation of the same dynamics. For this purpose, we propose a unified method based on stochastic representations for general Markovian dynamics. Extending beyond classical systems, we apply this method to Markovian open quantum systems by unraveling their dynamics, deriving quantum uncertainty relations that are physically more accessible and tighter in regimes where quantum effects play a significant role. This fully establishes uncertainty relations for both classical and quantum systems as intrinsic properties of their stochastic nature.</description>

      <title>Two-photon coupling via Josephson element I: Breaking the symmetry with magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a coupling element based on a symmetric superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and show that it mediates a two-photon interaction. This and other inductive interactions can be switched off in situ. We derive the system Hamiltonian for coupled resonator and rf SQUID. The rf SQUID dwells in the vicinity of its metastable well holding a number of energy states and acts as an artificial atom. We discuss how the Josephson symmetry breaks owing to magnetic fields in the superconducting loops. We assess that the two-photon coupling strength reaches 18 MHz which can exceed the single-photon capacitive interaction in the coupler.</description>

      <title>Ultralong-range Rydberg molecules of Hg atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralong-range Rydberg molecules, composed of an excited Rydberg atom and a ground-state atom, are characterized by large bond lengths, dipole moments, sensitivity to external fields, and an unusual binding mechanism based on low-energy elastic electron scattering. Although Rydberg molecules formed between alkali atoms have received the most attention, the additional complexity found in atoms with more than a single valence electron poses new theoretical challenges as well as new possibilities for control and design of the molecular structure. In this paper, we extend the theory of Rydberg molecules to include the additional spin coupling of the Rydberg states of a multivalent atom. We employ this theory to describe the properties of Rydberg molecules composed of mercury atoms. We calculate the potential energy curves of both heteronuclear (Hg*Rb) and homonuclear (Hg*Hg) molecules. In the former case, we propose the realization of long-range spin entanglement and remote spin flip. In the latter, we show how long-lived metastable molecular states of Hg*Hg exist as resonances above the dissociation threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schr\"odinger's cat is an iconic example for the problem of the transition from the microscopic quantum world to the macroscopic, classical one. It opened many interesting questions such as, could a macroscopic superposition like a dead and alive cat ever exist? What would be the characteristic features of such a system? The field of macroscopicity aims at providing answers to those questions, both from a theoretical and an experimental point of view. Here, we present the main concepts in macroscopicity, including macroscopicity measures, experimental realizations and the link to metrology, from a pedagogical perspective. We provide visualizations and intuitive explanations, together with a hands-on activity where students can create their own macroscopic quantum cats from cardboard cells that are in a superposition of being dead and alive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.10078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the classical-quantum correspondence in the inverted harmonic oscillator (IHO) system. It is shown that the out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) which the initial states are located at any position in the IHO system possess the same exponential growth rates (EGRs) as that at the saddle point, and their EGRs are twice the classical lyapunov exponent (CLE) of the saddle point. Through the time evolution of mean photon number and the OTOCs, we exhibit that the classical-quantum correspondence in the IHO system not only depends on the initial system photon number, but also on the central positions of the initial states in the phase space. Moreover, we use the Husimi Q function to visualize the quantum wave packets during the OTOCs grow exponentially.</description>

      <title>Optimization for the propagation of a multiparticle quantum walk in a one-dimensional lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum walk is a quantum counterpart of the classical random walk that exhibits nonclassical behaviors and outperforms the classical random walk in various aspects. It has been known that a single particle can be propagated by a discrete-time quantum walk with a quadratic time scaling in the variance of position distribution, beating the linear time scaling in a classical random walk. In this paper, we consider the discrete-time quantum walk for multiple particles in a one-dimensional lattice, and investigate the optimization of the joint coin state to enhance the spatial propagation of the particles in the lattice. We study the asymptotic evolution of position distribution for multiple particles in the long-time limit, and analytically optimize the joint coin state to derive the maximum variance of the position distribution between the particles after the evolution of the quantum walk. An interesting result is that an optimized coin state always possesses specific exchange symmetry which can be characterized by a graph consisting of two disconnected complete subgraphs and the exchange symmetry can significantly influence the position correlations between the particles, showing the critical role of coin symmetry in the propagation of multiple particles by the quantum walk. We further study the entanglement of the optimized coin states to show the relation of the coin correlations to the particle position distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The limits of quantum feedback control have immediate consequences for quantum information science at large, yet remain largely unexplored. Here, we combine quantum filtering theory and moment-sum-of-squares techniques to construct a hierarchy of convex optimization problems that furnish monotonically improving, computable bounds on the best attainable performance for a broad class of quantum feedback control problems. These bounds may serve as witnesses of fundamental limitations, optimality certificates, or performance targets. We prove convergence of the bounds to the optimal control performance under technical conditions and demonstrate the practical utility of our approach by designing certifiably near-optimal controllers for a qubit in a cavity subjected to photon counting and homodyne detection measurements.</description>

      <title>Path distributions for describing eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator and other 1-dimensional problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11155v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The manner in which probability amplitudes of paths sum up to form wave functions of a harmonic oscillator, as well as other, simple 1-dimensional problems, is described. Using known, closed-form, path-based propagators for each problem, an integral expression is written that describes the wave function. This expression conventionally takes the form of an integral over initial locations of a particle, but it is re-expressed here in terms of a characteristic momentum associated with motion between the endpoints of a path. In this manner, the resulting expression can be analyzed using a generalization of stationary-phase analysis, leading to distributions of paths that exactly describe each eigenstate. These distributions are valid for all travel times, but when evaluated for long times they turn out to be real, non-negative functions of the characteristic momentum. For the harmonic oscillator in particular, a somewhat broad distribution is found, peaked at value of momentum that corresponds to a classical energy which in turn equals the energy eigenvalue for the state being described.</description>

      <title>What can we learn from quantum convolutional neural networks?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) shows promise for analyzing quantum data. A notable example is the use of quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), implemented as specific types of quantum circuits, to recognize phases of matter. In this approach, ground states of many-body Hamiltonians are prepared to form a quantum dataset and classified in a supervised manner using only a few labeled examples. However, this type of dataset and model differs fundamentally from typical QML paradigms based on feature maps and parameterized circuits. In this study, we demonstrate how models utilizing quantum data can be interpreted through hidden feature maps, where physical features are implicitly embedded via ground-state feature maps. By analyzing selected examples previously explored with QCNNs, we show that high performance in quantum phase recognition comes from generating a highly effective basis set with sharp features at critical points. The learning process adapts the measurement to create sharp decision boundaries. Our analysis highlights improved generalization when working with quantum data, particularly in the limited-shots regime. Furthermore, translating these insights into the domain of quantum scientific machine learning, we demonstrate that ground-state feature maps can be applied to fluid dynamics problems, expressing shock wave solutions with good generalization and proven trainability.</description>

      <title>Teleportation of a genuine single-rail vacuum-one-photon qubit generated via a quantum dot source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state teleportation represents a pillar of quantum information and a milestone on the roadmap towards quantum networks with a large number of nodes. Successful photonic demonstrations of this protocol have been carried out employing different qubit encodings. However, demonstrations in the Fock basis encoding are challenging, due to the impossibility of generating a coherent superposition of vacuum-one photon states on a single mode with linear optics. Indeed, previous realizations only allowed the teleportation of dual-rail entangled states, by exploiting ancillary electromagnetic modes. Here, instead, we enable the quantum teleportation of pure vacuum-one-photon qubits encoded in a single spatial mode, by exploiting coherent control of a resonantly excited semiconductor quantum dot in a micro-cavity. Within our setup, we can both teleport genuine single-rail vacuum-one-photon qubits and perform entanglement swapping. Our results may disclose new quantum information processing potentialities for this encoding, whose manipulation is achievable via quantum dot single-photon sources.</description>

Abstract: Multi-photon dynamics beyond linear optical materials are of significant fundamental and technological importance in quantum information processing. However, it remains largely unexplored in nonlinear waveguide QED. In this work, we theoretically propose a structured nonlinear waveguide in the presence of staggered photon-photon interactions, which supports two branches of gaped bands for doublons (i.e., spatially bound-photon-pair states). In contrast to linear waveguide QED systems, we identify two important contributions to its dynamical evolution, i.e., single-photon bound states (SPBSs) and doublon bound states (DBSs). Most remarkably, the nonlinear waveguide can mediate the long-range four-body interactions between two emitter pairs, even in the presence of disturbance from SPBS. By appropriately designing system's parameters, we can achieve high-fidelity four-body Rabi oscillations mediated only by virtual doublons in DBSs. Our findings pave the way for applying structured nonlinear waveguide QED in multi-body quantum information processing and quantum simulations among remote sites.</description>

      <title>Experimental realization of universal quantum gates and six-qubit entangled state using photonic quantum walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For quantum computation using photons, performing deterministic quantum gate operations is a challenge due to the probabilistic nature of the photon-photon interaction. Encoding qubits in multiple degrees-of-freedom of photons and controlling operations between them is one of the promising ways to navigate the probabilistic behavior. Using single-photon discrete-time quantum walk in combination with polarization and path degrees-of-freedom, we experimentally demonstrate the realization of a universal set of quantum gates with high fidelity at room temperature. The deterministic realization of quantum gates through photonic quantum walk are characterized via quantum state tomography. For a three-qubit system using a single photon, the first qubit is encoded using polarization information, and the other two qubits are encoded using path information, closely resembling a Galton-board setup. To generate a six-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, entangled photon pairs are used to entangle the two three-qubit modules on which gate operations are performed. We also provide insights into the mapping of photonic quantum walk operations to quantum circuits and propose methods to resourcefully scale. This demonstration marks a significant progress towards using quantum walks for quantum computing and provides a framework for using fewer photons in combination with different degrees-of-freedom of photon to scale the number of qubits.</description>

      <title>A tweezer array with 6100 highly coherent atomic qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have had a transformative impact on atomic and molecular physics over the past years, and they now form the backbone for a wide range of leading experiments in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology. Typical experiments trap tens to hundreds of atomic qubits, and very recently systems with around one thousand atoms were realized without demonstrating coherent control. However, scaling to thousands of atomic qubits with long coherence times and low-loss, high-fidelity imaging is an outstanding challenge and critical for progress in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology, in particular, towards applications with quantum error correction. Here, we experimentally realize an array of optical tweezers trapping over 6,100 neutral atoms in around 12,000 sites while simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art performance for several critical metrics that underpin the success of the platform. Specifically, while scaling to such a large number of atoms, we also demonstrate a coherence time of 12.6(1) seconds, a record for hyperfine qubits in an optical tweezer array. Further, we show trapping lifetimes close to 23 minutes in a room-temperature apparatus, enabling record-high imaging survival of 99.98952(1)% in combination with an imaging fidelity of over 99.99%. We lay out a detailed, near-term plan to enable zone-based quantum computing with $\sim$6,000 atoms, and demonstrate a crucial ingredient thereof: coherent moves of up to 610 $\mu$m with a fidelity of $\sim$99.95%, as characterized through interleaved randomized benchmarking. Our results, together with other recent developments, indicate that universal quantum computing with ten thousand atomic qubits could be a near-term prospect. Furthermore, our work could pave the way for quantum simulation and metrology experiments with inherent single particle readout and positioning capabilities at a similar scale.</description>

      <title>Stronger speed limit for observables: Tight bound for the capacity of entanglement, the modular Hamiltonian and the charging of a quantum battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How fast an observable can evolve in time is answered by so-called ``observable speed limit". Here, we prove a stronger version of the observable speed limit and show that the previously obtained bound is a special case of the new bound. The stronger quantum speed limit for the state also follows from the stronger quantum speed limit for observables (SQSLO). We apply this to prove a stronger bound for the entanglement rate using the notion of capacity of entanglement (the quantum information theoretic counterpart of the heat capacity), and show that it outperforms previous bounds. Furthermore, we apply the SQSLO for the rate of modular Hamiltonian and in the context of interacting qubits in a quantum battery. These illustrative examples reveal that the speed limit for the modular energy and the time required to charge the battery can be exactly predicted using the new bound. This shows that for estimating the charging time of quantum battery, SQSLO is actually tight, i.e. it saturates. Our findings can have important applications in quantum thermodynamics, the complexity of operator growth, predicting the time rate of quantum correlation growth, and quantum technology in general.</description>

We compare the properties of underlying quantum models with ubiquitous Fourier-type quantum models, and show that ground state embeddings can be described effectively by a spectrum with degree that grows rapidly with the number of qubits, corresponding to a large model capacity. We observe that the spectrum contains massive frequency degeneracies, and the weighting coefficients for the modes are highly structured, thus limiting model expressivity. Our results provide a step towards understanding models based on quantum data, and contribute to fundamental knowledge needed for building efficient quantum machine learning (QML) protocols. As non-trivial embeddings are crucial for designing QML protocols that cannot be simulated classically, our findings guide the search for high-capacity quantum models that can largely outperform classical models.</description>

      <title>Stark localization near Aubry-Andr\'e criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Stark localization near the Aubry-Andr\'{e} (AA) critical point. We perform careful studies for reporting system-dependent parameters, such as localization length, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and energy gap between the ground and first excited state, for characterizing the localization-delocalization transition. We show that the scaling exponents possessed by these key descriptors of localization are quite different from that of a pure AA model or Stark model. Near the critical point of the AA model, in the presence of Stark field of strength $h$, the localization length $\zeta$ scales as $\zeta\propto h^{-\nu}$ with $\nu\approx0.29$ which is different than both the pure AA model ($\nu=1$) and Stark model ($\nu\approx0.33$). The IPR in this case scales as IPR $\propto h^{s}$ with $s\approx0.096$ which is again significantly different than both the pure AA model ($s\approx0.33$) and Stark model ($s\approx0.33$). The energy gap, $\Delta$, scales as $E\propto h^{\nu z}$, where $z\approx2.37$ which is however same as the pure AA model. Finally, we discuss how invoking a criticality inducing additional control parameter may help in designing better many-body quantum sensors. Quantum critical sensors exploit the venerability of the wavefunction near the quantum critical point against small parameter shifts. By incorporating a control parameter in the form of the quasi-periodic field, i.e., the AA potential, we show a significant advantage can be drawn in estimating an unknown parameter, which is considered here to be the Stark weak field strength, with high precision.</description>

      <title>Maxwell's demon across the quantum-to-classical transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In scenarios coined Maxwell's demon, information on microscopic degrees of freedom is used to seemingly violate the second law of thermodynamics. This has been studied in the classical as well as the quantum domain. In this paper, we study an implementation of Maxwell's demon that can operate in both domains. In particular, we investigate information-to-work conversion over the quantum-to-classical transition. The demon continuously measures the charge state of a double quantum dot, and uses this information to guide electrons against a voltage bias by tuning the on-site energies of the dots. Coherent tunneling between the dots allows for the buildup of quantum coherence in the system. Under strong measurements, the coherence is suppressed, and the system is well-described by a classical model. As the measurement strength is further increased, the Zeno effect prohibits interdot tunneling. A Zeno-like effect is also observed for weak measurements, where measurement errors lead to fluctuations in the on-site energies, dephasing the system. We anticipate similar behaviors in other quantum systems under continuous measurement and feedback control, making our results relevant for implementations in quantum technology and quantum control.</description>

Abstract: Nonpolar atoms or molecules with low particle mass and weak inter-particle interactions can form quantum liquids and solids (QLS) at low temperatures. Excess electrons naturally bind to the surfaces of QLS in a vacuum, exhibiting unique quantum electronic behaviors in two and lower dimensions. This article reviews the historical development and recent progress in this field. Key topics include collective and individual electron transport on liquid helium, solid neon, and solid hydrogen; theoretical proposals and experimental efforts toward single-electron qubits on superfluid helium; the recent experimental realization of single-electron charge qubits on solid neon; and related theoretical calculations. Finally, we discuss and envision future exploration of quantum electronics in heterogeneous QLS systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced sensing of Stark weak field under the influence of Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The localization-delocalization transition can be leveraged as a resource for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity in parameter estimation. We demonstrate that by employing different classes of localization-delocalization transition potentials one can significantly enhance the precision of parameter estimation. Specifically, we focus on the precision measurement of the Stark strength parameter encoded in the ground state of a one-dimensional fermionic lattice under the influence of Aubry-Andr{\'e}-Harper (AAH) localization-delocalization transition. We consider the single-particle system and the system at half-filling. Our work reveals that the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) offers a superior scaling with respect to the system size in comparison to the pure stark case, leading to a better parameter estimation. However, experimentally measuring fidelity-based QFI in a many-body system poses significant challenges. To address this, we suggest experimentally relevant operators that can be utilized to achieve precision surpassing the Heisenberg Limit (HL) or can even saturate the QFI scaling. These operators, relevant for practical experimental setups, provides a feasible pathway to harness the advantages offered by the localization-delocalization transition by exploiting two distinct localizing potentials for quantum-enhanced parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Distributing quantum correlations through local operations and classical resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributing quantum correlations to each node of a network is a key aspect of quantum networking. Here, we present a robust, physically motivated protocol by which global quantum correlations, as characterized by the discord, can be distributed to quantum memories using a mixed state of information carriers which possesses only classical correlations. In addition, such distribution is done using only bilocal unitary operations and projective measurements, with the degree of discord being measurement-outcome independent. We explore the scaling of the performance of the proposed protocol with the size of the network and illustrate the structure of quantum correlations that are shared by the nodes, showing its dependence on the local operations performed. Finally, we find the counterintuitive result that even more discord can be generated when the resource state undergoes correlated dephasing noise, allowing high fidelities with mixtures of the Bell basis such as Werner states.</description>

      <title>Dephasing-Induced Distribution of Entanglement in Tripartite Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preserving multipartite entanglement amidst decoherence poses a pivotal challenge in quantum information processing. However, assessing multipartite entanglement in mixed states amid decoherence presenting a formidable task. Employing reservoir memory offers a means to attenuate the decoherence dynamics impacting multipartite entanglement, thereby slowing its degradation. One of the important measures which can be implemented to quantify entanglement is the relative entropy of entanglement. Although this measure is not monogamous \cite{horodeckirev2009}, it can universally be applied to both pure and mixed states. Based on this fundamental novelty, in this work, therefore, we introduce a quantifier which will investigate how entanglement remain distributed among the qubits of multipartite states when these states are exposed to multipartite dephasing setting. For our study we use various pure and mixed tripartite states subjected to finite temperature in both Markovian and non-Markovian local/common bath. Here, we consider situations where the three qubits interact with a common reservoir as well as a local bosonic reservoir. We also show that the robustness of a quantum system to decoherence depends on the distribution of entanglement and its interaction with various configurations of the bath. When each qubit has its own local environment, the system exhibits different distribution dynamics compared to when all three qubits share a common environment with one exception regarding a mixed state.</description>

Abstract: The advent of quantum computers has justified the development of quantum machine learning algorithms , based on the adaptation of the principles of machine learning to the formalism of qubits. Among such quantum algorithms, anomaly detection represents an important problem crossing several disciplines from cybersecurity, to fraud detection to particle physics. We summarize the key concepts involved in quantum computing, introducing the formal concept of quantum speed up. The review provides a structured map of anomaly detection based on quantum machine learning. We have grouped existing algorithms according to the different learning methods, namely quantum supervised, quantum unsupervised and quantum reinforcement learning, respectively. We provide an estimate of the hardware resources to provide sufficient computational power in the future. The review provides a systematic and compact understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. We eventually provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the learning methods in real application domains.</description>

      <title>Phonon-mediated quantum gates in trapped ions coupled to an ultracold atomic gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of phonon-mediated qubit-qubit interactions between trapped ions in the presence of an ultracold atomic gas. By deriving and solving a master equation to describe the combined system, we show that the presence of the atoms causes the quantum gate quality to reduce because of motional decoherence. On the other hand, we calculate that the gas may be used to keep the ion crystal cold in the presence of external heating due to electric field noise. We show that tuning the atom-ion scattering length allows one to tune the cooling rate of the ions and would make it possible to temporarily reduce the effects of the gas during a quantum gate while keeping the ions cold over long timescales. In this way, the trapped ion quantum computer may be buffer gas cooled. The system may also be used for quantum-enhanced measurements of the atom-ion interactions or properties of the atomic bath.</description>

      <title>Gauge-Fixing Quantum Density Operators At Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide theory, algorithms, and simulations of non-equilibrium quantum systems using a one-dimensional (1D) completely-positive (CP), matrix-product (MP) density-operator ($\rho$) representation. By generalizing the matrix product state's orthogonality center, to additionally store positive classical mixture correlations, the MP$\rho$ factorization naturally emerges. In this work we analytically and numerically examine the virtual freedoms associated with the representation of quantum density operators. Using this augmented perspective, we simplify algorithms in certain limits to integrate the canonical form's master equation dynamics. This enables us to quickly evolve under the dynamics of two-body quantum channels without resorting to optimization-based methods. In addition to this technical advance, we also scale-up numerical examples and discuss implications for accurately modeling hardware architectures and predicting their performance. This includes an example of the quantum to classical transition of informationally leaky, i.e., decohering, qubits. In this setting, due to loss from environmental interactions, non-local complex coherence correlations are converted into global incoherent classical statistical mixture correlations. Lastly, the representation of both global and local correlations is discussed. We expect this work to have applications in additional non-equilibrium settings, beyond qubit engineering.</description>

      <title>Virtual entanglement purification via noisy entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computation (DQC) is a promising approach for scalable quantum computing, where high-fidelity non-local operations among remote devices are required for universal quantum computation. These operations are typically implemented through state and gate teleportation with the consumption of high-fidelity entanglement prepared via entanglement purification. However, noisy local operations and classical communication (LOCC) limit the fidelity of purified entanglement, thereby degrading the quality of non-local operations. Meanwhile, circuit knitting and cutting, which simulate non-local operations by preparing separable states along with LOCC, has been considered for DQC as an alternative. Although this approach needs no entanglement among remote devices, it requires excessive circuit runs. Here, we present a protocol utilizing virtual operations that purifies noisy entanglement at the level of expectation values. Our protocol offers the following advantages over conventional methods: surpasses the fidelity limit of entanglement purification in the presence of noise in LOCC, requires fewer sampling shots than circuit knitting, and exhibits robustness against infidelity fluctuations in shared noisy Bell states, unlike probabilistic error cancellation. Our protocol bridges the gap between the entanglement-based and circuit-knitting DQC methods, offering a flexible approach to achieve further scalability despite hardware limitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many of the envisioned use-cases for quantum computers involve optimisation processes. While there are many algorithmic primitives to perform the required calculations, all eventually lead to quantum gates operating on quantum bits, with an order as determined by the structure of the objective function and the properties of target hardware. When the structure of the problem representation is not aligned with structure and boundary conditions of the executing hardware, various overheads degrading the computation may arise, possibly negating any possible quantum advantage.
  Therefore, automatic transformations of problem representations play an important role in quantum computing when descriptions (semi-)targeted at humans must be cast into forms that can be executed on quantum computers. Mathematically equivalent formulations are known to result in substantially different non-functional properties depending on hardware, algorithm and detail properties of the problem. Given the current state of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, these effects are considerably more pronounced than in classical computing. Likewise, efficiency of the transformation itself is relevant because possible quantum advantage may easily be eradicated by the overhead of transforming between representations. In this paper, we consider a specific class of higher-level representations, i.e. polynomial unconstrained binary optimisation problems, and devise novel automatic transformation mechanisms into widely used quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation problems that substantially improve efficiency and versatility over the state of the art. We also identify what influence factors of lower-level details can be abstracted away in the transformation process, and which details must be made available to higher-level abstractions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) in federated learning (FL) has led to significant advances in data privacy. However, during the aggregation phase, it often results in performance degradation of the aggregated model, hindering the development of robust representational generalization. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal quantum federated learning framework that utilizes quantum computing to counteract the performance drop resulting from FHE. For the first time in FL, our framework combines a multimodal quantum mixture of experts (MQMoE) model with FHE, incorporating multimodal datasets for enriched representation and task-specific learning. Our MQMoE framework enhances performance on multimodal datasets and combined genomics and brain MRI scans, especially for underrepresented categories. Our results also demonstrate that the quantum-enhanced approach mitigates the performance degradation associated with FHE and improves classification accuracy across diverse datasets, validating the potential of quantum interventions in enhancing privacy in FL.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing holds promise across various fields, particularly with the advent of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, which can outperform classical supercomputers in specific tasks. However, challenges such as noise and limited qubit capabilities hinder its practical applications. Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) offer a viable strategy to achieve quantum advantage by combining quantum and classical computing. Leveraging on VQAs, the performance of Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQCs) is competitive with many classical classifiers. This work implements a VQC using a silicon-based quantum photonic microprocessor and a classical computer, demonstrating its effectiveness in nonlinear binary and multi-classification tasks. An efficient gradient free genetic algorithm is employed for training. The VQC's performance was evaluated on three synthetic binary classification tasks with square-, circular-, and sine-shape decision boundaries and a real-world multiclass Iris dataset. The accuracies on the three binary classification tasks were 87.5%, 92.5%, and 85.0%, respectively, and 98.8% on the real world Iris dataset, highlighting the platform's potential to handle complex data patterns.</description>

      <title>Searches for exotic spin-dependent interactions with spin sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous theories have postulated the existence of exotic spin-dependent interactions beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Spin-based quantum sensors, which utilize the quantum properties of spins to enhance measurement precision, emerge as powerful tools for probing these exotic interactions. These sensors encompass a wide range of technologies, such as optically pumped magnetometers, atomic comagnetometers, spin masers, nuclear magnetic resonance, spin amplifiers, and nitrogen-vacancy centers. These technologies stand out for their ultrahigh sensitivity, compact tabletop design, and cost-effectiveness, offering complementary approaches to the large-scale particle colliders and astrophysical observations. This article reviews the underlying physical principles of various spin sensors and highlights the recent theoretical and experimental progress in the searches for exotic spin-dependent interactions with these quantum sensors. Investigations covered include the exotic interactions of spins with ultralight dark matter, exotic spin-dependent forces, electric dipole moment, spin-gravity interactions, and among others. Ongoing and forthcoming experiments using advanced spin-based sensors to investigate exotic spin-dependent interactions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Squeezing and Entanglement Dynamics in Phase-Sensitive Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decade, parity-time (PT) symmetry and anti-PT (APT) symmetry in various physical systems have been extensively studied, leading to significant experimental and theoretical advancements. However, physical systems that simultaneously exhibit both PT and APT symmetry have not yet been explored. In this study, we construct a phase-sensitive non-Hermitian wave mixing model that inherently possesses single-mode APT symmetry. By tuning the phase of the pump field, this model simultaneously exhibits two-mode quadrature-PT symmetry. Moreover, the APT phase transition is accompanied by the emergence of quantum entanglement from absence to presence. This remarkable quantum effect, quantum entanglement, which distinguishes itself from classical physics, is surprisingly linked to APT symmetry phase transition. Our work further explores the relationship between two-mode quantum entanglement and the phase of the pump field, offering deeper insight into the generation and evolution of entanglement in the corresponding nonlinear system. This provides a new perspective on quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>A robust quantum nonlinear solver based on the asymptotic numerical method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers a promising new avenue for advancing computational methods in science and engineering. In this work, we introduce the quantum asymptotic numerical method, a novel quantum nonlinear solver that combines Taylor series expansions with quantum linear solvers to efficiently address nonlinear problems. By linearizing nonlinear problems using the Taylor series, the method transforms them into sequences of linear equations solvable by quantum algorithms, thus extending the convergence region for solutions and simultaneously leveraging quantum computational advantages. Numerical tests on the quantum simulator Qiskit confirm the convergence and accuracy of the method in solving nonlinear problems. Additionally, we apply the proposed method to a beam buckling problem, demonstrating its robustness in handling strongly nonlinear problems and its potential advantages in quantum resource requirements. Furthermore, we perform experiments on a superconducting quantum processor from Quafu, successfully achieving up to 98% accuracy in the obtained nonlinear solution path. We believe this work contributes to the utility of quantum computing in scientific computing applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cherenkov transition of finite momentum Bose polarons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.12260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of a finite-momentum impurity immersed in a weakly interacting three-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of ultra-cold atoms, giving a detailed account of the dynamical quantum Cherenkov transition discussed in Ref. [arXiv:2101.00030]. Using a time-dependent variational approach, we identify a transition in the far-from-equilibrium dynamics of the system after the attractive short-range impurity-boson interaction is quenched on. The transition occurs as the impurity's velocity crosses an interaction-dependent critical value, and manifests in the long-time behavior of the Loschmidt echo and average impurity velocity. This behavior is also reflected in the finite momentum ground state of the system, where the group velocity of the interaction-dressed impurity loses it's dependence on the total momentum of the system as the critical point is crossed. The transition we discuss should be experimentally observable via a variety of common protocols in ultracold atomic systems such as time-of-flight imaging, RF spectroscopy, Ramsey interferometry, and absorption imaging.</description>

      <title>Finite-frequency noise, Fano factor, $\Delta T$-noise and cross-correlations in double quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A theoretical study on electrical current fluctuations in a double quantum dot connected to electronic reservoirs is presented, with the aim of deriving the finite-frequency noise, the Fano factor and the $\Delta T$-noise. We establish a general expression for the noise in terms of Green functions in the double quantum dot and self-energies in the reservoirs. This result is then applied to model double quantum dots in various situations. For a non-interacting double quantum dot, we highlight several interesting features in the physical properties of this system. In particular, we demonstrate the possibility of obtaining a significant reduction in zero-frequency noise and Fano factor either when the system is placed in a given operating regime, or when a temperature gradient is applied between the two reservoirs, resulting in a negative $\Delta T$-noise being generated. In addition, in the vicinity of honeycomb vertices, a sign change is observed in the finite-frequency cross-correlator between the two reservoirs, in contrast to what is obtained for the zero-frequency cross-correlator, which remains negative throughout the $(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2)$-plane, $\varepsilon_{1,2}$ being the level energies in each of the two dots. By using an approximate first-level numerical approach, we finally study how the finite-frequency noise in a double quantum dot evolves under the influence of Coulomb interactions.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian Approach to Barrier Option Pricing Under Vasicek Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study option pricing under Vasicek Model by a Hamiltonian approach. Since the interest rate changes with time, we split the time to maturity into infinite steps, and the matrix element during each step could be calculated by quantum mechanics methods. Using completeness condition, the pricing kernel and the integral expression of option price could also be derived. Numerical results of option prices as functions of underlying asset price, floating rate and regression rate are also shown.</description>

      <title>Exact deconfined gauge structures in the higher-spin Yao-Lee model: a quantum spin-orbital liquid with spin fractionalization and non-Abelian anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-integrable higher spin Kitaev honeycomb model has an exact $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge structure, which exclusively identifies quantum spin liquid (QSL) in the half-integer spin Kitaev model. But its constraints for the integer-spin Kitaev model are much limited, and even trivially gapped insulators cannot be excluded. The physical implications of exact $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge structure, especially $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes, in integer-spin models remain largely unexplored. In this Letter, we theoretically show that a spin-S Yao-Lee model (a spin-orbital model with SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry) possesses a topologically-nontrivial quantum spin-orbital liquid (QSOL) ground state for any spin (both integer and half-integer spin) by constructing exact deconfined fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges. We further show that the conserved $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux can also demonstrate the intriguing spin fractionalization phenomena in the nonabelian topological order phase of the spin-1 Yao-Lee model. Its deconfined $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex excitation carries fractionalized spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ quantum number in the low-energy subspace, which is also an nonabelian anyon. Our exact manifestation of spin fractionalization in an integer-spin model is rather rare in previous studies, and is absent in the Kitaev honeycomb model.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Superconducting Magnetoelectric Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18616v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supercurrent flow can induce a nonvanishing spin magnetization in noncentrosymmetric superconductors with spin-orbit interaction. Often known as the non-dissipative magnetoelectric effect, these are most commonly found at linear order in supercurrent flow. Here, we propose that a {\it nonlinear} superconducting magnetoelectric (NSM) effect can naturally manifest in magnet/superconductor heterostructures. In such platforms, NSM manifests as the spin polarization generated as a second-order response to a driving supercurrent. Strikingly, we find NSM survives centrosymmetry and is the leading order magnetic response in a variety of magnetic materials that include both collinear magnets [e.g., $d$-wave planar altermagnet thin film/superconductor (ALM/SC)] as well as noncollinear magnets (e.g., Kagome/SC systems). This renders NSM a powerful electric and non-dissipative means of controlling magnetization in magnet/superconductor heterostructures, a promising platform for superconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>The Fock-space landscape of many-body localisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article reviews recent progress in understanding the physics of many-body localisation (MBL) in disordered and interacting quantum many-body systems, from the perspective of ergodicity breaking on the associated Fock space. This approach to MBL is underpinned by mapping the dynamics of the many-body system onto that of a fictitious single particle on the high-dimensional, correlated and disordered Fock-space graph; yet, as we elaborate, the problem is fundamentally different from that of conventional Anderson localisation on high-dimensional or hierarchical graphs. We discuss in detail the nature of eigenstate correlations on the Fock space, both static and dynamic, and in the ergodic and many-body localised phases as well as in the vicinity of the MBL transition. The latter in turn sheds light on the nature of the transition, and motivates a scaling theory for it in terms of Fock-space based quantities. We also illustrate how these quantities can be concretely connected to real-space observables. An overview is given of several analytical and numerical techniques which have proven important in developing a comprehensive picture. Finally, we comment on some open questions in the field of MBL where the Fock-space approach is likely to prove insightful.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Quasiparticle Relaxation in a Superconductor via the Proximity Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticle relaxation in pure superconductors is thought to be determined by the intrinsic inelastic scattering rate in the material. In certain applications, i.e. superconducting qubits and circuits, excess quasiparticles exist at densities far beyond the thermal equilibrium level, potentially leading to dephasing and energy loss. In order to engineer superconductors with shorter overall quasiparticle lifetimes, we consider the impact of a proximity layer on the transport of quasiparticles in a superconductor. We find that a normal metal layer can be used to significantly increase the relaxation rate of quasiparticles in a superconductor, as seen by a large reduction in the quasiparticle charge imbalance in a fully proximitized Cu/Al bilayer wire. The mechanism for this effect may be useful for preventing quasiparticle poisoning of qubits using carefully chosen proximity bilayers consisting of clean superconductors and disordered normal metals.</description>

      <title>Optimization of the sensitivity of a temperature sensor based on germanium-vacancy color center (GeV) in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temperature sensors based on the GeV color center in diamond are gaining considerable attention in both scientific and industrial fields. For widespread industrial adoption, however, these sensors need a design that is as simple and cost-effective as possible. The original sensor design relied on measuring the spectral characteristics of the zero-phonon line. Recently, a modified approach was introduced, which involves splitting the GeV emission with a dichroic mirror and determining temperature based on the ratio of the two resulting signals. In this analysis, we provide a detailed comparison of both methods. At room temperature, the two methods show comparable performance, with slight variations depending on component quality. However, at temperatures around 300 {\deg}C, the new method's performance is estimated to be nearly twice that of the original, provided optimal filter parameters are used. Additionally, the sensitivity of the new method remains roughly consistent with its performance at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Ultra precise determination of Cs($nS_{1/2}$) and Cs($nD_J$) quantum defects for sensing and computing: Evaluation of core contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We make absolute frequency measurements of Cs Rydberg transitions, $\vert 6S_{1/2}, F=3 \rangle \rightarrow \vert nS_{1/2}~(n=23\rm{-}90)\rangle$ and $\vert nD_{3/2,5/2}~(n=21\rm{-}90)\rangle$, with an accuracy of less than $ 72\,\rm kHz$. The quantum defect parameters for the measured Rydberg series are the most precise obtained to date. The quantum defect series is terminated at $\delta_4$, showing that prior fits requiring higher order quantum defects reflect uncertainties in the observations. The precision of the measured quantum defects allow for the calculation of Rydberg electric-dipole transitions and fine-structure intervals extrapolated from high principal quantum numbers, to rival that of sophisticated many-body relativistic calculations carried out at low Rydberg principal quantum numbers. We quantitatively predict the contributions to the quantum defect parameters from core polarization and core penetration of Cs inner shell electrons. A new value for the ionization energy, consistent across the $ nS_{1/2}$ and $ nD_{3/2,5/2}$ Rydberg series, is reported at $31406.467 751 48 (14)~\rm{cm}^{-1}$.</description>
