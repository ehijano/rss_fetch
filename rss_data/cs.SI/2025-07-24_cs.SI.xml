      <title>Between Filters and Feeds: Investigating Douyin and WeChat's Influence on Chinese Adolescent Body Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the digital era, social media platforms play a pivotal role in shaping adolescents' body image perceptions. This study examines how Douyin and WeChat, two contrasting Chinese social media platforms, influence body image among Chinese male adolescents. Employing a platformization perspective, we surveyed 395 male adolescents aged 10 to 24 using the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire-Appearance Scales (MBSRQ-AS) to assess self-evaluation and body satisfaction. Our findings reveal that Douyin usage is significantly correlated with appearance evaluation and body area satisfaction, while WeChat usage shows no significant correlation with any body image dimensions. These results suggest that Douyin's algorithm-driven, video-centric environment intensifies exposure to idealized body standards, impacting users at a cognitive level. This study underscores the importance of considering platform-specific characteristics in understanding social media's impact on body image. It contributes to the broader discourse on how technological design and content modalities mediate psychological outcomes, offering insights for addressing body image concerns among male adolescents in China.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Uniqueness and Divisiveness of Presidential Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Do American presidents speak discernibly different from each other? If so, in what ways? And are these differences confined to any single medium of communication? To investigate these questions, this paper introduces a novel metric of uniqueness based on large language models, develops a new lexicon for divisive speech, and presents a framework for assessing the distinctive ways in which presidents speak about their political opponents. Applying these tools to a variety of corpora of presidential speeches, we find considerable evidence that Donald Trump's speech patterns diverge from those of all major party nominees for the presidency in recent history. Trump is significantly more distinctive than his fellow Republicans, whose uniqueness values appear closer to those of the Democrats. Contributing to these differences is Trump's employment of divisive and antagonistic language, particularly when targeting his political opponents. These differences hold across a variety of measurement strategies, arise on both the campaign trail and in official presidential addresses, and do not appear to be an artifact of secular changes in presidential communications.</description>

      <title>LLM Web Dynamics: Tracing Model Collapse in a Network of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data from the public Internet has enhanced data usage efficiency in large language model (LLM) training. However, the potential threat of model collapse remains insufficiently explored. Existing studies primarily examine model collapse in a single model setting or rely solely on statistical surrogates. In this work, we introduce LLM Web Dynamics (LWD), an efficient framework for investigating model collapse at the network level. By simulating the Internet with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) database, we analyze the convergence pattern of model outputs. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees for this convergence by drawing an analogy to interacting Gaussian Mixture Models.</description>
