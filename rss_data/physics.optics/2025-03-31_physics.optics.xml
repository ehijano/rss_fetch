      <title>W-shaped Broadband Attenuation of Longitudinal Waves through Composite Elastic Metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a composite elastic meta-slab with exceptional transmission properties, particularly the presence of a W-shaped bandgap. A comprehensive study, utilizing experimental measurements, the finite element method, and an analytical approach, identifies this specific bandgap. The meta-slab design involves cutting an array of composite materials arranged in parallel with strategically placed incisions. This configuration ensures that the materials between the slits act as plate-like waveguides within the surrounding medium. The incorporation of steel into ABS-based Fabry-Perot cavities induces a notable coupling effect between longitudinal waves and localized modes traversing the structure, leading to the formation of two distinct Fabry-Perot resonators. These coupling effects generate a series of resonances and antiresonances, ultimately producing the W-band gap through the interaction of two symmetric Fano resonances.</description>

      <title>Anti-symmetric chirp control by four-wave-mixing in gas-filled hollow capillary fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Customizing the pulse shaping of femtosecond pulses remains a key challenge in ultrafast optics. Programmable shaping for ultraviolet (UV) pulses is constrained by the transmission properties and damage threshold of the dielectric materials. We demonstrate an anti-symmetric dispersion transfer from near-infrared (NIR) pulses to UV pulses through chirped-four-wave-mixing (CFWM) in an argon gas. Positively chirped NIR pulses convert to negatively chirped UV in the hollow capillary fiber (HCF), achieving a conversion efficiency exceeding 13%. This approach expands the foundations of UV pulse shaping, enabling broadband frequency conversion by leveraging the large acceptance angle and intrinsically low dispersion of noble gases, rather than relying on conventional nonlinear crystals. High-energy customizing UV pulse shaping is a pivotal technique that enables precise control over pulse characteristics, essential for applications in ultrafast dynamics, high-precision spectroscopy through XUV frequency combs, improving electron beam quality for free electron lasers (FELs), and industrial microstructure.</description>

      <title>Polarization Decoupling Multi-Port Beam-Splitting Metasurface for Miniaturized Magneto-Optical Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In regular magneto-optical trap (MOT) systems, the delivery of six circularly polarized (CP) cooling beams requires complex and bulky optical arrangements including waveplates, mirrors, retroreflectors, etc. To address such technique challenges, we have proposed a beam delivery system for miniaturized MOT entirely based on meta-devices. The key component is a novel multi-port beam-splitting (PD-MPBS) metasurface that relies on both propagation phase and geometric phase. The fabricated samples exhibit high beam-splitting power uniformity (within 4.4%) and polarization purities (91.29%~93.15%). By leveraging such beam-splitting device as well as reflective beam-expanding meta-device, an integrated six-beam delivery system for miniaturized MOT application has been implemented. The experimental results indicate that six expanded beams have been successfully delivered with uniform power (within 9.5%), the desired CP configuration and large overlapping volume (76.2 mm^3). We believe that a miniaturized MOT with the proposed beam delivery system is very promising for portable application of cold atom technology in precision measurement, atomic clock, quantum simulation and computing, etc.</description>

      <title>Realization of the Tellegen Effect in Resonant Optical Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonreciprocal magnetoelectric effect in isotropic Tellegen materials enables exotic phenomena such as axion-modified electrodynamics and fosters the development of magnet-free nonreciprocal media. Although predicted over 75 years ago and observed in only a handful of natural materials with very low strength, the strong optical Tellegen effect has remained experimentally elusive. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of a resonant optical isotropic Tellegen effect in a metasurface, showcasing a response that is 100 times greater than that of any known natural material. This optical metasurface, consisting of randomly distributed cobalt-silicon nanoscatterers with strong shape anisotropy, utilizes spontaneous magnetization to achieve a robust Tellegen effect without the need for an external magnetic field. In addition to the Tellegen response, the metasurface exhibits both gyroelectric and gyromagnetic effects, contributing to nonreciprocal cross-polarized light reflection. We introduce a technique to independently extract the amplitudes of these three effects using conventional magneto-optical single-side illumination measurements. The observation of the resonant Tellegen effects in the optical frequency range may lead to the experimental observation of axionic electrodynamics and compact bias-free nonreciprocal optical devices.</description>

      <title>Inverse design of dual-band valley-Hall topological photonic crystals with arbitrary pseudospin states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Valley photonic crystals (VPCs) offer topological kink states that ensure robust, unidirectional, and backscattering-immune light propagation. The design of VPCs is typically based on analogies with condensed-matter topological insulators that exhibit the quantum valley Hall effect; trial-and-error approaches are often used to tailor the photonic band structures and their topological properties, which are characterized by the local Berry curvatures. In this paper, we present an inverse design framework based on frequency-domain analysis for VPCs with arbitrary pseudospin states. Specifically, we utilize the transverse spin angular momentum (TSAM) at the band edge to formulate the objective function for engineering the desired topological properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed design approach can successfully produce photonic crystal waveguides exhibiting dual-band operation, enabling frequency-dependent light routing. Our pseudospin-engineering method thus provides a cost-effective alternative for designing topological photonic waveguides, offering novel functionalities.</description>

      <title>Microwave One-way Transparency by Large Synthetic Motion of Magnetochiral Polaritons in Metamolecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe microwave one-way transparency via ultrastrongly-coupled magnetochiral polaritons (MChPs) in a metamolecule with simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and space-inversion symmetries at room temperature. The experimental results are reproduced well via numerical simulations. Effective polarizability tensor analyses of the simulation results verify that the one-way transparency is traced back to massive synthetic motion of MChPs. This study paves a way to hybrid quantum systems and synthetic gauge fields using metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Error-Corrected Eternal Lifetime Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the information explosion era, the demand for high-density stable storage technologies is soaring. Multi-dimensional optical storage with femtosecond laser writing offers a potential solution for massive data storage. However, equipment instability and reduced voxel resolution inevitably lead to data errors. Here, we propose and demonstrate a paradigm exemplifying high-fidelity eternal lifetime optical storage enabled by error correction mechanism. We increase information density by reducing voxel size and spacing. Leveraging deep learning methods, we achieve 8-bit voxel encoding and a storage capacity of 2.15 Tb/disc. We implement the Reed-Solomon(RS) algorithm for errorfree data recovery and get the trade-off between the storage capacity and the redundancy length. Our storage paradigm takes advantage of error-correcting codes, together with permanent information storage capabilities of extremely stable fused silica, marking a significant advancement for recording massive data to the application level and making it possible to faithfully record the information generated in human civilization.</description>

      <title>A spatiotemporal couplings perspective on harmonic vortices generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of light with matter serves as a fundamental tool for probing material properties across a wide range of energy regimes. Recent breakthroughs in tailoring the topology of coherent electromagnetic fields have opened new avenues for exploring how matter uniquely responds to the topological characteristics of light. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) driven by spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) beams. We demonstrate how distinct STOV configurations imprint their signature on the HHG process and show that the intensity distribution of harmonic fields can be precisely controlled by tuning the beam parameters. Furthermore, by bridging microscopic calculations with far-field observations, we establish the consistency of our findings and offer fresh insights into this emerging nonlinear spatiotemporal regime.</description>

      <title>Comparison between neural network clustering, hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering: Applications using fluidic lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comparison between neural network clustering (NNC), hierarchical clustering (HC) and K-means clustering (KMC) is performed to evaluate the computational superiority of these three machine learning (ML) techniques for organizing large datasets into clusters. For NNC, a self-organizing map (SOM) training was applied to a collection of wavefront sensor reconstructions, decomposed in terms of 15 Zernike coefficients, characterizing the optical aberrations of the phase front transmitted by fluidic lenses. In order to understand the distribution and structure of the 15 Zernike variables within an input space, SOM-neighboring weight distances, SOM-sample hits, SOM-weight positions and SOM-weight planes were analyzed to form a visual interpretation of the system's structural properties. In the case of HC, the data was partitioned using a combined dissimilarity-linkage matrix computation. The effectiveness of this method was confirmed by a high cophenetic correlation coefficient value (c=0.9651). Additionally, a maximum number of clusters was established by setting an inconsistency cutoff of 0.8, yielding a total of 7 clusters for system segmentation. In addition, a KMC approach was employed to establish a quantitative measure of clustering segmentation efficiency, obtaining a sillhoute average value of 0.905 for data segmentation into K=5 non-overlapping clusters. On the other hand, the NNC analysis revealed that the 15 variables could be characterized through the collective influence of 8 clusters. It was established that the formation of clusters through the combined linkage and dissimilarity algorithms of HC alongside KMC is a more dependable clustering solution than separate assessment via NNC or HC, where altering the SOM size or inconsistency cutoff can lead to completely new clustering configurations.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Encoding Computational Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional imaging technology has demonstrated significant research value across diverse fields, including environmental monitoring, agricultural inspection, and biomedical imaging, through integrating spatial (X*Y), spectral, and polarization detection functionalities. Here, we report a High-Dimensional encoding computational imaging technique, utilizing 4 high-dimensional encoders (HDE1-4) and a high-dimensional neural network (HDNN) to reconstruct 80 high-dimensional images of the target. The system efficiently acquires spectral-polarization information, spanning a wavelength range of 400-800 nm at intervals of 20 nm, obtaining 20 spectral datasets. Each dataset contains images captured at 4 polarization angles (0{\deg}, 45{\deg}, 90{\deg}, and -45{\deg}), and the image resolution can reach up to 1280 * 960 pixels. Achieving a reconstruction ratio 1:20. Experimental validation confirms that the spectral reconstruction error consistently remains below 0.14%. Extensive high-dimensional imaging experiments were conducted under indoor and outdoor conditions, showing the system's significant adaptability and robustness in various environments. Compared to traditional imaging devices, such as hyperspectral cameras that could only acquire spectral information, while polarization cameras are limited to polarization imaging, this integrated system successfully overcomes these technological constraints, providing an innovative and efficient solution for high-dimensional optical sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Topological optical skyrmion transfer to matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of structured light to mimic exotic topological skyrmion textures, encountered in high-energy physics, cosmology, magnetic materials, and superfluids has recently received considerable attention. Despite their promise as mechanisms for data encoding and storage, there has been a lack of studies addressing the transfer and storage of the topology of optical skyrmions to matter. Here, we demonstrate a high-fidelity mapping of skyrmion topology from a laser beam onto a gas of cold atoms, where it is detected in its new non-propagating form. Within the spatial overlap of the beam and atom cloud, the skyrmion topological charge is preserved, with a reduction from $Q \simeq 0.91$ to $Q \simeq 0.84$ mainly due to the beam width exceeding the sample size. Our work potentially opens novel avenues for topological photonics state storage and the analysis of more complex structured light topologies.</description>

      <title>3D Heterogeneous Integration of Silicon Nitride and Aluminum Nitride on Sapphire toward Ultra-wideband Photonics Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending two-dimensional photonic integrated circuits (PICs) to three-dimensional (3D) configurations promises great potential for scaling up integration, enhancing functionality, and improving performance of PICs. Silicon-based 3D PICs have made substantial progress due to CMOS compatibility. However, the narrow bandgap of silicon (1.1 eV) limits their use in short-wavelength applications, such as chemical and biological sensing, underwater optical communications, and optical atomic clocks. In this work, we developed a 3D photonics platform by heterogeneously integrating silicon nitride (SiN) and aluminum nitride (AlN) PICs on sapphire (Al$_2$O$_3$). The broadband transparency of these materials allow our platform to operate over a multi-octave wavelength ranging from ultraviolet to infrared. Leveraging this platform, we demonstrated efficient optical nonlinearity in an AlN microcavity, low-loss and tunable SiN waveguide-based optical components, and optical linking between AlN and SiN PICs layers in the visible and near-infrared spectrum, hinting at potential applications in integrated quantum systems. Our work presents an ultra-wideband 3D PICs platform, providing new opportunities for broadband and short-wavelength applications of PICs.</description>

      <title>Leveraging partial coherence in interferometric microscopy to enhance nanoparticle detection sensitivity and throughput</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22565v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometric-based microscopies stand as powerful label-free approaches for monitoring and characterising chemical reactions and heterogeneous nanoparticle systems in real time with single particle sensitivity. Nevertheless, coherent artifacts, such as speckle and parasitic interferences, together with limited photon fluxes from spatially incoherent sources, pose an ongoing challenge in achieving both high sensitivity and throughput. In this study, we systematically characterise how partial coherence affects both the signal contrast and the background noise level; thus, it offers a route to improve the signal-to-noise ratio from single nanoparticles (NPs), irrespective of their size and composition; or the light source used. We first validate that lasers can be modified into partially coherent sources with performance matching that of spatially incoherent ones; while providing higher photon fluxes. Secondly, we demonstrate that tuning the degree of partial coherence not only enhances the detection sensitivity of both synthetic and biological NPs, but also affects how signal contrasts vary as a function of the focus position. Finally, we apply our findings to single-protein detection, confirming that these principles extend to differential imaging modalities, which deliver the highest sensitivity. Our results address a critical milestone in the detection of weakly scattering NPs in complex matrices, with wide-ranging applications in biotechnology, nanotechnology, chemical synthesis, and biosensing; ushering a new generation of microscopes that push both the sensitivity and throughput boundaries without requiring beam scanning.</description>

      <title>Toward single-photon detection with superconducting niobium diselenide nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) based on few-layer NbSe$_2$ fully encapsulated with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), demonstrating single-photon sensitivity. Our fabrication process preserves the superconducting properties of NbSe$_2$ in nanowires, as confirmed by low-temperature transport measurements that show a critical temperature of $T_c \approx 6.5$ K, comparable to the reported values for unpatterned sheets, and it maintains a contact resistance of $\sim 50 \, \Omega$ at $T = 4$ K. Meandered NbSe$_2$ nanowires exhibit a responsivity of up to $4.9 \times 10^4$ V/W over a spectral range of 650-1550 nm in a closed-cycle cryostat at 4 K, outperforming planar and short-wire devices. The devices achieve a $1/e$ recovery time of $\tau = (135 \pm 36)$ ns, system timing jitter of $j_\text{sys} = (1103 \pm 7)$ ps, and detection efficiency of $\sim 0.01\%$ at $0.95I_c$, with a linear increase in detection probability confirming the single-photon operation. Furthermore, measurements under attenuated pulsed laser (1 MHz) indicate a success rate of up to $33\%$ in detecting individual optical pulses, establishing the platform as a promising candidate for developing efficient single-photon detectors.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Chern-Euler Duality Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phase transitions are typically characterized by abrupt changes in a quantized invariant. Here we report a contrasting paradigm in non-Hermitian parity-time symmetric systems, where the topological invariant remains conserved, but its nature transitions between the Chern number, characteristic of chiral transport in complex bands, and the Euler number, which characterizes the number of nodal points in pairs of real bands. The transition features qualitative changes in the non-Abelian geometric phases during spontaneous parity-time symmetry breaking, where different quantized components become mutually convertible. Our findings establish a novel topological duality principle governing transitions across symmetry classes and reveal unique non-unitary features intertwining topology, symmetry, and non-Abelian gauge structure.</description>

      <title>Infrared Dielectric Function of Photochromic Thiazolothiazole Embedded Polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the infrared dielectric function of photochromic dipyridinium thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole embedded in polymer is reported. Bulk thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-embedded polymer samples were prepared by drop casting and dehydration in room temperature. The samples were investigated using spectroscopic ellipsometry before and after irradiation with a 405~nm diode laser in the infrared spectral range from 500 cm-1 to 1800 cm-1. The model dielectric functions of the thiazolothiazole embedded polymer film for its TTz2+ (unirradiated) and TTz0 (irradiated) states are composed of a series of Lorentz oscillators in the measured spectral range. A comparison of the obtained complex dielectric functions for the TTz2+ and TTz0 states shows that the oscillators located in the spectral ranges 500 cm-1 - 700 cm-1, 1300 cm-1 - 1400 cm-1, and 1500 cm-1 - 1700 cm-1 change in both amplitude and resonant frequency upon transition between the states. Additionally, a resonance at approximately 1050 cm-1 exhibited a change in oscillator amplitude but not resonant frequency due to the photochromic transition.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Mode Quantum Cryptography in a 545-Dimensional Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in quantum key distribution (QKD) with spatial modes lies in efficiently generating, manipulating, and detecting high-dimensional quantum states. Here, we present a hybrid QKD protocol that integrates entanglement-based and prepare-and-measure approaches, utilizing position and momentum correlations of photon pairs generated via spontaneous parametric downconversion. Through projective measurements on one photon, the sender remotely prepares spatial modes at the receiver's end, simplifying state preparation. Detection is enhanced using advanced event-based single-photon cameras. Our scheme supports QKD in a 545-dimensional Hilbert space-the highest reported for spatial encoding-achieving 5.07 bits per coincidence in an optimized 90-mode configuration. This work demonstrates a scalable route to high-dimensional, spatially encoded quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Light Storage in Light Cages: A Scalable Platform for Multiplexed Quantum Memories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum memories are essential for photonic quantum technologies, enabling long-distance quantum communication and serving as delay units in quantum computing. Hot atomic vapors using electromagnetically induced transparency provide a simple platform with second-long photon storage capabilities. Light-guiding structures enhance performance, but current hollow-core fiber waveguides face significant limitations in filling time, physical size, fabrication versatility, and large-scale integration potential. In this work, we demonstrate the storage of attenuated coherent light pulses in a cesium (Cs) quantum memory based on a 3D-nanoprinted hollow-core waveguide, known as a light cage (LC), with several hundred nanoseconds of storage times. Leveraging the versatile fabrication process, we successfully integrated multiple LC memories onto a single chip within a Cs vapor cell, achieving consistent performance across all devices. We conducted a detailed investigation into storage efficiency, analyzing memory lifetime and bandwidth. These results represent a significant advancement toward spatially multiplexed quantum memories and have the potential to elevate memory integration to unprecedented levels. We anticipate applications in parallel single-photon synchronization for quantum repeater nodes and photonic quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Charge creation via quantum tunneling in one-dimensional Mott insulators: A numerical study of the extended Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge creation via quantum tunneling, i.e. dielectric breakdown, is one of the most fundamental and significant phenomena arising from strong light(field)-matter coupling. In this work, we conduct a systematic numerical analysis of quantum tunneling in one-dimensional Mott insulators described by the extended ($U$-$V$) Hubbard model. We discuss the applicability of the analytical formula for doublon-holon (DH) pair production, previously derived for the one-dimensional Hubbard model, which highlights the relationship between the tunneling threshold, the charge gap, and the correlation length. We test the formulas ability to predict both DH pair production and energy increase rate. Using tensor-network-based approaches, we demonstrate that the formula provides accurate predictions in the absence of excitonic states facilitated by the nearest-neighbor interaction $V$. However, when excitonic states emerge, the formula more accurately describes the rate of energy increase than the DH pair creation rate and in both cases gets improved by incorporating the exciton energy as the effective gap.</description>

      <title>Terahertz frequency-domain 4x4 Mueller matrix ellipsometer instrument designed for high-frequency magnetic resonance measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a Mueller matrix ellipsometer design using dual continuously rotating anisotropic meta wave plates which determines the full set of Mueller matrix elements in the terahertz spectral range. The instrument operates in the frequency domain and employs a frequency tunable, solid state synthesizer based, continuous wave terahertz source with sub-MHz bandwidth. The implemented source permits operation within 82-125 GHz and 170-250 GHz, without and with an additional frequency doubler, respectively. The terahertz transparent meta wave plates consist of 3D-printed polymer based columnar thin film structures with subwavelength dimensions. The rotating wave plates produce sufficient modulation of the Stokes vector components of transmitted terahertz light to use the wave plates in polarization state generator and polarization state detector devices. Fast terahertz light detection rate of a quasi optical solid state detector permits acquisition with few microsecond temporal resolution and electronic sweeping control of the source frequency. We develop a fast frequency sweeping scheme while continuously rotating the terahertz wave plates. Subsequent sorting of measured data permits measurements of Mueller matrix elements at hundreds of different wavelengths. The Mueller matrix elements are obtained by forward numerical reduction of the measured data using an algorithm developed by Ruder et al.[Opt. Lett. 45, 3541 (2020)]. The instrument is combined with a magnetocryostat capable of reaching magnetic field strengths at the sample position of -8 T...8 T and sample temperatures from 4 K...400 K. Hence, the instrument is suitable to measure the full Mueller matrix of samples with magnetic resonances as demonstrated recently by Rindert et al. [Phys. Rev. B 110, 054413 (2024)]. We discuss design, calibration, and example applications.</description>

Abstract: Single pulse All Optical Helicity-Independent Toggle Switching is observed in CoHo and CoDy alloys single layers. An original reversal mechanism is reported which contrasts with those observed to date. It is shown that the reversal process is on the {\mu}s timescale involving the reorganization / coalescence of domains and domain walls. The toggle switching is explained considering the unbalanced magnetization distribution stabilized after the ultrashort laser pulse.</description>

      <title>Mechanical characterization of a membrane with an on-chip loss shield in a cryogenic environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum transduction of an rf/microwave signal to the optical domain, and viceversa, paves the way to novel technologies which exploit the advantages of each domain to perform quantum operations. Since electro-optomechanical devices implement a simultaneous coupling of a mechanical oscillator to both an rf/microwave field and an optical field, they are suitable for the realization of a quantum transducer. The membrane-in-the-middle setup is a possible solution, once that its vibrational mode is cooled down to ultra cryogenic temperature for achieving quantum operation. This work is focused on the mechanical characterization via an optical interferometric probe, down to T=18 mK, of a loss-shielded metalized membrane designed for this purpose. A stroboscopic technique has been exploited for revealing a mechanical quality factor up to 64 millions at the lowest temperature. In fact, with continuous illumination and a cryostat temperature below 1 K, the heat due to optical absorption is not efficiently dissipated anymore, and the membrane remains hotter than its environment.</description>

Abstract: The ability to manipulate the spatial structure of light is fundamental for a range of applications, from classical communication to quantum information processing. Multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) addresses the limitations of single-plane modulation by enabling full control over multiple spatial modes of light through a series of phase masks separated by free-space propagation. In this tutorial, we present a step-by-step guide for building and aligning a 10-plane programmable light converter using a single spatial light modulator (SLM) and standard optical components. Our method allows precise alignment, achieving single-pixel accuracy with a relatively simple setup. We hope that this guide will help other researchers to quickly adopt and adapt MPLC technology for their own experiments.</description>

      <title>Synchronized motion of gold nanoparticles in an optothermal trap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical tweezers have revolutionized particle manipulation at the micro- and nanoscale, playing a critical role in fields such as plasmonics, biophysics, and nanotechnology. While traditional optical trapping methods primarily rely on optical forces to manipulate and organize particles, recent studies suggest that optothermal traps in surfactant solutions can induce unconventional effects such as enhanced trapping stiffness and increased diffusion. Thus, there is a need for further exploration of this system to gain a deeper understanding of the forces involved. This work investigates the behaviour of gold nanoparticles confined in an optothermal trap around a heated anchor particle in a surfactant (CTAC) solution. We observe unexpected radial confinement and synchronized rotational diffusion of particles at micrometre-scale separations from the anchor particle. These dynamics differ from known optical binding and thermophoretic effects, suggesting unexplored forces facilitated by the surfactant environment. This study expands the understanding of optothermal trapping driven by anchor plasmonic particles and introduces new possibilities for nanoparticle assembly, offering insights with potential applications in nanoscale fabrication and materials science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of resonant optical torque that allows enhancing substantially a transfer of optical angular momentum (AM) of light to a subwavelength particle. We consider high-index cylindrical dielectric nanoparticles supporting Mie resonances, and explore a transfer of AM and how it is affected by absorption and particle shape. We analyse a simple trapping geometry of standing wave patterns created by opposite helical light waves. We uncover stable rotation of particles in both nodes and anti-nodes, and also study how specific particle properties influence the resonant optical torque. We demonstrate that adjusting particle losses can maximize spinning torque, and we predict "super-torque" originating from the superabsorption effect at resonances. Our study offers a deeper understanding of the physics of resonant optical torque and its importance in manipulating AM transfer in optical systems, with promising implications for various fields and inspiring further research in resonant light-matter interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a general framework for deriving effective material properties of one-dimensional time-modulated systems of subwavelength resonators. It applies to subwavelength resonator systems with a general form of time-dependent parameters. We show that the resonators can be accurately described by a point-scattering formulation when the width of the resonators is small. In contrast to the static setting, where this point interaction approximation yields a Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the effective material properties, the mode coupling in the time-modulated case instead yields an infinite linear system of Lippmann-Schwinger-type equations. The effective equations can equivalently be written as a system of differential equations. Moreover, we introduce a numerical scheme to approximately solve the system of coupled equations and illustrate the validity of the effective equation.</description>

Abstract: Polarization is a fundamental property of light that can be engineered and controlled efficiently with optical metasurfaces. Here, we employ chiral metasurfaces with monoclinic lattice geometry and achiral meta-atoms for resonant engineering of polarization states of light. We demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that a monoclinic metasurface can convert linearly polarized light into elliptically polarized light not only in the linear regime but also in the nonlinear regime with the resonant generation of the third-harmonic field. We reveal that the ellipticity of the fundamental and higher-harmonic fields depends critically on the angle of the input linear polarization, and the effective chiral response of a monoclinic lattice plays a significant role in the polarization conversion.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient PCSEL Design: A Fully AI-driven Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11022v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an fully AI-driven design framework for photonic crystals (PhCs), engineered to achieve high efficiency in photonic crystal surface-emitting lasers (PCSELs). By discretizing the PhC structure into a grid, where the edges of the holes are represented by the cross-sections of two-dimensional Gaussian surfaces, we achieve high-degree-of-freedom and fabrication-friendly hole design. Coupled-wave theory (CWT) generates a dataset by evaluating surface-emitting efficiency ($SEE$) and quality factor ($Q$) of PhC designs, while a multi-layered neural network (NN) learns and extracts essential features from these designs. Finally, black-box optimization (BBO) is employed to fine-tune the photonic crystal structure, enabling a fully AI-driven design process. The model achieves high prediction accuracy, with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.780 for $SEE$ and 0.887 for the log-transformed $Q$. Additionally, we perform Shapley value analysis to identify the most important Fourier coefficients, providing insights into the factors that impact the performance of PCSEL designs. Our work accelerates the design process by over 1,000,000 times compared to traditional FDTD simulations, reducing parameter optimization from two weeks to just one second. Our work speeds up the design process and enables efficient optimization of high-performance PCSELs, driving the development of fully photonic design automation (PDA).</description>

      <title>Design of Macroscale Optical Systems with Metaoptics Using Transformer-Based Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metaoptics are thin, planar surfaces consisting of many subwavelength optical resonators that can be designed to simultaneously control the amplitude, phase, and polarization to arbitrarily shape an optical wavefront much in the same manner as a traditional lens but with a much smaller form factor. The incorporation of metaoptics into a conventional optical system spans multiple length scales between that of the individual metaoptic elements (&lt; {\lambda}) and that of the entire size of the optic (&gt;&gt; {\lambda}), making computational techniques that accurately simulate the optical response of metaoptics computationally intractable, while more efficient techniques utilizing various approximations suffer from inaccuracies in their prediction of the optical response. To overcome the trade between speed and accuracy, we implement a transformer-based neural network solver to calculate the optical response of metaoptics and combine it with commercial ray optics software incorporating Fourier propagation methods to simulate an entire optical system. We demonstrate that this neural net method is more than 3 orders of magnitude faster than a traditional finite-difference time domain method, with only a 0.47 % deviation in total irradiance when compared with a full wave simulation, which is nearly 2 orders of magnitude more accurate than standard approximation methods for metaoptics. The ability to accurately and efficiently predict the optical response of a metaoptic could enable their optimization, further accelerating and facilitating their application.</description>

      <title>A Hermitian bypass to the non-Hermitian quantum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Describing systems with non-Hermitian (NH) operators remains a challenge in quantum theory due to instabilities (e.g., exceptional points and decoherence) arising from interactions with the environment. We propose a framework to express the energy states of NH Hamiltonians using a well-defined basis (dub computational basis) derived from a related Hermitian operator. This suitably shifts the singularities from the basis states to the expansion coefficients, allowing for their easier mathematical treatment and parametric control. Furthermore, we introduce a `space-time' transformation on the computational basis that defines a generic dual space map for the energy states. Interestingly, this transformation leads to a symmetry for real/imaginary energy values, revealing the existence of weaker condition than hermiticity or the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. This leads to clearer understanding and novel interpretations of key features like exceptional points, dual space, and weaker symmetry-enforced real eigenvalues. The applicability of our framework extends to various branches of physics where NH operators manifest as ladder operators, order parameters, self-energies, projectors, and other entities.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of darkness using a standard single-photon avalanche photodiode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In experiments requiring extreme darkness, such as experiments probing the limits of human vision, assessment of the background photon flux is essential. However, direct measurement thereof with standard single photon detectors is challenged by dark counts and their fluctuations. Here we report an experiment and detailed statistical analysis of a direct measurement of darkness in a dedicated dark chamber suitable for human vision experiments, only using a standard single photon detector and a mechanical shutter. From a Bayesian analysis of $616$ h of data, we find substantial to decisive evidence for absolute darkness (depending on choice of prior distribution) based on the Savage-Dickey ratio, and a light level $&lt;0.039$ cnt/s (posterior $0.95$-highest density interval).</description>

      <title>Strong-Field-Assisted X-ray Second Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10211v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate x-ray second harmonic generation (SHG) with strong-field-driven high harmonic generation (HHG) from core electrons in gas-phase atoms, highlighting its potential as a powerful spectroscopic tool for studying atomic and molecular systems. Our simulations confirm the generation of HHG with x-ray SHG (HHG-XSHG) from atomic core electrons through the rescattering of electrons from x-ray two-photon excitation and subsequent tunneling ionization in an optical laser field. The resulting HHG-XSHG spectrum features a broadband multi-peak structure and a distinct spectral cutoff in the x-ray regime. These findings indicate that HHG-XSHG is a valuable technique for probing core-electron dynamics, generating attosecond x-ray pulses, and exploring nonlinear interactions, effectively merging laser-driven attosecond technology with nonlinear x-ray methodologies provided by x-ray free-electron lasers.</description>

      <title>Cavity enhancement of V2 centers in 4H-SiC with a fiber-based Fabry-P\'erot microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Silicon vacancy centers in 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) host a long-lived electronic spin and simultaneously possess spin-resolved optical transitions, making them a great candidate for implementing a spin-photon interface. These interfaces are an important building block of quantum networks, which in turn promise to enable secure communication and distributed quantum computing. To achieve this goal, the rate of coherently scattered photons collected from a single emitter needs to be maximized, which can be achieved by interfacing the emitter with an optical cavity. In this work, we integrate V2 centers inside a SiC membrane into a fiber-based Fabry-P\'erot microcavity. We find that SiC lends itself well to membrane fabrication, as evidenced by low surface roughness $\sigma_{\mathrm{RMS}}$ ~ 400 pm, high reproducibility, and consequentially a high cavity finesse F ~ 40 000. At cryogenic temperatures, we observe individual emitters coupling to cavity modes. We confirm their single-emitter character by measuring the second-order autocorrelation function and investigate the Purcell factor by measuring the optical lifetime as a function of the cavity-emitter detuning. We find a 13.3-fold enhancement of photons scattered into the zero-phonon line (ZPL), which could be further increased by using optimized mirror coatings, potentially opening the path towards deterministic spin-photon interaction.</description>

      <title>Methods for the study of light propagation in LArTPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs) are widely used in particle physics experiments. They use light and charge released in events to reconstruct and analyze them. Light information collected by the Photon Detection System (PDS) is used mainly to determine the initial time stamp, $t_0$, and to support determining the total energy of the event. For these purposes, it is important to simulate and predict the propagation of light inside the detector. There are several approaches to this, and this work discusses some of the options.</description>

      <title>Roadmap on Nonlocality in Photonic Materials and Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic technologies continue to drive the quest for new optical materials with unprecedented responses. A major frontier in this field is the exploration of nonlocal (spatially dispersive) materials, going beyond the local, wavevector-independent assumption traditionally made in optical material modeling. On one end, the growing interest in plasmonic, polaritonic and quantum materials has revealed naturally occurring nonlocalities, emphasizing the need for more accurate models to predict and design their optical responses. This has major implications also for topological, nonreciprocal, and time-varying systems based on these material platforms. Beyond natural materials, artificially structured materials--metamaterials and metasurfaces--can provide even stronger and engineered nonlocal effects, emerging from long-range interactions or multipolar effects. This is a rapidly expanding area in the field of photonic metamaterials, with open frontiers yet to be explored. In the case of metasurfaces, in particular, nonlocality engineering has become a powerful tool for designing strongly wavevector-dependent responses, enabling enhanced wavefront control, spatial compression, multifunctional devices, and wave-based computing. Furthermore, nonlocality and related concepts play a critical role in defining the ultimate limits of what is possible in optics, photonics, and wave physics. This Roadmap aims to survey the most exciting developments in nonlocal photonic materials, highlight new opportunities and open challenges, and chart new pathways that will drive this emerging field forward--toward new scientific discoveries and technological advancements.</description>

      <title>Complex Frequency Detection in a Subsystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we systematically explore the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and its associated complex-frequency detection in the context of a frequency-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian arises from the self-energy correction of the subsystem and can be calculated exactly within our theoretical model, without the need for any approximations. Additionally, complex frequency detection, which encompasses complex frequency excitation, synthesis, and fingerprint, enables us to detect the physical responses induced by the complex driving frequencies. Our calculations reveal that both complex frequency excitation and synthesis are incompatible with the non-Hermitian approximation and are unable to characterize the presence or abscence of the NHSE. In contrast, the complex-frequency fingerprint successfully detects the novel responses induced by the NHSE through the introduction of a double-frequency Green's function. Our work provides a platform for studying non-Hermitian physics and their novel response in quantum systems rigorously without relying on any approximations.</description>
