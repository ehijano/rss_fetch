      <title>Entropy Regularized Belief Reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a model of partition dependence, a widely reported experimental finding where the agent's reported beliefs depend on how the states are grouped. In the model, called Entropy Regularized Belief Reporting (ERBR), the agent is endowed with a latent benchmark prior that is unobserved by the analyst. When presented with a partition, the agent reports a prior that minimizes Kullback-Leibler divergence from the latent benchmark prior subject to entropy regularization. This captures the intuition that while the agent would like to report a prior that is close to her latent benchmark prior, she may also have a preference to remain noncommittal. I axiomatically characterize the model and apply it to the experimental data from Benjamin et al. (2017).</description>

      <title>Flexible Moral Hazard Problems with Adverse Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a moral hazard problem with adverse selection: a risk-neutral agent can directly control the output distribution and possess private information about the production environment. The principal designs a menu of contracts satisfying limited liability. Deviating from classical models, not only can the principal motivate the agent to exert certain levels of aggregate efforts by designing the "power" of the contracts, but she can also regulate the support of the chosen output distributions by designing the "range" of the contract. We show that it is either optimal for the principal to provide a single full-range contract, or the optimal low-type contract range excludes some high outputs, or the optimal high-type contract range excludes some low outputs. We provide sufficient and necessary conditions on when a single full-range contract is optimal under convex effort functions, and show that this condition is also sufficient with general effort functions.</description>

      <title>Detection of coordinated fleet vehicles in route choice urban games. Part I. Inverse fleet assignment theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detection of collectively routing fleets of vehicles in future urban systems may become important for the management of traffic, as such routing may destabilize urban networks leading to deterioration of driving conditions. Accordingly, in this paper we discuss the question whether it is possible to determine the flow of fleet vehicles on all routes given the fleet size and behaviour as well as the combined total flow of fleet and non-fleet vehicles on every route. We prove that the answer to this Inverse Fleet Assignment Problem is 'yes' for myopic fleet strategies which are more 'selfish' than 'altruistic', and 'no' otherwise, under mild assumptions on route/link performance functions. To reach these conclusions we introduce the forward fleet assignment operator and study its properties, proving that it is invertible for 'bad' objectives of fleet controllers. We also discuss the challenges of implementing myopic fleet routing in the real world and compare it to Stackelberg and Nash routing. Finally, we show that optimal Stackelberg fleet routing could involve highly variable mixed strategies in some scenarios, which would likely cause chaos in the traffic network.</description>

      <title>Learning about informativeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a sequential social learning model in which there is uncertainty about the informativeness of a common signal-generating process. Rational agents arrive in order and make decisions based on the past actions of others and their private signals. We show that, in this setting, asymptotic learning about informativeness is not guaranteed and depends crucially on the relative tail distributions of the private beliefs induced by uninformative and informative signals. We identify the phenomenon of perpetual disagreement as the cause of learning and characterize learning in the canonical Gaussian environment.</description>

      <title>Renegotiation-Proof Cheap Talk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An informed Advisor and an uninformed Decision-Maker engage in repeated cheap talk communication in always new (stochastically independent) decision problems. They have a conflict of interest over which action should be implemented at least in some cases. Our main result is that, while the Decision-Maker's optimal payoff is attainable in some subgame perfect equilibrium (by force of the usual folk theorem), no payoff profile close to the Decision-Maker's optimal one is immune to renegotiation. Pareto efficient renegotiation-proof equilibria are typically attainable, and they entail a compromise between the Advisor and the Decision-Maker. This could take the form of the Advisor being truthful and the Decision-Maker not utilizing this information to their own full advantage, or the Advisor being somewhat liberal with the truth and the Decision-Maker, while fully aware of this, pretending to believe the Advisor.</description>

      <title>Robust Social Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a society composed of individuals who have diverse sets of beliefs (or models) and diverse tastes (or utility functions). It characterizes the model selection process of a social planner who wishes to aggregate individuals' beliefs and tastes but is concerned that their beliefs are misspecified (or distorted). A novel impossibility result emerges: a utilitarian social planner who seeks robustness to misspecification never aggregates individuals' beliefs but instead behaves systematically as a dictator by selecting one individual's belief. This tension between robustness and aggregation exists because aggregation yields policy-contingent beliefs, which are very sensitive to policy outcomes. Restoring possibility of belief aggregation requires individuals to have heterogeneous tastes and some common regular beliefs. This analysis reveals that misspecification has significant implications for welfare aggregation. These implications are illustrated in treatment choice, asset pricing, and dynamic macroeconomics.</description>

      <title>Network Heterogeneity and Value of Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies how payoff heterogeneity affects the value of information in beauty contest games. I show that public information is detrimental to welfare if and only if agents' Katz-Bonacich centralities exhibit specific forms of heterogeneity, stemming from the network of coordination motives. A key insight is that agents may value the commonality of information so differently that some are harmed by their neighbors knowing what others know. Leveraging this insight, I also show that when the commonality of information is endogenously determined through information sharing, the equilibrium degree of information sharing can be inefficiently low, even without sharing costs.</description>
