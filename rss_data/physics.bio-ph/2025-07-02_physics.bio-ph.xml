      <title>Topological weight and structural diversity of polydisperse chromatin loop networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current biophysical models for transcriptionally active chromatin view this as a polymer with sticky sites, mimicking transcription units such as promoters and enhancers which interact via the binding of multivalent complexes of chromatin-binding proteins. It has been demonstrated that this model spontaneously leads to microphase separation, resulting in the formation of a network of loops with transcription units serving as anchors. Here, we demonstrate how to compute the topological weights of loop networks with an arbitrary 1D pattern of transcription units along the fibre (or `polydisperse' loop networks), finding an analogy with networks of electric resistors in parallel or in series. We also show how the BEST (de Bruijn, van Aardenne-Ehrenfest, Smith and Tutte) theorem in combinatorics can be used to find the combinatorial multiplicity of any class of loop networks. Our results can be used to compute the structural diversity, or Shannon entropy, of loop networks: we show that this quantity depends on the 1D patterning of transcription units along the chain, possibly providing a pathway to control transcriptional noise in eukaryotic genes.</description>

      <title>Integrating nano- and micrometer-scale energy deposition models for mechanistic prediction of radiation-induced DNA damage and cell survival</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an integrated modeling framework that combines the Generalized Stochastic Microdosimetric Model (GSM2), used to predict cell survival fractions, with MINAS-TIRITH, a fast and efficient Geant4 DNA-based tool for simulating radiation-induced DNA damage in cell populations. This approach enables the generation of spatially and structurally resolved double-strand break (DSB) distributions, capturing key features such as damage complexity and chromosome specificity. A novel application of the DBSCAN clustering algorithm is introduced to group DSBs at the micrometer scale. This allows the identification of physical aggregates of DNA damage and their association with subnuclear domains, providing a direct link to the cell survival probability as predicted by \gsm.
  The model was validated using experimental data from HUVEC cells irradiated with 220 kV X-rays and H460 cells exposed to protons over a wide linear energy transfer (LET) range, from approximately 4 keV/{\mu}m to over 20 keV/{\mu}m. Results show excellent agreement between simulations and experimental survival probabilities, making this one of the first consistent multi-scale models to bridge nanodosimetric and microdosimetric representations of radiation with biological outcomes such as cell survival.
  By incorporating the inherent stochastic nature of radiation-matter interactions, this framework effectively connects the physical properties of the radiation field to the biological response at the cellular level. Its accuracy across various radiation types and energies supports its potential for use in biologically optimized radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>Gliding microtubules exhibit tunable collective rotation driven by chiral active forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How chirality propagates across scales remains an open question in many biological and synthetic systems. An especially clear manifestation of this propagation is found in in vitro gliding assays of cytoskeletal filaments on surfaces, driven by molecular motors. These assays have become model systems of active matter dynamics, as they spontaneously organize into diverse dynamical states, including collective motions with chiral rotation. However, the microscopic mechanisms underlying these chiral collective dynamics have remained unclear. Here, we investigate rotating active nematic order in microtubule gliding assay experiments under two stabilization conditions, each on two types of substrates. We propose that chirality in active forces exerted by motors on microtubules represents a viable mechanism for this large-scale chirality. Using Brownian dynamics simulations of self-propelled, semiflexible filaments with chiral activity, we demonstrate that coherently rotating active nematic order emerges by this mechanism even in the absence of curvature, i.e. shape chirality, of the constituent filaments. Moreover, we predict that the angular speed and handedness of the collective rotation can be tuned by modulating filament stiffness. Our findings identify a new set of sufficient microscopic ingredients for predictable propagation of chiral handedness from the molecular to the material scale in living and active matter.</description>

      <title>Charge Regulation Effect on Nanoparticles Interaction Mediated by Polyelectrolyte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to precisely control surface charge using charged polymers is fundamental to many nanotechnology applications, enabling the design and fabrication of materials with tailored properties and functionalities. Here, we study the effect of charge regulation (CR) on the interaction between two nanoparticles (NPs) mediated by an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte (PE) in an electrolyte solution. To this end, we employ a hybrid CR Monte Carlo (CR-MC)/molecular dynamics (MD) simulation framework to systematically explore the effects of pH, salt concentration, and polymer chain length on NP surface charge behavior. For comparison, we also conduct MD simulations under constant charge (CC) conditions. Our results reveal that CR enhances PE adsorption onto NP surfaces compared to the CC case, where polymer bridging dominates across a wide range of NP intersurface separations. This enhanced adsorption under CR leads to a weak net repulsion driven by osmotic forces. In contrast, the CC model yields a stronger net attraction due to the bridging force. Furthermore, we find that the CR effects are more pronounced at a low salt concentration, whereas at a high salt concentration, counterion screening dominates in both CR and CC cases, resulting in similar interaction profiles. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating charge regulation in characterizing NP interactions within a complex biochemical environment, particularly in the presence of low salt concentrations.</description>

      <title>Cardiorespiratory coupling improves cardiac pumping efficiency in heart failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent trials of a neuronal pacemaker have shown that cardiac pumping efficiency increases when respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is artificially restored in animal models of heart failure. This novel device sheds new light on the functional role of RSA, which has long been debated, by allowing the strength of cardiorespiratory coupling to be artificially varied. Here we show that RSA minimizes the cardiac power dissipated within the cardiovascular network. The cardiorespiratory system is found to exhibit mode-locked synchronized regions within which viscoelastic dissipation is reduced relative to the scenario where cardiorespiratory coupling is absent. We determine the gain in cardiac output as the magnitude of RSA increases. We find that cardiac pumping efficiency improves up and until the cardiac frequency, within each breadth intake, is approximately 1.5 times greater than the cardiac frequency in the expiratory phase, at which point it reaches a plateau. RSA was found to be most effective at low cardiac frequencies, in good agreement with clinical evidence. Simulation of the cardiac power saved under RSA is in good agreement with the 17-20% increase in cardiac output observed in RSA-paced animal models.</description>

      <title>BoltzNCE: Learning Likelihoods for Boltzmann Generation with Stochastic Interpolants and Noise Contrastive Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00846v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution defined by an energy function is a key challenge in modeling physical systems such as molecules. Boltzmann Generators tackle this by leveraging Continuous Normalizing Flows that transform a simple prior into a distribution that can be reweighted to match the Boltzmann distribution using sample likelihoods. However, obtaining likelihoods requires computing costly Jacobians during integration, making it impractical for large molecular systems. To overcome this, we propose learning the likelihood of the generated distribution via an energy-based model trained with noise contrastive estimation and score matching. By using stochastic interpolants to anneal between the prior and generated distributions, we combine both the objective functions to efficiently learn the density function. On the alanine dipeptide system, we demonstrate that our method yields free energy profiles and energy distributions comparable to those obtained with exact likelihoods. Additionally, we show that free energy differences between metastable states can be estimated accurately with orders-of-magnitude speedup.</description>

      <title>The modelling of the action potentials in myelinated nerve fibres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The initial version of the planned paper has gone through a major revision in 2025. First, the paper ended up growing a bit too long, and as a result of that, we decided to split it into two parts. The first part focuses on the model for the unmyelinated case and its behaviour, and the second part focuses on including the influence of myelination into the model. Second, when the initial version of the manuscript was going through the review process, it became evident that the way the content was presented was somewhat confusing for readers with a background in the experimental side of research into nerve processes. As a result, we went through a major revision, redoing all the numerical simulations with parameters that are closer to what Hodgkin and Huxley used in their classical paper from 1952, where the Hodgkin-Huxley model was initially introduced. The second major change was to change the logic how the specific inductance value is chosen for the numerical example - in the previous version it was chosen by aiming for a specific propagation velocity when the axon radius was chosen as 1 micrometre, in the updated version the value is chosen to get the AP propagation velocity which was experimentally observed in the HH 1952 paper at the same parameters as were used in that paper. Part 1 - On hyperbolicity for nerve pulse propagation in axons. Part 2 - The modelling of the action potentials in myelinated nerve fibres.</description>

      <title>Robust assessment of asymmetric division in colon cancer cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymmetric partition of fate determinants during cell division is a hallmark of cell differentiation. Recent work suggested that such a mechanism is hijacked by cancer cells to increase both their phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity and in turn their fitness. To quantify fluctuations in the partitioning of cellular elements, imaging-based approaches are used, whose accuracy is limited by the difficulty of detecting cell divisions. Our work addresses this gap proposing a general method based on high-throughput flow cytometry measurements coupled with a theoretical framework. We applied our method to a panel of both normal and cancerous human colon cells, showing that different kinds of colon adenocarcinoma cells display very distinct extents of fluctuations in their cytoplasm partition, explained by an asymmetric division of their size. To test the accuracy of our population-level protocol, we directly measure the inherited fractions of cellular elements from extensive time-lapses of live-cell laser scanning microscopy, finding excellent agreement across the cell types. Ultimately, our flow cytometry-based method promises to be accurate and easily applicable to a wide range of biological systems where the quantification of partition fluctuations would help accounting for the observed phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity</description>
