      <title>The $\kappa$-Fr\'{e}chet-Urysohn property for $C_p(X)$ is equivalent to Baireness of $B_1(X)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A topological space $X$ is Baire if the intersection of any sequence of open dense subsets of $X$ is dense in $X$. We establish that the property $(\kappa)$ for a Tychonoff space $X$ is equivalent to Baireness of $B_1(X)$ and, hence, the Banakh property for $C_p(X)$ is equivalent to meagerness of $B_1(X)$. Thus, we obtain one characteristic of the Banach property for $C_p(X)$ through the property of space $X$.</description>

      <title>On the infinite powers of large zero-dimensional metrizable spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that $X^\lambda$ is strongly homogeneous whenever $X$ is a non-separable zero-dimensional metrizable space and $\lambda$ is an infinite cardinal. This partially answers a question of Terada, and improves a previous result of the author. Along the way, we show that every non-compact weight-homogeneous metrizable space with a $\pi$-base consisting of clopen sets can be partitioned into $\kappa$ many clopen sets, where $\kappa$ is the weight of $X$. This improves a result of van Engelen.</description>

      <title>On the axiomatisability of the dual of compact ordered spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the category of Nachbin's compact ordered spaces and order-preserving continuous maps between them is dually equivalent to a variety of algebras, with operations of at most countable arity. Furthermore, we show that the countable bound on the arity is the best possible: the category of compact ordered spaces is not dually equivalent to any variety of finitary algebras. Indeed, the following stronger results hold: the category of compact ordered spaces is not dually equivalent to (i) any finitely accessible category, (ii) any first-order definable class of structures, (iii) any class of finitary algebras closed under products and subalgebras. An explicit equational axiomatisation of the dual of the category of compact ordered spaces is obtained; in fact, we provide a finite one, meaning that our description uses only finitely many function symbols and finitely many equational axioms. In preparation for the latter result, we establish a generalisation of a celebrated theorem by D. Mundici: our result asserts that the category of unital commutative distributive lattice-ordered monoids is equivalent to the category of what we call MV-monoidal algebras. Our proof is independent of Mundici's theorem.</description>

      <title>On identities in connected topological groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1957, Nemytskii proved the following fact: if in a locally compact or in an Abelian connected group there is a neighborhood of the identity in which some identity holds, then it holds in the entire group. The following question was also posed there: Let G be a connected topological group. In some neighborhood of the identity of the group G the identity $x^3=1$ holds. Is it true that then the identity $x^3=1$ holds in the entire group $G$? The same question is posed for the identity $gx^2 = x^2g$, where $g$ is a fixed element of the group. Platonov formulated the following generalized formulation of the Mytselsky problem: for a topological connected group, is it true that if the identity holds in a neighborhood of the identity, then the identity holds everywhere? In this paper, a negative answer to Platonov's question is given, the following theorem is proven: if $n &gt; 10^{10}$ is odd, then there exists a connected topological group in which the identity $x^n=1$ holds in some neighborhood of unity, but not in the entire group.</description>

      <title>Semitopology: a topological approach to decentralised collaborative action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09287v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce semitopology, a generalisation of point-set topology that removes the restriction that intersections of open sets need necessarily be open. The intuition is that points represent participants in a decentralised system, and open sets represent collections of participants that collectively have the authority to collaborate to update their local state; we call this an actionable coalition.
  Examples of actionable coalition include: majority stakes in proof-of-stake blockchains; communicating peers in peer-to-peer networks; and even pedestrians working together to not bump into one another in the street. Where actionable coalitions exist, they have in common that: collaborations are local (updating the states of the participants in the coalition, but not immediately those of the whole system); collaborations are voluntary (up to and including breaking rules); participants may be heterogeneous in their computing power or in their goals (not all pedestrians want to go to the same place); participants can choose with whom to collaborate; and they are not assumed subject to permission or synchronisation by a central authority.
  We develop a topology-flavoured mathematics that goes some way to explaining how and why these complex decentralised systems can exhibit order, and gives us new ways to understand existing practical implementations.</description>

      <title>Disjointly non-singular operators and various topologies on Banach lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of dispersed subspaces and disjointly non-singular (DNS) operators on Banach lattices using topological methods. In particular, we provide a simple proof of the fact that in an order continuous Banach lattice an operator is DNS if and only if it is $n$-DNS, for some $n\in\mathbb{N}$. We characterize Banach lattices with order continuous dual in terms of dispersed subspaces and absolute weak topology. We also connect these topics with the recently launched study of phase retrieval in Banach lattices.</description>
