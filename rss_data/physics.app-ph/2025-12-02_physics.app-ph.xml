      <title>Nanoscale Magnonic Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use micromagnetic simulations to demonstrate neuron functionality of two-dimensional (2D) chiral magnonic resonators. Our design exploits nonlinear resonant scattering of spin waves propagating in a YIG medium from an edge mode of a permalloy nano-element. The reduced frequency and volume of the edge mode facilitate matching it to the YIG modes and give rise to their wide-angle scattering. As the amplitudes of the incident spin waves increase, the edge mode exhibits a positive nonlinear frequency shift. This shift leads to a complex frequency-dependent nonlinear variation of the amplitude and phase of spin waves scattered in different directions. We show that the scattered waves are strong enough to activate secondary neurons. This provides the connectivity required for combining our proposed neurons into 2D magnonic neural networks.</description>

      <title>New record in optical gain and room-temperature nanolasers in multiple wavelengths in 2D ErOCl single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erbium-based materials have long been recognized for their important telecom-band applications, yet their widespread adoption in integrated optoelectronics has been hindered by two fundamental limitations: the difficulty in achieving high erbium density without concentration quenching which leads to small optical gain in doped materials, and the difficulty in fabricating a practical device with single crystal nanowires that demonstrated high optical gain previously1,2. Here, we overcome these limitations by synthesizing 2D single crystal ErOCl that has an Er density of 1.75*1022 cm-3. The high-quality single crystal material significantly reduces the density-related quenching effect that dominates in randomly doped materials with high Er concentration. This results in a record optical gain coefficient over 1500 dB/cm at 1536 nm band, at least larger by an order of magnitude than the previous gain record in Er materials. Leveraging this exceptional gain medium, we demonstrate room-temperature continuous-wave lasing operation by integrating with a photonic crystal microcavity, achieving a record-low threshold of 7 {\mu}W with the most compact size of any Er-based lasers. Furthermore, the unique Stark splitting characteristics of ErOCl provide optical gain in three wavelength bands and lead to lasing in these wavelengths by engineering the cavity. This is the first time that optical gain has been shown in three different wavelength bands in Er materials, together with the smallest size of laser cavity, could have many important applications in on-chip sensing and optical communication.</description>

      <title>A C-band microwave rectenna using aperture-coupled antenna array and novel Class-F rectifier with cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rectenna (rectifying antenna) is usually applied to a microwave power transmission (MPT) system as a terminal, which receives microwave (MW) power and converts them into DC power. A 5.8 GHz aperture-coupled patch antenna array is developed with a gain of 19.5 dBi, which is a part of the rectenna. A novel Class-F rectifier with a series diode is proposed to achieve a high rectifying efficiency based on harmonic termination techniques. The input circuit of the proposed rectifier is taken into consideration to reach the Class-F condition, while mostly only the output circuit is involved in conventional Class-F designs. A low-pass filter based on defected ground structure is implemented, which not only blocks the harmonics produced in rectifying but also presents desired impedance at harmonics. The current and voltage waveforms on the diode are well enforced. The radiation feature of the rectifier is presented as well. It shows that an optimized cavity, which shields the parasite radiation, may achieve a 5% enhancement on the MW-to-DC conversion efficiency. A C-band rectifier based on HSMS-286 Schottky diode is fabricated and measured. A MPT simple demo system is constructed with the proposed rectifier and antenna. A measured maximum MW-to-DC conversion efficiency of 72% is achieved on the rectifier. The design method is extremely valuable in a high conversion efficiency rectenna design based on harmonic termination techniques.</description>

      <title>A Novel Class-F 2.45/5.8 GHz Dual-Band Rectifier for Wireless Power Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a high-efficiency dual-band class-F rectifier for wireless power transmission (WPT). The rectifier comprises a dual-band harmonic termination network, a dual-band matching network, a single Schottky diode, and a dc pass filter. A theoretical analysis of the harmonic termination network is performed to improve the rectifying efficiency. The network exhibits good class-F operation by controlling the second and third harmonics in dual bands. A rectifier operating at 2.45 and 5.8 GHz was designed, fabricated, and measured for validation. The measurements show maximum RF-dc conversion efficiencies of 74.9% and 61.9% with 200 and 500{\Omega} loads at 2.45 and 5.8 GHz, respectively. The proposed rectifier achieves dual-band harmonic control with high efficiency.</description>

      <title>Stiffness and Buckling Behavior of Woven Columns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Woven shell structures are beneficial for applications requiring lightweight, damage resilience, and design tunability, such as in wearable devices, soft robotics, and aerospace systems. A fundamental component of woven structures is the woven column. While the mechanical properties of a woven column can be determined using sophisticated finite element (FE) simulations, these FE models are computationally expensive and do not explain the underlying mechanics behind scaling relationships. In this work, we derive purely analytical models for the buckling load and stiffness of woven columns, and discuss the criteria that lead to different buckling modes of the woven columns. The simulated results based on our models closely match experimental data across various weave design parameters. This work advances our understanding of the mechanics of woven systems and serves as a baseline for the design of next-generation hierarchical structures and materials.</description>

      <title>Acoustic helical dichroism enhanced by chiral quasi-bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic helical dichroism (HD) arises from the interaction between vortex beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) and chiral media, yet such chiral sound-matter interactions are typically weak. Here, we employ quasi-bound states in the continuum (QBICs) in acoustic meta-cavities composed of coupled Helmholtz resonators to enhance acoustic HD. We design both achiral and chiral meta-cavities that support QBICs in the form of vortex states with high Q-factors. Using full-wave numerical simulations, we show that the QBICs in the achiral meta-cavities cannot enhance acoustic HD due to the absence of a chiral wavefront. In contrast, the chiral meta-cavity exhibits a pronounced HD enhancement through the QBICs with a 3D helical wavefront, which can be excited by incident waves either with or without OAM. Our work identifies two essential requirements for enhancing acoustic HD effect via QBICs: a high Q-factor of the states and 3D chirality of the state fields, which usually compromise each other in conventional acoustic resonators. The findings open new avenues for achieving strong chiral sound-matter interactions, with potential applications in acoustic chiral sensing and acoustic OAM manipulation.</description>

      <title>Self-Organized Freeform Waveguiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nature offers remarkable examples of complex photonic architectures such as those responsible for the iridescent colors of butterfly wings that emerge spontaneously during growth, well before any centralized control takes place. Arising from local rules, these structures exhibit advanced optical functionalities, such as photonic band gaps, without relying on in-situ optimization or top-down design. Inspired by biological morphogenesis, we introduce an optimization-free approach for the automated generation of self-organized freeform waveguides that adapt to complex propagation paths. Our method relies on local reaction-diffusion dynamics to produce robust, spatially distributed structures. In contrast to conventional waveguides based on periodic media, which impose strong geometric constraints and require extensive fine-tuning, the proposed structures support nontrivial geometries while maintaining photonic band gap behavior. We experimentally demonstrate that these self-organized waveguides achieve superior transmission efficiency along complex paths. This optimization-free strategy enables the automated design of advanced electromagnetic components with intrinsic adaptability and resilience.</description>

      <title>Optical modulation of Gate-Induced Electron Trapping via Persistent Photoconductivity in STO/Al Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic interplay between light and electric field control of charge states lies at the heart of developing multifunctional optoelectronic devices. While persistent photoconductivity (PPC) and gate-voltage (VG)-induced electron trapping are well-known phenomena in oxide heterostructures, their mutual coupling remains poorly explored. Here, we report that the non-equilibrium state established by PPC can effectively modulate the efficacy of VG-induced electron trapping in a STO/Al heterostructure. The PPC, characterized by a slow relaxation (8.5 hours at 4 K) after sub-illumination, originates from the re-trapping of photoexcited carriers into deep-level states. In contrast, VG-induced trapping, governed by shallow states, exhibits much faster dynamics ({100 - 400 s). Crucially, we discover that the strength of VG-induced trapping is not constant but is dynamically modulated by the PPC relaxation process. The trapping amplitude is strongly amplified after illumination and recovers only after the deep-level states are substantially refilled, precisely following the PPC relaxation time constant. Furthermore, the electron trapping effect diminishes with increasing temperature and vanishes near the ferroelastic phase transition of STO (110 K), confirming that ferroelastic twin walls and associated oxygen vacancy clusters are the physical origin of the traps. Our findings reveal a novel optical gating mechanism for electron trapping, paving the way for designing non-volatile, optically programmable electronic devices.</description>

      <title>High-Sensitivity NV Ensemble Imaging via AOD-Based Raster Scanning and Photodetection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a technique based on an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond capable of imaging magnetic fields with high spatio-temporal resolution. A focused laser beam is raster-scanned using an acousto-optic deflector (AOD) and NV center fluorescence is read out with a single photodetector, enabling low-noise detection with high dynamic range. The method operates in a previously unexplored regime, quasi-continuous wave optically detected magnetic resonance (qCW-ODMR). In this regime, NV centers experience short optical pump pulses for spin readout and repolarization, analogous to pulsed ODMR technique, while the microwave field remains continuously on resonance with the spin transitions. We systematically characterize this regime and show that the spin response is governed by a tunable interplay between coherent evolution and relaxation, determined by the temporal spacing between pump laser pulses. Notably, the technique does not require precise microwave pulse control, thus simplifying experimental implementation. To demonstrate its capabilities, we image time-varying magnetic fields from a microelectrode in a conductive medium with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. This approach enables flexible spatial sampling and with our diamond achieves nT$\cdot$Hz$^{-1/2}$ per pixel sensitivity, making it well suited for detecting weak, dynamic magnetic fields in biological and other complex systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It makes sense to consider a helical waveguide with a fine pitch approximately, replacing the turns with anisotropic conductivity: infinite along the turns and zero across them. This approach has been known for a long time, but calculation formulas within it have only been obtained for the case where the winding does not contain a dielectric core. This paper addresses this gap in the theory: calculation formulas are obtained for the case where the waveguide contains a dielectric with a certain permittivity and magnetic permeability. An equation determining the slowing factor is found, and a method for its numerical solution is proposed. Explicit formulas are obtained for the wave impedance.</description>

      <title>Impact of Electrical Contacts on Transition Metal Dichalcogenides-Based Acoustoelectric and Acousto-Photoelectric Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of electrical contact barriers in hybrid WSe$_2$-LiNbO$_3$-based acoustoelectric and acousto-photoelectric devices using a combination of scanning photocurrent and acousto-electric current spectroscopy. Static scanning photocurrent measurements provide a qualitative measure of the band-bending and spatial distribution of the Schottky barrier between semiconducting WSe$_2$ and gold electrodes whereas the surface acoustic wave-induced acousto-electric current reveals the height of the tunnelling barrier created by the van der Waals gap between the multilayered WSe$_2$ flake and the gold electrodes in addition to the Schottky barrier. The combination of both techniques shows a ten-fold increase in the photocurrent by the acoustic wave. Moreover, the observed spatial redistribution of the current is attributed to the interplay between the contact properties at the source and drain electrodes and the charge carrier dynamics induced by the surface acoustic wave. The ratio of acoustic wavelength to the electrical channel length is found to impact the SAW-induced charge carrier transport. For a channel length shorter than one acoustic wavelength, carriers undergo a seesaw-like motion which changes to charge conveyance for channel lengths comparable or exceeding the acoustic wavelength.</description>

      <title>Resonant states and nuclear dynamics in solid-state systems: the case of silicon-hydrogen bond dissociation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bond breaking in the presence of highly energetic carriers is central to many important phenomena in physics and chemistry, including radiation damage, hot-carrier degradation, activation of dopant-hydrogen complexes in semiconductors, and photocatalysis. Describing these processes from first principles has remained an elusive goal. Here we introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework for the dissociation process, emphasizing the need for a non-adiabatic approach. We benchmark the results for the case of silicon-hydrogen bond dissocation, a primary process for hot-carrier degradation. Passivation of Si dangling bonds by hydrogen is vital in all Si devices because it eliminates electrically active mid-gap states; understanding the mechanism for dissociation of these bonds is therefore crucial for device technology. While the need for a non-adiabatic approach has been previously recognized, explicitly obtaining diabatic states for solid-state systems has been an outstanding challenge. We demonstrate how to obtain these states by applying a partitioning scheme to the Hamiltonian obtained from first-principles density functional theory. Our results demonstrate that bond dissociation can occur when electrons temporarily occupy the antibonding states, generating a highly repulsive excited-state potential that causes the hydrogen nuclear wavepacket to shift and propagate rapidly. Based on the Menzel-Gomer-Redhead (MGR) model, we show that after moving on this excited-state potential on femtosecond timescales, a portion of the nuclear wavepacket can continue to propagate even after the system relaxes back to the ground state, allowing us to determine the dissociation probability. Our results provide essential insights into the fundamental processes that drive carrier-induced bond breaking in general, and specifically elucidate hydrogen-related degradation in Si devices.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Multi-Scale Physical Fields from Extremely Sparse Measurements with an Autoencoder-Diffusion Cascade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing full fields from extremely sparse and random measurements is a longstanding ill-posed inverse problem. A powerful framework for addressing such challenges is hierarchical probabilistic modeling, where uncertainty is represented by intermediate variables and resolved through marginalization during inference. Inspired by this principle, we propose Cascaded Sensing (Cas-Sensing), a hierarchical reconstruction framework that integrates an autoencoder-diffusion cascade. First, a neural operator-based functional autoencoder reconstructs the dominant structures of the original field - including large-scale components and geometric boundaries - from arbitrary sparse inputs, serving as an intermediate variable. Then, a conditional diffusion model, trained with a mask-cascade strategy, generates fine-scale details conditioned on these large-scale structures. To further enhance fidelity, measurement consistency is enforced via the manifold constrained gradient based on Bayesian posterior sampling during the generation process. This cascaded pipeline substantially alleviates ill-posedness, delivering accurate and robust reconstructions. Experiments on both simulation and real-world datasets demonstrate that Cas-Sensing generalizes well across varying sensor configurations and geometric boundaries, making it a promising tool for practical deployment in scientific and engineering applications.</description>

These measurements, combined with simultaneous data from a three-dimensional anemometer, can be used to determine fluxes using the eddy-covariance method. The instrument utilizes two interband cascade lasers operating at 2.78 $\mu$m and 3.24 $\mu$m within a novel four-pass M-shaped optical cell, which provides high signal power and long-term field operation without requiring active air sampling. Two detection techniques $-$ tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) and a simplified wavelength modulation spectroscopy (sWMS) $-$ were implemented and evaluated. Laboratory calibration demonstrated linear responses for all gases (R$^2$ $\approx$ 0.999) and detection precisions at 10 Hz of 311 ppb for CO$_2$, 8.87 ppb for CH$_4$, and 788 ppb for H$_2$O. Field tests conducted at a grassland site near Moscow showed strong correlations (R = 0.91 for CO$_2$ and H$_2$O, R = 0.67 for CH$_4$) with commercial LI-COR LI-7200 and LI-7700 analyzers. The TDLAS mode demonstrated lower noise and greater stability under outdoor conditions, while sWMS provided baseline-free spectra but was more sensitive to power fluctuations. E-CAHORS combines high precision, multi-species sensing capability with low power consumption (10 W) and a compact design (4.2 kg).</description>

      <title>Fabrication and Properties of NbN/NbNx/NbN and Nb/NbNx/Nb Josephson Junctions</title>

Abstract: Increasing integration scale of superconductor electronics (SCE) requires employing kinetic inductors and self-shunted Josephson junctions (JJs) for miniaturizing inductors and JJs. We have been developing a ten-superconductor-layer planarized fabrication process with NbN kinetic inductors and searching for suitable self-shunted JJs to potentially replace high Josephson critical current density, Jc, Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb junctions. We report on the fabrication and electrical properties of NbN/NbNx/NbN junctions produced by reactive sputtering in Ar+N2 mixture on 200-mm wafers at 200 oC and incorporated into a planarized process with two Nb ground planes and Nb wiring layer. Here NbN is a stoichiometric nitride with superconducting critical temperature Tc =15 K and NbNx is a high resistivity, nonsuperconducting nitride deposited using a higher nitrogen partial pressure than for the NbN electrodes. For comparison, we co-fabricated Nb/NbNx/Nb JJs using the same NbNx barriers deposited at 20 oC. We varied the NbNx barrier thickness from 5 nm to 20 nm, resulting in the range of Jc from about 1 mA/um^2 down to ~10 uA/um^2, and extracted coherence length of 3 nm and 4 nm in NbNx deposited, respectively at 20 oC and 200 oC. Both types of JJs are well described by resistively and capacitively shunted junction model without any excess current. We found the Jc of NbN/NbNx/NbN JJs to be somewhat lower than of Nb/NbNx/Nb JJs with the same barrier thickness, despite a much higher Tc and energy gap of NbN than of Nb electrodes. IcRn products up to ~ 0.5 mV were obtained for JJs with Jc~ 0.6 mA/um^2. Jc(T) dependences have been measured.</description>

      <title>Laser Structured Optical Interposer for Ultra-dense Vertical Coupling of Multi-core Fibers to Silicon Photonic Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Femtosecond laser writing in glass was harnessed to fabricate photonic circuits comprised of waveguides, micro-mirrors, and fiber sockets, in an optical interposer chip. The compact design enabled ultra-dense routing of 40 optical channels from six multi-core fibers, in a two-layer array, vertically coupling onto a 2D grid of silicon photonic grating couplers. Various photonic circuit designs were explored and tested, achieving an average single-pass insertion loss of 5.0 dB for the fully packaged system, with a minimum loss of 3.2 dB. The reasonably low loss and low-profile, compact package make such interposers an attractive option for densifying interconnects to address bottlenecks in optical networks, datacenters, and optical computing applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-Mode Lens for Momentum Microscopy and XPEEM: Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strong electric field between the sample and the extractor is the core of cathode lenses and a pivotal determinant of high resolution. Nevertheless, fields in the range of 3-8 kV/mm can be a source of complications. Local field enhancement at sharp edges or microscopic protrusions of cleaved samples may result in field emission or flashovers. Moreover, slow background electrons are drawn into the microscope column, where they contribute to space charge effects. A novel front lens configuration, optimized through ray-tracing simulations, significantly reduces the field at the sample and allows even for zero field or retarding field, which serves to suppress space charge effects. One or several annular electrodes, situated in a concentric position relative to the extractor, serve to form an additional lens within the gap between the sample and the extractor. The refractory power of this lens, and consequently the field at the sample surface, can be modified by adjusting the potentials of the annular electrodes. The imaging properties and aberrations of this gap lens have been investigated with regard to momentum imaging and XPEEM. The study encompasses the energy range from the few-eV level for laser-ARPES to 6 keV, for hard X-ray ARPES. The additional converging lens situated in close proximity to the sample exhibits a reduced field curvature of the k-image in the backfocal plane. This allows for the acquisition of larger fields of view in both momentum and real-space imaging.</description>

      <title>Wave propagation in an elastic lattice with non-reciprocal stiffness and engineered damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal wave propagation allows for directional energy transport. In this work, we systematically investigate wave dynamics in an elastic lattice that combines nonreciprocal stiffness with viscous damping. After establishing how conventional damping counteracts the system's gain, we introduce a non-dissipative form of nonreciprocal damping in the form of gyroscopic damping. We find that the coexistence of nonreciprocal stiffness and nonreciprocal damping results in a decoupled control mechanism. The nonreciprocal stiffness is shown to govern the temporal amplification rate, while the nonreciprocal damper independently tunes the wave's group velocity and oscillation frequency. This decoupling gives rise to phenomena such as the enhancement of net amplification for slower-propagating waves, and also boundary-induced wave interference arising from divergent and convergent reflected wave trajectories with varying growth rates. These findings provide a theoretical framework for designing active metamaterials with more versatile control over their wave propagation characteristics.</description>

      <title>Fly-by transit: A novel door-to-door shared mobility with minimal stops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces fly-by transit (FBT), a novel mobility system that employs modular mini-electric vehicles (mini-EVs) to provide door-to-door shared mobility with minimal stops. Unlike existing modular minibus concepts that rely on in-motion coupling and passenger transfers -- technologies unlikely to mature soon -- FBT lowers the technological barriers by building upon near-term feasible solutions. The system comprises two complementary mini-EV modules: low-cost trailers for on-demand feeder trips and high-performance leaders that guide coupled trailers in high-speed platoons along trunk lines. Trailers operate independently for detour-free feeder services, while stationary coupling at designated hubs enables platoons to achieve economies of scale (EoS). In-motion decoupling of the tail trailer allows stop-less operation without delaying the main convoy.
  As a proof of concept, a stylized corridor model is developed to analyze optimal FBT design. Results indicate that FBT can substantially reduce travel times relative to conventional buses and lower operating costs compared with e-hailing taxis. Numerical analyses further demonstrate that FBT achieves stronger EoS than both buses and taxis, yielding more than 13\% savings in generalized system costs. By addressing key limitations of existing transit systems, this study establishes FBT as a practical and scalable pathway toward transformative urban mobility and outlines directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Event-Based Simulation of Stochastic Memristive Devices for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we build a general modelling framework for memristors, suitable for the simulation of event-based systems such as hardware spiking neural networks, and more generally, neuromorphic computing systems composed of three independent components: i) an event-based modelling approach, extending and generalising an existing general model of memristors - the Generalised Metastable Switch Model (GMSM) - eliminating errors associated with discrete time approximation, as well as offering potential improvements in terms of suitability for neuromorphic memristive system simulations; ii) a volatility state variable to allow for the unified understanding of disparate non-linear and volatile phenomena, including state relaxation, structural disruption, Joule heating, and non-linear drift in different memristive devices; and iii) a readout equation that separates the latent state variable evolution from explicit variables of interest such as an instantaneous resistance. We exhibit an illustrative implementation of this framework, fit to a resistive drift dataset for titanium dioxide memristors, based on a proposed linear conductance model for resistive drift in the devices. Finally, we highlight the application of the model to neuromorphic computing, through demonstrating the contribution of the volatility state variable to switching dynamics, resulting in frequency-dependent switching (for stable memristors acting as programmable synaptic weights) and the generation of action potentials (for unstable memristors, acting as spike-generators).</description>

      <title>Correlating on-the-fly Electrical and Optical Skyrmion Readout</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, topologically stabilized spin textures, are promising candidates for future memory devices and non-conventional computing applications due to their enhanced stability, non-linear interactions, and low-power manipulation capabilities. Despite their significant potential, the reliable electrical readout of individual skyrmions remains a fundamental challenge. While magnetic tunnel junctions and anomalous Hall effect (AHE)-based techniques have demonstrated skyrmion detection capabilities, they currently fail to reliably detect single moving skyrmions as required for applications. Our approach leverages thermally activated skyrmions, where a low constant drive current simultaneously generates both skyrmion motion and the Hall voltage necessary for detection. We demonstrate the reliability of this method through real-time correlation between measured Hall voltage signals and direct Kerr microscopy imaging. Two consecutive Hall crosses allow for determining the skyrmion velocity, in accordance to Kerr microscopy videos. We present an analytical formula for the skyrmion AHE readout signal, demonstrating scalability from micrometer to nanometer skyrmions. These advances establish a robust platform for skyrmion-based sensors, counters and unconventional computing systems that depend on precise individual skyrmion control and detection.</description>

      <title>Frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy for nanometric layer thickness imaging with GHz elastic plate resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanometric layer thickness imaging is crucial for fundamental research and characterization of micro fabricated devices. Here, we assess the potential of a non-contact opto-acoustic frequency domain laser ultrasound (FreDomLUS) microscopy technique for imaging nanometric thickness variations via GHz zero-group velocity (ZGV) elastic plate resonances. The method exploits the ZGV's lateral energy confinement that leads to sharp resonance peaks which can be effectively probed with the FreDomLUS technique at GHz acoustic frequencies. For demonstration purposes we introduced sub-10 nm height variation patterns in the topmost layer of solidly mounted bulk-acoustic wave resonators with a design frequency of around 1.7 GHz. They are raster-scanned to retrieve ZGV-frequencies from local acoustic spectra as a contrast quantity for imaging. We show how to retrieve quantitative height information by numerically calibrating the factor which inversely relates ZGV frequency change with the layer thickness change. Height variations in stacks with nominal thickness changes of 8 nm, 4 nm, and 1 nm can be resolved and indicate sub-nanometer depth resolution capabilities. The lateral resolution is studied by measuring the method's step edge function and it is found to be in the micrometer range. Atomic force microscopy imaging is used to validate the results.</description>
