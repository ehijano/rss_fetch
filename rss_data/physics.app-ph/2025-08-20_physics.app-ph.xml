      <title>Airborne acoustic emission enables sub-scanline keyhole porosity quantification and effective process characterization for metallic laser powder bed fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Keyhole-induced (KH) porosity, which arises from unstable vapor cavity dynamics under excessive laser energy input, remains a significant challenge in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). This study presents an integrated experimental and data-driven framework using airborne acoustic emission (AE) to achieve high-resolution quantification of KH porosity. Experiments conducted on an LPBF system involved in situ acquisition of airborne AE and ex situ porosity imaging via X-ray computed tomography (XCT), synchronized spatiotemporally through photodiode signals with submillisecond precision. We introduce KHLineNum, a spatially resolved porosity metric defined as the number of KH pores per unit scan length, which serves as a physically meaningful indicator of the severity of KH porosity in geometries and scanning strategies. Using AE scalogram data and scan speed, we trained a lightweight convolutional neural network to predict KHLineNum with millisecond-scale temporal resolution, achieving an R-squared value exceeding 0.8. Subsequent analysis identified the 35-45 kHz frequency band of AE as particularly informative, consistent with known KH oscillations. Beyond defect quantification, the framework also enables AE-driven direct inference of KH regime boundaries on the power-velocity process map, offering a noninvasive and scalable component to labor-intensive post-process techniques such as XCT. We believe this framework advances AE-based monitoring in LPBF, providing a pathway toward improved quantifiable defect detection and process control.</description>

      <title>Gear-shifting tunable meta-shaft for low-frequency torsional vibration suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metastructures with band gaps provide a new solution for the torsional vibration attenuation in shaft systems, while tunable band gaps remain challenging, typically relying on additional physical fields or complex assembly processes. In this study, a gear-shifting tunable meta-shaft with self-locking gear (SLG) resonators is proposed, where a simple gear-shifting mechanism replaces complex tuning methods to achieve low-frequency torsional vibration suppression in tunable frequency ranges. First, as the key components of the SLG resonator, six inner curved beams are designed to provide precisely tunable torsional stiffness of the resonator through their deformed shapes controlled by shifting the gear teeth on the edge of the resonator. Also, based on the gear-shifting mechanism, the SLG resonator achieves resonant frequency modulation and opens tunable low-frequency torsional band gaps consistent with theoretical predictions. Then, the SLG resonators are periodically attached to a uniform shaft to construct a gear-shifting tunable meta-shaft, whose dynamic response is obtained using numerical simulations to evaluate its torsional wave attenuation performance. Finally, a gear-shifting tunable meta-shaft prototype is fabricated and experiments are carried out to study the propagation characteristics of torsional waves therein. Through the consistency observed among theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experimental results, the gear-shifting tunable meta-shaft is found to exhibit excellent attenuation performance in the tunable low-frequency band gaps. Therefore, the proposed gear-shifting tunable meta-shaft paves a new way for low-frequency torsional vibration suppression.</description>

      <title>Charge accumulation by Direct Magnetoelectric Effect in ScAlN/Ni Nanoscale Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the direct magnetoelectric effect in thin-film lab scale composite heterostructures comprising a 100 nm thick piezoelectric Sc0.4Al0.6N (ScAlN) and a magnetostrictive Ni with 100-200 nm thickness, fabricated on Si/SiO2 substrates. The films are patterned into square pillar arrays with lateral dimensions down to 500 nm x 500 nm. Vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) measurements reveal in-plane magnetic anisotropy in the Ni films, attributed to strain induced by the underlying ScAlN layer. Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometry imaging confirms the formation of magnetic domains at remanence in polycrystalline Ni when patterned in sub-microscale structures. Capacitance measurements reveal a ScAlN dielectric constant at the device level consistent with unpatterned thin films, confirming the preservation of electrical integrity at the sub-microscale. The direct magnetoelectric effect is demonstrated through quasi-static charge measurements under applied out-of-plane DC magnetic fields, yielding equivalent open-circuit voltages up to 1.17 mV.</description>

      <title>Modification of adhesion between microparticles and engineered silicon surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in performing experiments with microparticles is controlling their adhesion to substrates. For example, levitation of a microparticle initially resting on a surface requires overcoming the surface adhesion forces to deliver the microparticle into a mechanical potential acting as a trap. By engineering the surface of silicon substrates, we aim to decrease the adhesion force between a metallic microparticle and the silicon surface. To this end, we investigate different methods of surface engineering that are based on chemical, physical, or physio-chemical modifications of the surface of silicon. We give quantitative results on the detachment force, finding a correlation between the water contact angle and the mean detachment force, indicating that hydrophobic surfaces are desired for low microparticle adhesion. We develop surface preparations decreasing the mean detachment force by more than a factor of three, or the force at which 50% of particles move by more than a factor of six, the compared to an untreated silicon surface. Our results will enable reliable levitation of microparticles and are relevant for experiments requiring low adhesion between microparticles and a surface.</description>

      <title>Breaking the material-limited temperature coefficient of resistance via carrier feedback in a single transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) is one of the most fundamental properties of a material. Semiconductor materials exhibiting high TCR are promising candidates for applications in high-resolution thermal imaging for autonomous systems, high-precision temperature sensing, and neuromorphic computing. However, the TCR magnitude is typically below 5%/K near 300 K for thermal imaging materials, such as vanadium oxide and amorphous silicon. Inspired by the distinctive characteristic of feedback in electronic circuits, we demonstrate a voltage-tunable TCR of up to 150%/K near 300 K in a two-terminal InGaAs/InP n-p-n transistor, enabled by an internal coherent carrier feedback mechanism. In this device, current amplification arises from a synergistic interplay between temperature-dependent transistor gain and avalanche multiplication. Carriers amplified at the emitter-base junction via the transistor effect are injected into the collector-base junction, where avalanche multiplication generates additional carriers. These excess carriers are then fed back to the emitter-base junction, triggering further transistor amplification. This regenerative positive feedback loop results in a high and bias-tunable temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR). This work reveals the potential of device engineering in overcoming the fundamental material-level physical limits of temperature properties.</description>

      <title>Next-generation soliton frequency combs in photonic-crystal and nanocomposite microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microresonator frequency combs offer tremendous opportunity to advance applications in fundamental research and technology by linking the optical and microwave frequency domains. Kerr-nonlinear microresonators further enable the generation of portable, integrated optical frequency combs, which are called microcombs. However, the dispersion engineering usually suffers from the small, geometric parameter space, and achieving soliton microcombs is challenging and usually requires complicated experimental techniques and setups. In recent years, the invention of photonic-crystal resonators (PhCRs) provides access to solitons in a convenient and stable way while its mechanism has not been fully understood. In this article, we highlight the perspectives of generating solitons for various applications in PhCRs and give a thorough understanding of the dynamics of soliton formation. We also propose a nanocomposite waveguide structure for the optimization of group velocity dispersion (GVD), lifting the limitation on geometric parameter space. We apply it to the design of the pump-harmonic microcomb, a new concept for f-2f self-referencing in microcombs. Inspired by the pulse-driven microresonator, we provide a scheme of two-microresonator network, retaining the convenience of using a continuous wave laser for microcomb generation. Our work depicts a blueprint of achieving the next generation soliton frequency combs in PhCR and nanocomposite microresonators and highlights their great prospects in optical metrology, precision measurement and optical data transmission.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigation of the approximation properties, convergence, and stability of the ADER-DG method for solving an ODE system is carried out. The ADER-DG method generates a new implicit RK method, which is similar in its properties to the original ADER-DG method. The ADER-DG method has an approximation order $2N+1$ when using polynomials of degree $N$ for the numerical solution at grid nodes, and demonstrates superconvergence. The local solution obtained by the local DG predictor has an approximation order $N+1$ and has a subgrid resolution. The ADER-DG method is $A$- and $AN$-stable, $L$-stable, $B$- and $BN$-stable, and algebraically stable. Applications of the ADER-DG method demonstrated compliance with the expected theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Extracting Membrane-like hexagonal Boron Nitride hosting single Defect Centers for Resonator Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of membranes into optical resonators plays a key role in a variety of applications, including optomechanics. If such membranes host atom-like systems, ideally with access to spin states, new roads in quantum photonics and also in optomechanics can be taken. Layered, two-dimensional materials have emerged as candidates for membranes hosting atom-like quantum emitters. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is among the most promising two-dimensional platforms showing good mechanical properties combined with the ability to host various kinds of optical active (spin-) defects. However, the determinisitc creation of optically active defect centers in hBN membranes is an outstanding challenge. Commercially available flakes of hBN host defect centers with promising optical properties, but the integration into optical resonators suffers from scattering losses due to the flakes topography and suitable transfer, handling and manipulation techniques need to be established. Here, we develope a toolset of nano-scaled manipulation techniques to extract membrane-like structures of commercially-available hBN containing spectrally narrow single photon emitters. We demonstrate the transfer and integration into photonic devices, by coupling a single photon emitter in membran-like hBN to the mode of an open Fabry-Perot fiber cavity (FPFC) and observe cavity induced spectral enhancement by a factor of up to 100 at room temperature. Overcoming hBN-induced scattering for extracted hBN membranes, which host single photon emitters, paves the way for future applications such as its use as an optomechanical system.</description>

      <title>Tuning electrochemical reactions with ratchet-based ion pumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrochemical reactions are highly sensitive to the physical and chemical environment near the electrodes. Thus, controlling the electrolyte ionic composition and the electrochemical potential of specific ions can modify the overpotential of electrochemical reactions and enhance their selectivity toward the desired products. Ratchet-based ion pumps (RBIPs) are membrane-like devices that utilize temporal potential modulation to drive a net ionic flux with no associated electrochemical reactions. RBIPs were fabricated by coating the surfaces of nanoporous alumina wafers with metals, forming nanoporous capacitors. Placing the RBIP between two electrolyte compartments and applying an alternating signal between the metal layers resulted in a voltage buildup across the membrane, leading to ion pumping. Here, we demonstrate that by modifying the electrochemical potential of ions, RBIPs can accelerate or inhibit electrochemical reactions on the surface of adjacent water-splitting electrodes according to the RBIP input signal. Proton pumping towards a water-splitting cathode prevented proton depletion due to the hydrogen evolution reaction and maintained the pH in the cathode compartment. The combination of ion pumping and ion selectivity can enable the electrolyte composition to be tuned near the electrodes, providing greater control over the electrochemical process.</description>

      <title>Microassembly of Multi-Material and 3D Integration Enabled by Programmable and Universal High-Precision Micro-Transfer Printing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Micro-transfer printing is an assembly technology that enables large-scale integration of diverse materials and components from micro- to nano-scale. However, traditional micro-transfer printing technologies lack dynamic selectivity, limiting capabilities in sorting and repairing materials and components for effective yield management during large-scale manufacturing and integration processes. In this work, we introduce a dynamically programmable micro-transfer printing system utilizing a sharp phase-changing polymer and an independently addressable microheater array to modulate adhesion through localized heating. The system demonstrates dynamically programmable capabilities for selective transfer of various materials including semiconductors, polymers and metals, handling geometries from micro-scale chiplets to nanometer-thick films and micro-spheres. It also exhibits exceptional capabilities in 3D stacking and heterogeneous materials integration, significantly advancing the manufacturability of complex microsystems. As a demonstration, we successfully perform dynamically programmable transfer of microLED chips to create arbitrarily specified patterns, offering a promising solution to the challenges of mass transfer and pixel repair in microLED display manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Towards Non-Invasive Sediment Monitoring Using Muography: A Pilot Run at the Shanghai Outer Ring Tunnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the application of cosmic-ray muography as a non-invasive method for monitoring sediment accumulation and tidal influences in the Shanghai Outer Ring Tunnel, an immersed tube tunnel located beneath the Huangpu River in Shanghai, China. A portable, dual-layer plastic scintillator detector was deployed to conduct muon flux scans along the tunnel's length and to continuously monitor muon flux, allowing for the study of tidal effects. Geant4 simulations validated the correlation between muon attenuation and overburden thickness, incorporating sediment, water, and concrete layers. Key findings include a strong anti-correlation between the measured muon flux and the water levels observed at a nearby tide gauge. The results align with geotechnical data and simulations, especially in the region of interest, confirming muography's sensitivity to sediment dynamics. This work establishes muography as a robust tool for long-term, real-time monitoring of submerged infrastructure, offering significant advantages over conventional invasive techniques. The study underscores the potential for integrating muography into civil engineering practices to enhance safety and operational resilience in tidal environments.</description>

      <title>Non-Local and Quantum Advantages in Network Coding for Multiple Access Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider two-sender, one-receiver communication over a discrete memoryless multiple-access channel without feedback, where two senders may cooperate on channel coding by using pre-shared resources, such as shared randomness, quantum states and measurements, or nonlocal correlations. We present the capacity region when senders employ cooperative encoding with quantum and nonlocal resources, extending beyond shared randomness, and derive a sum rate that serves as a lower bound to the sum capacity, the lower bound is computable by exploiting specific strategies. We also compute the sum capacities for two instances. One is when senders apply local resources for cooperative encoding. The other is when senders exploit non-classical resources for encoding against channels constructed by referring to nonlocal games, in this way, correlated noise other than independent errors occurs on codewords. Comparing the exact sum capacities and lower bounds, we show that nonlocal and quantum resources for cooperative encoding enable higher sum capacities over local ones. The Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt and magic square games are considered for constructing multiple-access channels, and we demonstrate the usefulness of nonlocal and quantum resources to achieve higher sum capacities.</description>

      <title>Radio Map Estimation: Empirical Validation and Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radio maps provide metrics such as the received signal strength at every location in a geographical region of interest. Extensive research has been carried out in this context, but it relies almost exclusively on synthetic-data experiments. Thus, the practical aspects of the radio map estimation (RME) problem as well as the performance of existing estimators in the real world remain unknown. To fill this gap end, this paper puts forth the first comprehensive, rigorous, and reproducible study of RME with real data. The main contributions include (C1) an assessment of the viability of RME based on the estimation error that can be achieved, (C2) the analysis of the main phenomena and trade-offs involved in RME, including the experimental verification of theoretical findings in the literature, and (C3) a thorough evaluation of a wide range of estimators on realworld data. Remarkably, this reveals that the performance gain of existing deep estimators in their pure form may not compensate for their complexity. A simple enhancement (C4) is proposed to alleviate this issue. The vast amount of data collected for this study is published along with the developed simulator to enable research on new schemes, hopefully bringing RME one step closer to practical deployment.</description>

Abstract: The operation of superconducting qubits requires a sensitive readout circuit at cryogenic temperatures, driving the demand for cryogenic non reciprocal microwave components such as circulators. However, evaluating these components at low temperatures presents significant challenges for companies and institutions without specialized measurement systems. In the development of such cryogenic non reciprocal components, the temperature dependence of ferrite's magnetic properties is the most critical factor. Therefore, an evaluation technique for accurately assessing these properties at cryogenic temperatures is essential. In this study, we develop a measurement method to characterize low loss ferrite materials over a temperature range of 300 K to 2 K. The use of the circularly polarized resonance mode \( \text{TE}_{11n} \) enables the direct estimation of circular complex permeability and the determination of key material parameters, including saturation magnetization and damping constant both essential for assessing the performance of ferrite materials in circulator applications. To validate the reliability of our measurement method, we selected single crystal YIG as the test material, as its magnetic properties at cryogenic temperatures are relatively well known. This demonstration confirms that our method is effective for characterizing various low loss ferrite materials that are potential candidates for compact cryogenic non reciprocal devices.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Characterization of Thin Film MoS$_2$ Using Generative Models</title>

Abstract: The growth and characterization of materials using empirical optimization typically requires a significant amount of expert time, experience, and resources. Several complementary characterization methods are routinely performed to determine the quality and properties of a grown sample. Machine learning (ML) can support the conventional approaches by using historical data to guide and provide speed and efficiency to the growth and characterization of materials. Specifically, ML can provide quantitative information from characterization data that is typically obtained from a different modality. In this study, we have investigated the feasibility of projecting the quantitative metric from microscopy measurements, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), using data obtained from spectroscopy measurements, like Raman spectroscopy. Generative models were also trained to generate the full and specific features of the Raman and photoluminescence spectra from each other and the AFM images of the thin film MoS$_2$. The results are promising and have provided a foundational guide for the use of ML for the cross-modal characterization of materials for their accelerated, efficient, and cost-effective discovery.</description>

      <title>Phase mask fabrication for multi-plane light conversion using grayscale lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct writing laser (DWL) grayscale lithography is introduced as a novel fabrication technique for multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) phase masks, enabling direct transfer of precise depth profiles onto substrates via reactive ion etching and subsequent reflective coating. An MPLC system employing these masks achieves 92% fidelity in converting a Gaussian (TEM (0,0)) input to a Laguerre-Gaussian (LG(0,0)) mode. The fabricated masks exhibit sub-10 nm vertical resolution, surface roughness below 3 nm, and an R-squared value of 0.976. This method provides a scalable alternative to conventional multi-step lithographic fabrication for advanced photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Single attosecond XUV pulse source via light-wave controlled relativistic laser-plasma interaction: Thomson Back Scattering Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16949</link>

Abstract: Reflecting light off a mirror moving near light speed offers a powerful method for generating bright, ultrashort pulses in the extreme ultraviolet range. Several investigations show that dense relativistic electron mirrors can be created by striking a nanometre-scale foil with a high-intensity, sharp-front laser pulse, forming a single relativistic electron sheet (RES). This RES coherently reflects and upshifts a counter-propagating laser beam from the infrared to the extreme ultraviolet with efficiency exceeding incoherent scattering by over several orders of magnitude. Here we demonstrate that optimizing the drive laser waveform can reliably produce a single RES, leading to generation of isolated \emph{attosecond} pulses enhancing both intensity and temporal compression of the back reflected light in a controlled manner. Simulations reveal that tuning parameters like timing delay enables control over the amplitude, duration, and bandwidth of the resulting attosecond Thomson backscattering pulse. Together, these advances meet key experimental challenges and pave the way for compact, tunable sources of isolated attosecond pulses for probing ultrafast phenomena.</description>

      <title>Modeling wind farm noise emission and propagation: effects of flow and layout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study demonstrates how wind farm flow physics influence noise generation and downstream propagation through numerical simulations. The flow field is modeled using large-eddy simulations (LES), and the time-averaged output serves as input to acoustic models that predict wind turbine noise. In the first turbine row, turbulence-induced noise (TIN) and trailing edge noise (TEN) contribute equally, with TIN dominating at low frequencies and TEN at higher frequencies. Downstream, TEN decreases due to lower wind speeds, while TIN mostly persists due to increased turbulence dissipation. These effects are more pronounced in aligned wind farms, where stronger wake interactions occur, than in staggered layouts. However, staggered farms produce more noise overall because turbines operate at higher wind speeds.Additionally, wind farm flow significantly affects sound propagation downwind. The wake superposition modifies sound focusing leading to different amplification area than for an isolated turbine. For a staggered layout it particularly shows enhanced sound focusing downwind due to the position of the turbine wakes. This leads to higher sound levels and higher amplitude modulation downwind for the wind farm compared to an aligned layout. These phenomena are not captured by models based on isolated turbines. These findings underscore the importance of integrating flow and acoustic models to more accurately assess the environmental impact of wind farms.</description>
