      <title>Impacts and Statistical Mitigation of Missing Data on the 21cm Power Spectrum: A Case Study with the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise characterization and mitigation of systematic effects is one of the biggest roadblocks impeding the detection of the fluctuations of cosmological 21cm signals. Missing data in radio cosmological experiments, often due to radio frequency interference (RFI), poses a particular challenge to power spectrum analysis as it could lead to the ringing of bright foreground modes in Fourier space, heavily contaminating the cosmological signals. Here we show that the problem of missing data becomes even more arduous in the presence of systematic effects. Using a realistic numerical simulation, we demonstrate that partially flagged data combined with systematic effects can introduce significant foreground ringing. We show that such an effect can be mitigated through inpainting the missing data. We present a rigorous statistical framework that incorporates the process of inpainting missing data into a quadratic estimator of the 21cm power spectrum. Under this framework, the uncertainties associated with our inpainting method and its impact on power spectrum statistics can be understood. These results are applied to the latest Phase II observations taken by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array, forming a crucial component in power spectrum analyses as we move toward detecting 21cm signals in the ever more noisy RFI environment.</description>

      <title>Development of an unbiased cosmic shear estimator measured on galaxy images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since cosmic shear was first observed in 2000, it has become a key cosmological probe and promises to deliver exquisite dark energy constraints. However, shear is inferred from coherent distortions of galaxy shapes, and the relation between galaxy ellipticities and gravitational shear is a serious potential source of bias. To address this, we are developing a shear estimation method that makes no assumption on galaxy shapes, in order to avoid the shortcomings of a simulation-based shear calibration. Our method relies on the estimation of second moments on the image, and the evaluation of how second moments respond to a shear applied to the coordinate system, without altering the image itself, at variance with the Metacalibration method. We also evaluate analytically the noise bias due to the non-linearity of the estimator, and confront it with the bias derived from noisy image simulations, which allows a fast and precise noise bias correction.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Dark Matter Annihilation and Dark Matter-Baryon Velocity Offsets at Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter annihilation has the potential to leave an imprint on the properties of the first luminous structures at Cosmic Dawn as well as the overall evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM). In this work, we employ a semi-analytic method to model dark matter annihilation during Cosmic Dawn (approximately redshift $z=20$ to $40$), examining potential modifications to IGM evolution as well as gas collapse, cooling, and star formation in mini-halos. Our analysis takes into account the effects of dark matter-baryon velocity offsets, utilizing the public 21cmvFAST code, and producing predictions for the 21cm global signal. The results from our simplified model suggest that dark matter annihilation can suppress the gas fraction in small halos and alter the molecular cooling process, while the impact on star formation might be positive or negative depending on parameters of the dark matter model as well as the redshift and assumptions about velocity offsets. This underscores the need for more comprehensive simulations of the effects of exotic energy injection at Cosmic Dawn as observational probes are providing us new insights into the process of reionization and the formation of first stars and galaxies.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy in Pantheon+ supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ Maximum Likelihood Estimators to examine the Pantheon+ catalogue of Type Ia supernovae for large scale anisotropies in the expansion rate of the Universe. The analyses are carried out in the heliocentric frame, the CMB frame, as well as the Local Group frame. In all frames, the Hubble expansion rate in the redshift range 0.023 &lt; z &lt; 0.15 is found to have a statistically significant dipolar variation exceeding 1.5 km/s/Mpc, i.e. bigger than the claimed 1% uncertainty in the SH0ES measurement of the Hubble parameter H_0. The deceleration parameter too has a redshift-dependent dipolar modulation at &gt;5 sigma significance, consistent with previous findings using the SDSSII/SNLS3 Joint Lightcurve Analysis catalogue. The inferred cosmic acceleration cannot therefore be due to a Cosmological Constant, but is probably an apparent (general relativistic) effect due to the anomalous bulk flow in our local Universe.</description>

      <title>The Odd-Parity Part of the Observed Galaxy Trispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently the galaxy matter density 4-point correlation function has been looked at to investigate parity violation in large scale structure surveys. The 4-point correlation function is the lowest order statistic which is sensitive to parity violation, since a tetrahedron is the simplest shape that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image by a rotation. If the parity violation is intrinsic in nature, this could give us a window into inflationary physics. However, we need to exhaust all other contaminations before we consider them to be intrinsic. Even though the standard Newtonian redshift-space distortions are parity symmetric, the full relativistic picture is not. Therefore, we expect a parity-odd trispectrum when observing in redshift space. We calculate the trispectrum with the leading-order relativistic effects and investigate in detail the parameter space of the trispectrum and the effects of these relativistic corrections for different parameter values and configurations. We also look at different surveys and how the evolution and magnification biases can be affected by different parameter choices.</description>

      <title>Statistical Isotropy Violations in CMB Temperature Anisotropy: Analysis Using Minimal Bipolar Spherical Harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a follow-up to our previous work where the concept of minimal Bipolar spherical harmonics (mBipoSH) functions was introduced as a natural basis for studying angular correlations in the non-statistical isotropic (nSI) Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) sky. In this study, we extend the formalism of mBipoSH functions and apply it to analyze two sources of statistical isotropy (SI) violation-cosmic hemispherical asymmetry (CHA) and non-circular (NC) beam shapes. We present the analytical expression for mBipoSH functions and plot the corresponding angular correlation functions for these cases, addressing the $L=1$ and $L=2$ multipole statistical isotropy violations within the BipoSH basis. Our results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, as it successfully captures and explains the observed angular correlations in the CMB sky.</description>

      <title>Transmutation of interacting quintessence in the late universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the presence of an interaction between dark energy and dark matter can induce a transmutation of quintessence from thawing to scaling freezing. The analysis is done in a Lagrangian approach where dark energy and dark matter are treated as spin zero fields. Remarkably, with the cosmological constraints on energy densities of dark matter and dark energy, such a transmutation can occur in the late universe and searchable in accumulating cosmological data by DESI and other dark energy-related experiments. We give a fit to the dark energy equation of state which can be used by experimental collaborations to search for this transmutation that can occur at redshifts up to $z=13$ depending on the interaction strength. A transmutation in the range $z=1-3$ is already within reach of current and near future experiments.</description>

      <title>AI-Powered Reconstruction of Dark Matter Velocity Fields from Redshift-Space Halo Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of cosmology and galaxy evolution, the peculiar velocity and density field of dark matter (DM) play a crucial role in studying many issues. Here, we propose a UNet-based deep learning to reconstruct the real-space DM velocity field from the spatial distribution of a sparse sample of DM halos in redshift space. By comparing and testing various properties, we demonstrate that the reconstructed velocity field is in good agreement with the actual situation. At $k&lt;0.3~h/{\rm Mpc}$, the reconstruction of various velocity field components, including velocity magnitude and divergence, outperforms traditional linear perturbation theory. Additionally, the effects of redshift space distortions (RSD) are well corrected using the UNet model. Compared to the true real-space power spectra, the UNet reconstruction provides an unbiased estimate of the density, velocity, and momentum fields, remaining consistent within $2\sigma$ level. We also demonstrate that the UNet model remains effective even with limited information about halo masses. Thus, our proposed UNet model has a wide range of applications in various aspects of cosmology, such as RSD, cosmic web analysis, the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, BAO reconstruction, and so on.</description>

      <title>Map-based E/B separation of filtered timestreams using space-based E-mode observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: E to B mixing or "leakage" due to time-ordered data (TOD) filtering has become an important source of sensitivity loss that ground-based cosmic microwave background polarization experiments must address. However, it is a difficult problem for which very few viable solutions exist. In this paper, we expand upon satellite E-mode methods to cover E/B leakage specifically due to TOD filtering. We take a satellite E-mode map and TOD filter it through the ground-based experiment data analysis pipeline, from which we construct a map-space "leakage template" and subtract it from the ground-based experiment map. We evaluate the residual leakage by simulating the satellite E-mode maps with Planck-like and LiteBIRD-like noise levels, and simulate the ground-based experiment with Simons Observatory-like and CMB-S4-like noise levels. The effectiveness of the method is measured in the improvement of the Fisher uncertainty $\sigma(r=0)$. We find that our method can reduce $\sigma(r=0)$ by $\sim15\text{--}75\%$ depending on the noise levels considered.</description>

      <title>How bad could it be? Modelling the 3D complexity of the polarised dust signal using moment expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variation of the physical conditions across the three dimensions of our Galaxy is a major source of complexity for the modelling of the foreground signal facing the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In the present work, we demonstrate that the spin-moment expansion formalism provides a powerful framework to model and understand this complexity, with a special focus on that arising from variations of the physical conditions along each line-of-sight on the sky. We perform the first application of the moment expansion to reproduce a thermal dust model largely used by the CMB community, demonstrating its power as a minimal tool to compress, understand and model the information contained within any foreground model. Furthermore, we use this framework to produce new models of thermal dust emission containing the maximal amount of complexity allowed by the current data, remaining compatible with the observed angular power-spectra by the $Planck$ mission. By assessing the impact of these models on the performance of component separation methodologies, we conclude that the additional complexity contained within the third dimension could represent a significant challenge for future CMB experiments and that different component separation approaches are sensitive to different properties of the moments.</description>

      <title>BAO vs. SN evidence for evolving dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We critically review the evidence for time-varying dark energy from recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Supernova (SN) observations. First, we show that such evidence is present at the 3$\sigma$ level, even without the new BAO data from the dark energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), by instead using BAO data from the dark energy Survey (DES), combined with the DES5Y supernovae and Planck CMB data. Next, we examine the role of the DES5Y supernova dataset, showing that the preference for time-varying dark energy is driven by the low redshift supernovae common to both the DES5Y and Pantheon+ compilations. We find that combining Pantheon+ and DES5Y supernovae by removing the common supernovae leads to two different results, depending on whether they are removed from the DES5Y or the Pantheon+ catalog, leading to stronger or weaker exclusion of $\Lambda$CDM, at the (3.8$\sigma$) and (2.5$\sigma$) level, respectively. These common supernovae have smaller error bars in DES5Y compared to Pantheon+, and, as recently pointed out, there is an offset in magnitude in DES5Y between supernovae at ($z &gt; 0.1$), where almost all the measurements taken during the full five years of DES are, and the low-redshift ones ($z &lt; 0.1$), where all the historical set of nearby supernovae lies. We show that marginalizing over such an offset in DES5Y would lead to significantly weaker evidence for evolving dark energy.</description>

      <title>Bridge the Cosmological Tensions with Thawing Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is found that a non-minimally coupled scalar tensor theory, Thawing Gravity (TG), can explain multiple tensions plaguing the standard cosmological model $\Lambda$CDM while fitting better to observations than the latter. Using the standard Bayes model comparison method, TG has moderate evidence over $\Lambda$CDM with a Bayes factor $\ln B=+1.5$ in the baseline analysis including CMB, BAO and SNIa. In the baseline+$H_0$ analysis which further takes into account the Cepheids calibration of the SNIa distance ladder from SH0ES, TG has very strong evidence over $\Lambda$CDM with $\ln B=+11.8$. In particular, TG yields $H_0=71.78\pm0.86 \ {\rm km/s/Mpc}$ and $S_8=0.793\pm0.012$, consistent with both local $H_0$ measurement and the large scale structure surveys.</description>

      <title>Investigating the galaxy-halo connection of DESI Emission-Line Galaxies with SHAMe-SF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey is mapping the large-scale distribution of millions of Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) over vast cosmic volumes to measure the growth history of the Universe. However, compared to Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs), very little is known about the connection of ELGs with the underlying matter field. In this paper, we employ a novel theoretical model, SHAMe-SF, to infer the connection between ELGs and their host dark matter subhaloes. SHAMe-SF is a version of subhalo abundance matching that incorporates prescriptions for multiple processes, including star formation, tidal stripping, environmental correlations, and quenching. We analyse the public measurements of the projected and redshift-space ELGs correlation functions at $z=1.0$ and $z=1.3$ from DESI One Percent data release, which we fit over a broad range of scales $r \in [0.1, 30]/h^{-1}$Mpc to within the statistical uncertainties of the data. We also validate the inference pipeline using two mock DESI ELG catalogues built from hydrodynamical (TNG300) and semi-analytical galaxy formation models (\texttt{L-Galaxies}). SHAMe-SF is able to reproduce the clustering of DESI-ELGs and the mock DESI samples within statistical uncertainties. We infer that DESI ELGs typically reside in haloes of $\sim 10^{11.8}h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$ when they are central, and $\sim 10^{12.5}h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$ when they are a satellite, which occurs in $\sim$30 \% of the cases. In addition, compared to the distribution of dark matter within halos, satellite ELGs preferentially reside both in the outskirts and inside haloes, and have a net infall velocity towards the centre. Finally, our results show evidence of assembly bias and conformity.</description>

      <title>Towards cosmological inference on unlabeled out-of-distribution HI observational data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an approach that can be utilized in order to account for the covariate shift between two datasets of the same observable with different distributions, so as to improve the generalizability of a neural network model trained on in-distribution samples (IDs) when inferring cosmology at the field level on out-of-distribution samples (OODs) of {\it unknown labels}. We make use of HI maps from the two simulation suites in CAMELS, IllustrisTNG and SIMBA. We consider two different techniques, namely adversarial approach and optimal transport, to adapt a target network whose initial weights are those of a source network pre-trained on a labeled dataset. Results show that after adaptation, salient features that are extracted by source and target encoders are well aligned in the embedding space, indicating that the target encoder has learned the representations of the target domain via the adversarial training and optimal transport. Furthermore, in all scenarios considered in our analyses, the target encoder, which does not have access to any labels ($\Omega_{\rm m}$) during adaptation phase, is able to retrieve the underlying $\Omega_{\rm m}$ from out-of-distribution maps to a great accuracy of $R^{2}$ score $\ge$ 0.9, comparable to the performance of the source encoder trained in a supervised learning setup. We further test the viability of the techniques when only a few out-of-distribution instances are available and find that the target encoder still reasonably recovers the matter density. Our approach is critical in extracting information from upcoming large scale surveys.</description>

      <title>Radiation Exposure from the Dark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that exotic forms of dark matter could expose humans on Earth or on prolonged space travel to a significant radiation dose. The radiation exposure from dark matter interacting with nuclei in the human body is generally assumed to be negligible compared to other sources of background radiation. However, as we discuss here, current data allow for dark matter models where this is not necessarily true. In particular, if dark matter is heavier and more strongly interacting than weakly interacting massive particle dark matter, it could act as ionizing radiation and deposit a significant amount of radiation energy in all or part of the human population, similar to or even exceeding the known radiation exposure from other background sources. Conversely, the non-observation of such an exposure can be used to constrain this type of heavier and more strongly interacting dark matter. We first consider the case where dark matter scatters elastically and identify the relevant parameter space in a model-independent way. We also discuss how previous bounds from cosmological probes, as well as atmospheric and space-based detectors, might be avoided, and how a re-analysis of existing radiation data, along with a simple experiment monitoring ionizing radiation in space with a lower detection threshold, could help constrain part of this parameter space. We finally propose a hypothetical dark matter candidate that scatters inelastically and argue that, in principle, one per mille of the Earth's population could attain a significant radiation dose from such a dark matter exposure in their lifetime.</description>

      <title>Searching for GeV Gamma-Ray Polarization and Axion-Like Particles with AMS-02</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the detectability of GeV-band gamma-ray polarization with the AMS-02 experiment and a proposed successor, from Galactic and extragalactic sources. Characterizing gamma-ray polarization in this energy range could shed light on gamma-ray emission mechanisms in the sources; physics beyond the Standard Model, such as the presence of axion-like particles (ALPs), could also induce a distinctive energy-dependent polarization signal due to propagation effects in magnetic fields. We present estimates for the minimum detectable polarization from bright sources and the forecast reach for axion-like particles (ALPs). We show that for an example bright extragalactic source (NGC1275), AMS-02 will only have sensitivity to ALP-induced polarization from currently open parameter space if the B-field configuration is unusually favorable to a signal. However, a successor experiment such as AMS-100 would be expected to probe new parameter space even for pessimistic B-field models, with prospects to measure the energy-dependence of such a signal. For Galactic sources, polarization measurements could provide a unique test of scenarios where ALPs induce energy-dependent features in the photon intensity. However, in the absence of a bright transient source (such as a Galactic supernova), the parameter space that would be probed by this approach with ten years of AMS-100 data is already nominally excluded by other experiments, although this conflict may be avoided in specific ALP models.</description>

      <title>Rips and regular future scenario with Holographic Dark Energy: A comprehensive look</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interest on the possible future scenarios the universe could have has grew substantially with breakthroughs on late-time acceleration. Holographic dark energy (HDE) presents a very interesting approach towards addressing late-time acceleration, presenting an intriguing interface of ideas from quantum gravity and cosmology. In this work we present an extensive discussion of possible late-time scenarios, focusing on rips and similar events, in a universe with holographic dark energy. We discuss these events in the realm of the generalized Nojiri-Odintsov cutoff and also for the more primitive holographic cutoffs like Hubble, particle and event horizon cutoffs. We also discuss the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics and various energy conditions in these regimes. Our work points towards the idea that it is not possible to have alternatives of the big rip consistently in the simpler HDE cutoffs, and shows the flexibility of the generalized HDE cutoff as well.</description>

      <title>Implication of preheating on gravity assisted baryogenesis in $R^2$-Higgs inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of preheating on baryogenesis in $R^2$-Higgs inflation. In this scenario, the inclusion of a dimension-six operator ${(R/ \Lambda^2)} B_{\mu\nu} \widetilde{B}^{\mu\nu} $ abundantly generates helical hypermagnetic fields during inflation, leading to a baryon asymmetric Universe at the electroweak crossover. Focusing on the $R^2$-like regime, we first derive the relevant dynamics of preheating using a doubly-covariant formalism. We find that preheating can happen for the Higgs, transverse gauge and Goldstone bosons, however, it is dependent on the value of the non-minimal coupling $\xi_H$ between the Standard Model Higgs field and the Ricci scalar. We identify the preheating temperature to determine the appropriate scale $\Lambda$ for driving baryogenesis, which is around $\Lambda \sim 2.2 \, (2.6) \times 10^{-5}\, M_{\rm P}$ for $\xi_H \sim 1 \, (10)$. Our results represent the most accurate estimation of the scale of gravity induced baryogenesis in $R^2$-Higgs inflation to date. Areas for further improvement are identified.</description>

      <title>Comparing geometric and gravitational particle production in Jordan and Einstein frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore cosmological particle production associated with inflationary fluctuations by comparing gravitational and geometric mechanisms, within a non-minimal Yukawa-like coupling between a inflaton and spacetime curvature. We show under which circumstances the number of geometric particles is comparable to the purely gravitational contribution by introducing the S-matrix formalism and approximating the inflationary potentials through power series. Despite the geometric production is a second-order effect, we show that it cannot be neglected \emph{a priori}, emphasizing that throughout inflation we do expect geometric particles to form as well as in the reheating phase. This result is investigated in both the Jordan and Einstein frames, selecting inflationary potentials supported by the Planck Satellite outcomes, \textit{i.e.}, the Starobinsky, hilltop, $\alpha$-attractor, and natural inflationary paradigms. We notice that, for large field approaches, the only feasible coupling may occur in case of extremely small field-curvature coupling constants, while the small field frameworks, namely the hilltop and $\alpha$-attractor models with quartic behavior, are essentially ruled out since they do not appear dynamically viable. We then point out that, while dynamically there exists a net equivalence between the Jordan and Einstein frames, the number of particles appears quite different passing from a representation to another one, thus pointing out the existence of a possible \emph{quantum frame issue}. In summary, while the classical inflationary dynamics is equivalently described in the Jordan and Einstein frames, a viable physical description of particle production valid in both the frames may be hindered by the absence of a complete quantum gravity. The latter could therefore be seen as missing puzzle to address the longstanding challenge of consistently passing between the two frames.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark Yang-Mills sectors that confine to form stable composite states, known as glueballs, have been traditionally proposed as a potential explanation for cosmological Dark Matter (DM). Earlier studies have established viability of the lightest scalar glueball as a possible DM candidate. In this work, we explore a whole class of effective composite sectors in the confined Yang-Mills regime featuring an additional pseudoscalar glueball state. We also investigate the role of effective interactions of the dark glueball sector with the visible sectors via higher-dimensional operators primarily focusing on dimension-8 couplings of glueballs to photons and gluons. We stress the remarkable similarities between the phenomenology of such glueball effective theories and Standard Model extensions featuring Axion-Like Particles (ALPs). Hence, one deals with a new class of composite Glueball ALPs (or GALPs) coupled to photons and/or nucleons in a wide mass range, from sub-eV to the Planck scale, yielding viable DM candidates that can be probed by astrophysical and cosmological observations.</description>

Abstract: We present an exact solution to standard model hydrodynamic cosmological perturbation theory in a matter-dominated era that is taken to be adiabatic. The solution is in the form of hypergeometric functions. While such functions can oscillate they do not appear to oscillate with the acoustic sound velocity. We show that for the model the hydrodynamic assumption is only valid at low frequencies, with viscous effects being needed in order to maintain the covariant conservation of the perturbed energy-momentum tensor.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Bayesian CMB Component Separation with the No-U-Turn Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14170</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.14170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a novel implementation of Bayesian CMB component separation. We sample from the full posterior distribution using the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), a gradient-based sampling algorithm. Alongside this, we introduce new foreground modelling approaches. We use the mean-shift algorithm to define regions on the sky, clustering according to naively estimated foreground spectral parameters. Over these regions we adopt a complete pooling model, where we assume constant spectral parameters, and a hierarchical model, where we model individual pixel spectral parameters as being drawn from underlying hyper-distributions. We validate the algorithm against simulations of the \textit{LiteBIRD} and C-BASS experiments, with an input tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r=5\times 10^{-3}$. Considering multipoles $30\leq\ell&lt;180$, we are able to recover estimates for $r$. With \textit{LiteBIRD}-only observations, and using the complete pooling model, we recover $r=(12.9\pm 1.4)\times 10^{-3}$. For C-BASS and \textit{LiteBIRD} observations we find $r=(9.0\pm 1.1)\times 10^{-3}$ using the complete pooling model, and $r=(5.2\pm 1.0)\times 10^{-3}$ using the hierarchical model. Unlike the complete pooling model, the hierarchical model captures pixel-scale spatial variations in the foreground spectral parameters, and therefore produces cosmological parameter estimates with reduced bias, without inflating the their uncertainties. Measured by the rate of effective sample generation, NUTS offers performance improvements of $\sim10^3$ over using Metropolis-Hastings to fit the complete pooling model. The efficiency of NUTS allows us to fit the more sophisticated hierarchical foreground model, that would likely be intractable with non-gradient based sampling algorithms.</description>

      <title>Primordial Magnetic Fields in Light of Dark Ages Global 21-cm Signal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the constraints on primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) in light of the global 21-cm signal observed during the dark ages. Primordial magnetic fields can heat the intergalactic medium (IGM) via magnetohydrodynamic effects. We investigate the impact of magnetic heating on the dark ages global 21-cm signal and constrain the present-day strength of primordial magnetic fields and their spectral indices. Since there were no stars during the Dark Ages, measuring the global 21-cm signal can provide pristine cosmological information. However, detecting this signal using ground-based telescopes is challenging. Several lunar and space-based experiments, such as FARSIDE, DAPPER, and FarView, have been proposed to detect the signal in future. Our findings indicate that measuring the 21-cm global signal during the Dark Ages can provide stronger bounds compared to the existing constraints from Planck 2016. Specifically, the bounds are independent of astrophysical uncertainties and stronger for spectral indices $-2.84 \leq n_B \leq -1.58$. Additionally, we explore the dark-ages consistency ratio, which can identify any non-standard heating of the IGM by measuring the 21-cm signal at only three different redshifts. This approach could complement future experiments aimed at detecting the Dark Ages global 21-cm signal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High fidelity separation of astrophysical foreground contributions from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) signal has been recognized as one of the main challenges of modern CMB data analysis, and one which needs to be addressed in a robust way to ensure that the next generation of CMB polarization experiments lives up to its promise. In this work we consider the non-parametric maximum likelihood CMB cleaning approach recently proposed by some of the authors which has been shown to match the performance of standard parametric techniques for simple foreground models, while superseding it in cases where the foregrounds do not exhibit a simple frequency dependence. We present a new implementation of the method in pixel space, extending its functionalities to account for spatial variability of the properties of the foregrounds. We describe the algorithmic details of our approach and its validation against the original code as well as the parametric method for various experimental set-ups and different models of the foreground components. We argue that the method provides a compelling alternative to other state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

Abstract: We present a new perturbative full-shape analysis of BOSS galaxy clustering data, including the full combination of the galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum multipoles, baryon acoustic oscillations, and cross-correlations with the gravitational lensing of cosmic microwave background measured from \textit{Planck}. Assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model, we constrain the matter density fraction $\Omega_m = 0.3138\pm 0.0086$, the Hubble constant $H_0=68.23\pm 0.78\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8=0.688\pm 0.026$ (equivalent to $S_8 = 0.703\pm 0.029$). Cosmic structure at low redshifts appears suppressed with respect to the Planck $\Lambda$CDM concordance model at $4.5\sigma$. We explore whether this tension can be explained by the recent DESI preference for dynamical dark energy (DDE): the BOSS data combine with DESI BAO and PantheonPlus supernovae competitively compared to the CMB, yielding no preference for DDE, but the same $\sim 10\%$ suppression of structure, with dark energy being consistent with a cosmological constant at 68\% CL. Our results suggest that either the data contains residual systematics, or more model-building efforts may be required to restore cosmological concordance.</description>

      <title>Prospects for cosmological research with the FAST array: 21-cm intensity mapping survey observation strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise cosmological measurements are essential for understanding the evolution of the universe and the nature of dark energy. The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), the most sensitive single-dish radio telescope, has the potential to provide the precise cosmological measurements through neutral hydrogen 21-cm intensity mapping sky survey. This paper primarily explores the potential of technological upgrades for FAST in cosmology. The most crucial upgrade begins with equipping FAST with a wide-band receiver ($0 &lt; z &lt; 2.5$). This upgrade can enable FAST to achieve higher precision in cosmological parameter estimation than the Square Kilometre Array Phase-1 Mid frequency. On this basis, expanding to a FAST array (FASTA) consisting of six identical FASTs would offer significant improvements in precision compared to FAST. Additionally, compared with the current results from the data combination of cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations (optical galaxy surveys), and type Ia supernovae, FASTA can provide comparable constraints. Specifically, for the dark-energy equation-of-state parameters, FASTA can achieve $\sigma(w_0) = 0.09$ and $\sigma(w_a) = 0.33$.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric late-time expansion history reconstruction and implications for the Hubble tension in light of recent DESI and Type Ia supernovae data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We non-parametrically reconstruct the late-time expansion history in light of the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI combined with various Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) catalogs, using interpolation through piece-wise natural cubic splines, and a reconstruction procedure based on Gaussian Processes (GPs). Applied to DESI BAO and PantheonPlus SNeIa data, both methods indicate that deviations from a reference $\Lambda$CDM model in the $z \lesssim 2$ unnormalized expansion rate $E(z)$ are constrained to be $\lesssim 10\%$, but also consistently identify two features in $E(z)$: a bump at $z \sim 0.5$, and a depression at $z \sim 0.9$, which cannot be simultaneously captured by a $w_0w_a$CDM fit. These features, which are stable against assumptions regarding spatial curvature, interpolation knots, and GP kernel, disappear if one adopts the older SDSS BAO measurements in place of DESI, and decrease in significance when replacing the PantheonPlus catalog with the Union3 and DESY5 ones. We infer $c/(r_dH_0)=29.90 \pm 0.33$, with $r_d$ the sound horizon at baryon drag and $H_0$ the Hubble constant. Breaking the $r_d$-$H_0$ degeneracy with the SH0ES prior on $H_0$, the significance of the tension between our non-parametric determination of $r_d=136.20^{+2.20}_{-2.40}\,{\text{Mpc}}$ and the \textit{Planck} $\Lambda$CDM-based determination is at the $5\sigma$ level, slightly lower than the $6\sigma$ obtained when adopting the older SDSS dataset in place of DESI. This indicates the persistence at very high significance of the ``sound horizon tension'', reinforcing the need for pre-recombination new physics. If substantiated in forthcoming data releases, our results tentatively point to oscillatory/non-monotonic features in the shape of the expansion rate at $z \lesssim 2$, of potential interest for dark energy model-building.</description>

      <title>Updated Cosmological Constraints in Extended Parameter Space with Planck PR4, DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and Supernovae: Dynamical Dark Energy, Neutrino Masses, Lensing Anomaly, and the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present updated constraints on cosmological parameters in a 12-parameter model, extending the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM by including dynamical dark energy (DE: $w_0$, $w_a$), the sum of neutrino masses ($\sum m_{\nu}$), the effective number of non-photon radiation species ($N_{\rm eff}$), the lensing amplitude scaling ($A_{\rm lens}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha_s$). For CMB data, we use the Planck PR4 (2020) HiLLiPoP and LoLLiPoP likelihoods, Planck PR4+ACT DR6 lensing, and Planck 2018 low-$l$ TT likelihoods, along with DESI DR1 BAO and Pantheon+ and DESY5 uncalibrated type Ia Supernovae (SNe) likelihoods. Key findings are the following: i) Contrary to DESI results, CMB+BAO+Pantheon+ data include a cosmological constant within $2\sigma$, while CMB+BAO+DESY5 excludes it at over $2\sigma$, indicating the dynamical nature of dark energy is not yet robust. Potential systematics in the DESY5 sample may drive this exclusion. ii) Some data combinations show a $1\sigma$+ detection of non-zero $\sum m_{\nu}$, indicating possible future detection. We also provide a robust upper bound of $\sum m_{\nu} \lesssim 0.3$ eV (95% confidence limit (C.L.)). iii) With CMB+BAO+SNe, $A_{\rm lens} = 1$ is included at $2\sigma$ (albeit not at $1\sigma$), indicating no significant lensing anomaly in this extended cosmology with Planck PR4 likelihoods. iv) The Hubble tension persists at $3.2$ to $3.9\sigma$, suggesting these simple extensions do not resolve it. v) The $S_8$ tension with DES Year 3 weak lensing is reduced to $1.4\sigma$, likely due to additional parameters and the Planck PR4 likelihoods.</description>

      <title>Constraining Galaxy-Halo Connection Using Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of machine learning (ML) methods to model small-scale galaxy clustering for constraining Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) parameters. Our analysis reveals that while many ML algorithms report good statistical fits, they often yield likelihood contours that are significantly biased in both mean values and variances relative to the true model parameters. This highlights the importance of careful data processing and algorithm selection in ML applications for galaxy clustering, as even seemingly robust methods can lead to biased results if not applied correctly. ML tools offer a promising approach to exploring the HOD parameter space with significantly reduced computational costs compared to traditional brute-force methods if their robustness is established. Using our ANN-based pipeline, we successfully recreate some standard results from recent literature. Properly restricting the HOD parameter space, transforming the training data, and carefully selecting ML algorithms are essential for achieving unbiased and robust predictions. Among the methods tested, artificial neural networks (ANNs) outperform random forests (RF) and ridge regression in predicting clustering statistics, when the HOD prior space is appropriately restricted. We demonstrate these findings using the projected two-point correlation function ($w_\mathrm{p}(r_\mathrm{p})$), angular multipoles of the correlation function ($\xi_\ell(r)$), and the void probability function (VPF) of Luminous Red Galaxies from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument mocks. Our results show that while combining $w_\mathrm{p}(r_\mathrm{p})$ and VPF improves parameter constraints, adding the multipoles $\xi_0$, $\xi_2$, and $\xi_4$ to $w_\mathrm{p}(r_\mathrm{p})$ does not significantly improve the constraints.</description>

      <title>Impact of the cosmological expansion on spectral energy density of radiation in the intergalactic medium and once more about Olbers' paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06616v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the impact of the expansion of the Universe on the formation of total spectral energy density of radiation in the intergalactic medium. Assuming the same proper thermal spectrum of sources, we show how the expansion of the Universe changes the nature of the energy distribution of the thermal spectrum: a decrease of the energy density in the Wien range and an increase in the Rayleigh--Jeans range with increasing the redshift of the bulk filled by sources. This is due to the cosmological redshift and the growing contribution of large number of distant sources. The numerical estimations also illustrate the main factors that resolve the Olbers' paradox in the expanding Universe: i) the particle horizon, ii) the finiteness of the volume filled by luminous objects, and iii) the cosmological redshift. Applying the obtained expressions to the epoch of reionization made it possible to estimate the concentration of objects of various classes (stars, globular clusters, dwarf galaxies) necessary for complete reionization of hydrogen at $z=6$. It is shown that even a small part of globular clusters or dwarf galaxies with a thermal spectrum of moderate temperature, from those predicted by Press-Schechter formalism and its improvements, is able to completely reionize hydrogen in the intergalactic medium at $z=6$.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Slow-Roll Inflation on the Lattice: Backreaction and Nonlinear Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Violating the slow-roll regime during the final stages of inflation can significantly enhance curvature perturbations, a scenario often invoked in models producing primordial black holes and small-scale scalar induced gravitational waves. When perturbations are enhanced, one approaches the regime in which tree-level computations are insufficient, and nonlinear corrections may become relevant. In this work, we conduct lattice simulations of ultra-slow-roll (USR) dynamics to investigate the significance of nonlinear effects, both in terms of backreaction on the background and in the evolution of perturbations. Our systematic study of various USR potentials reveals that nonlinear corrections are significant when the tree-level curvature power spectrum peaks at $\mathcal{P}^{\rm max}_{\zeta} = {\cal O}(10^{-3})-{\cal O}(10^{-2})$, with 5\%$-$10\% corrections. Larger enhancements yield even greater differences. We find a simple universal relation between simulation and tree-level quantities $\dot\phi = \dot\phi_{\rm tree}\left(1+\sqrt{\mathcal{P}^{\rm max}_{\zeta,\rm tree}}\right)$ at the end of the USR phase, which is valid in all cases we consider. Additionally, we explore how nonlinear interactions during the USR phase affect the clustering and non-Gaussianity of scalar fluctuations, crucial for understanding the phenomenological consequences of USR, such as scalar-induced gravitational waves and primordial black holes. Our findings demonstrate the necessity of going beyond leading order perturbation theory results, through higher-order or non-perturbative computations, to make robust predictions for inflation models exhibiting a USR phase.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Coupled Dark Energy Models with Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether neural networks (NNs) can accurately differentiate between growth-rate data of the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe simulated via two models: a cosmological constant and $\Lambda$ cold dark matter (CDM) model and a tomographic coupled dark energy (CDE) model. We built an NN classifier and tested its accuracy in distinguishing between cosmological models. For our dataset, we generated $f\sigma_8(z)$ growth-rate observables that simulate a realistic Stage IV galaxy survey-like setup for both $\Lambda$CDM and a tomographic CDE model for various values of the model parameters. We then optimised and trained our NN with \texttt{Optuna}, aiming to avoid overfitting and to maximise the accuracy of the trained model. We conducted our analysis for both a binary classification, comparing between $\Lambda$CDM and a CDE model where only one tomographic coupling bin is activated, and a multi-class classification scenario where all the models are combined. For the case of binary classification, we find that our NN can confidently (with $&gt;86\%$ accuracy) detect non-zero values of the tomographic coupling regardless of the redshift range at which coupling is activated and, at a $100\%$ confidence level, detect the $\Lambda$CDM model. For the multi-class classification task, we find that the NN performs adequately well at distinguishing $\Lambda$CDM, a CDE model with low-redshift coupling, and a model with high-redshift coupling, with 99\%, 79\%, and 84\% accuracy, respectively. By leveraging the power of machine learning, our pipeline can be a useful tool for analysing growth-rate data and maximising the potential of current surveys to probe for deviations from general relativity.</description>

      <title>UNCOVER: A NIRSpec Census of Lensed Galaxies at z=8.50-13.08 Probing a High AGN Fraction and Ionized Bubbles in the Shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11609v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present JWST NIRSpec prism spectroscopy of gravitationally lensed galaxies at $z\gtrsim9$ found behind the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744 in the UNCOVER Cycle 1 Treasury Program. We confirm the source redshift via emission lines and/or the Ly$\alpha$ break feature for ten galaxies at z=8.50-13.08 down to $M_{\rm UV}=-17.3$. We achieve a high confirmation rate of 100\% for $z&gt;9$ candidates reported in Atek et al. (2023). Using six sources with multiple emission line detections, we find that the offset of the redshift estimates between the lines and the Ly$\alpha$ break alone with prism can be as large as $\pm0.2$, raising caution in designing future follow-up spectroscopy for the break-only sources with ALMA. With spec-$z$ confirmed sources in UNCOVER and the literature, we derive lower limits on the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) at $z\simeq9$-12 and find these lower limits to be consistent with recent photometric measurements. We identify at least two unambiguous and several possible active galactic nucleus (AGN) systems based on X-ray emission, broad line (BL) H$\beta$, high ionization line (e.g., NIV]1487, CIV1549) detections, and excess in UVLF. This requires the AGN LFs at $z\simeq$ 9-10 to be comparable or even higher than the X-ray AGN LF estimated at $z\sim6$ and indicates a plausible cause of the high abundance of $z&gt;9$ galaxies claimed in recent photometric studies may be AGNs. One UV-luminous source is confirmed at the same redshift as a dusty BL AGN at $z=8.50$ with a physical separation of 380 kpc in the source plane. These two sources show blueward Ly$\alpha$ line or continuum emission, suggesting that they reside in the same ionized bubble with a radius of $7.69\pm0.18$ pMpc. Our results imply that AGNs have a non-negligible contribution to cosmic reionization.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{slick}$: Modeling a Universe of Molecular Line Luminosities in Hydrodynamical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present {\sc slick} (the Scalable Line Intensity Computation Kit), a software package that calculates realistic CO, [\ion{C}{1}], and [\ion{C}{2}] luminosities for clouds and galaxies formed in hydrodynamic simulations. Built on the radiative transfer code {\sc despotic}, {\sc slick} computes the thermal, radiative, and statistical equilibrium in concentric zones of model clouds, based on their physical properties and individual environments. We validate our results applying {\sc slick} to the high-resolution run of the {\sc Simba} simulations, testing the derived luminosities against empirical and theoretical/analytic relations. To simulate the line emission from a universe of emitting clouds, we have incorporated random forest machine learning (ML) methods into our approach, allowing us to predict cosmologically evolving properties of CO, [\ion{C}{1}] and [\ion{C}{2}] emission from galaxies such as luminosity functions. We tested this model in 100,000 gas particles, and 2,500 galaxies, reaching an average accuracy of $\sim$99.8\% for all lines. Finally, we present the first model light cones created with realistic and ML-predicted CO, [\ion{C}{1}], and [\ion{C}{2}] luminosities in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, from $z=0$ to $z=10$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastable `false' vacuum states are an important feature of the Standard Model of particle physics and many theories beyond it. Describing the dynamics of a phase transition out of a false vacuum via the nucleation of bubbles is essential for understanding the cosmology of vacuum decay and the full spectrum of observables. In this paper, we study vacuum decay by numerically evolving ensembles of field theories in 1+1 dimensions from a metastable state. We demonstrate that for an initial Bose-Einstein distribution of fluctuations, bubbles form with a Gaussian spread of center-of-mass velocities and that bubble nucleation events are preceded by an oscillon -- a long-lived, time-dependent, pseudo-stable configuration of the field. Defining an effective temperature from the long-wavelength amplitude of fluctuations in the ensemble of simulations, we find good agreement between theoretical finite temperature predictions and empirical measurements of the decay rate, velocity distribution and critical bubble solution. We comment on the generalization of our results and the implications for cosmological observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the Lagrangian method to study the post-Newtonian evolution of a compact binary system with environmental effects, including a dark matter spike, and obtain the resulting gravitational wave emission. This formalism allows one to incorporate post-Newtonian effects up to any desired known order, as well as any other environmental effect around the binary, as long as their dissipation power or force formulae are known. In particular, in this work, we employ this method to study a black hole--black hole binary system of mass ratio $10^5$ by including post-Newtonian effects of order 1PN and 2.5PN, as well as the effect of relativistic dynamical friction. We obtain the modified orbits and the corresponding modified gravitational waveform. Finally, we contrast these modifications against the LISA sensitivity curve in frequency space and show that this observatory can detect the associated signals.</description>

Abstract: Unimodular gravity became an object of increasing interest in the late $80$-ties and was recently used in primordial Universe modeling with cosmological constant, in the context of the Brans-Dicke gravity including scalar field. In the present article we investigate the possibility of imposing the unimodular condition within the $5$-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory including the scalar field. The variational principle is formulated in $5$ dimensions first, and dimensional reduction is applied to the resulting set of equations. A cosmological model based on these equations is then presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>The SAGA Survey. III. A Census of 101 Satellite Systems around Milky Way-mass Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Data Release 3 (DR3) of the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey, a spectroscopic survey characterizing satellite galaxies around Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies. The SAGA Survey DR3 includes 378 satellites identified across 101 MW-mass systems in the distance range of 25-40.75 Mpc, and an accompanying redshift catalog of background galaxies (including about 46,000 taken by SAGA) in the SAGA footprint of 84.7 sq. deg. The number of confirmed satellites per system ranges from zero to 13, in the stellar mass range of 10^6 to 10^10 solar masses. Based on a detailed completeness model, this sample accounts for 94% of the true satellite population down to a stellar mass of 10^7.5 solar masses. We find that the mass of the most massive satellite in SAGA systems is the strongest predictor of satellite abundance; one-third of the SAGA systems contain LMC-mass satellites, and they tend to have more satellites than the MW. The SAGA satellite radial distribution is less concentrated than the MW's, and the SAGA quenched fraction below 10^8.5 solar masses is lower than the MW's, but in both cases, the MW is within 1 sigma of SAGA system-to-system scatter. SAGA satellites do not exhibit a clear corotating signal as has been suggested in the MW/M31 satellite systems. Although the MW differs in many respects from the typical SAGA system, these differences can be reconciled if the MW is an older, slightly less massive host with a recently accreted LMC/SMC system.</description>

      <title>Hawking Radiation of Nonrelativistic Scalars: Applications to Pion and Axion Production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In studying secondary gamma-ray emissions from Primordial Black Holes (PBHs), the production of scalar particles like pions and axion-like particles (ALPs) via Hawking radiation is crucial. While previous analyses assumed relativistic production, asteroid-mass PBHs, relevant to upcoming experiments like AMEGO-X, likely produce pions and ALPs non-relativistically when their masses exceed 10 MeV. To account for mass dependence in Hawking radiation, we revisit the greybody factors for massive scalars from Schwarzschild black holes, revealing significant mass corrections to particle production rates compared to the projected AMEGO-X sensitivity. We highlight the importance of considering non-relativistic $\pi^0$ production in interpreting PBH gamma-ray signals, essential for determining PBH properties. Additionally, we comment on the potential suppression of pion production due to form factor effects when producing extended objects via Hawking radiation. We also provide an example code for calculating the Hawking radiation spectrum of massive scalar particles.</description>

      <title>Probing the Morphology of Polarized Emission Induced by Fluctuation Dynamo using Minkowski Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The morphology and the characteristic scale of polarized structures provide crucial insights into the mechanisms that drive turbulence and maintain magnetic fields in magneto-ionic plasma. We aim to establish the efficacy of Minkowski functionals as quantitative statistical probes of filamentary morphology of polarized synchrotron emission resulting from fluctuation dynamo action. Using synthetic observations generated from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of fluctuation dynamos with varying driving scales ($\ell_{\rm f}$) of turbulence in isothermal, incompressible, and subsonic media, we study the relation between different morphological measures and their connection to fractional polarization ($p_{\rm f}$). We find that Faraday depolarization at low frequencies gives rise to small-scale polarized structures that have higher filamentarity as compared to the intrinsic structures that are comparable to $\ell_{\rm f}$. Above $\sim3\,{\rm GHz}$, the number of connected polarized structures per unit area ($N_{\rm CC, peak}$) is related to the mean $p_{\rm f}$ ($\langle p_{\rm f} \rangle$) of the emitting region as $\langle p_{\rm f}\rangle \propto N_{\rm CC, peak}^{-1/4}$, provided the scale of the detectable emitting region is larger than $\ell_{\rm f}$. This implies that $N_{\rm CC,peak}$ represents the number of turbulent cells projected on the plane of the sky and can be directly used to infer $\ell_{\rm f}$ via the relation $\ell_{\rm f} \propto N_{\rm CC,peak}^{-1/2}$. An estimate of $\ell_{\rm f}$ thus directly allows for pinning down the turbulence-driving mechanism in astrophysical systems. While the simulated conditions are mostly prevalent in the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters, the qualitative morphological features are also applicable in the context of interstellar medium in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Scalaron dark matter and the thermal history of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In metric $f(R)$ gravity minimally coupled to the Standard Model, the scalaron field can act as a dark-matter candidate if its mass lies in the range $\text{meV} \lesssim m \lesssim \text{MeV}$. The evolution of the scalaron is influenced by the trace of the stress-energy tensor, whose behaviour, as shown in our previous work, becomes non-adiabatic during the electroweak crossover, potentially triggering scalaron oscillations. While we previously approximated this crossover as a second-order phase transition at the one-loop level, the transition is actually smoother. In this paper, we refine our analysis to account for this smooth crossover and show that scalaron oscillations are still excited in a qualitatively similar manner, driven by the rapid dynamics of the electroweak crossover observed in numerical lattice simulations, provided the scalaron mass is sufficiently small. We also investigate the time-dependent contribution to the stress-energy trace due to the trace anomaly of quantum chromodynamics. Our results indicate that, while the trace anomaly shifts the scalaron's equilibrium value, this shift evolves adiabatically compared to the fast oscillations of the scalaron, meaning that the trace anomaly does not significantly affect the potential cosmological scenarios for scalaron evolution.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass and ultralight dark matter mass from the Higgs mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a model in which small neutrino masses are generated via Yukawa coupling to a self-interacting ultralight dark matter (ULDM) field, treated as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with a heavy Higgs-like field. ULDM has a mass \( m \gtrsim 10^{-22}~\text{eV} \) and a characteristic energy scale \( \tilde{m} \simeq 10~\text{eV} \). The resulting neutrino mass, as well as the mass and self-interaction strength of ULDM, align with cosmological observations. A quantum stability condition for an ULDM effective potential demands a small mass for neutrinos roughly bounded by $\tilde{m}$. The phase transition temperature for the Higgs mechanism can approach the grand unified theory (GUT) scale, potentially inducing the electroweak scale by reverting the type I seesaw mechanism for Majonara neutrinos. In this framework, neutrino masses can vary with spacetime, a feature that may be experimentally detectable through neutrino oscillation experiments. We also explore a scenario in which the tiny ULDM mass arises through radiative corrections via the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, beginning from a massless field theory.
  Our model addresses both the neutrino mass and ULDM mass puzzles through a unified approach, providing insights into possible extensions of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>BayeSN and SALT: A Comparison of Dust Inference Across SN Ia Light-curve Models with DES5YR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years there has been significant debate around the impact of dust on SNe Ia, a major source of uncertainty in cosmological analyses. We perform the first cross-comparison of the probabilistic hierarchical SN Ia SED model BayeSN with the conventional SALT model, an important test given the history of conflicting conclusions regarding the distributions of host galaxy dust properties between the two. Applying BayeSN to SALT-based simulations, we find that BayeSN is able to accurately recover our simulated inputs, establishing excellent consistency between the two models. When inferring dust parameters with simulated samples including non-Ia contamination, we find that our choice of photometric classifier causes a bias in the inferred dust distribution; this arises because SNe Ia heavily impacted by dust are misclassified as contaminants and excluded. We then apply BayeSN to the sample of SNe from DES5YR to jointly infer host galaxy dust distributions and intrinsic differences on either side of the 'mass step' at $10^{10}$ M$\odot$. We find evidence in favour of an intrinsic contribution to the mass step and differing $R_V$ distributions. We also build on recent results supporting an environmental-dependence on the secondary maximum of SNe Ia in $i$-band. Twenty days post-peak, we find an offset in intrinsic $i$-band light curve between each mass bin at a significance in excess of $3\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Early Bright Galaxies from Helium Enhancements in High-Redshift Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first few cycles of JWST have identified an overabundance of UV-bright galaxies and a general excess of UV luminosity density at $z\gtrsim10$ compared to expectations from most (pre-JWST) theoretical models. Moreover, some of the brightest high-redshift spectroscopically confirmed galaxies exhibit peculiar chemical abundance patterns, most notably extremely high N/O ratios. Since N/O has been empirically shown to scale strongly with He/H, as expected for hot hydrogen burning, these same bright high-redshift galaxies are likely also helium-enhanced. Under simplistic assumptions for stellar evolution, the bolometric luminosity of a star scales as $L\propto (4-\frac{9}{2}Y+\frac{5}{4}Y^{2})^{-1}$ -- hence a higher He/H leads to brighter stars. In this Letter, we evolve a series of MESA models to the zero-age main-sequence and highlight that the helium enhancements at the levels measured and inferred for high-redshift galaxies can boost the 1500 $\mathring{\rm A}$ UV luminosity by up to $\sim50\%$, while simultaneously increasing the stellar effective temperature. The combination of helium enhancements with nebular continuum emission expected for intense bursts of star formation have the potential to help reduce the tension between JWST observations and certain galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>Toward Gravitational Lensing in Modified Theories of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate gravitational lensing within modified gravity frameworks, focusing on the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ and normal branch Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) models, and we compare these results with those obtained from general relativity (GR). Our results reveal that both modified gravity models consistently enhance key lensing parameters relative to GR, including the Einstein radius, lensing optical depth, and time delays. Notably, we find that the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ and nDGP models yield significantly larger Einstein radii and higher lensing probabilities, especially at greater redshifts, indicating an increased likelihood of lensing events under modified gravity. Our analysis of time delays further shows that the broader mass distributions in these frameworks lead to pronounced differences in high-mass lens systems, providing potential observational markers of modified gravity. Additionally, we observe amplified magnification factors in wave optics regimes, highlighting the potential for gravitational wave (GW) lensing to differentiate modified gravity effects from GR predictions. Through these findings, we propose modified gravity theories as compelling alternatives to GR in explaining cosmic phenomena, with promising implications for future high-precision gravitational lensing surveys.</description>
