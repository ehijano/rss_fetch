      <title>Minimal motifs for habituating systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Habituation - a phenomenon in which a dynamical system exhibits a diminishing response to repeated stimulations that eventually recovers when the stimulus is withheld - is universally observed in living systems from animals to unicellular organisms. Despite its prevalence, generic mechanisms for this fundamental form of learning remain poorly defined. Drawing inspiration from prior work on systems that respond adaptively to step inputs, we study habituation from a nonlinear dynamics perspective. This approach enables us to formalize classical hallmarks of habituation that have been experimentally identified in diverse organisms and stimulus scenarios. We use this framework to investigate distinct dynamical circuits capable of habituation. In particular, we show that driven linear dynamics of a memory variable with static nonlinearities acting at the input and output can implement numerous hallmarks in a mathematically interpretable manner. This work establishes a foundation for understanding the dynamical substrates of this primitive learning behavior and offers a blueprint for the identification of habituating circuits in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Confinement-driven state transition and bistability in schooling fish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of confinement density (i.e the number of individuals in a group per unit area of available space) on transitions from polarized to milling state, using groups of rummy-nose tetra fish (\textit{Hemigrammus rhodostomus}) under controlled experimental conditions. We demonstrate a continuous state transition controlled by confinement density in a group of live animals. During this transition, the school exhibits a bistable state, wherein both polarization and milling states coexist, with the group randomly alternating between them. A simple two-state Markov process describes the observed transition remarkably well. The confinement density influences the statistics of this bistability, shaping the distribution of transition times between states. Our findings suggest that confinement plays a crucial role in state transitions for moving animal groups. More generally, they provide an experimental benchmark for active matter models of macroscopic, self-propelled, confined agents.</description>

      <title>Selective decision-making and collective behavior of fish by the motion of visual attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective motion provides a spectacular example of self-organization in Nature. Visual information plays a crucial role among various types of information in determining interactions. Recently, experiments have revealed that organisms such as fish and insects selectively utilize a portion, rather than the entirety, of visual information. Here, focusing on fish, we propose an agent-based model where the direction of attention is guided by visual stimuli received from the images of nearby fish. Our model reproduces a branching phenomenon where a fish selectively follows a specific individual as the distance between two or three nearby fish increases. Furthermore, our model replicates various patterns of collective motion in a group of agents, such as vortex, polarized school, swarm, and turning. We also discuss the topological nature of the visual interaction, as well as the positional distribution of nearby fish and the map of pairwise and three-body interactions induced by them. Through a comprehensive comparison with existing experimental results, we clarify the roles of visual interactions and issues to be resolved by other forms of interactions.</description>
