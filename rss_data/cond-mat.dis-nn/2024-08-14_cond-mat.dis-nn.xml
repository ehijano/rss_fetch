      <title>Neural Networks as Spin Models: From Glass to Hidden Order Through Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a one-to-one correspondence between a neural network (NN) and a statistical mechanical spin model where neurons are mapped to Ising spins and weights to spin-spin couplings. The process of training an NN produces a family of spin Hamiltonians parameterized by training time. We study the magnetic phases and the melting transition temperature as training progresses. First, we prove analytically that the common initial state before training--an NN with independent random weights--maps to a layered version of the classical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass exhibiting a replica symmetry breaking. The spin-glass-to-paramagnet transition temperature is calculated. Further, we use the Thouless-Anderson-Palmer (TAP) equations--a theoretical technique to analyze the landscape of energy minima of random systems--to determine the evolution of the magnetic phases on two types of NNs (one with continuous and one with binarized activations) trained on the MNIST dataset. The two NN types give rise to similar results, showing a quick destruction of the spin glass and the appearance of a phase with a hidden order, whose melting transition temperature $T_c$ grows as a power law in training time. We also discuss the properties of the spectrum of the spin system's bond matrix in the context of rich vs. lazy learning. We suggest that this statistical mechanical view of NNs provides a useful unifying perspective on the training process, which can be viewed as selecting and strengthening a symmetry-broken state associated with the training task.</description>

      <title>Multifractal critical phase driven by coupling quasiperiodic systems to electromagnetic cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the effects of criticality and multifractal states in a one-dimensional Aubry-Andre-Harper model coupled to electromagnetic cavities. We focus on two specific cases where the phonon frequencies are $\omega_{0}=1$ and $\omega_{0}=2$, respectively. Phase transitions are analyzed using both the average and minimum inverse participation ratio to identify metallic, fractal, and insulating states. We provide numerical evidence to show that the presence of the optical cavity induces a critical, intermediate phase in between the extended and localized phases, hence drastically modifying the traditional transport phase diagram of the Aubry-Andre-Harper model, in which critical states can only exist at the well-defined metal-insulator critical point. We also investigate the probability distribution of the inverse participation ratio and conduct a multifractal analysis to characterize the nature of the critical phase, in which we show that extended, localized, and fractal eigenstates coexist. Altogether our findings reveal the pivotal role that the coupling to electromagnetic cavities plays in tailoring critical transport phenomena at the microscopic level of the eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Simple fluctuations in simple glass formers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical single-particle fluctuations associated with particle displacements are inherent to simple glass-forming liquids in the limit of large dimensions and leave a pseudo-critical trace across all finite dimensions. This characteristic could serve as a crucial test for distinguishing between theories of glass formation. We here examine these critical fluctuations, as captured by the well-established non-Gaussian parameter, within both mode-coupling theory (MCT) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) across dimensions for hard sphere liquids and for the minimally structured Mari--Kurchan model. We establish general scaling laws relevant to any liquid dynamics theory in large dimensions and show that the dimensional scalings predicted by MCT are inconsistent with those from DMFT. Simulation results for hard spheres in moderately high dimensions align with the DMFT scenario, reinforcing the relevance of mean-field theory for capturing glass physics in finite dimensions. We identify potential adjustments to MCT to account for certain mean-field physics. Our findings also highlight that local structure and spatial dimensionality can affect single-particle critical fluctuations in non-trivial ways.</description>

      <title>Uncontrolled learning: co-design of neuromorphic hardware topology for neuromorphic algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hardware-based neuromorphic computing remains an elusive goal with the potential to profoundly impact future technologies and deepen our understanding of emergent intelligence. The learning-from-mistakes algorithm is one of the few training algorithms inspired by the brain's simple learning rules, utilizing inhibition and pruning to demonstrate self-organized learning. Here we implement this algorithm in purely neuromorphic memristive hardware through a co-design process. This implementation requires evaluating hardware trade-offs and constraints. It has been shown that learning-from-mistakes successfully trains small networks to function as binary classifiers and perceptrons. However, without tailoring the hardware to the algorithm, performance decreases exponentially as the network size increases. When implementing neuromorphic algorithms on neuromorphic hardware, we investigate the trade-offs between depth, controllability, and capacity, the latter being the number of learnable patterns. We emphasize the significance of topology and the use of governing equations, demonstrating theoretical tools to aid in the co-design of neuromorphic hardware and algorithms. We provide quantitative techniques to evaluate the computational capacity of a neuromorphic device based on the measurements performed and the underlying circuit structure. This approach shows that breaking the symmetry of a neural network can increase both the controllability and average network capacity. By pruning the circuit, neuromorphic algorithms in all-memristive device circuits leverage stochastic resources to drive local contrast in network weights. Our combined experimental and simulation efforts explore the parameters that make a network suited for displaying emergent intelligence from simple rules.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian integral that counts regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent article J. Phys. Compl. 4 (2023) 035005, Kawamoto evoked statistical physics methods for the problem of counting graphs with a prescribed degree sequence. This treatment involved truncating a particular Taylor expansion at the first two terms, which resulted in the Bender-Canfield estimate for the graph counts. This is surprisingly successful since the Bender-Canfield formula is asymptotically accurate for large graphs, while the series truncation does not a priori suggest a similar level of accuracy.
  We upgrade the above treatment in three directions. First, we derive an exact formula for counting d-regular graphs in terms of a d-dimensional Gaussian integral. Second, we show how to convert this formula into an integral representation for the generating function of d-regular graph counts. Third, we perform explicit saddle point analysis for large graph sizes and identify the saddle point configurations responsible for graph count estimates. In these saddle point configurations, only two of the integration variables condense to significant values, while the remaining ones approach zero for large graphs. This provides an underlying picture that justifies Kawamoto's earlier findings.</description>

      <title>Thermally activated particle motion in biased correlated Gaussian disorder potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermally activated particle motion in disorder potentials is controlled by the large-$\Delta V$ tail of the distribution of height $\Delta V$ of the potential barriers created by the disorder. We employ the optimal fluctuation method to evaluate this tail for correlated quenched Gaussian potentials in one dimension in the presence of a small bias of the potential. We focus on the mean escape time (MET) of overdamped particles averaged over the disorder. We show that the bias leads to a strong (exponential) reduction of the MET in the direction along the bias. The reduction depends both on the bias, and on detailed properties of the covariance of the disorder, such as its derivatives and asymptotic behavior at large distances. We verify our theoretical predictions for the large-$\Delta V$ tail of the barrier height distribution, as well as earlier predictions of this tail for zero bias, by performing large-deviation simulations of the potential disorder. The simulations employ correlated random potential sampling based on the circulant embedding method and the Wang-Landau algorithm, which enable us to probe probability densities smaller than $10^{-1200}$.</description>
