      <title>An Exactly Solvable Dual Bus Route Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1998, O'Loan et al. introduced a simplified bus route model to illustrate bus dynamics. However, due to fluctuations in passenger numbers, achieving an exact solution for the model's stationary state remains challenging, as these fluctuations can impact the buses' behavior. In this study, we present an exactly solvable model for the dual bus route model whose dynamics expand upon O'Loan et al.'s model. Using this dual model allows us to analyze bus route dynamics comprehensively. However, our model introduces additional parameters not previously considered by O'Loan et al. to account for neighboring effects, which have the potential to influence the average stationary current and velocity of buses. When the neighboring effect is weak, our model behaves similarly to O'Loan et al.'s bus route model. However, in the presence of a strong neighboring effect, our model exhibits intriguing characteristics.</description>

      <title>Geometric measures of uniaxial solids of revolution in ${\mathbb{R}^{4}}$ and their relation to the second virial coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide analytical expressions for the second virial coefficients of hard, convex, monoaxial solids of revolution in ${\mathbb{R}^{4}}$. The excluded volume per particle and thus the second virial coefficient is calculated using quermassintegrals and rotationally invariant mixed volumes based on the Brunn-Minkowski theorem. We derive analytical expressions for the mutual excluded volume of four-dimensional hard solids of revolution in dependence on their aspect ratio $\nu$ including the limits of infinitely thin oblate and infinitely long prolate geometries. Using reduced second virial coefficients $B_2^{\ast}=B_2/V_{\mathrm{P}}$ as size-independent quantities with $V_{\mathrm{P}}$ denoting the $D$-dimensional particle volume, the influence of the particle geometry to the mutual excluded volume is analyzed for various shapes. Beyond the aspect ratio $\nu$, the detailed particle shape influences the reduced second virial coefficients $B_2^{\ast}$. We prove that for $D$-dimensional spherocylinders in arbitrary-dimensional Euclidean spaces ${\mathbb{R}^{D}}$ their excluded volume solely depends on at most three intrinsic volumes, whereas for different convex geometries $D$ intrinsic volumes are required. For $D$-dimensional ellipsoids of revolution, the general parity $B_2^{\ast}(\nu)=B_2^{\ast}(\nu^{-1})$ is proven.</description>

      <title>A general multi-wave quasi-resonance theory for lattice energy diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, a multi-wave quasi-resonance framework is established to analyze energy diffusion in classical lattices, uncovering that it is fundamentally determined by the characteristics of eigenmodes. Namely, based on the presence and the absence of extended modes, lattices fall into two universality classes with qualitatively different thermalization behavior. In particular, we find that while the one with extended modes can be thermalized under arbitrarily weak perturbations in the thermodynamic limit, the other class can be thermalized only when perturbations exceed a certain threshold, revealing for the first time the possibility that a lattice cannot be thermalized, violating the hypothesis of statistical mechanics. Our study addresses conclusively the renowned Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou problem for large systems under weak perturbations, underscoring the pivotal roles of both extended and localized modes in facilitating energy diffusion and thermalization processes.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Transformations in Dissipative and Non-Hermitian Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12337v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor has established itself as a general framework for the analysis and detection of equilibrium phase transitions in isolated quantum systems. We propose a novel generalization of the quantum geometric tensor, which offers a universal approach to studying phase transitions in non-Hermitian quantum systems. Our generalization is based on the concept of the generator of adiabatic transformations and can be applied to systems described by either a Liouvillian superoperator or by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We illustrate the proposed method by analyzing the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and a generic quasi-free dissipative fermionic system with a quadratic Liouvillian. Our findings reveal that this method effectively identifies phase transitions across all examined models, providing a universal tool for investigating general non-Hermitian systems.</description>

Abstract: But if you treat it as a two-form, you get three nontrivial renormalization group fixed points! Which becomes the Heisenberg fixed point in three dimensions? Motivated by this question, we study the conformal bootstrap constraint in the $O(d)$ anti-symmetric matrix model in $d$ dimensions, varying $d$ as a continuous parameter. Besides the one that is naturally connected to the Heisenberg fixed point in three dimensions, we find ``evanescent" kinks whose origin is yet to be identified. We also bootstrap $O(4), O(5), O(6)$ anti-symmetric matrix model in $d=3$, aiming at physical applications.</description>

      <title>Irreversible Boltzmann samplers in dense liquids: weak-coupling approximation and mode-coupling theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exerting a nonequilibrium drive on an otherwise equilibrium Langevin process brings the dynamics out of equilibrium but can also speedup the approach to the Boltzmann steady-state. Transverse forces are a minimal framework to achieve dynamical acceleration of the Boltzmann sampling. We consider a simple liquid in three space dimensions subjected to additional transverse pairwise forces, and quantify the extent to which transverse forces accelerate the dynamics. We first explore the dynamics of a tracer in a weak coupling regime describing high temperatures. The resulting acceleration is correlated with a monotonous increase of the magnitude of odd transport coefficients (mobility and diffusivity) with the amplitude of the transverse drive. We then develop a nonequilibrium version of the mode-coupling theory able to capture the effect of transverse forces, and more generally of forces created by additional degrees of freedom. Based on an analysis of transport coefficients, both odd and longitudinal, both for the collective modes and for a tracer particle, we find a systematic acceleration of the dynamics. Quantitatively, the gain, which is guaranteed throughout the ergodic phase, turns out to be a decreasing function of temperature beyond a temperature crossover, in particular as the glass transition is approached. Our theoretical results are in good agreement with available numerical results.</description>

      <title>Mining higher-order triadic interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex systems often present higher-order interactions which require us to go beyond their description in terms of pairwise networks. Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order interaction that occurs when one node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order networks, found in a large variety of biological systems, from neuron-glia interactions to gene-regulation and ecosystems. However, triadic interactions have been so far mostly neglected. In this article, we propose a theoretical principle to model and mine triadic interactions from node metadata, and we apply this framework to gene expression data finding new candidates for triadic interactions relevant for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Our work reveals important aspects of higher-order triadic interactions often ignored, which can transform our understanding of complex systems and be applied to a large variety of systems ranging from biology to the climate.</description>

      <title>Identifying phase transitions in physical systems with neural networks: a neural architecture search perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of machine learning algorithms to investigate phase transitions in physical systems is a valuable way to better understand the characteristics of these systems. Neural networks have been used to extract information of phases and phase transitions directly from many-body configurations. However, one limitation of neural networks is that they require the definition of the model architecture and parameters previous to their application, and such determination is itself a difficult problem. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the relationship between the accuracy of neural networks for information of phases and the network configuration (that comprises the architecture and hyperparameters). We formulate the phase analysis as a regression task, address the question of generating data that reflects the different states of the physical system, and evaluate the performance of neural architecture search for this task. After obtaining the optimized architectures, we further implement smart data processing and analytics by means of neuron coverage metrics, assessing the capability of these metrics to estimate phase transitions. Our results identify the neuron coverage metric as promising for detecting phase transitions in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Slow dynamics and large deviations in classical stochastic Fredkin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.06989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fredkin spin chain serves as an interesting theoretical example of a quantum Hamiltonian whose ground state exhibits a phase transition between three distinct phases, one of which violates the area law. Here we consider a classical stochastic version of the Fredkin model, which can be thought of as a simple exclusion process subject to additional kinetic constraints, and study its classical stochastic dynamics. The ground state phase transition of the quantum chain implies an equilibrium phase transition in the stochastic problem, whose properties we quantify in terms of numerical matrix product states (MPS). The stochastic model displays slow dynamics, including power law decaying autocorrelation functions and hierarchical relaxation processes due to exponential localization. Like in other kinetically constrained models, the Fredkin chain has a rich structure in its dynamical large deviations - which we compute accurately via numerical MPS - including an active-inactive phase transition, and a hierarchy of trajectory phases connected to particular equilibrium states of the model. We also propose, via its height field representation, a generalization of the Fredkin model to two dimensions in terms of constrained dimer coverings of the honeycomb lattice.</description>

Abstract: As the quantification of metabolism, nonequilibrium steady states play a central role in living matter, but are beyond the purview of equilibrium statistical mechanics. Here we develop a fermionic theory of nonequilibrium steady states in continuous-time Markovian systems, generalizing Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics to this case. The response to an arbitrary perturbation is computed, and simplified in canonical cases. Beyond response, we consider ensembles of nonequilibrium steady states and show that a general class of ensembles is described by a 2D statistical field theory with infinitesimally broken supersymmetry, which may form the basis of nontrivial solvable models of nonequilibrium steady states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the dynamics of species abundances within ecological communities using the Generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) model. At variance with previous approaches, we present an analysis of stochastic GLV dynamics with temporal fluctuations in interaction strengths between species. We develop a dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) tailored for scenarios with annealed colored noise and simple functional responses. We show that time-dependent interactions can be effectively modeled as environmental noise in the DMFT and we obtain analytical predictions for the species abundance distribution that well matches empirical observations. Our results suggest that environmental noise favors species coexistence and allows to overcome the complexity-stability paradox, especially in comparison to dynamics with quenched disorder. This study offers new insights not only into the modeling of large ecosystem dynamics, but also proposes novel methodologies for examining ecological systems.</description>

Abstract: Recent work has given a systematic way for studying the kinetics of classical weakly interacting waves beyond leading order, having analogies with renormalization in quantum field theory. An important context is weak wave turbulence, occurring for waves which are small in magnitude and weakly interacting, such as those on the surface of the ocean. Here we continue the work of perturbatively computing correlation functions and the kinetic equation in this far-from-equilibrium state. In particular, we obtain the two-loop kinetic equation for waves with a cubic interaction. Our main result is a simple graphical prescription for the terms in the kinetic equation, at any order in the nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Entanglement phase transitions in non-Hermitian Floquet systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The competition between unitary time-evolution and quantum measurements could induce phase transitions in the entanglement characteristics of quantum many-body dynamics. In this work, we reveal such entanglement transitions in the context of non-Hermitian Floquet systems. Focusing on noninteracting fermions in a representative bipartite lattice with balanced gain/loss and under time-periodic quenches, we uncover rich patterns of entanglement transitions due to the interplay between driving and non-Hermitian effects. Specially, we find that the monotonic increase of quenched hopping amplitude could flip the system between volume-law and area-law entangled Floquet phases, yielding alternated entanglement transitions. Meanwhile, the raise of gain/loss strength could trigger area-law to volume-law reentrant transitions in the scaling behavior of steady-state entanglement entropy, which are abnormal and highly unexpected in non-driven systems. Connections between entanglement transitions and parity-time-reversal (PT) transitions in Floquet spectra are further established. Our findings not only build a foundation for exploring entanglement phase transitions in Floquet non-Hermitian setups, but also provide efficient means to engineer and control such transitions by driving fields.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-Induced Transitions in Anisotropic Two-Dimensional Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) turbulence features an inverse energy cascade that produces large-scale flow structures such as large-scale vortices (LSVs) and unidirectional jets. We investigate the dynamics of such structures using extensive direct numerical simulations (DNS) of randomly forced, viscously damped 2D turbulence within a periodic rectangular (Cartesian) domain $[0,L_x]\times[0,L_y]$. LSVs form and dominate the system when the domain aspect ratio $\delta = L_x/L_y \approx 1$, while unidirectional jets predominate at $\delta \gtrsim 1.1$. At intermediate $\delta$, both structures are metastable, with noise-induced transitions between LSVs and jets. We derive and verify predictions for the dependence of kinetic energy E and flow polarity on the nondimensional control parameters. We further collect detailed statistics on the lifetimes of LSVs and jets from DNS runs that are up to 10738 viscous diffusive times long. The distribution of the lifetimes is consistent with that of a memoryless process. Our DNS show an exponential dependence of the mean lifetime on $\delta$. Mean lifetimes depend sensitively on the Reynolds number Re: as Re increases, the energy gap between LSV (lower E) and jet states (higher E) arising from anisotropic dissipation increases, leading to an approximately exponential increase in lifetimes with Re for both LSVs and jets. Similarly, as the forcing scale decreases, transitions become less frequent. We study the transitions in detail, revealing that they occur in two stages: an initial, rapid redistribution of kinetic energy by nonlinear triadic interactions deforms LSVs into jets or vice versa. In the second stage, the energy of the newly formed structure slowly adjusts to its associated equilibrium value on a longer, viscous timescale, producing hysteresis. Our findings shed new light on the dynamics of coherent large-scale structures in anisotropic turbulence.</description>

      <title>Quest for optimal quantum resetting: protocols for a particle on a chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the classical context, it is well known that, sometimes, if the search does not find its target, it is better to start the process anew again, known as resetting. The quantum counterpart of resetting also indicates speeding up the detection process by eliminating the dark states, i.e., situations where the particle avoids detection. In this work, we introduce a most probable position resetting (MPR) protocol in which we reset the particle in a position where the probability of finding the particle could have been maximum, provided one would let the system evolve Unitarily in a given time window. In a tight-binding lattice model, there exists a 2-fold degeneracy (left and right) of the positions of maximum probability. The survival probability with optimal restart rate approaches zero (detection probability approaches one) when the particle is reset with equal probability on both sides. This protocol significantly reduces the optimal mean first-detected-passage time (FDT) and performs better even if the detector is far apart compared to the usual resetting protocols where the particle is brought back to the initial position. We propose a modified protocol, adaptive two-stage MPR, by making the associated probabilities of resetting to the right and left a function of resetting steps. In this protocol, we see a further reduction of the optimal mean FDT and improvement in the search process when the detector is far apart.</description>

      <title>Effect of the presence of pinned particles on the structural parameters of a liquid and correlation between structure and dynamics at the local level</title>

Abstract: Pinning particles at the equilibrium configuration of the liquid is expected not to affect the structure and any property that depends on the structure while slowing down the dynamics. This leads to a breakdown of the structure dynamics correlation. Here, we calculate two structural quantities, the pair excess entropy, $S_2$, and the mean field caging potential, the inverse of which is our structural order parameter (SOP). We show that when the pinned particles are treated the same way as the mobile particles, both $S_2$ and SOP of the mobile particles remain the same as that of the unpinned system, and the structure dynamics correlation decreases with an increase in pinning density, "c". However, when we treat the pinned particles as a different species, even if we consider that the structure does not change, the expression of $S_2$ and SOP changes. The microscopic expressions show that interaction between a pinned and mobile particle affects $S_2$ and SOP more than the interaction between two mobile particles. We show that a similar effect is also present in the calculation of the excess entropy and the primary reason for the well-known vanishing of the configurational entropy at high temperatures. We further show that contrary to common belief, the pinning process does change the structure. When these two effects are considered, both $S_2$ and SOP decrease with an increase in "c", and the correlation between the structural parameters and the dynamics continues even for higher values of "c".</description>

Abstract: We study Floquet systems with translationally invariant nearest-neighbor 2-site gates. Depending on the order in which the gates are applied on an N-site system with periodic boundary conditions, there are factorially many different circuit configurations. We prove that there are only N-1 different spectrally equivalent classes which can be viewed either as a generalization of the brick-wall or of the staircase configuration. Every class, characterized by two integers, has a nontrivial space-time symmetry with important implications for the level-spacing distribution -- a standard indicator of quantum chaos. Namely, in order to study chaoticity one should not look at eigenphases of the Floquet propagator itself, but rather at the spectrum of an appropriate root of the propagator.</description>

      <title>Typical thermalization of low-entanglement states</title>

Abstract: Proving thermalization from the unitary evolution of a closed quantum system is one of the oldest questions that is still nowadays only partially resolved. Several efforts have led to various formulations of what is called the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which leads to thermalization under certain conditions on the initial states. These conditions, however, are sensitive to the precise formulation of the hypothesis. In this work, we focus on the important case of low entanglement initial states, which are operationally accessible in many natural physical settings, including experimental schemes for testing thermalization and for quantum simulation. We prove thermalization of these states under precise conditions that have operational significance. More specifically, motivated by arguments of unavoidable finite resolution, we define a random energy smoothing on local Hamiltonians that leads to local thermalization when the initial state has low entanglement. Finally we show that such a transformation affects neither the Gibbs state locally nor, under generic smoothness conditions on the spectrum, the short-time dynamics.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of a charged Brownian particle in a magnetic field : an analysis of the roles of coupling via position and momentum variables</title>

Abstract: The study of decoherence plays a key role in our understanding of the transition from the quantum to the classical world. Typically, one considers a system coupled to an external bath which forms a model for an open quantum system. While most of the studies pertain to a position coupling between the system and the environment, some involve a momentum coupling, giving rise to an anomalous diffusive model. Here we have gone beyond existing studies and analysed the quantum Langevin dynamics of a harmonically oscillating charged Brownian particle in the presence of a magnetic field and coupled to an Ohmic heat bath via both position and momentum couplings. The presence of both position and momentum couplings leads to a stronger interaction with the environment, resulting in a faster loss of coherence compared to a situation where only position coupling is present. The rate of decoherence can be tuned by controlling the relative strengths of the position and momentum coupling parameters. In addition, the magnetic field results in the slowing down of the loss of information from the system, irrespective of the nature of coupling between the system and the bath. Our results can be experimentally verified by designing a suitable ion trap setup.</description>
