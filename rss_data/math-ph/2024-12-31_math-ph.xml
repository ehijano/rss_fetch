      <title>Notes on path integral reduction in scalar electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a method developed earlier for a finite-dimensional mechanical system, the problem of path integral reduction for scalar electrodynamics is considered. Using the Coulomb gauge, the stochastic differential equations for the reduced dynamics on the orbit space are obtained. It is shown that the geometry of the reduced space is completely determined by the behaviour of the material fields. Since the main role in the singular behavior of the reduction Jacobian is played by the mean curvature of the orbit, the final solution of the path inyegral reduction problem in the field system under consideration is possible only by carrying out an adequate regularization of the term that determines the volume of the orbit, and on which the additional correction to the interaction potential completely depends.</description>

      <title>Invariance of intrinsic hypercontractivity under perturbation of Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Schr\"odinger operator that is bounded below and has a unique positive ground state can be transformed into a Dirichlet form operator by the ground state transformation. If the resulting Dirichlet form operator is hypercontractive, Davies and Simon call the Schr\"odinger operator ``intrinsically hypercontractive". I will show that if one adds a suitable potential onto an intrinsically hypercontractive Schr\"odinger operator it remains intrinsically hypercontractive. The proof uses a fortuitous relation between the WKB equation and logarithmic Sobolev inequalities. All bounds are dimension independent. The main theorem will be applied to several examples.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics and large genus asymptotics of the Br\'ezin--Gross--Witten numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study combinatorial and asymptotic properties of some interesting rational numbers called the Br\'ezin--Gross--Witten (BGW) numbers, which can be represented as the intersection numbers of psi and Theta classes on the moduli space of stable algebraic curves. In particular, we discover and prove the uniform large genus asymptotics of certain normalized BGW numbers, and give a new proof of the polynomiality phenomenon for the large genus. We also propose several new conjectures including monotonicity and integrality on the BGW numbers. Applications to the Painlev\'e II hierarchy and to the BGW-kappa numbers are given.</description>

      <title>Curvature, area and Gauss-Bonnet formula of the Moyal sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied some geometric properties of the Moyal sphere. Using the conformal metric of the sphere in ordinary space and the matrix basis, we calculated the scalar curvature, total curvature integral and area of the Moyal sphere. We found that when the noncommutative parameter approaches to 0, the scalar curvature and area of the Moyal sphere return to those of the ordinary sphere. As the noncommutative parameter increases, the area of the Moyal sphere will decrease and eventually approach to 0. We found that the total curvature integral of the two-dimensional Moyal sphere still satisfies the usual Gauss-Bonnet formula and does not depend on the noncommutative parameter. We also calculated the approximate expression of the conformal metric with a constant curvature and obtained the corresponding correction function. In addition, we also studied a type of generalized deformed Moyal sphere with two noncommutative parameters and obtained similar results.</description>

      <title>Microlocal Analysis of a Deformed Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deformation technique, known as the warped convolution, takes quantum fields in Minkowski spacetime to quantum fields in noncommutative Minkowski space-time. Since a quantum field is an operator valued regular distribution and the warped convolution is (weakly) an oscillatory integral of Rieffel type, we prove that the symbol classes introduced by Hormander admit extensions which are suited to the warped convolutions of scalar quantum field operators. We further show that, if a particular vector state on the undeformed algebra of field operators fulfills the microlocal spectrum condition, then every vector state on the deformed algebra generated by these warped convolutions fulfills the microlocal spectrum condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we use the power of the outer exponential $\Lambda^B$ of a bivector $B$ to see the so-called invariant decomposition from a different perspective. This is deeply connected with the eigenvalues for the adjoint action of $B$, a fact that allows a version of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem which factorises the classical theorem (both the matrix version and the geometric algebra version).</description>

      <title>Universal hyper-scaling relations, power-law tails, and data analysis for strong anomalous diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong anomalous diffusion is {often} characterized by a piecewise-linear spectrum of the moments of displacement.
  The spectrum is characterized by slopes $\xi$ and $\zeta$ for small and large moments, respectively,
  and by the critical moment $\alpha$ of the crossover.
  The exponents $\xi$ and $\zeta$ characterize the asymptotic scaling of the bulk and the tails of the probability distribution function of displacements, respectively.
  Here, we adopt asymptotic theory to match the behaviors at intermediate scales.
  The resulting constraint explains how distributions with algebraic tails imply strong anomalous diffusion,
  and it relates $\alpha$ to the corresponding power law.
  Our theory provides novel relations between exponents characterizing strong anomalous diffusion,
  and it yields explicit expressions for the leading-order corrections to the asymptotic power-law behavior of the moments of displacement.
  They provide the time scale that must be surpassed to clearly discriminate the leading-order power law from its sub-leading corrections.
  This insight allows us to point out sources of systematic errors in their numerical estimates.
  Rather than separately fitting an exponent for each moment we devise a robust scheme to determine $\xi$, $\zeta$ and $\alpha$.
  The findings are supported by numerical and analytical results on five different models exhibiting strong anomalous diffusion.</description>

      <title>Generating and Computing Quantum Periods in Exact WKB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periods of rational integrals appear in quantum mechanics through asymptotic expansions of traces computed with the semiclassical symbol calculus. In particular, a novel formal series expansion for the trace of the Dirac delta of the quantization of a polynomial Hamiltonian is developed. Reducing these integrals modulo total derivatives results in a novel formula for normal forms of the integrals. In the case of one degree of freedom, the two dimensional residue formula relates the rational integrals to the quantum actions in the exact WKB formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider fairly general class of dynamical systems under the assumptions guaranteeing the existence of Lyapunov function around some nontrivial stationary point. Moreover, the existence of heteroclinic trajectory is proved motivated by integrated densities approach to some astrophysical models of self-gravitating particles both in relativistic and non--relativistic frameworks. Finally, with the aid of geometric and topological reasoning we find the upper bounds for this trajectory yielding the critical mass--radius theorem for the astrophysical model.</description>

      <title>Parametrized topological phases in 1d and T-duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are families of physical systems that cannot be adiabatically evolved to the trivial system uniformly across the parameter space, even if each system in the family belongs to the trivial phase. The obstruction is measured by higher Berry class. We analyze families of topological systems in 1+1d using families of invertible TQFTs and families of RG fixed states of spin chains. We use the generalized matrix-product states to describe RG fixed points of all translation invariant pure splits states on spin chains. Families of such fixed points correspond to bundles of Hilbert-Schmidt operators. There exists a global MPS parametrization of the family if and only if the latter bundle is trivial. We propose a novel duality of parametrized topological phases which is an avatar of the T-duality in string theory. The duality relates families with different parameter spaces and different higher Berry classes. Mathematically, the T-duality is realized by gauging the circle action on the continuous trace algebra generated by parametrized matrix-product tensors.</description>

Abstract: The quasi-classical expansion of a multicomponent spin solution of the star-star relation with hyperbolic Boltzmann weights is investigated. The equations obtained in a quasi-classical limit provide n-1-component extensions of certain scalar 5-point equations (corresponding to n=2) that were previously investigated by the author in the context of integrability and consistency of equations on face-centered cubics.</description>

      <title>Quantum tunneling and its absence in deep wells and strong magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new results on quantum tunneling between deep potential wells, in the presence of a strong constant magnetic field. We construct a family of double well potentials containing examples for which the low-energy eigenvalue splitting vanishes, and hence quantum tunneling is eliminated. Further, by deforming within this family, the magnetic ground state can be made to transition from symmetric to anti-symmetric. However, for typical double wells in a certain regime, tunneling is not suppressed, and we provide a lower bound for the eigenvalue splitting.</description>

      <title>Lattice random walks and quantum A-period conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive explicit closed-form expressions for the generating function $C_N(A)$, which enumerates classical closed random walks on square and triangular lattices with $N$ steps and a signed area $A$, characterized by the number of moves in each hopping direction. This enumeration problem is mapped to the trace of powers of anisotropic Hofstadter-like Hamiltonian and is connected to the cluster coefficients of exclusion particles: exclusion strength parameter $g = 2$ for square lattice walks, and a mixture of $g = 1$ and $g = 2$ for triangular lattice walks. By leveraging the intrinsic link between the Hofstadter model and high energy physics, we propose a conjecture connecting the above signed area enumeration $C_N(A)$ in statistical mechanics to the quantum A-period of associated toric Calabi-Yau threefold in topological string theory: square lattice walks correspond to local $\mathbb{F}_0$ geometry, while triangular lattice walks are associated with local $\mathcal{B}_3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically construct the spectrum of the Laplacian on Page's inhomogeneous Einstein metric on $\mathbb{CP}^2 \# \overline{\mathbb{CP}}^2$ by reducing the problem to a (singular) Sturm-Liouville problem in one dimension. We perform a perturbative analysis based upon a closely related, exactly solvable problem that strongly supports our results. We also study the spectrum of the Lichnerowicz Laplacian on symmetric traceless transverse two-tensors. The method relies on both the isometries of the Page metric and pseudospectral methods to numerically solve the resulting ODEs.</description>

      <title>Modular Intersections, Time Interval Algebras and Stringy AdS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the modular flow and conjugation of time interval algebras of conformal Generalized Free Fields (GFF) in $(0+1)$-dimensions in vacuum. For non-integer scaling dimensions, for general time-intervals, the modular conjugation and the modular flow of operators outside the algebra are non-geometric. This is because they involve a Generalized Hilbert Transform (GHT) that treats positive and negative frequency modes differently. However, the modular conjugation and flows viewed in the dual bulk AdS$_2$ are local, because the GHT geometrizes as the local antipodal symmetry transformation that pushes operators behind the Poincar\'e horizon. These algebras of conformal GFF satisfy a Twisted Modular Inclusion and a Twisted Modular Intersection property. We prove the converse statement that the existence of a (twisted) modular inclusion/intersection in any quantum system implies a representation of the (universal cover of) conformal group $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$, respectively. We discuss the implications of our result for the emergence of Stringy AdS$_2$ geometries in large $N$ theories without a large gap. Our result applied to higher dimensional eternal AdS black holes explains the emergence of two copies of $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$ on future and past Killing horizons.</description>

We also show that c-Entropy attains its maximum value (finite or infinite) whenever the perturbation parameter vanishes so that the impedance function of such a L-system belongs to one of the generalized (or regular) Donoghue classes.</description>

      <title>Inelastic Scattering, Emergent Interactions of Solitons in the Zakharov-Kuznetsov Equation through Conservative and non-Conservative Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are used to study collision process of soliton solutions in the 2+1 dimensional Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation. The Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation originally was the model in three dimensions of plasma with a uniform magnetic field and it is a direct extension of the KdV equation into higher dimensions and is a typical quasi-integrable system. PINNs successfully solve the equations in the forward process and the solutions are obtained using the mesh-free approach and automatic differentiation while accounting for conservation laws. In the inverse process, the proper form of the equation can be successfully derived from a given training data. On the other hand, the situation becomes weird in the collision process. The result in the forward analysis no longer possesses the conservation laws, which is ought to be referred to as a dynamically incompatible field configuration (DIFC) instead of the solutions of the system. Conservative PINNs are thus introduced and we succeed to obtain the solutions that satisfy the conservation laws. The inverse analysis suggests a different equation where the coefficients exhibit the significant changes, which implies an emergent temporal interaction. With these modulated coefficients, we recalculate the equation and confirm that the conservation law has unquestionably improved.</description>

      <title>A canonical foliation on null infinity in perturbations of Kerr</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kerr stability for small angular momentum has been proved in the series of works by Klainerman-Szeftel, Giorgi-Klainerman-Szeftel and Shen. Some of the most basic conclusions of the result, concerning various physical quantities on the future null infinity are derived in the work of Klainerman-Szeftel. Further important conclusions were later derived in An-He-Shen and Chen-Klainerman. In this paper, based on the existence and uniqueness results for GCM spheres by Klainerman-Szeftel, we establish the existence of a canonical foliation on the future null infinity for which the null energy, linear momentum, center of mass and angular momentum are well defined and satisfy the expected physical laws of gravitational radiation. The rigid character of this foliation eliminates the usual ambiguities related to these quantities in the physics literature. We also show that under the initial assumption of Klainerman-Szeftel, the center of mass of the black hole has a large deformation (recoil) after the perturbation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a detailed account of the N -component Toda lattice hierarchy. This hierarchy is an extended version of the one introduced by Ueno and Takasaki. Our version contains N discrete variables rather than one. We start from the Lax formalism, deduce the bilinear relation for the wave functions from it and then, based on the latter, prove existence of the tau-function. We also show how the multi-component Toda lattice hierarchy is embedded into the universal hierarchy which is basically the multi-component KP hierarchy. At last, we show how the bilinear integral equation for the tau-function can be obtained using the free fermion technique. An example of exact solutions (a multi-component analogue of one-soliton solutions) is given.</description>

      <title>Determinant, Characteristic Polynomial, and Inverse in Commutative Analogues of Clifford Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generators of a Clifford algebra anti-commute. This anti-commutativity is essential and allows the algebra to describe the plethora of things it is able to describe. It is then a natural question whether an analogous algebra whose generators commute with each other interesting or not. We call such an algebra a commutative analogue of Clifford algebra and study them in this paper. We note that commutativity makes life easier and gives us nice results. In particular, it is the case that such an algebra admits a decomposition as tensor product of algebras generated by a single generator. Once we have this decomposition, we use it to come up with a matrix representation of these algebras and then answer the multiplicative inverse problem i.e., how to find multiplicative inverses in these algebras. We give an explicit formula for multiplicative inverse of invertible element. In order to do this, we introduce the notion of determinant in commutative of Clifford algebras. We also consider notions of trace and characteristic polynomial coefficients and give explicit formulas for them.</description>

      <title>Self-similarity on 4d cubic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A phenomenon of "algebraic self-similarity" on 3d cubic lattice, providing what can be called an algebraic analogue of Kadanoff--Wilson theory, is shown to possess a 4d version as well. Namely, if there is a $4\times 4$ matrix $A$ whose entries are indeterminates over the field $\mathbb F_2$, then the $2\times 2\times 2\times 2$ block made of sixteen copies of $A$ reveals the existence of four direct "block spin" summands corresponding to the same matrix $A$. Moreover, these summands can be written out in quite an elegant way. Somewhat strikingly, if the entries of $A$ are just zeros and ones -- elements of $\mathbb F_2$ -- then there are examples where two more "block spins" split out, and this time with different $A$'s.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase estimation and realistic detection schemes in Mach-Zehnder interferometer using SU(2) coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum parameter estimation, the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound (QCRB) sets a fundamental limit on the precision achievable with unbiased estimators. It relates the uncertainty in estimating a parameter to the inverse of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). Both QCRB and QFI are valuable tools for analyzing interferometric phase sensitivity. This paper compares the single-parameter and two-parameter QFI for a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with three detection schemes: single-mode and difference intensity detection, neither has access to an external phase reference and balanced homodyne detection with access to an external phase reference. We use a spin-coherent state associated with the su(2) algebra as the input state in all scenarios and show that all three schemes can achieve the QCRB for the spin-coherent input state. Furthermore, we explore the utilization of SU(2) coherent states in diverse scenarios. Significantly, we find that the best pressure is obtained when the total angular momentum quantum number $j$ is high, and we demonstrate that given optimal conditions, all detection schemes can achieve the QCRB by utilizing SU(2) coherent states as input states.</description>

      <title>Ramanujan Property and Edge Universality of Random Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the normalized adjacency matrix of a random $d$-regular graph on $N$ vertices with any fixed degree $d\geq 3$ and denote its eigenvalues as $\lambda_1=d/\sqrt{d-1}\geq \lambda_2\geq\lambda_3\cdots\geq \lambda_N$. We establish the following two results as $N\rightarrow \infty$. (i) With high probability, all eigenvalues are optimally rigid, up to an additional $N^{{\rm o}(1)}$ factor. Specifically, the fluctuations of bulk eigenvalues are bounded by $N^{-1+{\rm o}(1)}$, and the fluctuations of edge eigenvalues are bounded by $N^{-2/3+{\rm o}(1)}$. (ii) Edge universality holds for random $d$-regular graphs. That is, the distributions of $\lambda_2$ and $-\lambda_N$ converge to the Tracy-Widom$_1$ distribution associated with the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble. As a consequence, for sufficiently large $N$, approximately $69\%$ of $d$-regular graphs on $N$ vertices are Ramanujan, meaning $\max\{\lambda_2,|\lambda_N|\}\leq 2$.</description>

      <title>Consistent deformations in the presymplectic BV-AKSZ approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for studying consistent interactions of local gauge theories, which is based on the presymplectic BV-AKSZ formulation. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it operates in terms of finite-dimensional spaces and avoids working with quotient spaces such as local functionals or functionals modulo on-shell trivial ones. The structure that is being deformed is that of a presymplectic gauge PDE, which consists of a graded presymplectic structure and a compatible odd vector field. These are known to encode the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formulation of a local gauge theory in terms of the finite dimensional supergeometrical object. Although in its present version the method is limited to interactions that do not deform the pre-symplectic structure and relies on some natural assumptions, it gives a remarkably simple way to analyse consistent interactions. The approach can be considered as the BV-AKSZ extension of the frame-like approach to consistent interactions. We also describe the underlying homological deformation theory, which turns out to be slightly unusual compared to the standard deformations of differential graded Lie algebras. As an illustration, the Chern-Simons and YM theories are rederived starting from their linearized versions.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by (perturbative) quantum observables in Lorentzian signature we define a new operad: the operad of causally disjoint disks. In order to describe this operad we use the orthogonal categories of Benini, Schenkel, and Woike and the prefactorization functor of Benini, Carmona, Grant-Stuart, and Schenkel. Along the way we extend these constructions to the topological setting, i.e., (multi-)categories enriched over spaces.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the special case of the chiral magnet with vanishing Heisenberg exchange energy, whose axisymmetric Skyrmion solution has previously been found. The dynamical equations of this model look like inviscid fluid flow, and by investigating path-lines of this flow we can construct explicit static and dynamic solutions. We find an infinite-dimensional family of static Skyrmions that are related to the axisymmetric Skyrmion by co-ordinate transformations thus discovering a new moduli space, and further infinite-dimensional families of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric breather-like supercompactons. We call the maps generating such moduli space "contour-preserving" maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present normal forms of elliptic automorphic Lie algebras with symmetry group $D_2$, the dihedral group of order 4, which appear prominently in the context of Landau-Lifshitz type of equations. The normal forms are established through the construction of certain intertwining maps, which are formulated in terms of theta functions. Furthermore, we realise the Wahlquist- Estabrook prolongation algebra of the Landau-Lifshitz equation in terms of an automorphic Lie algebra on a complex torus with one orbit of punctures, and show that it is isomorphic to an $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$-current algebra. Finally, we show that a Lie algebra introduced by Uglov and the well-known hidden symmetry algebra of Holod are isomorphic to an elliptic $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$-current algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study regular contact manifolds $(M,\eta)$ whose Reeb vector field is complete and prove that they are canonically principal bundles with the structure group $S^1$ or $\mathbb{R}$. For compact $M$, our proof is very short and elementary and covers the celebrated Boothby-Wang theorem, but we do not assume compactness from the very beginning. However, to prove our result in full generality we use some topological tools adapted to smooth fibrations. In the second part of the paper, we describe a natural concept of contact products of general contact manifolds as well as a product of principal contact manifolds, which exists if the periods of the Reeb vector fields are commensurate, and corresponds to the construction of products of prequantization bundles of symplectic manifolds.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible SPTs: an on-site realization of (1+1)d anomaly-free fusion category symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate (1+1)d symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with fusion category symmetries. We emphasize that the UV description of an anomaly-free fusion category symmetry must include the fiber functor, giving rise to a local symmetry action, a charge category and a trivial phase. We construct an ``onsite'' matrix-product-operator (MPO) version of the Hopf algebra symmetry operators in a lattice model with tensor-product Hilbert space. In particular, we propose a systematic framework for classifying and constructing SPTs with non-invertible symmetries. An SPT phase corresponds to a Q-system in the charge category, such that the Q-system becomes a matrix algebra when the symmetry is forgotten. As an example, we provide an explicit microscopic realization of all three $\mathsf{Rep}^\dagger(D_8)$ SPT phases, including a trivial phase, and further demonstrate the $S_3$-duality among these three SPT phases.</description>

      <title>A Model of Entropy Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key tenet of the Transactional Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics is the idea that photon absorption localizes the absorbing material system. In doing so, it measures the location of the absorber and hence reduces information entropy, which in turn needs to be balanced by appropriate entropy production, if there is a link between information entropy and thermodynamic entropy. Based on a critical analysis of the physics of information erasure, we clarify the link between information and thermodynamic entropy and develop a rigorous model of entropy production in photon absorption processes. Links to the intepretation of quantum probabilities and Maxwell's Demon are made.</description>

      <title>Local ultrametric approximation of graph distance based Laplacian diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The error estimation for eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a small positive symmetric perturbation on the spectrum of a graph Laplacian is related to Gau{\ss} hypergeometric functions. Based on this, a heuristic polynomial-time algorithm for finding an optimal locally ultrametric approximation of a graph-distance power Laplacian matrix via the Vietoris-Rips graph based on the graph distance function is proposed. In the end, the error in the solution to the graph Laplacian heat equation given by extension to a locally p-adic equation is estimated.</description>

      <title>Error Estimates and Higher Order Trotter Product Formulas in Jordan-Banach Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum computing, Trotter estimates are critical for enabling efficient simulation of quantum systems and quantum dynamics, help implement complex quantum algorithms, and provide a systematic way to control approximate errors. In this paper, we extend the analysis of Trotter-Suzuki approximations, including third and higher orders, to Jordan-Banach algebras. We solve an open problem in our earlier paper on the existence of second-order Trotter formula error estimation in Jordan-Banach algebras. To illustrate our work, we apply our formula to simulate Trotter-factorized spins, and show improvements in the approximations. Our approach demonstrates the adaptability of Trotter product formulas and estimates to non-associative settings, which offers new insights into the applications of Jordan algebra theory to operator dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Potts spin glass with additional ferromagnetic interaction parametrized by $t$. It has long been observed that the Potts color symmetry breaking for the spin glass order parameter is closely related to the ferromagnetic phase transition. To clarify this, we identify a single critical value $t_\mathrm{c}$, which marks the onset of both color symmetry breaking and the transition to ferromagnetism.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the direct and inverse spectral problems for the Schrodinger operator with two generalized Regge boundary conditions. For the direct problem, we give the properties of the spectrum, including the asymptotic distribution of the eigenvalues. For the inverse problems, we prove several uniqueness theorems, including the cases: even potential, two-spectra, as well as the general partial inverse problem.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-enforced minimal entanglement and correlation in quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between symmetry, entanglement and correlation is an interesting and important topic in quantum many-body physics. Within the framework of matrix product states, in this paper we study the minimal entanglement and correlation enforced by the $SO(3)$ spin rotation symmetry and lattice translation symmetry in a quantum spin-$J$ chain, with $J$ a positive integer. When neither symmetry is spontaneously broken, for a sufficiently long segment in a sufficiently large closed chain, we find that the minimal R\'enyi-$\alpha$ entropy compatible with these symmetries is $\min\{ -\frac{2}{\alpha-1}\ln(\frac{1}{2^\alpha}({1+\frac{1}{(2J+1)^{\alpha-1}}})), 2\ln(J+1) \}$, for any $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^+$. In an infinitely long open chain with such symmetries, for any $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^+$ the minimal R\'enyi-$\alpha$ entropy of half of the system is $\min\{ -\frac{1}{\alpha-1}\ln(\frac{1}{2^\alpha}({1+\frac{1}{(2J+1)^{\alpha-1}}})), \ln(J+1) \}$. When $\alpha\rightarrow 1$, these lower bounds give the symmetry-enforced minimal von Neumann entropies in these setups. Moreover, we show that no state in a quantum spin-$J$ chain with these symmetries can have a vanishing correlation length. Interestingly, the states with the minimal entanglement may not be a state with the minimal correlation length.</description>

      <title>Level crossing instabilities in inviscid isothermal compressible Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the linear stability of inviscid steady parallel flow of an ideal gas in a channel of finite width. Compressible isothermal two-dimensional monochromatic perturbations are considered. The eigenvalue problem governing density and velocity perturbations is a compressible version of Rayleigh's equation and involves two parameters: a flow Mach number $M$ and the perturbation wavenumber $k$. For an odd background velocity profile, there is a $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and growth rates $\gamma$ come in symmetrically placed 4-tuples in the complex eigenplane. Specializing to uniform background vorticity Couette flow, we find an infinite tower of noninflectional eigenmodes and derive stability theorems and bounds on growth rates. We show that eigenmodes are neutrally stable for small $k$ and small $M$ but that they otherwise display an infinite sequence of stability transitions with increasing $k$ or $M$. Using a search algorithm based on the Fredholm alternative, we find that the transitions are associated to level crossings between neighboring eigenmodes. Repeated level crossings result in windows of instability. For a given eigenmode, they are arranged in a zebra-like striped pattern on the $k$-$M$ plane. A canonical square-root power law form for $\gamma(k,M)$ in the vicinity of a stability transition is identified. In addition to the discrete spectrum, we find a continuous spectrum of eigenmodes that are always neutrally stable but fail to be smooth across critical layers.</description>

Abstract: The first step in investigating fractional difference maps, which do not have periodic points except fixed points, is to find asymptotically periodic points and bifurcation points and draw asymptotic bifurcation diagrams. Recently derived equations that allow calculations of asymptotically periodic and bifurcation points contain coefficients defined as slowly converging infinite sums. In this paper we derive analytic expressions for coefficients of the equations that allow calculations of asymptotically periodic and bifurcation points in fractional difference maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the tensor structure on the category of modules of the $N=1$ triplet vertex operator superalgebra $\mathcal{SW}(m)$ introduced by Adamovi\'{c} and Milas. Based on the theory of vertex tensor supercategories, we determine the structure of fusion products between the simple and projective $\mathcal{SW}(m)$-modules and show that the tensor supercategory on $\mathcal{SW}(m)$-mod is rigid. Technically, explicit solutions of a fourth-order Fuchsian differential equation are important to show the rigidity of $\mathcal{SW}(m)$-modules. We construct solutions of this Fuchsian differential equation using the theory of the Dotsenko-Fateev integrals developed by Sussman.</description>

Abstract: For rescaled additive functionals of the sine-process, upper bounds are obtained for their speed of convergence to the Gaussian distribution with respect to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric. Under scaling with coefficient $R$ the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance is bounded from above by $c/\log R$ for a smooth function and by $c/R$ for a function holomorphic in a horizontal strip.</description>

Abstract: We consider a periodic quantum graph in the form of a rectangular lattice with the $\delta$-coupling of strength $\gamma$ in the vertices perturbed by changing the latter at an infinite straight array of vertices to a $\widetilde\gamma\ne\gamma$. We analyze the band spectrum of the system and show that it remains preserved as a set provided $\widetilde\gamma&gt;\gamma&gt;0$ while for all the other combinations additional band appear in some or all gaps of the unperturbed system. We also prove that for a randomly chosen positive energy, the probability of existence of a state exponentially localized in the vicinity of the perturbation equals $\frac12$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the spiralling branes technique introduced in arXiv:2312.16990 to many-body integrable systems. We start by giving a new R-matrix description of the trigonometric Ruijsenaars-Schneider (RS) Hamiltonians and eigenfunctions using the intertwiners of quantum toroidal algebra. We then consider elliptic deformations of the RS system, elucidate how Shiraishi functions appear naturally in the process and relate them to certain special infinite system of intertwiners of the algebra. We further show that there are two distinguished elliptic deformations, one of which leads to the conventional elliptic RS Hamiltonians, while the other produces trigonometric Koroteev-Shakirov Hamiltonians. Along the way we prove the fully noncommutative version of the "noncommutative Jacobi identities" for affine qq-characters recently introduced by Grekov and Nekrasov.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum mechanical systems of spin chain type, with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and $\mathcal{N}=2$ or $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetry, described in $\mathcal{N}=2$ superspace in terms of nonlinear chiral multiplets. We prove that they are natural truncations of 1D sigma models, whose target spaces are $\mathsf{SU}(n)$ (co)adjoint orbits. As a first application, we compute the Witten indices of these finite-dimensional models showing that they reproduce the Dolbeault and de Rham indices of the target space. The problem of finding the exact spectra of generalized Laplace operators on such orbits is shown to be equivalent to the diagonalization of spin chain Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>The 3BF theory as a TQFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the path integral quantization of the topological 3BF theory, whose gauge symmetry is described by a 3-group. This theory is relevant for the quantization of general relativity coupled to Standard Model of elementary particles. We explicitly construct a state sum corresponding to the discretized path integral of a 3BF action. Being a topological invariant of 4-dimensional manifolds with boundary, this state sum gives rise to a topological quantum field theory (TQFT), realized as a functor between the category of cobordisms and the category of Hilbert spaces. After an introduction to appropriate category theory concepts and the construction of the state sum, we provide an explicit proof that it satisfies all Atiyah's axioms, and thus represents a genuine TQFT. The formulation of this TQFT represents a major step in the spinfoam quantization programme for a realistic theory of quantum gravity with matter.</description>

      <title>Ordinary limits of the hyperbolic hypergeometric integral identities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computation of the partition function of supersymmetric gauge theories on compact manifolds can be reduced to matrix integrals by using the supersymmetric localization technique. Such matrix integrals in the case of three-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories on lens space can be expressed in terms of hyperbolic hypergeometric integrals. By studying partition functions of supersymmetric dual theories, one can obtain new complicated identities for this type of special function. We derive new ordinary hypergeometric identities from the reduction of certain hyperbolic hypergeometric integral identities obtained via supersymmetric infrared dualities.</description>

      <title>A polynomial affine model of gravity: after ten years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The polynomial affine model of gravity was proposed as an alternative to metric and metric-affine gravitational models. What at the beginning was thought as a source of unpredictability, the presence of many terms in the action, turned out to be a milestone, since it contains all possible combinations of the fields compatible with the covariance under diffeomorphisms. Here, we present a review of the advances in the analysis of the model after ten years of its proposal, and sketch the guideline of our future perspectives.</description>

      <title>From Painlev\'e equations to ${\cal N}=2$ susy gauge theories: prolegomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the linear problems in $z,t$ (time) associated to the Painlev\'e III$_3$ and III$_1$ equations when the Painlev\'e solution $q(t)$ approaches a pole or a zero. In this limit the problem in $z$ for the Painlev\'e III$_3$ reduces to the modified Mathieu equation, while that for the Painlev\'e III$_1$ to the Doubly Confluent Heun Equation. These equations appear as Nekrasov-Shatashvili quantisations/deformations of Seiberg-Witten differentials for $SU(2)$ ${\cal N}=2$ super Yang-Mills gauge theory with number of flavours $N_f=0$ and $N_f=2$, respectively. These results allow us to conjecture that this link holds for any Painlev\'e equation relating each of them to a different matter theory, which is actually the same as in the well-established Painlev\'e gauge correspondence, but {\it with another deformation ($\Omega$-background)}. An explicit expression for the dual gauge period (and then prepotential) is also found. As a by-product, a new solution to the connexion problem is illustrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the nonlinear Dirac equation with scalar self-interaction (the Soler model) in three spatial dimensions, we consider the linearization at solitary wave solutions and find the invariant spaces which correspond to different spherical harmonics, thus achieving the radial reduction of the spectral stability analysis. We apply the same technique to the bi-frequency solitary waves (which are generically present in the Soler model) and show that they can also possess linear stability properties similar to those of one-frequency solitary waves.</description>

      <title>Causal evolution of probability measures and continuity equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.02552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the notion of a causal time-evolution of a conserved nonlocal physical quantity in a globally hyperbolic spacetime $\mathcal{M}$. The role of the `global time' is played by a chosen Cauchy temporal function $\mathcal{T}$, whereas the instantaneous configurations of the nonlocal quantity are modeled by probability measures $\mu_t$ supported on the corresponding time slices $\mathcal{T}^{-1}(t)$. We show that the causality of such an evolution can be expressed in three equivalent ways: (i) via the causal precedence relation $\preceq$ extended to probability measures, (ii) with the help of a probability measure $\sigma$ on the space of future-directed continuous causal curves endowed with the compact-open topology and (iii) through a causal vector field $X$ of $L^\infty_{\textrm{loc}}$-regularity, with which the map $t \mapsto \mu_t$ satisfies the continuity equation in the distributional sense. In the course of the proof we find that the compact-open topology is sensitive to the differential properties of the causal curves, being equal to the topology induced from a suitable $H^1_{\textrm{loc}}$-Sobolev space. This enables us to construct $X$ as a vector field in a sense `tangent' to $\sigma$. In addition, we discuss the general covariance of descriptions (i)-(iii), unraveling the geometrical, observer-independent notions behind them.</description>

Abstract: The term Bethe Ansatz stands for a multitude of methods in the theory of integrable models in statistical mechanics and quantum field theory that were designed to study the spectra, the thermodynamic properties and the correlation functions of these models non-perturbatively. This essay attempts to a give a brief overview of some of these methods and their development, mostly based on the example of the Heisenberg model and the corresponding six-vertex model.</description>

Abstract: We study the asymmetric simple exclusion process with non-diagonal boundary terms under a specific constraint. A symmetric chiral basis is constructed and a special string solution of the Bethe ansatz equations corresponding to the steady state is presented. Using the coordinate Bethe ansatz method, we derive a concise expression for the steady state. The current and density profile in the steady state are also studied.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions on 1d Long-Range Ising Models with Decaying Fields: A Direct Proof via Contours</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following seminal work by J. Fr\"ohlich and T. Spencer on the critical exponent $\alpha=2$, we give a proof via contours of phase transition in the one-dimensional long-range ferromagnetic Ising model in the entire region of decay, where phase transition is known to occur, i.e., polynomial decay $\alpha \in (1,2]$. No assumptions that the nearest-neighbor interaction $J(1)$ is large are made. The robustness of the method also yields a proof of phase transition in the presence of a nonsummable external field that decays sufficiently fast.</description>

      <title>Impossibility of Local State Transformation via Hypercontractivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:1307.2747v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local state transformation is the problem of transforming an arbitrary number of copies of a bipartite resource state to a bipartite target state under local operations. That is, given two bipartite states, is it possible to transform an arbitrary number of copies of one of them to one copy of the other state under local operations only? This problem is a hard one in general since we assume that the number of copies of the resource state is arbitrarily large. In this paper we prove some bounds on this problem using the hypercontractivity properties of some super-operators corresponding to bipartite states. We measure hypercontractivity in terms of both the usual super-operator norms as well as completely bounded norms.</description>

      <title>Duality via convolution of W-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.01843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feigin-Frenkel duality is the isomorphism between the principal $\mathcal{W}$-algebras of a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and its Langlands dual Lie algebra ${}^L\mathfrak{g}$. A generalization of this duality to a larger family of $\mathcal{W}$-algebras called hook-type was recently conjectured by Gaiotto and Rap\v{c}\'ak and proved by the first two authors. It says that the affine cosets of two different hook-type $\mathcal{W}$-algebras are isomorphic. A natural question is whether the duality between affine cosets can be enhanced to a duality between the full $\mathcal{W}$-algebras. There is a convolution operation that maps a hook-type $\mathcal{W}$-algebra $\mathcal{W}$ to a certain relative semi-infinite cohomology of $\mathcal{W}$ tensored with a suitable kernel VOA. The first two authors conjectured previously that this cohomology is isomorphic to the Feigin-Frenkel dual hook-type $\mathcal{W}$-algebra. Our main result is a proof of this conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.05533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The backward heat flow on the real line started from the initial condition $z^n$ results in the classical $n$-th Hermite polynomial whose zeroes are distributed according to the Wigner semicircle law in the large $n$ limit. Similarly, the backward heat flow with the periodic initial condition $(\sin \frac \theta 2)^n$ leads to trigonometric or unitary analogues of the Hermite polynomials. These polynomials are closely related to the partition function of the Curie--Weiss model and appeared in the work of Mirabelli on finite free probability. We relate the $n$-th unitary Hermite polynomial to the expected characteristic polynomial of a unitary random matrix obtained by running a Brownian motion on the unitary group $U(n)$. We identify the global distribution of zeroes of the unitary Hermite polynomials as the free unitary normal distribution. We also compute the asymptotics of these polynomials or, equivalently, the free energy of the Curie--Weiss model in a complex external field. We identify the global distribution of the Lee--Yang zeroes of this model. Finally, we show that the backward heat flow applied to a high-degree real-rooted polynomial (respectively, trigonometric polynomial) induces, on the level of the asymptotic distribution of its roots, a free Brownian motion (respectively, free unitary Brownian motion).</description>

      <title>Singular Riemannian foliations and $\mathcal{I}$-Poisson manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We recall the notion of a singular foliation (SF) on a manifold $M$, viewed as an appropriate submodule of $\mathfrak{X}(M)$, and adapt it to the presence of a Riemannian metric $g$, yielding a module version of a singular Riemannian foliation (SRF). Following Garmendia-Zambon on Hausdorff Morita equivalence of SFs, we define the Morita equivalence of SRFs (both in the module sense as well as in the more traditional geometric one of Molino) and show that the leaf spaces of Morita equivalent SRFs are isomrophic as pseudo-metric spaces.
  In a second part, we introduce the category of $\mathcal{I}$-Poisson manifolds. Its objects and morphisms generalize Poisson manifolds and morphisms in the presence of appropriate ideals $\mathcal{I}$ of the smooth functions on the manifold such that two conditions are satisfied: $(i)$ The category of Poisson manifolds becomes a full subcategory when choosing $\mathcal{I}=0$ and $(ii)$ there is a reduction functor from this new category to the category of Poisson algebras, which generalizes coistropic reduction to the singular setting.
  Every SF on $M$ gives rise to an $\mathcal{I}$-Poisson manifold on $T^*M$ and $g$ enhances this to an SRF if and only if the induced Hamiltonian lies in the normalizer of $\mathcal{I}$. This perspective provides, on the one hand, a simple proof of the fact that every module SRF is a geometric SRF and, on the other hand, a construction of an algebraic invariant of singular foliations: Hausdorff Morita equivalent SFs have isomorphic reduced Poisson algebras.</description>

      <title>Designs from Local Random Quantum Circuits with SU(d) Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation of $k$-designs (pseudorandom distributions that emulate the Haar measure up to $k$ moments) with local quantum circuit ensembles is a problem of fundamental importance in quantum information and physics. Despite the extensive understanding of this problem for ordinary random circuits, the crucial situations where symmetries or conservation laws are in play are known to pose fundamental challenges and remain little understood. We construct, for the first time, explicit local unitary ensembles that can achieve high-order unitary $k$-designs under transversal continuous symmetry, in the particularly important SU$(d)$ case. Specifically, we define the Convolutional Quantum Alternating group (CQA) generated by 4-local SU$(d)$-symmetric Hamiltonians as well as associated 4-local SU$(d)$-symmetric random unitary circuit ensembles, and prove that they form and converge to SU$(d)$-symmetric $k$-designs, respectively, for all $k &lt; n(n-3)/2$ with $n$ being the number of qudits. A key technique that we employ to obtain the results is the Okounkov--Vershik approach to $S_n$ representation theory. To study the convergence time of the CQA ensemble, we develop a numerical method using the Young orthogonal form and $S_n$ branching rule. We provide strong evidence for a subconstant spectral gap and certain convergence time scales of various important circuit architectures, which contrast with the symmetry-free case. We also provide comprehensive explanations of the difficulties and limitations in rigorously analyzing the convergence time using methods that have been effective for cases without symmetries, including Knabe's local gap threshold and Nachtergaele's martingale methods. This suggests that a novel approach is likely necessary for understanding the convergence time of SU$(d)$-symmetric local random circuits.</description>

      <title>Reformulating polarized radiative transfer for astrophysical applications. (I) A formalism allowing non-local Magnus solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00252</link>

Abstract: The solar atmosphere is diagnosed by solving the polarized radiative transfer problem for plasmas in Non-Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium (NLTE). A key challenge in multidimensional NLTE diagnosis is to integrate the radiative transfer equation (RTE) efficiently, but current methods are local, limited to constant propagation matrices. The formalism presented in this paper lays the foundations to achieve an efficient non-local integration of the RTE based on the Magnus expansion. Our approach starts formulating the problem in terms of rotations represented in the Lorentz-Poincare group (Stokes formalism) and motivating the use of the Magnus expansion. Then, we combine a highly detailed algebraic characterization of the propagation matrix with Magnus to reformulate the homogenous solution to the RTE. Thus, we obtain a compact analytical evolution operator supporting arbitrary variations of the propagation matrix to first and second order in the Magnus expansion and showing the way to higher orders. Finally, we reformulate the inhomogeneous part to make it solvable with the Magnus expansion too, which gives rise to an interesting new object: the inhomogeneous evolution operator. This provides the first consistent and general formal solution of the RTE that furthermore is non-local, efficient, and accurate by design, with other peculiarity: it separates the integration part from the algebraic formal solution. Our framework is verified analytically and with a computational implementation that leads to a new family of numerical radiative transfer methods and suggests several applications, e.g. accelerating NLTE calculations with non-local radiative transfer. With cosmetic changes, our results apply to other universal physical problems sharing the Lorentz-Poincare algebra of the RTE and special relativity.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent conserved operators for autonomous systems and quantization of resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two systems for a charged particle are studied, the first one when it is under the effect of a constant electric field, and the second one when it is under the effect of a constant electromagnetic field. For both systems, it is possible to find time-dependent conserved operators that can be used to derive time-dependent wave functions to the complete Schr\"odinger equation, such that the time variable is not separable from the space coordinates. At the same time, these conserved operators are used to build up a unitary operators, which define the symmetries of the systems. Then, it is shown that the invariance of the wave function under the action of these unitary operators leads to the quantization of resistance as integer multiples of the Klitzing's constant.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic properties of special function solutions of Painlev\'e III equation for fixed parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04852v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the small and large $x$ asymptotics of the special function solutions of Painlev\'e-III equation in the complex plane. We use the representation in terms of Toeplitz determinants of Bessel functions obtained in arXiv:nlin/0302026. Toeplitz determinants are rewritten as multiple contour integrals using Andr\`eief's identity. The small and large $x$ asymptotics are obtained using elementary asymptotic methods applied to the multiple contour integral. The asymptotics is extended to the whole complex plane using analytic continuation formulas for Bessel functions. The claimed result has not appeared in the literature before. We note that Toeplitz determinant representation is useful for numerical computations of corresponding solutions of the Painlev\'e-III equation.</description>

      <title>Higher-order localization landscape theory of Anderson localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a Hamiltonian ${\hat H}$ containing a position-dependent (disordered) potential, we introduce a sequence of landscape functions $u_n(\vec{r})$ obeying ${\hat H} u_n(\vec{r}) = u_{n-1}(\vec{r})$ with $u_0(\vec{r}) = 1$. For $n \to \infty$, $1/v_n(\vec{r}) = u_{n-1}(\vec{r})/u_{n}(\vec{r})$ converges to the lowest eigenenergy $E_1$ of ${\hat H}$ whereas $u_{\infty}(\vec{r})$ yields the corresponding wave function $\psi_1(\vec{r})$. For large but finite $n$, $v_n(\vec{r})$ can be approximated by a piecewise constant function $v_n(\vec{r}) \simeq v_n^{(m)}$ for $\vec{r} \in \Omega_m$ and yields progressively improving estimations of eigenenergies $E_m = 1/v_n^{(m)}$ of locally fundamental eigenstates $\psi_m(\vec{r}) \propto u_{n}(\vec{r})$ in spatial domains $\Omega_m$. These general results are illustrated by a number of examples in one dimension: box potential, sequence of randomly placed infinite potential barriers, smooth and spatially uncorrelated random potentials, quasiperiodic potential, as well as for the uncorrelated random potential in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Liouvillians of squeeze-driven parametric oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the symmetries of the Liouville superoperator of one dimensional parametric oscillators, especially the so-called squeeze-driven Kerr oscillator, and discover a remarkable quasi-spin symmetry $su(2)$ at integer values of the ratio $\eta =\omega /K$ of the detuning parameter $\omega$ to the Kerr coefficient $K$, which reflects the symmetry previously found for the Hamiltonian operator. We find that the Liouvillian of an $su(2)$ representation $\left\vert j,m_{j}\right\rangle$ has a characteristic double-ellipsoidal structure, and calculate the relaxation time $T_{X}$ for this structure. We then study the phase transitions of the Liouvillian which occur as a function of the parameters $\xi =\varepsilon _{2}/K$ and $\eta=\omega /K$. Finally, we study the temperature dependence of the spectrum of eigenvalues of the Liouvillian. Our findings may have applications in the generation and stabilization of states of interest in quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Massive bigravity as a presymplectic BV-AKSZ sigma-model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a presymplectic BV-AKSZ sigma model encoding the ghost-free massive bigravity theory action as well as its Batalin-Vilkovisky extension in terms of the finite-dimensional graded geometry of the target space. A characteristic feature of the construction is that the target space is realised as a quasi-regular submanifold of a linear graded manifold which, in turn, is a direct product of two copies of the shifted Poincar\'e or (anti-)de Sitter Lie algebra. This graded manifold comes equipped with a natural presymplectcic structure and the compatible pre-$Q$ structure which is a sum of the Chevalley-Eilenberg differentials of each copy of the Lie algebra and the interaction term. The constraints determining the submanifold are the supergeometrical realisation of the known Deser-van Nieuwenhuizen condition and its descendant.</description>

      <title>Notes on equivalent formulations of Hamiltonian dynamics on multicotangent bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the equivalence of five different conditions on a classical field $\psi$ with values in a restricted multicotangent bundle to be a solution of the field equations, notably in terms of the Hamilton-Volterra equations, the principle of least action and several conditions based on the contraction of the multi-vector tangent to $\psi$ with canonical differential forms. Most prominently, we have equivalence to the "dynamical Hamilton-de Donder-Weyl equation", that can be vastly generalized to define Hamiltonian dynamics on multisymplectic manifolds, defined for sources of different dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an operadic interpretation of the known result of L.Shapiro and A.B.Stephens that characterizes percolating permutation matrices. A relation of ideals and suboperads of the non-symmetric operad of permutations to percolative properties of sets in the 2-neighbor percolation process is discussed. On a related note, we discuss a certain presentation of the operad of permutations.</description>

      <title>On some states minimizing uncertainty relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing Heisenberg-Robertson (HR) and Schr\"{o}dinger uncertainty relations we found, that there can exist large set of states of the quantum system under considerations, for which the lower bound of the product of the standard deviations of a pair of non-commuting observables, $A$ and $B$, is zero. These states are not eigenstates of either the observable $A$ or $B$. We have also shown that the so-called "sum uncertainty relations" also do not provide any information about lower bounds on the standard deviations calculated for these states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the Newtonian mechanics, in this article, we present a heuristic derivation of the Friedmann equations, providing an intuitive foundation for these fundamental relations in cosmology. Additionally, using the first law of thermodynamics and Euler's equation, we derive a set of equations that, at linear order, coincide with those obtained from the conservation of the stress-energy tensor in General Relativity. This approach not only highlights the consistency between Newtonian and relativistic frameworks in certain limits but also serves as a pedagogical bridge, offering insights into the physical principles underlying the dynamics of the universe.</description>

      <title>High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-order tensors. After decades of research, we recently achieve an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ \citep{bonvicini2024irreducible} with factorial time/space complexity. This work, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contraction with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set \citep{pearce2023brauer}, through this path matrices technique. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available in https://github.com/ShihaoShao-GH/ICT-decomposition-and-equivariant-bases where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s, respectively.</description>

      <title>The $S=\frac{1}{2}$ XY and XYZ models on the two or higher dimensional hypercubic lattice do not possess nontrivial local conserved quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $S=\frac{1}{2}$ quantum spin system on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ with uniform nearest-neighbor interaction of the XY or XYZ type and arbitrary uniform magnetic field. By extending the method recently developed for quantum spin chains, we prove that the model possesses no local conserved quantities except for the trivial ones, such as the Hamiltonian. This result strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. We note that our result applies to the XX model without a magnetic field, which is one of the easiest solvable models in one dimension.</description>
