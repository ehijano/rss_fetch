      <title>Redundancy analysis using lcm-filtrations: networks, system signature and sensitivity evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the lcm-filtration and stepwise filtration, comparing their performance across various scenarios in terms of computational complexity, efficiency, and redundancy. The lcm-filtration often involves identical steps or ideals, leading to unnecessary computations. To address this, we analyse how stepwise filtration can effectively compute only the non-identical steps, offering a more efficient approach. We compare these filtrations in applications to networks, system signatures, and sensitivity analysis.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of polytopes with edge length and coplanarity constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a novel setting for polytope rigidity, where a flex must preserve edge lengths and the planarity of faces, but is allowed to change the shapes of faces. For instance, the regular cube is flexible in this notion. We present techniques for constructing flexible polytopes and find that flexibility seems to be an exceptional property. Based on this observation, we introduce a notion of generic realizations for polytopes and conjecture that convex polytopes are generically rigid in dimension $d\geq 3$. We prove this conjecture in dimension $d=3$. Motivated by our findings we also pose several questions that are intended to inspire future research into this notion of polytope rigidity.</description>

      <title>Cluster deletion and clique partitioning in graphs with bounded clique number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cluster Deletion problem takes a graph $G$ as input and asks for a minimum size set of edges $X$ such that $G-X$ is the disjoint union of complete graphs. An equivalent formulation is the Clique Partition problem, which asks to find a partition of $V(G)$ into cliques such that the total number of edges is maximized.
  We begin by giving a much simpler proof of a theorem of Gao, Hare, and Nastos that Cluster Deletion is efficiently solvable on the class of cographs. We then investigate Cluster Deletion and Clique Partition on permutation graphs, which are a superclass of cographs. Our findings suggest that Cluster Deletion may be NP-hard on permutation graphs.
  Finally, we prove that for graphs with clique number at most $c$, there is a $\frac{2\binom{c}{2}}{\binom{c}{2}+1}$-approximation algorithm for Clique Partition. This is the first polynomial time algorithm which achieves an approximation ratio better than 2 for graphs with bounded clique number. More generally, our algorithm runs in polynomial time on any graph class for which Maximum Clique can be computed in polynomial time. We also provide a class of examples which shows that our approximation ratio is best possible.</description>

      <title>The tape reconfiguration problem and its consequences for dominating set reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dominating set of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a set of vertices $D \subseteq V$ whose closed neighborhood is $V$, i.e., $N[D]=V$. We view a dominating set as a collection of tokens placed on the vertices of $D$. In the token sliding variant of the Dominating Set Reconfiguration problem (TS-DSR), we seek to transform a source dominating set into a target dominating set in $G$ by sliding tokens along edges, and while maintaining a dominating set all along the transformation.
  TS-DSR is known to be PSPACE-complete even restricted to graphs of pathwidth $w$, for some non-explicit constant $w$ and to be XL-complete parameterized by the size $k$ of the solution. The first contribution of this article consists in using a novel approach to provide the first explicit constant for which the TS-DSR problem is PSPACE-complete, a question that was left open in the literature.
  From a parameterized complexity perspective, the token jumping variant of DSR, i.e., where tokens can jump to arbitrary vertices, is known to be FPT when parameterized by the size of the dominating sets on nowhere dense classes of graphs. But, in contrast, no non-trivial result was known about TS-DSR. We prove that DSR is actually much harder in the sliding model since it is XL-complete when restricted to bounded pathwidth graphs and even when parameterized by $k$ plus the feedback vertex set number of the graph. This gives, for the first time, a difference of behavior between the complexity under token sliding and token jumping for some problem on graphs of bounded treewidth. All our results are obtained using a brand new method, based on the hardness of the so-called Tape Reconfiguration problem, a problem we believe to be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Going deep and going wide: Counting logic and homomorphism indistinguishability over graphs of bounded treedepth and treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the expressive power of first-order logic with counting quantifiers, especially the k-variable and quantifier-rank-q fragment C^k_q, using homomorphism indistinguishability. Recently, Dawar, Jakl, and Reggio~(2021) proved that two graphs satisfy the same C^k_q-sentences if and only if they are homomorphism indistinguishable over the class T^k_q of graphs admitting a k-pebble forest cover of depth q. After reproving this result using elementary means, we provide a graph-theoretic analysis of the graph class T^k_q. This allows us to separate T^k_q from the intersection TW_{k-1} \cap TD_q, provided that q is sufficiently larger than k. Here TW_{k-1} is the class of all graphs of treewidth at most k-1 and TD_q is the class of all graphs of treedepth at most q.
  We are able to lift this separation to a (semantic) separation of the respective homomorphism indistinguishability relations \equiv_{T^k_q} and \equiv_{TW_{k-1} \cap TD_q}. We do this by showing that the classes TD_q and T^k_q are homomorphism distinguishing closed, as conjectured by Roberson~(2022).
  In order to prove Roberson's conjecture for T^k_q we characterise T^k_q in terms of a monotone Cops-and-Robber game. The crux is to prove that if Cop has a winning strategy then Cop also has a winning strategy that is monotone. To that end, we show how to transform Cops' winning strategy into a pree-tree-decomposition, which is inspired by decompositions of matroids, and then applying an intricate breadth-first `cleaning up' procedure along the pree-tree-decomposition (which may temporarily lose the property of representing a strategy), in order to achieve monotonicity while controlling the number of rounds simultaneously across all branches of the decomposition via a vertex exchange argument.</description>

      <title>How to Learn a Star: Binary Classification with Starshaped Polyhedral Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider binary classification restricted to a class of continuous piecewise linear functions whose decision boundaries are (possibly nonconvex) starshaped polyhedral sets, supported on a fixed polyhedral simplicial fan. We investigate the expressivity of these function classes and describe the combinatorial and geometric structure of the loss landscape, most prominently the sublevel sets, for two loss-functions: the 0/1-loss (discrete loss) and an exponential loss function. In particular, we give explicit bounds on the VC dimension of this model, and concretely describe the sublevel sets of the discrete loss as chambers in a hyperplane arrangement. For the exponential loss, we give sufficient conditions for the optimum to be unique, and describe the geometry of the optimum when varying the rate parameter of the underlying exponential probability distribution.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Differentiable Optimization For The Maximum Independent Set Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19532v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial Optimization (CO) addresses many important problems, including the challenging Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. Alongside exact and heuristic solvers, differentiable approaches have emerged, often using continuous relaxations of ReLU-based or quadratic objectives. Noting that an MIS in a graph is a Maximum Clique (MC) in its complement, we propose a new quadratic formulation for MIS by incorporating an MC term, improving convergence and exploration. We show that every maximal independent set corresponds to a local minimizer, derive conditions with respect to the MIS size, and characterize stationary points. To tackle the non-convexity of the objective, we propose optimizing several initializations in parallel using momentum-based gradient descent, complemented by an efficient MIS checking criterion derived from our theory. We dub our method as **p**arallelized **C**lique-Informed **Q**uadratic **O**ptimization for MIS (**pCQO-MIS**). Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to exact, heuristic, sampling, and data-centric approaches. Notably, our method avoids the out-of-distribution tuning and reliance on (un)labeled data required by data-centric methods, while achieving superior MIS sizes and competitive runtime relative to their inference time. Additionally, a key advantage of pCQO-MIS is that, unlike exact and heuristic solvers, the runtime scales only with the number of nodes in the graph, not the number of edges. Our code is available at the GitHub repository \href{https://github.com/ledenmat/pCQO-mis-benchmark/tree/refactor}{{{pCQO-MIS}}}</description>

      <title>Linear Recurrence Sequence Automata and the Addition of Abstract Numeration Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09868v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Abstract numeration systems encode natural numbers using radix ordered words of an infinite regular language and linear recurrence sequences play a key role in their valuation. Sequence automata, which are deterministic finite automata with an additional linear recurrence sequence on each transition, are introduced to compute various $\mathbb{Z}$-rational non commutative formal series in abstract numeration systems. Under certain Pisot conditions on the recurrence sequences, the support of these series is regular. This property can be leveraged to derive various synchronized relations including a deterministic finite automaton that computes the addition relation of various Dumont-Thomas numeration systems and deterministic finite automata converting between various numeration systems. A practical implementation for Walnut is provided.</description>
