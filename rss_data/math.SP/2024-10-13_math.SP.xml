      <title>Computing Generalized Eigenfunctions in Rigged Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple, general, and convergent scheme to compute generalized eigenfunctions of self-adjoint operators with continuous spectra on rigged Hilbert spaces. Our approach does not require prior knowledge about the eigenfunctions, such as asymptotics or other analytic properties. Instead, we carefully sample the range of the resolvent operator to construct smooth and accurate wave packet approximations to generalized eigenfunctions. We prove high-order convergence in key topologies, including weak-star convergence for distributional eigenfunctions, uniform convergence on compact sets for locally smooth generalized eigenfunctions, and convergence in seminorms for separable Frechet spaces, covering the majority of physical scenarios. The method's performance is illustrated with applications to both differential and integral operators, culminating in the computation of spectral measures and generalized eigenfunctions for an operator associated with Poincare's internal waves problem. These computations corroborate experimental results and highlight the method's utility for a broad range of spectral problems in physics.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Steklov problem on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map encodes the voltage-to-current measurements under the influence of a magnetic field. In the case of surfaces, we provide precise spectral asymptotics expansion (up to arbitrary polynomial power) for the eigenvalues of this map. Moreover, we consider the inverse spectral problem and from the expansion we show that the spectrum of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, in favourable situations, uniquely determines the number and the length of boundary components, the parallel transport and the magnetic flux along boundary components. In general, we show that the situation complicates compared to the case when there is no magnetic field. For instance, there are plenty of examples where the expansion does $\textit{not}$ detect the number of boundary components, and this phenomenon is thoroughly studied in the paper.</description>

      <title>Koopman correlations underlie linear response and causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inference of causal relationships among observed variables is a pivotal, longstanding problem in the scientific community. An intuitive method for quantifying these causal links involves examining the response of one variable to perturbations in another. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem elegantly connects this response to the correlation functions of the unperturbed system, thereby bridging the concepts of causality and correlation. However, this relationship becomes intricate in nonlinear systems, where knowledge of the invariant measure is required but elusive, especially in high-dimensional spaces. In this study, we establish a novel link between the Koopman operator of nonlinear stochastic systems and the response function. This connection provides an alternative method for computing the response function using generalized correlation functions, even when the invariant measure is unknown. We validate our theoretical framework by applying it to a nonlinear high-dimensional system amenable to exact solutions, demonstrating convergence and consistency with established results. Finally, we discuss a significant interplay between the resulting causal network and the relevant time scales of the system.</description>

      <title>Unique continuation principles for finite-element discretizations of the Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unique continuation principles are fundamental properties of elliptic partial differential equations, giving conditions that guarantee that the solution to an elliptic equation must be uniformly zero. Since finite-element discretizations are a natural tool to help gain understanding into elliptic equations, it is natural to ask if such principles also hold at the discrete level. In this work, we prove a version of the unique continuation principle for piecewise-linear and -bilinear finite-element discretizations of the Laplacian eigenvalue problem on polygonal domains in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Namely, we show that any solution to the discretized equation $-\Delta u = \lambda u$ with vanishing Dirichlet and Neumann traces must be identically zero under certain geometric and topological assumptions on the resulting triangulation. We also provide a counterexample, showing that a nonzero \emph{inner solution} exists when the topological assumptions are not satisfied. Finally, we give an application to an eigenvalue interlacing problem, where the space of inner solutions makes an explicit appearance.</description>

      <title>On the $p$-torsional rigidity of combinatorial graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $p$-\emph{torsion function} and the corresponding $p$-\emph{torsional rigidity} associated with $p$-Laplacians and, more generally, $p$-Schr\"odinger operators, for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, on possibly infinite combinatorial graphs. We present sufficient criteria for the existence of a summable $p$-torsion function and we derive several upper and lower bounds for the $p$-torsional rigidity. Our methods are mostly based on novel surgery principles. As an application, we also find some new estimates on the bottom of the spectrum of the $p$-Laplacian with Dirichlet conditions, thus complementing some results recently obtained in: Jos\'e M. Maz\'on, Julian Toledo, Torsional rigidity in random walk spaces, in a more general setting. Finally, we prove a Kohler-Jobin inequality for combinatorial graphs (for $p=2$): to the best of our knowledge, graphs thus become the third ambient where a Kohler-Jobin inequality is known to hold.</description>

      <title>The hot spots conjecture for some non-convex polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an elementary new proof of the hot spots conjecture for L-shaped domains. This result, in addition to a new eigenvalue inequality, allows us to locate the hot spots in Swiss cross translation surfaces. We then prove, in several cases, that first mixed Dirichlet-Neumann eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on L-shaped domains also have no interior critical points. As a combination of these results, we prove the hot spots conjecture for five classes of domains tiled by L-shaped domains, including a class of non-simply connected domains. An interesting feature of the proofs is that we make positive use of the lack of regularity of eigenfunctions on non-convex polygons.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between non-commutative harmonic oscillators and two-photon quantum Rabi models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the non-commutative harmonic oscillator on $L^2(\mathbb{R})\otimes\mathbb{C}^2$ introduced by Parmeggiani and Wakayama is equivalent to the two-photon quantum Rabi model, and they are also equivalent to a holomorphic differential equation on the unit disk. The confluence process of this differential equation and the relation with the one-photon quantum Rabi model are also discussed.</description>
