      <title>Enhancing Cross-Modality Synthesis: Subvolume Merging for MRI-to-CT Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing more precise tissue attenuation information, synthetic computed tomography (sCT) generated from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contributes to improved radiation therapy treatment planning. In our study, we employ the advanced SwinUNETR framework for synthesizing CT from MRI images. Additionally, we introduce a three-dimensional subvolume merging technique in the prediction process. By selecting an optimal overlap percentage for adjacent subvolumes, stitching artifacts are effectively mitigated, leading to a decrease in the mean absolute error (MAE) between sCT and the labels from 52.65 HU to 47.75 HU. Furthermore, implementing a weight function with a gamma value of 0.9 results in the lowest MAE within the same overlap area. By setting the overlap percentage between 50% and 70%, we achieve a balance between image quality and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Pioneering Precision in Lumbar Spine MRI Segmentation with Advanced Deep Learning and Data Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an advanced approach to lumbar spine segmentation using deep learning techniques, focusing on addressing key challenges such as class imbalance and data preprocessing. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of patients with low back pain are meticulously preprocessed to accurately represent three critical classes: vertebrae, spinal canal, and intervertebral discs (IVDs). By rectifying class inconsistencies in the data preprocessing stage, the fidelity of the training data is ensured. The modified U-Net model incorporates innovative architectural enhancements, including an upsample block with leaky Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) and Glorot uniform initializer, to mitigate common issues such as the dying ReLU problem and improve stability during training. Introducing a custom combined loss function effectively tackles class imbalance, significantly improving segmentation accuracy. Evaluation using a comprehensive suite of metrics showcases the superior performance of this approach, outperforming existing methods and advancing the current techniques in lumbar spine segmentation. These findings hold significant advancements for enhanced lumbar spine MRI and segmentation diagnostic accuracy.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Tumors by Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-aided tumor detection has shown great potential in enhancing the interpretation of over 80 million CT scans performed annually in the United States. However, challenges arise due to the rarity of CT scans with tumors, especially early-stage tumors. Developing AI with real tumor data faces issues of scarcity, annotation difficulty, and low prevalence. Tumor synthesis addresses these challenges by generating numerous tumor examples in medical images, aiding AI training for tumor detection and segmentation. Successful synthesis requires realistic and generalizable synthetic tumors across various organs. This chapter reviews AI development on real and synthetic data and summarizes two key trends in synthetic data for cancer imaging research: modeling-based and learning-based approaches. Modeling-based methods, like Pixel2Cancer, simulate tumor development over time using generic rules, while learning-based methods, like DiffTumor, learn from a few annotated examples in one organ to generate synthetic tumors in others. Reader studies with expert radiologists show that synthetic tumors can be convincingly realistic. We also present case studies in the liver, pancreas, and kidneys reveal that AI trained on synthetic tumors can achieve performance comparable to, or better than, AI only trained on real data. Tumor synthesis holds significant promise for expanding datasets, enhancing AI reliability, improving tumor detection performance, and preserving patient privacy.</description>

      <title>Unrevealed Threats: A Comprehensive Study of the Adversarial Robustness of Underwater Image Enhancement Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based methods for underwater image enhancement (UWIE) have undergone extensive exploration. However, learning-based models are usually vulnerable to adversarial examples so as the UWIE models. To the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive study on the adversarial robustness of UWIE models, which indicates that UWIE models are potentially under the threat of adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a general adversarial attack protocol. We make a first attempt to conduct adversarial attacks on five well-designed UWIE models on three common underwater image benchmark datasets. Considering the scattering and absorption of light in the underwater environment, there exists a strong correlation between color correction and underwater image enhancement. On the basis of that, we also design two effective UWIE-oriented adversarial attack methods Pixel Attack and Color Shift Attack targeting different color spaces. The results show that five models exhibit varying degrees of vulnerability to adversarial attacks and well-designed small perturbations on degraded images are capable of preventing UWIE models from generating enhanced results. Further, we conduct adversarial training on these models and successfully mitigated the effectiveness of adversarial attacks. In summary, we reveal the adversarial vulnerability of UWIE models and propose a new evaluation dimension of UWIE models.</description>

      <title>Continual Domain Incremental Learning for Privacy-aware Digital Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been remarkable progress in the field of digital pathology, driven by the ability to model complex tissue patterns using advanced deep-learning algorithms. However, the robustness of these models is often severely compromised in the presence of data shifts (e.g., different stains, organs, centers, etc.). Alternatively, continual learning (CL) techniques aim to reduce the forgetting of past data when learning new data with distributional shift conditions. Specifically, rehearsal-based CL techniques, which store some past data in a buffer and then replay it with new data, have proven effective in medical image analysis tasks. However, privacy concerns arise as these approaches store past data, prompting the development of our novel Generative Latent Replay-based CL (GLRCL) approach. GLRCL captures the previous distribution through Gaussian Mixture Models instead of storing past samples, which are then utilized to generate features and perform latent replay with new data. We systematically evaluate our proposed framework under different shift conditions in histopathology data, including stain and organ shift. Our approach significantly outperforms popular buffer-free CL approaches and performs similarly to rehearsal-based CL approaches that require large buffers causing serious privacy violations.</description>

      <title>Universal End-to-End Neural Network for Lossy Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents variable bitrate lossy image compression using a VAE-based neural network. An adaptable image quality adjustment strategy is proposed. The key innovation involves adeptly adjusting the input scale exclusively during the inference process, resulting in an exceptionally efficient rate-distortion mechanism. Through extensive experimentation, across diverse VAE-based compression architectures (CNN, ViT) and training methodologies (MSE, SSIM), our approach exhibits remarkable universality. This success is attributed to the inherent generalization capacity of neural networks. Unlike methods that adjust model architecture or loss functions, our approach emphasizes simplicity, reducing computational complexity and memory requirements. The experiments not only highlight the effectiveness of our approach but also indicate its potential to drive advancements in variable-rate neural network lossy image compression methodologies.</description>

      <title>Interactive 3D Segmentation for Primary Gross Tumor Volume in Oropharyngeal Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main treatment modality for oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) is radiotherapy, where accurate segmentation of the primary gross tumor volume (GTVp) is essential. However, accurate GTVp segmentation is challenging due to significant interobserver variability and the time-consuming nature of manual annotation, while fully automated methods can occasionally fail. An interactive deep learning (DL) model offers the advantage of automatic high-performance segmentation with the flexibility for user correction when necessary. In this study, we examine interactive DL for GTVp segmentation in OPC. We implement state-of-the-art algorithms and propose a novel two-stage Interactive Click Refinement (2S-ICR) framework. Using the 2021 HEad and neCK TumOR (HECKTOR) dataset for development and an external dataset from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center for evaluation, the 2S-ICR framework achieves a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.713 $\pm$ 0.152 without user interaction and 0.824 $\pm$ 0.099 after five interactions, outperforming existing methods in both cases.</description>

      <title>Constructing an Interpretable Deep Denoiser by Unrolling Graph Laplacian Regularizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An image denoiser can be used for a wide range of restoration problems via the Plug-and-Play (PnP) architecture. In this paper, we propose a general framework to build an interpretable graph-based deep denoiser (GDD) by unrolling a solution to a maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem equipped with a graph Laplacian regularizer (GLR) as signal prior. Leveraging a recent theorem showing that any (pseudo-)linear denoiser $\boldsymbol \Psi$, under mild conditions, can be mapped to a solution of a MAP denoising problem regularized using GLR, we first initialize a graph Laplacian matrix $\mathbf L$ via truncated Taylor Series Expansion (TSE) of $\boldsymbol \Psi^{-1}$. Then, we compute the MAP linear system solution by unrolling iterations of the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm into a sequence of neural layers as a feed-forward network -- one that is amenable to parameter tuning. The resulting GDD network is "graph-interpretable", low in parameter count, and easy to initialize thanks to $\mathbf L$ derived from a known well-performing denoiser $\boldsymbol \Psi$. Experimental results show that GDD achieves competitive image denoising performance compared to competitors, but employing far fewer parameters, and is more robust to covariate shift.</description>

      <title>A study on deep feature extraction to detect and classify Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is a blood malignancy that mainly affects adults and children. This study looks into the use of deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for the detection and classification of ALL. Conventional techniques for ALL diagnosis, such bone marrow biopsy, are costly and prone to mistakes made by hand. By utilising automated technologies, the research seeks to improve diagnostic accuracy. The research uses a variety of pre-trained CNN models, such as InceptionV3, ResNet101, VGG19, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121, to extract characteristics from pictures of blood smears. ANOVA, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Random Forest, Lasso, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are a few of the selection approaches used to find the most relevant features after feature extraction. Following that, machine learning methods like Na\"ive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) are used to classify these features. With an 87% accuracy rate, the ResNet101 model produced the best results, closely followed by DenseNet121 and VGG19. According to the study, CNN-based models have the potential to decrease the need for medical specialists by increasing the speed and accuracy of ALL diagnosis. To improve model performance, the study also recommends expanding and diversifying datasets and investigating more sophisticated designs such as transformers. This study highlights how well automated deep learning systems do medical diagnosis.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study on Blood Cancer detection and classification using Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the years in object detection several efficient Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) networks, such as DenseNet201, InceptionV3, ResNet152v2, SEresNet152, VGG19, Xception gained significant attention due to their performance. Moreover, CNN paradigms have expanded to transfer learning and ensemble models from original CNN architectures. Research studies suggest that transfer learning and ensemble models are capable of increasing the accuracy of deep learning (DL) models. However, very few studies have conducted comprehensive experiments utilizing these techniques in detecting and localizing blood malignancies. Realizing the gap, this study conducted three experiments; in the first experiment -- six original CNNs were used, in the second experiment -- transfer learning and, in the third experiment a novel ensemble model DIX (DenseNet201, InceptionV3, and Xception) was developed to detect and classify blood cancer. The statistical result suggests that DIX outperformed the original and transfer learning performance, providing an accuracy of 99.12%. However, this study also provides a negative result in the case of transfer learning, as the transfer learning did not increase the accuracy of the original CNNs. Like many other cancers, blood cancer diseases require timely identification for effective treatment plans and increased survival possibilities. The high accuracy in detecting and categorization blood cancer detection using CNN suggests that the CNN model is promising in blood cancer disease detection. This research is significant in the fields of biomedical engineering, computer-aided disease diagnosis, and ML-based disease detection.</description>

      <title>A study on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, Transfer Learning and Ensemble Model for Breast Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In deep learning, transfer learning and ensemble models have shown promise in improving computer-aided disease diagnosis. However, applying the transfer learning and ensemble model is still relatively limited. Moreover, the ensemble model's development is ad-hoc, overlooks redundant layers, and suffers from imbalanced datasets and inadequate augmentation. Lastly, significant Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (D-CNNs) have been introduced to detect and classify breast cancer. Still, very few comparative studies were conducted to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of existing CNN architectures. Realising the gaps, this study compares the performance of D-CNN, which includes the original CNN, transfer learning, and an ensemble model, in detecting breast cancer. The comparison study of this paper consists of comparison using six CNN-based deep learning architectures (SE-ResNet152, MobileNetV2, VGG19, ResNet18, InceptionV3, and DenseNet-121), a transfer learning, and an ensemble model on breast cancer detection. Among the comparison of these models, the ensemble model provides the highest detection and classification accuracy of 99.94% for breast cancer detection and classification. However, this study also provides a negative result in the case of transfer learning, as the transfer learning did not increase the accuracy of the original SE-ResNet152, MobileNetV2, VGG19, ResNet18, InceptionV3, and DenseNet-121 model. The high accuracy in detecting and categorising breast cancer detection using CNN suggests that the CNN model is promising in breast cancer disease detection. This research is significant in biomedical engineering, computer-aided disease diagnosis, and ML-based disease detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on different hardware platforms is challenging due to varying resource constraints. Besides handcrafted approaches aiming at making deep models hardware-friendly, Neural Architectures Search is rising as a toolbox to craft more efficient DNNs without sacrificing performance. Among these, the Once-For-All (OFA) approach offers a solution by allowing the sampling of well-performing sub-networks from a single supernet -- this leads to evident advantages in terms of computation. However, OFA does not fully utilize the potential memory capacity of the target device, focusing instead on limiting maximum memory usage per layer. This leaves room for an unexploited potential in terms of model generalizability. In this paper, we introduce a Memory-Optimized OFA (MOOFA) supernet, designed to enhance DNN deployment on resource-limited devices by maximizing memory usage (and for instance, features diversity) across different configurations. Tested on ImageNet, our MOOFA supernet demonstrates improvements in memory exploitation and model accuracy compared to the original OFA supernet. Our code is available at https://github.com/MaximeGirard/memory-optimized-once-for-all.</description>

      <title>Denoising: A Powerful Building-Block for Imaging, Inverse Problems, and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Denoising, the process of reducing random fluctuations in a signal to emphasize essential patterns, has been a fundamental problem of interest since the dawn of modern scientific inquiry. Recent denoising techniques, particularly in imaging, have achieved remarkable success, nearing theoretical limits by some measures. Yet, despite tens of thousands of research papers, the wide-ranging applications of denoising beyond noise removal have not been fully recognized. This is partly due to the vast and diverse literature, making a clear overview challenging.
  This paper aims to address this gap. We present a comprehensive perspective on denoisers, their structure, and desired properties. We emphasize the increasing importance of denoising and showcase its evolution into an essential building block for complex tasks in imaging, inverse problems, and machine learning. Despite its long history, the community continues to uncover unexpected and groundbreaking uses for denoising, further solidifying its place as a cornerstone of scientific and engineering practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a vital task in the field of remote sensing (RS). However, conventional convolutional neural network (CNN) and transformer-based models face limitations in capturing long-range dependencies or are often computationally intensive. Recently, an advanced state space model (SSM), namely Mamba, was introduced, offering linear computational complexity while effectively establishing long-distance dependencies. Despite their advantages, Mamba-based methods encounter challenges in preserving local semantic information. To cope with these challenges, this paper proposes a novel network called Pyramid Pooling Mamba (PPMamba), which integrates CNN and Mamba for RS semantic segmentation tasks. The core structure of PPMamba, the Pyramid Pooling-State Space Model (PP-SSM) block, combines a local auxiliary mechanism with an omnidirectional state space model (OSS) that selectively scans feature maps from eight directions, capturing comprehensive feature information. Additionally, the auxiliary mechanism includes pyramid-shaped convolutional branches designed to extract features at multiple scales. Extensive experiments on two widely-used datasets, ISPRS Vaihingen and LoveDA Urban, demonstrate that PPMamba achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>A Practical Gated Recurrent Transformer Network Incorporating Multiple Fusions for Video Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) video denoising methods employ multi-frame simultaneous denoising mechanisms, resulting in significant delays (e.g., 16 frames), making them impractical for real-time cameras. To overcome this limitation, we propose a multi-fusion gated recurrent Transformer network (GRTN) that achieves SOTA denoising performance with only a single-frame delay. Specifically, the spatial denoising module extracts features from the current frame, while the reset gate selects relevant information from the previous frame and fuses it with current frame features via the temporal denoising module. The update gate then further blends this result with the previous frame features, and the reconstruction module integrates it with the current frame. To robustly compute attention for noisy features, we propose a residual simplified Swin Transformer with Euclidean distance (RSSTE) in the spatial and temporal denoising modules. Comparative objective and subjective results show that our GRTN achieves denoising performance comparable to SOTA multi-frame delay networks, with only a single-frame delay.</description>

      <title>CathFlow: Self-Supervised Segmentation of Catheters in Interventional Ultrasound Using Optical Flow and Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In minimally invasive endovascular procedures, contrast-enhanced angiography remains the most robust imaging technique. However, it is at the expense of the patient and clinician's health due to prolonged radiation exposure. As an alternative, interventional ultrasound has notable benefits such as being radiation-free, fast to deploy, and having a small footprint in the operating room. Yet, ultrasound is hard to interpret, and highly prone to artifacts and noise. Additionally, interventional radiologists must undergo extensive training before they become qualified to diagnose and treat patients effectively, leading to a shortage of staff, and a lack of open-source datasets. In this work, we seek to address both problems by introducing a self-supervised deep learning architecture to segment catheters in longitudinal ultrasound images, without demanding any labeled data. The network architecture builds upon AiAReSeg, a segmentation transformer built with the Attention in Attention mechanism, and is capable of learning feature changes across time and space. To facilitate training, we used synthetic ultrasound data based on physics-driven catheter insertion simulations, and translated the data into a unique CT-Ultrasound common domain, CACTUSS, to improve the segmentation performance. We generated ground truth segmentation masks by computing the optical flow between adjacent frames using FlowNet2, and performed thresholding to obtain a binary map estimate. Finally, we validated our model on a test dataset, consisting of unseen synthetic data and images collected from silicon aorta phantoms, thus demonstrating its potential for applications to clinical data in the future.</description>

      <title>XCAT-3.0: A Comprehensive Library of Personalized Digital Twins Derived from CT Scans</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11133v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Virtual Imaging Trials (VIT) offer a cost-effective and scalable approach for evaluating medical imaging technologies. Computational phantoms, which mimic real patient anatomy and physiology, play a central role in VITs. However, the current libraries of computational phantoms face limitations, particularly in terms of sample size and diversity. Insufficient representation of the population hampers accurate assessment of imaging technologies across different patient groups. Traditionally, the more realistic computational phantoms were created by manual segmentation, which is a laborious and time-consuming task, impeding the expansion of phantom libraries. This study presents a framework for creating realistic computational phantoms using a suite of automatic segmentation models and performing three forms of automated quality control on the segmented organ masks. The result is the release of over 2500 new computational phantoms, so-named XCAT3.0 after the ubiquitous XCAT computational construct. This new formation embodies 140 structures and represents a comprehensive approach to detailed anatomical modeling. The developed computational phantoms are formatted in both voxelized and surface mesh formats. The framework is combined with an in-house CT scanner simulator to produce realistic CT images. The framework has the potential to advance virtual imaging trials, facilitating comprehensive and reliable evaluations of medical imaging technologies. Phantoms may be requested at https://cvit.duke.edu/resources/. Code, model weights, and sample CT images are available at https://xcat-3.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Learned Image Transmission with Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an innovative hierarchical joint source-channel coding (HJSCC) framework for image transmission, utilizing a hierarchical variational autoencoder (VAE). Our approach leverages a combination of bottom-up and top-down paths at the transmitter to autoregressively generate multiple hierarchical representations of the original image. These representations are then directly mapped to channel symbols for transmission by the JSCC encoder. We extend this framework to scenarios with a feedback link, modeling transmission over a noisy channel as a probabilistic sampling process and deriving a novel generative formulation for JSCC with feedback. Compared with existing approaches, our proposed HJSCC provides enhanced adaptability by dynamically adjusting transmission bandwidth, encoding these representations into varying amounts of channel symbols. Extensive experiments on images of varying resolutions demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms existing baselines in rate-distortion performance and maintains robustness against channel noise. The source code will be made available upon acceptance.</description>

Abstract: Despite the growing adoption of video processing via Internet of Things (IoT) devices due to their cost-effectiveness, transmitting captured data to nearby servers poses challenges due to varying timing constraints and scarcity of network bandwidth. Existing video compression methods face difficulties in recovering compressed data when incomplete data is provided. Here, we introduce FrameCorr, a deep-learning based solution that utilizes previously received data to predict the missing segments of a frame, enabling the reconstruction of a frame from partially received data.</description>

      <title>Diff-INR: Generative Regularization for Electrical Impedance Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that reconstructs conductivity distributions within a body from boundary measurements. However, EIT reconstruction is hindered by its ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem, which complicates accurate results. To tackle this, we propose Diff-INR, a novel method that combines generative regularization with Implicit Neural Representations (INR) through a diffusion model. Diff-INR introduces geometric priors to guide the reconstruction, effectively addressing the shortcomings of traditional regularization methods. By integrating a pre-trained diffusion regularizer with INR, our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy in both simulation and experimental data. The method demonstrates robust performance across various mesh densities and hyperparameter settings, highlighting its flexibility and efficiency. This advancement represents a significant improvement in managing the ill-posed nature of EIT. Furthermore, the method's principles are applicable to other imaging modalities facing similar challenges with ill-posed inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Cross Layer Optimization and Distributed Reinforcement Learning for Wireless 360{\deg} Video Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.06356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wirelessly streaming high quality 360 degree videos is still a challenging problem. When there are many users watching different 360 degree videos and competing for the computing and communication resources, the streaming algorithm at hand should maximize the average quality of experience (QoE) while guaranteeing a minimum rate for each user. In this paper, we propose a cross layer optimization approach that maximizes the available rate to each user and efficiently uses it to maximize users' QoE. Particularly, we consider a tile based 360 degree video streaming, and we optimize a QoE metric that balances the tradeoff between maximizing each user's QoE and ensuring fairness among users. We show that the problem can be decoupled into two interrelated subproblems: (i) a physical layer subproblem whose objective is to find the download rate for each user, and (ii) an application layer subproblem whose objective is to use that rate to find a quality decision per tile such that the user's QoE is maximized. We prove that the physical layer subproblem can be solved optimally with low complexity and an actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed to leverage the parallel training of multiple independent agents and solve the application layer subproblem. Extensive experiments reveal the robustness of our scheme and demonstrate its significant performance improvement compared to several baseline algorithms.</description>

      <title>Learning a Cross-modality Anomaly Detector for Remote Sensing Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remote sensing anomaly detector can find the objects deviating from the background as potential targets for Earth monitoring. Given the diversity in earth anomaly types, designing a transferring model with cross-modality detection ability should be cost-effective and flexible to new earth observation sources and anomaly types. However, the current anomaly detectors aim to learn the certain background distribution, the trained model cannot be transferred to unseen images. Inspired by the fact that the deviation metric for score ranking is consistent and independent from the image distribution, this study exploits the learning target conversion from the varying background distribution to the consistent deviation metric. We theoretically prove that the large-margin condition in labeled samples ensures the transferring ability of learned deviation metric. To satisfy this condition, two large margin losses for pixel-level and feature-level deviation ranking are proposed respectively. Since the real anomalies are difficult to acquire, anomaly simulation strategies are designed to compute the model loss. With the large-margin learning for deviation metric, the trained model achieves cross-modality detection ability in five modalities including hyperspectral, visible light, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), infrared and low-light in zero-shot manner.</description>

      <title>RangeLDM: Fast Realistic LiDAR Point Cloud Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving demands high-quality LiDAR data, yet the cost of physical LiDAR sensors presents a significant scaling-up challenge. While recent efforts have explored deep generative models to address this issue, they often consume substantial computational resources with slow generation speeds while suffering from a lack of realism. To address these limitations, we introduce RangeLDM, a novel approach for rapidly generating high-quality range-view LiDAR point clouds via latent diffusion models. We achieve this by correcting range-view data distribution for accurate projection from point clouds to range images via Hough voting, which has a critical impact on generative learning. We then compress the range images into a latent space with a variational autoencoder, and leverage a diffusion model to enhance expressivity. Additionally, we instruct the model to preserve 3D structural fidelity by devising a range-guided discriminator. Experimental results on KITTI-360 and nuScenes datasets demonstrate both the robust expressiveness and fast speed of our LiDAR point cloud generation.</description>
