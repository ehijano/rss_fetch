      <title>Revisiting Text Ranking in Deep Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep research has emerged as an important task that aims to address hard queries through extensive open-web exploration. To tackle it, most prior work equips large language model (LLM)-based agents with opaque web search APIs, enabling agents to iteratively issue search queries, retrieve external evidence, and reason over it. Despite search's essential role in deep research, black-box web search APIs hinder systematic analysis of search components, leaving the behaviour of established text ranking methods in deep research largely unclear. To fill this gap, we reproduce a selection of key findings and best practices for IR text ranking methods in the deep research setting. In particular, we examine their effectiveness from three perspectives: (i) retrieval units (documents vs. passages), (ii) pipeline configurations (different retrievers, re-rankers, and re-ranking depths), and (iii) query characteristics (the mismatch between agent-issued queries and the training queries of text rankers). We perform experiments on BrowseComp-Plus, a deep research dataset with a fixed corpus, evaluating 2 open-source agents, 5 retrievers, and 3 re-rankers across diverse setups. We find that agent-issued queries typically follow web-search-style syntax (e.g., quoted exact matches), favouring lexical, learned sparse, and multi-vector retrievers; passage-level units are more efficient under limited context windows, and avoid the difficulties of document length normalisation in lexical retrieval; re-ranking is highly effective; translating agent-issued queries into natural-language questions significantly bridges the query mismatch.</description>

      <title>Revisiting RAG Retrievers: An Information Theoretic Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely critically on the retriever module to surface relevant context for large language models. Although numerous retrievers have recently been proposed, each built on different ranking principles such as lexical matching, dense embeddings, or graph citations, there remains a lack of systematic understanding of how these mechanisms differ and overlap. Existing benchmarks primarily compare entire RAG pipelines or introduce new datasets, providing little guidance on selecting or combining retrievers themselves. Those that do compare retrievers directly use a limited set of evaluation tools which fail to capture complementary and overlapping strengths. This work presents MIGRASCOPE, a Mutual Information based RAG Retriever Analysis Scope. We revisit state-of-the-art retrievers and introduce principled metrics grounded in information and statistical estimation theory to quantify retrieval quality, redundancy, synergy, and marginal contribution. We further show that if chosen carefully, an ensemble of retrievers outperforms any single retriever. We leverage the developed tools over major RAG corpora to provide unique insights on contribution levels of the state-of-the-art retrievers. Our findings provide a fresh perspective on the structure of modern retrieval techniques and actionable guidance for designing robust and efficient RAG systems.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Challenges in Low-Resource Public Service Information: A Case Study on Food Pantry Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public service information systems are often fragmented, inconsistently formatted, and outdated. These characteristics create low-resource retrieval environments that hinder timely access to critical services. We investigate retrieval challenges in such settings through the domain of food pantry access, a socially urgent problem given persistent food insecurity. We develop an AI-powered conversational retrieval system that scrapes and indexes publicly available pantry data and employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to support natural language queries via a web interface. We conduct a pilot evaluation study using community-sourced queries to examine system behavior in realistic scenarios. Our analysis reveals key limitations in retrieval robustness, handling underspecified queries, and grounding over inconsistent knowledge bases. This ongoing work exposes fundamental IR challenges in low-resource environments and motivates future research on robust conversational retrieval to improve access to critical public resources.</description>

      <title>AQR-HNSW: Accelerating Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search via Density-aware Quantization and Multi-stage Re-ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search has become fundamental to modern AI infrastructure, powering recommendation systems, search engines, and large language models across industry leaders from Google to OpenAI. Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs have emerged as the dominant ANN algorithm, widely adopted in production systems due to their superior recall versus latency balance. However, as vector databases scale to billions of embeddings, HNSW faces critical bottlenecks: memory consumption expands, distance computation overhead dominates query latency, and it suffers suboptimal performance on heterogeneous data distributions. This paper presents Adaptive Quantization and Rerank HNSW (AQR-HNSW), a novel framework that synergistically integrates three strategies to enhance HNSW scalability. AQR-HNSW introduces (1) density-aware adaptive quantization, achieving 4x compression while preserving distance relationships; (2) multi-state re-ranking that reduces unnecessary computations by 35%; and (3) quantization-optimized SIMD implementations delivering 16-64 operations per cycle across architectures. Evaluation on standard benchmarks demonstrates 2.5-3.3x higher queries per second (QPS) than state-of-the-art HNSW implementations while maintaining over 98% recall, with 75% memory reduction for the index graph and 5x faster index construction.</description>

      <title>Trie-Aware Transformers for Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) aligns with advances in generative AI by casting next-item prediction as token-level generation rather than score-based ranking. Most GR methods adopt a two-stage pipeline: (i) \textit{item tokenization}, which maps each item to a sequence of discrete, hierarchically organized tokens; and (ii) \textit{autoregressive generation}, which predicts the next item's tokens conditioned on the tokens of user's interaction history. Although hierarchical tokenization induces a prefix tree (trie) over items, standard autoregressive modeling with conventional Transformers often flattens item tokens into a linear stream and overlooks the underlying topology.
  To address this, we propose TrieRec, a trie-aware generative recommendation method that augments Transformers with structural inductive biases via two positional encodings. First, a \textit{trie-aware absolute positional encoding} aggregates a token's (node's) local structural context (\eg depth, ancestors, and descendants) into the token representation. Second, a \textit{topology-aware relative positional encoding} injects pairwise structural relations into self-attention to capture topology-induced semantic relatedness. TrieRec is also model-agnostic, efficient, and hyperparameter-free. In our experiments, we implement TrieRec within three representative GR backbones, achieving notably improvements of 8.83\% on average across four real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Offline Reasoning for Efficient Recommendation: LLM-Empowered Persona-Profiled Item Indexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for recommender systems by capturing the nuanced semantics of user interests and item characteristics through rich semantic understanding and contextual reasoning. In particular, LLMs have been employed as rerankers that reorder candidate items based on inferred user-item relevance. However, these approaches often require expensive online inference-time reasoning, leading to high latency that hampers real-world deployment. In this work, we introduce Persona4Rec, a recommendation framework that performs offline reasoning to construct interpretable persona representations of items, enabling lightweight and scalable real-time inference. In the offline stage, Persona4Rec leverages LLMs to reason over item reviews, inferring diverse user motivations that explain why different types of users may engage with an item; these inferred motivations are materialized as persona representations, providing multiple, human-interpretable views of each item. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on a single item representation, Persona4Rec learns to align user profiles with the most plausible item-side persona through a dedicated encoder, effectively transforming user-item relevance into user-persona relevance. At the online stage, this persona-profiled item index allows fast relevance computation without invoking expensive LLM reasoning. Extensive experiments show that Persona4Rec achieves performance comparable to recent LLM-based rerankers while substantially reducing inference time. Moreover, qualitative analysis confirms that persona representations not only drive efficient scoring but also provide intuitive, review-grounded explanations. These results demonstrate that Persona4Rec offers a practical and interpretable solution for next-generation recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Learning to Collaborate via Structures: Cluster-Guided Item Alignment for Federated Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated recommendation facilitates collaborative model training across distributed clients while keeping sensitive user interaction data local. Conventional approaches typically rely on synchronizing high-dimensional item representations between the server and clients. This paradigm implicitly assumes that precise geometric alignment of embedding coordinates is necessary for collaboration across clients. We posit that establishing relative semantic relationships among items is more effective than enforcing shared representations. Specifically, global semantic relations serve as structural constraints for items. Within these constraints, the framework allows item representations to vary locally on each client, which flexibility enables the model to capture fine-grained user personalization while maintaining global consistency. To this end, we propose Cluster-Guided FedRec framework (CGFedRec), a framework that transforms uploaded embeddings into compact cluster labels. In this framework, the server functions as a global structure discoverer to learn item clusters and distributes only the resulting labels. This mechanism explicitly cuts off the downstream transmission of item embeddings, relieving clients from maintaining global shared item embeddings. Consequently, CGFedRec achieves the effective injection of global collaborative signals into local item representations without transmitting full embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves communication efficiency while maintaining superior recommendation accuracy across multiple datasets.</description>

      <title>Disaster Question Answering with LoRA Efficiency and Accurate End Position</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural disasters such as earthquakes, torrential rainfall, floods, and volcanic eruptions occur with extremely low frequency and affect limited geographic areas. When individuals face disaster situations, they often experience confusion and lack the domain-specific knowledge and experience necessary to determine appropriate responses and actions. While disaster information is continuously updated, even when utilizing RAG search and large language models for inquiries, obtaining relevant domain knowledge about natural disasters and experiences similar to one's specific situation is not guaranteed. When hallucinations are included in disaster question answering, artificial misinformation may spread and exacerbate confusion. This work introduces a disaster-focused question answering system based on Japanese disaster situations and response experiences. Utilizing the cl-tohoku/bert-base-japanese-v3 + Bi-LSTM + Enhanced Position Heads architecture with LoRA efficiency optimization, we achieved 70.4\% End Position accuracy with only 5.7\% of the total parameters (6.7M/117M). Experimental results demonstrate that the combination of Japanese BERT-base optimization and Bi-LSTM contextual understanding achieves accuracy levels suitable for real disaster response scenarios, attaining a 0.885 Span F1 score. Future challenges include: establishing natural disaster Q\&amp;A benchmark datasets, fine-tuning foundation models with disaster knowledge, developing lightweight and power-efficient edge AI Disaster Q\&amp;A applications for situations with insufficient power and communication during disasters, and addressing disaster knowledge base updates and continual learning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Toward Effective Multi-Domain Rumor Detection in Social Networks Using Domain-Gated Mixture-of-Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms have become key channels for spreading and tracking rumors due to their widespread accessibility and ease of information sharing. Rumors can continuously emerge across diverse domains and topics, often with the intent to mislead society for personal or commercial gain. Therefore, developing methods that can accurately detect rumors at early stages is crucial to mitigating their negative impact. While existing approaches often specialize in single-domain detection, their performance degrades when applied to new domains due to shifts in data distribution, such as lexical patterns and propagation dynamics. To bridge this gap, this study introduces PerFact, a large-scale multi-domain rumor dataset comprising 8,034 annotated posts from the X platform, annotated into two primary categories: rumor (including true, false, and unverified rumors) and non-rumor. Annotator agreement, measured via Fleiss' Kappa ($\kappa = 0.74$), ensures high-quality labels.
  This research further proposes an effective multi-domain rumor detection model that employs a domain gate to dynamically aggregate multiple feature representations extracted through a Mixture-of-Experts method. Each expert combines CNN and BiLSTM networks to capture local syntactic features and long-range contextual dependencies. By leveraging both textual content and publisher information, the proposed model classifies posts into rumor and non-rumor categories with high accuracy. Evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving an F1-score of 79.86\% and an accuracy of 79.98\% in multi-domain settings.

      <title>PiPNN: Ultra-Scalable Graph-Based Nearest Neighbor Indexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fastest indexes for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search today are also the slowest to build: graph-based methods like HNSW and Vamana achieve state-of-the-art query performance but have large construction times due to relying on random-access-heavy beam searches. We introduce PiPNN (Pick-in-Partitions Nearest Neighbors), an ultra-scalable graph construction algorithm that avoids this ``search bottleneck'' that existing graph-based methods suffer from.
  PiPNN's core innovation is HashPrune, a novel online pruning algorithm which dynamically maintains sparse collections of edges. HashPrune enables PiPNN to partition the dataset into overlapping sub-problems, efficiently perform bulk distance comparisons via dense matrix multiplication kernels, and stream a subset of the edges into HashPrune. HashPrune guarantees bounded memory during index construction which permits PiPNN to build higher quality indices without the use of extra intermediate memory.
  PiPNN builds state-of-the-art indexes up to 11.6x faster than Vamana (DiskANN) and up to 12.9x faster than HNSW. PiPNN is significantly more scalable than recent algorithms for fast graph construction. PiPNN builds indexes at least 19.1x faster than MIRAGE and 17.3x than FastKCNA while producing indexes that achieve higher query throughput. PiPNN enables us to build, for the first time, high-quality ANN indexes on billion-scale datasets in under 20 minutes using a single multicore machine.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Multi-Agent System for Autonomous Discovery in Geoscientific Data Archives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid accumulation of Earth science data has created a significant scalability challenge; while repositories like PANGAEA host vast collections of datasets, citation metrics indicate that a substantial portion remains underutilized, limiting data reusability. Here we present PANGAEA-GPT, a hierarchical multi-agent framework designed for autonomous data discovery and analysis. Unlike standard Large Language Model (LLM) wrappers, our architecture implements a centralized Supervisor-Worker topology with strict data-type-aware routing, sandboxed deterministic code execution, and self-correction via execution feedback, enabling agents to diagnose and resolve runtime errors. Through use-case scenarios spanning physical oceanography and ecology, we demonstrate the system's capacity to execute complex, multi-step workflows with minimal human intervention. This framework provides a methodology for querying and analyzing heterogeneous repository data through coordinated agent workflows.</description>

      <title>Both Ends Count! Just How Good are LLM Agents at "Text-to-Big SQL"?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21480v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL and Big Data are both extensively benchmarked fields, yet there is limited research that evaluates them jointly. In the real world, Text-to-SQL systems are often embedded with Big Data workflows, such as large-scale data processing or interactive data analytics. We refer to this as "Text-to-Big SQL". However, existing text-to-SQL benchmarks remain narrowly scoped and overlook the cost and performance implications that arise at scale. For instance, translation errors that are minor on small datasets lead to substantial cost and latency overheads as data scales, a relevant issue completely ignored by text-to-SQL metrics.
  In this paper, we overcome this overlooked challenge by introducing novel and representative metrics for evaluating Text-to-Big SQL. Our study focuses on production-level LLM agents, a database-agnostic system adaptable to diverse user needs. Via an extensive evaluation of frontier models, we show that text-to-SQL metrics are insufficient for Big Data. In contrast, our proposed text-to-Big SQL metrics accurately reflect execution efficiency, cost, and the impact of data scale. Furthermore, we provide LLM-specific insights, including fine-grained, cross-model comparisons of latency and cost.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Multilingual Embeddings via Multi-Way Parallel Text Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilingual pretraining typically lacks explicit alignment signals, leading to suboptimal cross-lingual alignment in the representation space. In this work, we show that training standard pretrained models for cross-lingual alignment with a multi-way parallel corpus in a diverse pool of languages can substantially improve multilingual and cross-lingual representations for NLU tasks. We construct a multi-way parallel dataset using translations of English text from an off-the-shelf NMT model for a pool of six target languages and achieve strong cross-lingual alignment through contrastive learning. This leads to substantial performance gains across both seen and unseen languages for multiple tasks from the MTEB benchmark evaluated for XLM-Roberta and multilingual BERT base models. Using a multi-way parallel corpus for contrastive training yields substantial gains on bitext mining (21.3%), semantic similarity (5.3%), and classification (28.4%) compared to English-centric (En-X) bilingually parallel data, where X is sampled from a pool of multiple target languages. Furthermore, finetuning mE5 model on a small dataset with multi-way parallelism significantly improves bitext mining compared to one without, underscoring the importance of multi-way cross-lingual supervision even for models already pretrained for high-quality sentence embeddings.</description>

      <title>LiCQA : A Lightweight Complex Question Answering System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22182</link>

Abstract: Over the last twenty years, significant progress has been made in designing and implementing Question Answering (QA) systems. However, addressing complex questions, the answers to which are spread across multiple documents, remains a challenging problem. Recent QA systems that are designed to handle complex questions work either on the basis of knowledge graphs, or utilise contem- porary neural models that are expensive to train, in terms of both computational resources and the volume of training data required. In this paper, we present LiCQA, an unsupervised question answer- ing model that works primarily on the basis of corpus evidence. We empirically compare the effectiveness and efficiency of LiCQA with two recently presented QA systems, which are based on different underlying principles. The results of our experiments show that LiCQA significantly outperforms these two state-of-the-art systems on benchmark data with noteworthy reduction in latency.</description>

      <title>C$^3$: Capturing Consensus with Contrastive Learning in Group Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13703v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Group recommendation aims to recommend tailored items to groups of users, where the key challenge is modeling a consensus that reflects member preferences. Although several existing deep learning models have achieved performance improvements, they still fail to capture consensus in various aspects: (1) Capturing consensus in small-group (2~5 members) recommendation systems, which align more closely with real-world scenarios, remains a significant challenge; (2) Most existing models significantly enhance the overall group performance but struggle with balancing individual and group performance. To address these issues, we propose Capturing Consensus with Contrastive Learning in Group Recommendation (C$^3$), which focuses on exploring the consensus behind group decision-making. A Transformer encoder is used to learn both group and user representations, and contrastive learning mitigates overfitting for users with many interactions, yielding more robust group representations. Experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that C$^3$ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both user and group recommendation tasks.</description>

      <title>Toward Safe and Human-Aligned Game Conversational Recommendation via Multi-Agent Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) have advanced with large language models, showing strong results in domains like movies. These domains typically involve fixed content and passive consumption, where user preferences can be matched by genre or theme. In contrast, games present distinct challenges: fast-evolving catalogs, interaction-driven preferences (e.g., skill level, mechanics, hardware), and increased risk of unsafe responses in open-ended conversation. We propose MATCHA, a multi-agent framework for CRS that assigns specialized agents for intent parsing, tool-augmented retrieval, multi-LLM ranking with reflection, explanation, and risk control which enabling finer personalization, long-tail coverage, and stronger safety. Evaluated on real user request dataset, MATCHA outperforms six baselines across eight metrics, improving Hit@5 by 20%, reducing popularity bias by 24%, and achieving 97.9% adversarial defense. Human and virtual-judge evaluations confirm improved explanation quality and user alignment.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Semantic RL: Tackling the Problem of Dynamic Action Space for RL-based Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender Systems (RS) are fundamental to modern online services. While most existing approaches optimize for short-term engagement, recent work has begun to explore reinforcement learning (RL) to model long-term user value. However, these efforts face significant challenges due to the vast, dynamic action spaces inherent in RS, which hinder stable policy learning. To resolve this bottleneck, we introduce Hierarchical Semantic RL (HSRL), which reframes RL-based recommendation over a fixed Semantic Action Space (SAS). HSRL encodes items as Semantic IDs (SIDs) for policy learning, and maps SIDs back to their original items via a fixed lookup during execution. To align decision-making with SID generation, the Hierarchical Policy Network (HPN) operates in a coarse-to-fine manner, employing hierarchical residual state modeling to refine each level's context from the previous level's residual, thereby reducing representation-decision mismatch. In parallel, a Multi-level Critic (MLC) provides token-level value estimates, enabling fine-grained credit assignment. Across public benchmarks and a large-scale production dataset from a leading short-video advertising platform, HSRL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. In online deployment over a 7-day A/B testing, it delivers an 18.421% ADVV lift and a 1.251% increase in Revenue, supporting HSRL as a scalable paradigm for RL-based recommendation.</description>

      <title>Massive Memorization with Hundreds of Trillions of Parameters for Sequential Transducer Generative Recommenders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern large-scale recommendation systems rely heavily on user interaction history sequences to enhance the model performance. The advent of large language models and sequential modeling techniques, particularly transformer-like architectures, has led to significant advancements recently (e.g., HSTU, SIM, and TWIN models). While scaling to ultra-long user histories (10k to 100k items) generally improves model performance, it also creates significant challenges on latency, queries per second (QPS) and GPU cost in industry-scale recommendation systems. Existing models do not adequately address these industrial scalability issues. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage modeling framework, namely VIrtual Sequential Target Attention (VISTA), which decomposes traditional target attention from a candidate item to user history items into two distinct stages: (1) user history summarization into a few hundred tokens; followed by (2) candidate item attention to those tokens. These summarization token embeddings are then cached in storage system and then utilized as sequence features for downstream model training and inference. This novel design for scalability enables VISTA to scale to lifelong user histories (up to one million items) while keeping downstream training and inference costs fixed, which is essential in industry. Our approach achieves significant improvements in offline and online metrics and has been successfully deployed on an industry leading recommendation platform serving billions of users.</description>

      <title>Interact-RAG: Reason and Interact with the Corpus, Beyond Black-Box Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly enhanced LLMs by incorporating external information. However, prevailing agentic RAG approaches are constrained by a critical limitation: they treat the retrieval process as a black-box querying operation. This confines agents' actions to query issuing, hindering its ability to tackle complex information-seeking tasks. To address this, we introduce Interact-RAG, a new paradigm that elevates the LLM agent from a passive query issuer into an active manipulator of the retrieval process. We dismantle the black-box with a Corpus Interaction Engine, equipping the agent with a set of action primitives for fine-grained control over information retrieval. To further empower the agent on the entire RAG pipeline, we first develop a reasoning-enhanced workflow, which enables both zero-shot execution and the synthesis of interaction trajectories. We then leverage this synthetic data to train a fully autonomous end-to-end agent via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by refinement with Reinforcement Learning (RL). Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that Interact-RAG significantly outperforms other advanced methods, validating the efficacy of our reasoning-interaction strategy.</description>

      <title>Legal Retrieval for Public Defenders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI tools are increasingly suggested as solutions to assist public agencies with heavy workloads. In public defense, where a constitutional right to counsel meets the complexities of law, overwhelming caseloads and constrained resources, practitioners face especially taxing conditions. Yet, there is little evidence of how AI could meaningfully support defenders' day-to-day work. In partnership with the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender, we develop the NJ BriefBank, a retrieval tool which surfaces relevant appellate briefs to streamline legal research and writing. We show that existing legal retrieval benchmarks fail to transfer to public defense search, however adding domain knowledge improves retrieval quality. This includes query expansion with legal reasoning, domain-specific data and curated synthetic examples. To facilitate further research, we provide a taxonomy of realistic defender search queries and release a manually annotated public defense retrieval dataset. Together, our work offers starting points towards building practical, reliable retrieval AI tools for public defense, and towards more realistic legal retrieval benchmarks.</description>

      <title>S-GRec: Personalized Semantic-Aware Generative Recommendation with Asymmetric Advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10606v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative recommendation models sequence generation to produce items end-to-end, but training from behavioral logs often provides weak supervision on underlying user intent. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) offer rich semantic priors that could supply such supervision, direct adoption in industrial recommendation is hindered by two obstacles: semantic signals can conflict with platform business objectives, and LLM inference is prohibitively expensive at scale. This paper presents S-GRec, a semantic-aware framework that decouples an online lightweight generator from an offline LLM-based semantic judge for train-time supervision. S-GRec introduces a two-stage Personalized Semantic Judge (PSJ) that produces interpretable aspect evidence and learns user-conditional aggregation from pairwise feedback, yielding stable semantic rewards. To prevent semantic supervision from deviating from business goals, Asymmetric Advantage Policy Optimization (A2PO) anchors optimization on business rewards (e.g., eCPM) and injects semantic advantages only when they are consistent. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and a large-scale production system validate both effectiveness and scalability, including statistically significant gains in CTR and a 1.19\% lift in GMV in online A/B tests, without requiring real-time LLM inference.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Preference Leakage via Strict Estimator Separation for Normative Generative Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Generative Information Retrieval (GenIR), the bottleneck has shifted from generation to the selection of candidates, particularly for normative criteria such as cultural relevance. Current LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations often suffer from circularity and preference leakage, where overlapping supervision and evaluation models inflate performance. We address this by formalising cultural relevance as a within-query ranking task and introducing a leakage-free two-judge framework that strictly separates supervision (Judge B) from evaluation (Judge A). On a new benchmark of 33,052 (NGR-33k) culturally grounded stories, we find that while classical baselines yield only modest gains, a dense bi-encoder distilled from a Judge-B-supervised Cross-Encoder is highly effective. Although the Cross-Encoder provides a strong supervision signal for distillation, the distilled BGE-M3 model substantially outperforms it under leakage-free Judge~A evaluation. We validate our framework on the human-curated Moral Stories dataset, showing strong alignment with human norms. Our results demonstrate that rigorous evaluator separation is a prerequisite for credible GenIR evaluation, proving that subtle cultural preferences can be distilled into efficient rankers without leakage.</description>

      <title>Resisting Contextual Interference in RAG via Parametric-Knowledge Reinforcement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05154v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves performance on knowledge-intensive tasks but can be derailed by wrong, irrelevant, or conflicting retrieved text, causing models to rely on inaccurate evidence and cascade errors. We propose Knowledgeable-R1, a reinforcement-learning framework that explicitly trains large language models to use parametric knowledge (PK) to resist contextual interference while still exploiting external context when it is reliably helpful. Knowledgeable-R1 introduces a joint sampling scheme that generates paired responses with and without retrieval, and learns both local advantages (within each decoding regime) and global advantages under the same input to quantify when to ignore misleading context versus adopt it. We employ an asymmetric advantage transformation that amplifies exploratory behaviors toward parametric knowledge. Experiments show that Knowledgeable-R1 significantly improves robustness and reasoning accuracy in knowledge conflict scenarios and general RAG scenarios, outperforming SOTA baselines by +22.89% in counterfactual scenarios, and without degradation when the retrieved context is fully accurate.Our code are available at https://github.com/lcy80366872/knowledgeable-R1.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search Algorithms on Transformer-based Embedding Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in embedding models for text, image, audio, and video drive progress across multiple domains, including retrieval-augmented generation, recommendation systems, and others. Many of these applications require an efficient method to retrieve items that are close to a given query in the embedding space while satisfying a filter condition based on the item's attributes, a problem known as filtered approximate nearest neighbor search (FANNS). By performing an in-depth literature analysis on FANNS, we identify a key gap in the research landscape: publicly available datasets with embedding vectors from state-of-the-art transformer-based text embedding models that contain abundant real-world attributes covering a broad spectrum of attribute types and value distributions. To fill this gap, we introduce the arxiv-for-fanns dataset of transformer-based embedding vectors for the abstracts of over 2.7 million arXiv papers, enriched with 11 real-world attributes such as authors and categories. We benchmark eleven different FANNS methods on our new dataset to evaluate their performance across different filter types, numbers of retrieved neighbors, dataset scales, and query selectivities. We distill our findings into eight key observations that guide users in selecting the most suitable FANNS method for their specific use cases.</description>

      <title>LUMI: Unsupervised Intent Clustering with Multiple Pseudo-Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14640v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an intuitive, training-free and label-free method for intent clustering in conversational search. Current approaches to short text clustering use LLM-generated pseudo-labels to enrich text representations or to identify similar text pairs for pooling. The limitations are: (1) each text is assigned only a single label, and refining representations toward a single label can be unstable; (2) text-level similarity is treated as a binary selection, which fails to account for continuous degrees of similarity. Our method LUMI is designed to amplify similarities between texts by using shared pseudo-labels. We first generate pseudo-labels for each text and collect them into a pseudo-label set. Next, we compute the mean of the pseudo-label embeddings and pool it with the text embedding. Finally, we perform text-level pooling: Each text representation is pooled with its similar pairs, where similarity is determined by the degree of shared labels. Our evaluation on four benchmark sets shows that our approach achieves competitive results, better than recent state-of-the-art baselines, while avoiding the need to estimate the number of clusters during embedding refinement, as is required by most methods. Our findings indicate that LUMI can effectively be applied in unsupervised short-text clustering scenarios.</description>

      <title>Compression then Matching: An Efficient Pre-training Paradigm for Multimodal Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models advance multimodal representation learning by acquiring transferable semantic embeddings, thereby substantially enhancing performance across a range of vision-language tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, clustering, and classification. An effective embedding is expected to comprehensively preserve the semantic content of the input while simultaneously emphasizing features that are discriminative for downstream tasks. Recent approaches demonstrate that MLLMs can be adapted into competitive embedding models via large-scale contrastive learning, enabling the simultaneous optimization of two complementary objectives. We argue that the two aforementioned objectives can be decoupled: a comprehensive understanding of the input facilitates the embedding model in achieving superior performance in downstream tasks via contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose CoMa, a compressed pre-training phase, which serves as a warm-up stage for contrastive learning. Experiments demonstrate that with only a small amount of pre-training data, we can transform an MLLM into a competitive embedding model. CoMa achieves new state-of-the-art results among MLLMs of comparable size on the MMEB, realizing optimization in both efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>OGD4All: A Framework for Accessible Interaction with Geospatial Open Government Data Based on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present OGD4All, a transparent, auditable, and reproducible framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance citizens' interaction with geospatial Open Government Data (OGD). The system combines semantic data retrieval, agentic reasoning for iterative code generation, and secure sandboxed execution that produces verifiable multimodal outputs. Evaluated on a 199-question benchmark covering both factual and unanswerable questions, across 430 City-of-Zurich datasets and 11 LLMs, OGD4All reaches 98% analytical correctness and 94% recall while reliably rejecting questions unsupported by available data, which minimizes hallucination risks. Statistical robustness tests, as well as expert feedback, show reliability and social relevance. The proposed approach shows how LLMs can provide explainable, multimodal access to public data, advancing trustworthy AI for open governance.</description>
