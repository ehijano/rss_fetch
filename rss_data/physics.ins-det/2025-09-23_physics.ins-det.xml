      <title>Binary Classification of Light and Dark Time Traces of a Transition Edge Sensor Using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Any Light Particle Search II (ALPS II) is a light shining through a wall experiment probing the existence of axions and axion-like particles using a 1064 nm laser source. While ALPS II is already taking data using a heterodyne based detection scheme, cryogenic transition edge sensor (TES) based single-photon detectors are planned to expand the detection system for cross-checking the potential signals, for which a sensitivity on the order of $10^{-24}$ W is required. In order to reach this goal, we have investigated the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) as binary classifiers to distinguish the experimentally measured 1064 nm photon triggered (light) pulses from background (dark) pulses. Despite extensive hyperparameter optimization, the CNN based binary classifier did not outperform our previously optimized cut-based analysis in terms of detection significance. This suggests that the used approach is not generally suitable for background suppression and improving the energy resolution of the TES. We partly attribute this to the training confusion induced by near-1064 nm black-body photon triggers in the background, which we identified as the limiting background source as concluded in our previous works. However, we argue that the problem ultimately lies in the binary classification based approach and believe that regression models would be better suitable for addressing the energy resolution. Unsupervised machine learning models, in particular neural network based autoencoders, should also be considered potential candidates for the suppression of noise in time traces. While the presented results and associated conclusions are obtained for TES designed to be used in the ALPS II experiment, they should hold equivalently well for any device whose output signal can be considered as a univariate time trace.</description>

      <title>Application of X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy with a laboratory X-ray powder diffractometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel method and experimental configuration are proposed that allow the collection of high-quality X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) data in transmission mode on a standard laboratory diffractometer. This configuration makes use of components that have been developed for application in modern laboratory diffractometers, such as X-ray tubes with enhanced stability, accurate goniometers and position-sensitive photon-counting detectors with improved energy resolution. Such approach may extend the application of XAS in materials research, particularly for users of diffraction methods.</description>

      <title>Low-energy nuclear recoil calibration of the LUX-ZEPLIN experiment with a photoneutron source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LZ experiment is a liquid xenon time-projection chamber (TPC) searching for evidence of particle dark matter interactions. In the simplest assumption of elastic scattering, many dark matter models predict an energy spectrum which rises quasi-exponentially with decreasing energy transfer to a target atom. LZ expects to detect coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering of $^{8}$B solar neutrinos, the signal from which is very similar to a dark matter particle with mass of about 5.5 GeV/$c^{2}$, which result in typical nuclear recoil energies of $&lt;$5 keV$_{\text{nr}}$. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to calibrate the response of recoiling xenon nuclei to keV-energy recoils. This analysis details the first in situ photoneutron calibration of the LZ detector and probes its response in this energy regime.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Angular Distribution of Cherenkov Radiation in Thick Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the emission of Cherenkov radiation in thick media, explore the limitations of the simulation tools currently in use in particle and nuclear physics, and propose a method for overcoming these limitations. We start with a derivation of the Cherenkov power spectrum and its angular profile, accounting for interference of the radiation emitted, in contrast with commonly used tools that assume perfect coherence. We then study the impact that the path of electrons through a medium has on the angular profile of Cherenkov light. Finally, we devise a model that can introduce these effects in Geant4 and tune it to explain calibration data from the water-phase of SNO+. We find that the tuned model significantly improves the agreement between data and simulation, so we provide it for its wider use.</description>

      <title>Unity based virtual reality for detector and event visualization in JUNO experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detector and event visualization are crucial components of high-energy physics~(HEP) experimental software. Virtual Reality~(VR) technologies and multimedia development platforms such as Unity offer enhanced display effects and flexible extensibility for visualization in HEP experiments. In this study, we present a VR-based method for detector and event displays in the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory~(JUNO) experiment. This method shares the same detector geometry descriptions and event data model as those in offline software and provides necessary data conversion interfaces. The VR methodology facilitates an immersive exploration of the virtual environment in JUNO, enabling users to investigate detector geometry, visualize event data, and tune the detector simulation and event reconstruction algorithms. Additionally, this approach supports applications in data monitoring, physics data analysis, and public outreach initiatives.</description>

      <title>A high-voltage MR-ToF mass spectrometer and separator for the study of exotic isotopes at FRIB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) delivers a wide variety of rare isotopes as fast, stopped, or reaccelerated beams to enable forefront research in nuclear structure, astrophysics, and fundamental interactions. To expand the scientific potential of FRIB's stopped and reaccelerated beam programs, we are designing a Multi-Reflection Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer and separator (MR-ToF MS). It will enable high-precision mass measurements of short-lived isotopes, improve beam diagnostics, and deliver isobarically and isomerically purified beams to downstream experimental stations. It is designed to store ions at a kinetic energy of 30 keV, significantly enhancing ion throughput while maintaining high mass resolving power. We present the scientific motivation, technical design, and simulations demonstrating the expected performance of the system, which has the potential to significantly enhance FRIB's mass measurement, diagnostic, and mass separation capabilities.</description>

      <title>Gas-jet target with online interferometric thickness measurement for nuclear astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new jet gas target system has been developed for the Felsenkeller 5 MV underground ion accelerator for nuclear astrophysics. It provides either a 1.5$\times10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$ thick cylindrical jet or a 7$\times10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$ thick wall of nitrogen gas, with a surface of 10$\times$10 mm$^2$ to be seen by the ion beam. The system includes a de Laval type nozzle and altogether five pumping stages: In addition to the jet catcher and the jet chamber surrounding it, there are three stages connecting the jet to the ion accelerator. Behind the jet chamber, as seen from the ion beam, a windowless static-type gas target and, subsequently, a beam calorimeter have been installed.
  This work describes the offline tests of the gas target system prior to its installation on the beam line of the Felsenkeller accelerator. The thickness of the jet has been determined using three different methods: By computational fluid dynamics simulations, with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and by $\alpha$-energy loss using a mixed $\alpha$ source. The three methods were shown to be in agreement. For 0-6 bar inlet gas pressure, a linear relationship between inlet pressure and jet thickness has been found. Different shapes of de Laval type inlet nozzles, both circular and slit-type, have been manufactured from fused silica glass or stainless steel and tested using measurements and simulations. The power and stability of the beam calorimeter have been tested. The interferometry has been shown to work reliably and to give two-dimensional projections of the gas jet with sub-mm resolution.</description>

      <title>Radiation damage study of Belle II silicon strip sensors with 90 MeV electron irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The silicon strip sensors of the Belle II silicon vertex detector were irradiated with 90 MeV electron beams up to an equivalent 1-MeV-neutron fluence of $3.0\times 10^{13}~{\rm n}_{\rm eq}/{\rm cm^2}$. We measure changes in sensor properties induced by radiation damage in the semiconductor bulk. Electrons around this energy are a major source of beam-induced background during Belle II operation. We discuss observed changes in full depletion voltage, sensor leakage current, noise, and charge collection. The sensor bulk type inverts at an equivalent 1-MeV-neutron fluence of $6.0\times 10^{12}~{\rm n}_{\rm eq}/{\rm cm^2}$. The leakage current increases proportionally to the radiation dose. We determine a damage constant of $3.9 \times 10^{-17}$ A/cm at 17 C$^\circ$ immediately after irradiation, which drops significantly to approximately 40% of the initial value in 200 hours, then stabilizes to approximately 30% of the initial value in 1000 hours. We measure sensor noise and signal charge for a sensor irradiated with the equivalent 1-MeV-neutron fluence of $3.0\times 10^{13}~{\rm n}_{\rm eq}/{\rm cm^2}$. Noise increases by approximately 44% after irradiation, while signal charge does not change significantly when a sufficiently high bias voltage is applied.</description>

      <title>Performance of a Large-Volume Cryogenic Pure CsI Detector for CE{\nu}NS and Low-Energy Rare-Event Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cryogenic detector system based on two 3.3 kg high-purity CsI crystals was developed and characterized at approximately 95 K. Each wedge-shaped crystal was coupled to dual-ended 3-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) for scintillation readout. The measured light yields were $28.7 \pm 0.9$ and $29.3 \pm 1.0$ photoelectrons per keV electron-equivalent (PE/keV$_{ee}$) for the two crystals, with corresponding energy resolutions of 7.2 \% and 7.7 \% (FWHM) at 59.6 keV. The detector demonstrated excellent spatial uniformity, low intrinsic radioactivity, and stable operation over a continuous one-month period. Optical photon simulations using Geant4 reproduced the observed light collection trends, providing guidance for detector optimization. These results establish cryogenic pure CsI as a scalable technology for low-threshold rare-event searches.</description>

      <title>From real-time calibrations to smart HV tuning for FAIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time data processing of the next generation of experiments at FAIR requires reliable event reconstruction and thus depends heavily on in-situ calibration procedures. Previously, we developed a neural-network-based approach that predicts calibration parameters from continuously available environmental and operational data and validated it on the HADES Multiwire Drift Chambers (MDCs), achieving fast predictions as accurate as offline calibrations. In this work, we introduce several methodological improvements that enhance both accuracy and the ability to adapt to new data. These include changes to the input features, better offline calibration and trainable normalizations. Furthermore, by combining beam-time and cosmic-ray datasets, we demonstrate that the learned dependencies can be transferred between very different data-taking scenarios. This enables the network not only to provide real-time calibration predictions, but also to infer optimal high-voltage settings, thus establishing a practical framework for a real-time detector control during data acquisition process.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Electromagnetic Calorimeter Module: Enhanced Performance through Integration of Silicon Pixel Layer into Scintillator Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study constructs a hybrid module with a multi-material collaborative detection architecture by integrating silicon pixel layers into the longitudinally segmented scintillating fiber sampling calorimeter module and optimizes the placement of the silicon layers. The module utilizes the pre-shower characteristics of the front-end scintillator units to ensure sufficient energy deposition in the silicon pixel layers, thereby maintaining its high-precision detection capability. A dedicated simulation framework combining Geant4 modeling for the scintillator section and a parameterized approach for the silicon pixel layer is employed for module verification and performance study. The hybrid module demonstrates overall performance enhancement. The maximum achievable improvements are 56\% for position resolution and 26\% for time resolution, respectively. These advancements also lead to significant increase of physics sensitivity, especially for physics channels with low-energy photons, for instance, a 16\% boost in signal significance for $D^{*0}$ from the $B^-\rightarrow D^{*0}(\rightarrow D^0 \gamma)\pi^-$ decay</description>

      <title>Towards a Robust Machine-Learning Pipeline for 21-cm Cosmology Data Analysis I: A Roadmap for Development and Demonstration of Robustness Against PSF Modeling Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16280</link>

Abstract: The 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is a powerful probe of the evolution of the Universe. However, accurate measurements of the EoR signal from radio interferometric observations are sensitive to efficient foreground removal, mitigating radio-frequency interference and accounting for instrumental systematics. This work represents the first in a series of papers, where we will be introducing a novel ML based pipeline, step-by-step, to directly infer reionization parameters from 21-cm radio-interferometric images. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the variations in the point spread function (PSF) on parameter estimation by simulating visibilities corresponding to input 21-cm maps as observed by the 128-antenna configuration of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) Phase II. These visibilities are imaged to obtain dirty images, which are then used to train a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict $\rm x_{HI}$. To systematically assess the effect of PSF mis-modelling, we generate multiple test sets by varying the MWA's antenna layout, thereby introducing controlled variations in the PSF; we then feed these alternative PSF dirty images to our CNN trained using only dirty images with the PSF of the true antenna layout. Our results demonstrate that PSF variations introduce biases in the CNN's predictions of $\rm x_{HI}$, with errors depending on the extent of PSF distortion. We quantify these biases and discuss their implications for the reliability of machine-learning-based parameter inference in 21-cm cosmology and how they can be utilized to improve the robustness of estimation against PSF-related systematics in future 21-cm surveys. In concluding, we also discuss how this approach to incorporating realistic instrument error into an ML analysis pipeline can be expanded to include multiple other effects.</description>

      <title>From Coated to Uncoated: Scanning Electron Microscopy Corrections to Estimate True Surface Pore Size in Nanoporous Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is the premier method for characterizing the nanoscale surface pores in ultrafiltration (UF) membranes and the support layers of reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Based on SEM, the conventional understanding is that membranes typically have low surface porosities of &lt;10%. We hypothesized that high acceleration voltage during SEM imaging and sputter metal coatings required for SEM have led to systematic underestimations of porosity and pore size. We showed that imaging a commercial UF membrane at 1, 5, and 10 kV reduced measured porosity from 10.3% (1 kV) to 6.3% (10 kV), while increasing Pt coating thickness from 1.5 to 5 nm lowered porosity by 54% for the UF membrane (12.9% to 5.8%) and 46% for an RO support (13.1% to 7.0%). To account for coating thickness, we developed a digital correction method that simulates pore dilation, enabling the pore structure to be estimated for uncoated membranes. Dilation yielded uncoated porosity values of 23% for the UF membrane and 20% for the RO support, about 3-fold greater than values observed with a 4 nm coating. Mean pore diameters were 2-fold greater for the UF membrane and 1.5-fold greater for the RO support. Critically, dilation-derived pore-size distributions agreed with low-flux dextran-retention data fitted with the Bungay-Brenner model. Our results suggest that surface porosities and pore sizes of nanoporous membranes are much larger than previously understood, with major implications for structure/transport relationships. For future nanoscale pore analysis of membranes (and other nanoporous materials), we recommend low acceleration voltage (1 kV), minimal coatings (1-2 nm), and digital dilation to account for coating artifacts</description>

      <title>Dark counts in optical superconducting transition-edge sensors for rare-event searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03073v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting transition-edge sensors (TESs) are a type of quantum sensor known for its high single-photon detection efficiency and low background. This makes them ideal for particle physics experiments searching for rare events. In this work, we present a comprehensive characterization of the background in optical TESs, distinguishing three types of events: electrical-noise, high-energy, and photonlike events. We introduce computational methods to automate the classification of events. For the first time, we experimentally verify and simulate the source of the high-energy events. We also isolate the photonlike events, the expected signal in dielectric haloscopes searching for dark matter dark photons, and achieve a record-low photonlike dark-count rate of $3.6 \times 10^{-4}$ Hz in the 0.8-3.2 eV energy range.</description>

      <title>AC-LGADs Fermilab Front-End Electronics Characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterized the front-end electronics used to process high-frequency signals from low-gain avalanche diodes (LGADs) at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility. LGADs are silicon detectors employed for charged particle tracking, offering exceptional spatial and temporal resolution. The purpose of this characterization was to understand how the time resolution is influenced by the front-end electronics. To achieve this, we developed a setup capable of generating input signals with varying amplitudes. The output results demonstrated that signal processing by the front-end electronics plays a crucial role in enhancing time resolution. We showed that the time resolution achieved by the FEE board is better than $2\: ps$ at the $1\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>Studies of simulation framework for N{\nu}DEx experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13582</link>

Abstract: The N$\nu$DEx experiment aims to search for the neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{82}$Se using a high-pressure $^{82}$SeF$_6$ gas time projection chamber (TPC). Under the assumption of two kinds of charge carriers would be formed, the difference in drift velocities between these ion species enables trigger-less event reconstruction and offers the potential for excellent energy resolution through direct charge collection.
  In this study, we present a simulation framework for the N$\nu$DEx ion TPC. The reduced mobilities of SeF$_5^-$ and SeF$_6^-$ ions in SeF$_6$ were calculated using density functional theory and two-temperature theory, yielding values of $0.444 \pm 0.133$ and $0.430 \pm 0.129$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, respectively.
  The TPC geometry, featuring a cathode-focusing plane-anode structure and an 10,000-pixel readout array, was modeled with COMSOL to calculate the electric and weighting fields. Signal and background events were generated using BxDecay0 and Geant4. Garfield++ was used to simulate the transport of charge carriers and signal induction. The induced current was convolved with the transfer function to produce voltage signals, which were subsequently used to extract energy through amplitude. The 3D tracks are also reconstructed based on drift time differences and Breadth First search.
  To enhance signal background separation, six topological variables were extracted from the reconstructed tracks and used to define optimized selection criteria. The Boosted Decision Trees is used for a preliminary analysis. This simulation framework serves as a crucial tool for design optimization and sensitivity studies in the N$\nu$DEx experiment.</description>

      <title>Rapid muon tomography for border security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01525v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray muon tomography is a promising technique for border security applications, leveraging highly penetrating cosmic-ray muons and their interactions with various materials to generate 3D images of large and dense objects, such as shipping containers. Using scattering and absorption of muons as they pass through dense cargo materials, muon tomography provides a viable solution for customs and border security by enabling the verification of shipping container declarations and preventing illegal trafficking. In this study, we utilized Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of muon tomography for cargo characterization and contraband detection in various smuggling scenarios. Our results demonstrate that muon tomography can offers a novel approach to cargo inspection, moving beyond traditional 3D image reconstruction. Instead, it analyzes muon scattering and absorption rates in real time during scanning, enabling the prompt detection of discrepancies between actual cargo contents and declared goods within just 10 to 20 seconds. This method is particularly effective for cargo consisting of uniform loads composed of a single material or product, a common practice in shipping. Unlike traditional X-ray radiography, which analyzes detailed 2D images, muon tomography begins evaluating scatter-absorption rates within the first few seconds of scanning. This early assessment enables cargo evaluation long before a statistically reliable 3D image is formed, significantly improving scanning throughput without disrupting trade flow.</description>

      <title>Novel coincidence detection technique for precision measurement of neutron-capture-induced nuclear recoils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lattice dynamics following particle interactions remain not fully understood, and effects from nuclear-recoil interactions in conventional solid-state detectors - such as defect formation - can hinder accurate event-energy interpretation. Neutron capture $(n,\gamma)$ can produce detectable, precise-energy nuclear recoils for detector calibration and solid-state physics studies. This paper proposes a first-of-its-kind experiment to measure the twin products of neutron capture - the postcapture deexcitation gamma and postcapture nuclear recoil. Simulations show that with a 1 mCi californium neutron source, a positive measurement with existing detector technologies is possible in 26.1 gram-days of exposure.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Relativistic Time Scales for Cislunar Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified post-Newtonian framework for relativistic timing and coordinate transformations covering six time scales (TCB, TCG, TT, TDB, TCL, TL) and three reference systems (BCRS, GCRS, LCRS). Extending the IAU conventions, we define a Lunicentric Celestial Reference System (LCRS) metric that retains all contributions above a fractional threshold of 5 x 10^{-18} and timing terms above 0.1 ps by expanding the lunar gravity field to spherical-harmonic degree l=9 with Love number variations and including external tidal and inertial multipoles to the octupole. We derive closed-form mappings among TCB, TCG, TT, TCL and TL, yielding proper-to-coordinate time transformations and two-way time-transfer corrections at sub-picosecond accuracy. We evaluate secular rate constants and periodic perturbations arising from kinematic dilation, lunar monopole and multipoles, Earth tides and gravitomagnetic effects for clocks on the lunar surface, in very low and low lunar orbits (vLLO/LLO), in elliptical lunar frozen orbits (ELFOs), at the Earth-Moon L1 point, and in near-rectilinear halo orbits (NRHOs). Our analysis demonstrates that harmonics through l=9 and tides through l=8 are sufficient to achieve 5 x 10^{-18} fractional stability for deep cislunar regimes (e.g., NRHO, Earth-Moon L1), supporting sub-picosecond clock synchronization and centimeter-level navigation; near-surface and vLLO realizations generally require a much higher spherical-harmonic degree, l_max &gt;= 300, to meet the same stability goal. This framework underpins high-precision time and frequency transfer, relativistic geodesy, quantum communication links and fundamental physics experiments beyond low Earth orbit.</description>
