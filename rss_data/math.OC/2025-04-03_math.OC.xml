      <title>Geometric Programming for 3D Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the soaring demand for high-performing integrated circuits, 3D integrated circuits (ICs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional planar structures. Unlike existing 3D ICs that stack 2D layers, a full 3D IC features cubic circuit elements unrestricted by layers, offering greater design freedom. Design problems such as floorplanning, transistor sizing, and interconnect sizing are highly complex due to the 3D nature of the circuits and unavoidably require systematic approaches. We introduce geometric programming to solve these design optimization problems systematically and efficiently.</description>

      <title>DeepONet of dynamic event-triggered backstepping boundary control for reaction-diffusion PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an event-triggered boundary control scheme for a class of reaction-diffusion PDEs using operator learning and backstepping method. Our first-of-its-kind contribution aims at learning the backstepping kernels, which inherently induces the learning of the gains in the event trigger and the control law. The kernel functions in constructing the control law are approximated with neural operators (NOs) to improve the computational efficiency. Then, a dynamic event-triggering mechanism is designed, based on the plant and the continuous-in-time control law using kernels given by NOs,to determine the updating times of the actuation signal. In the resulting event-based closed-loop system, a strictly positive lower bound of the minimal dwell time is found, which is independent of initial conditions. As a result, the absence of a Zeno behavior is guaranteed. Besides, exponential convergence to zero of the L_2 norm of the reaction-diffusion PDE state and the dynamic variable in the event-triggering mechanism is proved via Lyapunov analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Extremum Seeking with High-Order Lie Bracket Approximations: Achieving Exponential Decay Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the further development of the Lie bracket approximation approach for extremum seeking systems. Classical results in this area provide extremum seeking algorithms with exponential convergence rates for quadratic-like cost functions, and polynomial decay rates for cost functions of higher degrees. This paper proposes a novel control design approach that ensures the motion of the extremum seeking system along directions associated with higher-order Lie brackets, thereby ensuring exponential convergence for cost functions that are polynomial-like but with degree greater than two.</description>

      <title>An accelerated randomized Bregman-Kaczmarz method for strongly convex linearly constraint optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a randomized accelerated method for the minimization of a strongly convex function under linear constraints. The method is of Kaczmarz-type, i.e. it only uses a single linear equation in each iteration. To obtain acceleration we build on the fact that the Kaczmarz method is dual to a coordinate descent method. We use a recently proposed acceleration method for the randomized coordinate descent and transfer it to the primal space. This method inherits many of the attractive features of the accelerated coordinate descent method, including its worst-case convergence rates. A theoretical analysis of the convergence of the proposed method is given. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method is more efficient and faster than the existing methods for solving the same problem.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to Motion Planning in 3D for a Dubins Vehicle: Special Case on a Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, a new approach for 3D motion planning, applicable to aerial vehicles, is proposed to connect an initial and final configuration subject to pitch rate and yaw rate constraints. The motion planning problem for a curvature-constrained vehicle over the surface of a sphere is identified as an intermediary problem to be solved, and it is the focus of this paper. In this article, the optimal path candidates for a vehicle with a minimum turning radius $r$ moving over a unit sphere are derived using a phase portrait approach. We show that the optimal path is $CGC$ or concatenations of $C$ segments through simple proofs, where $C = L, R$ denotes a turn of radius $r$ and $G$ denotes a great circular arc. We generalize the previous result of optimal paths being $CGC$ and $CCC$ paths for $r \in \left(0, \frac{1}{2} \right]\bigcup\{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\}$ to $r \leq \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ to account for vehicles with a larger $r$. We show that the optimal path is $CGC, CCCC,$ for $r \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},$ and $CGC, CC_\pi C, CCCCC$ for $r \leq \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.$ Additionally, we analytically construct all candidate paths and provide the code in a publicly accessible repository.</description>

      <title>A Control Barrier Function Approach to Constrained Resource Allocation Problems in a Maximum Entropy Principle Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to solve capacitated facility location problems (FLP) that encompass various resource allocation problems. FLPs are a class of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, involving optimal placement and assignment of a small number of facilities over a large number of demand points, with each facility subject to upper and lower bounds on its resource utilization (e.g., the number of demand points it can serve). To address the challenges posed by inequality constraints and the combinatorial nature of the solution space, we reformulate the problem as a dynamic control design problem, enabling structured constraint handling and enhanced solution efficiency. Our method integrates a Control Barrier Function (CBF) and Control Lyapunov Function (CLF)-based framework with a maximum-entropy principle-based framework to ensure feasibility, optimality, and improved exploration of solutions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances computational efficiency, yielding better solutions and showing negligible growth in computation time with problem size as compared to existing solvers. These results highlight the potential of control-theoretic and entropy-based methods for large-scale facility location problems.</description>

      <title>Multi-convex Programming for Discrete Latent Factor Models Prototyping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete latent factor models (DLFMs) are widely used in various domains such as machine learning, economics, neuroscience, psychology, etc. Currently, fitting a DLFM to some dataset relies on a customized solver for individual models, which requires lots of effort to implement and is limited to the targeted specific instance of DLFMs. In this paper, we propose a generic framework based on CVXPY, which allows users to specify and solve the fitting problem of a wide range of DLFMs, including both regression and classification models, within a very short script. Our framework is flexible and inherently supports the integration of regularization terms and constraints on the DLFM parameters and latent factors, such that the users can easily prototype the DLFM structure according to their dataset and application scenario. We introduce our open-source Python implementation and illustrate the framework in several examples.</description>

      <title>Dual first-order methods for efficient computation of convex hull prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convex Hull (CH) pricing, used in US electricity markets and raising interest in Europe, is a pricing rule designed to handle markets with non-convexities such as startup costs and minimum up and down times. In such markets, the market operator makes side payments to generators to cover lost opportunity costs, and CH prices minimize the total "lost opportunity costs", which include both actual losses and missed profit opportunities. These prices can also be obtained by solving a (partial) Lagrangian dual of the original mixed-integer program, where power balance constraints are dualized. Computing CH prices then amounts to minimizing a sum of nonsmooth convex objective functions, where each term depends only on a single generator. The subgradient of each of those terms can be obtained independently by solving smaller mixed-integer programs. In this work, we benchmark a large panel of first-order methods to solve the above dual CH pricing problem. We test several dual methods, most of which not previously considered for CH pricing, namely a proximal variant of the bundle level method, subgradient methods with three different stepsize strategies, two recent parameter-free methods and an accelerated gradient method combined with smoothing. We compare those methods on two representative sets of real-world large-scale instances and complement the comparison with a (Dantzig-Wolfe) primal column generation method shown to be efficient at computing CH prices, for reference. Our numerical experiments show that the bundle proximal level method and two variants of the subgradient method perform the best among all dual methods and compare favorably with the Dantzig-Wolfe primal method.</description>

      <title>A microscopic traffic flow model on network with destination-aware V2V communications and rational decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we carry out a computational study of a novel microscopic follow-the-leader model for traffic flow on road networks. We assume that each driver has its own origin and destination, and wants to complete its journey in minimal time. We also assume that each driver is able to take rational decisions at junctions and can change route while moving depending on the traffic conditions. The main novelty of the model is that vehicles can automatically and anonymously share information about their position, destination, and planned path when they are close to each other within a certain distance. The pieces of information acquired during the journey are used to optimize the route itself. In the limit case of a infinite communication range, we recover the classical Reactive User Equilibrium and Dynamic User Equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Acceleration via Perturbations on Low-resolution Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the high-resolution ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework, which retains higher-order terms, has been proposed to analyze gradient-based optimization algorithms. Through this framework, the term $\nabla^2 f(X_t)\dot{X_t}$, known as the gradient-correction term, was found to be essential for reducing oscillations and accelerating the convergence rate of function values. Despite the importance of this term, simply adding it to the low-resolution ODE may sometimes lead to a slower convergence rate. To fully understand this phenomenon, we propose a generalized perturbed ODE and analyze the role of the gradient and gradient-correction perturbation terms under both continuous-time and discrete-time settings. We demonstrate that while the gradient-correction perturbation is essential for obtaining accelerations, it can hinder the convergence rate of function values in certain cases. However, this adverse effect can be mitigated by involving an additional gradient perturbation term. Moreover, by conducting a comprehensive analysis, we derive proper choices of perturbation parameters. Numerical experiments are also provided to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Numerical techniques for geodesic approximation in Riemaniann shape optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shape optimization is commonly applied in engineering to optimize shapes with respect to an objective functional relying on PDE solutions. In this paper, we view shape optimization as optimization on Riemannian shape manifolds. We consider so-called outer metrics on the diffeomorphism group to solve PDE-constrained shape optimization problems efficiently. Commonly, the numerical solution of such problems relies on the Riemannian version of the steepest descent method. One key difference between this version and the standard method is that iterates are updated via geodesics or retractions. Due to the lack of explicit expressions for geodesics, for most of the previously proposed metrics, very limited progress has been made in this direction. Leveraging the existence of explicit expressions for the geodesic equations associated to the outer metrics on the diffeomorphism group, we aim to study the viability of using such equations in the context of PDE-constrained shape optimization. However, solving geodesic equations is computationally challenging and often restrictive. Therefore, this paper discusses potential numerical approaches to simplify the numerical burden of using geodesics, making the proposed method computationally competitive with previously established methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Copositive matrices and copositive polynomials are objects from optimization. We connect these to the geometry of Feynman integrals in physics. The integral is guaranteed to converge if its kinematic parameters lie in the copositive cone. P\'olya's method makes this manifest. We study the copositive cone for the second Symanzik polynomial of any Feynman graph. Its algebraic boundary is described by Landau discriminants.</description>

      <title>Second-order cone programming for distributionally robust compliance optimization of trusses considering input distribution uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) is a methodology for designing structures under the consideration for uncertainty with the assumption that the input distribution is completely known. In practical engineering, the number of input data is often limited, which can damage the validity of the optimal results obtained by RBDO. Confidence-based design optimization (CBDO) has been proposed to account for the uncertainty of the input distribution. However, this approach faces challenges, computational cost and accuracy when dealing with highly nonlinear performance constraints. In this paper, we consider the compliance minimization problem of truss structures with uncertain external forces. Armed with the advanced risk measure, conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), we formulate a bi-objective optimization problem for the worst-case expected value and the worst-case CVaR of compliance, which allows us to account for the tail risk of performance functions not addressed in CBDO. Employing kernel density estimation for estimation of the input distribution allows us to eliminate the need for modeling the input distribution. We show that this problem reduces to a second-order cone programming when assigning either uniform kernel or triangular kernel. Finally, through numerical experiments, we obtain the Pareto front for the bi-objective optimization problem of the worst-case expected value and CVaR of compliance of truss structures, and confirm the changes in the Pareto solutions.</description>

      <title>A Randomized Zeroth-Order Hierarchical Framework for Heterogeneous Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneity in federated learning (FL) is a critical and challenging aspect that significantly impacts model performance and convergence. In this paper, we propose a novel framework by formulating heterogeneous FL as a hierarchical optimization problem. This new framework captures both local and global training process through a bilevel formulation and is capable of the following: (i) addressing client heterogeneity through a personalized learning framework; (ii) capturing pre-training process on server's side; (iii) updating global model through nonstandard aggregation; (iv) allowing for nonidentical local steps; and (v) capturing clients' local constraints. We design and analyze an implicit zeroth-order FL method (ZO-HFL), provided with nonasymptotic convergence guarantees for both the server-agent and the individual client-agents, and asymptotic guarantees for both the server-agent and client-agents in an almost sure sense. Notably, our method does not rely on standard assumptions in heterogeneous FL, such as the bounded gradient dissimilarity condition. We implement our method on image classification tasks and compare with other methods under different heterogeneous settings.</description>

      <title>LQR based $\omega-$stabilization of a heat equation with memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a heat equation with memory which is defined on a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and is driven by $m$ control inputs acting on the interior of the domain. Our objective is to numerically construct a state feedback controller for this equation such that, for each initial state, the solution of the closed-loop system decays exponentially to zero with a decay rate larger than a given rate $\omega&gt;0$, i.e. we want to solve the $\omega$-stabilization problem for the heat equation with memory. We first show that the spectrum of the state operator $A$ associated with this equation has an accumulation point at $-\omega_0&lt;0$. Given a $\omega\in(0,\omega_0)$, we show that the $\omega$-stabilization problem for the heat equation with memory is solvable provided certain verifiable conditions on the control operator $B$ associated with this equation hold. We then consider an appropriate LQR problem for the heat equation with memory. For each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, we construct finite-dimensional approximations $A_n$ and $B_n$ of $A$ and $B$, respectively, and then show that by solving a corresponding approximation of the LQR problem a feedback operator $K_n$ can be computed such that all the eigenvalues of $A_n + B_n K_n$ have real part less than $-\omega$. We prove that $K_n$ for $n$ sufficiently large solves the $\omega$-stabilization problem for the heat equation with memory. A crucial and nontrivial step in our proof is establishing the uniform (in $n$) stabilizability of the pair $(A_n+\omega I, B_n)$. We have validated our theoretical results numerically using two examples: an 1D example on a unit interval and a 2D example on a square domain.</description>

      <title>Incompressible Optimal Transport and Applications in Fluid Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of incompressible fluid mixing arises in numerous engineering applications and has been well-studied over the years, yet many open questions remain. This paper aims to address the question "what do efficient flow fields for mixing look like, and how do they behave?" We approach this question by developing a framework which is inspired by the dynamic and geometric approach to optimal mass transport. Specifically, we formulate the fluid mixing problem as an optimal control problem where the dynamics are given by the continuity equation together with an incompressibility constraint. We show that within this framework, the set of reachable fluid configurations can formally be endowed with the structure of an infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifold, with a metric which is induced by the control effort, and that flow fields which are maximally efficient at mixing correspond to geodesics in this Riemannian space.</description>

      <title>How to Maximize Efficiency in Systems with Exhausted Workers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of assigning tasks efficiently to a set of workers that can exhaust themselves as a result of processing tasks. If a worker is exhausted, it will take a longer time to recover. To model efficiency of workers with exhaustion, we use a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). By taking samples from the internal states of the workers, the source assigns tasks to the workers when they are found to be in their efficient states. We consider two different settings where (i) the source can assign tasks to the workers only when they are in their most efficient state, and (ii) it can assign tasks to workers when they are also moderately efficient in spite of a potentially reduced success probability. In the former case, we find the optimal policy to be a threshold-based sampling policy where the thresholds depend on the workers' recovery and exhaustion rates. In the latter case, we solve a non-convex sum-of-ratios problem using a branch-and-bound approach which performs well compared with the globally optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of an Interconnected SDE -Parabolic PDE System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we design a controller for an interconnected system where a linear Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) is actuated through a linear parabolic heat equation. These dynamics arise in various applications, such as coupled heat transfer systems and chemical reaction processes that are subject to disturbances. Our goal is to develop a computational method for approximating the controller that minimizes a quadratic cost associated with the state of the SDE component. To achieve this, we first perform a change of variables to shift the actuation inside the PDE domain and reformulate the system as a linear Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE). We use a spectral approximation of the Laplacian operator to discretize the coupled dynamics into a finite-dimensional SDE and compute the optimal control for this approximated system. The resulting control serves as an approximation of the optimal control for the original system. We then establish the convergence of the approximated optimal control and the corresponding closed-loop dynamics to their infinite-dimensional counterparts. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Generalized Assignment and Knapsack Problems in the Random-Order Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study different online optimization problems in the random-order model. There is a finite set of bins with known capacity and a finite set of items arriving in a random order. Upon arrival of an item, its size and its value for each of the bins is revealed and it has to be decided immediately and irrevocably to which bin the item is assigned, or to not assign the item at all. In this setting, an algorithm is $\alpha$-competitive if the total value of all items assigned to the bins is at least an $\alpha$-fraction of the total value of an optimal assignment that knows all items beforehand. We give an algorithm that is $\alpha$-competitive with $\alpha = (1-\ln(2))/2 \approx 1/6.52$ improving upon the previous best algorithm with $\alpha \approx 1/6.99$ for the generalized assignment problem and the previous best algorithm with $\alpha \approx 1/6.65$ for the integral knapsack problem. We then study the fractional knapsack problem where we have a single bin and it is also allowed to pack items fractionally. For that case, we obtain an algorithm that is $\alpha$-competitive with $\alpha = 1/e \approx 1/2.71$ improving on the previous best algorithm with $\alpha = 1/4.39$. We further show that this competitive ratio is the best-possible for deterministic algorithms in this model.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Bandwidth and Bode Diagrams based on Scaled Relative Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaled Relative Graphs (SRGs) provide a novel graphical frequency domain method for the analysis of nonlinear systems. In this paper, we use the restriction of the SRG to particular input spaces to compute frequency-dependent gain bounds for incrementally stable nonlinear systems. This leads to a nonlinear (NL) generalization of the Bode diagram, where the sinusoidal, harmonic, and subharmonic inputs are considered separately. When applied to the analysis of the NL loop transfer and sensitivity, we define a notion of bandwidth for both the open-loop and closed-loop, compatible with the LTI definitions. We illustrate the power of our method on the analysis of a DC motor with a parasitic nonlinearity, verifying our results in simulations.</description>

      <title>A two-player voting game in Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite set $S$ of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, which we regard as the locations of voters on a $d$-dimensional political `spectrum', two candidates (Alice and Bob) select one point in $\mathbb{R}^d$ each, in an attempt to get as many votes as possible. Alice goes first and Bob goes second, and then each voter simply votes for the candidate closer to them in terms of Euclidean distance. If a voter's distance from the two candidates is the same, they vote for nobody. We give a geometric characterization of the sets $S$ for which each candidate wins, assuming that Alice wins if they get an equal number of votes. We also show that, if not all the voters lie on a single line, then, whenever Alice has a winning strategy, there is a unique winning point for her. We also provide an algorithm which decides whether Alice has a winning point, and determines the location of that point, both in finite (in fact polynomial) time.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Proximal Inexact Gradient Framework and Its Application to Per-Antenna Constrained Joint Beamforming and Compression Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an adaptive proximal inexact gradient (APIG) framework for solving a class of nonsmooth composite optimization problems involving function and gradient errors. Unlike existing inexact proximal gradient methods, the proposed framework introduces a new line search condition that jointly adapts to function and gradient errors, enabling adaptive stepsize selection while maintaining theoretical guarantees. Specifically, we prove that the proposed framework achieves an $\epsilon$-stationary point within $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations for nonconvex objectives and an $\epsilon$-optimal solution within $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ iterations for convex cases, matching the best-known complexity in this context. We then custom-apply the APIG framework to an important signal processing problem: the joint beamforming and compression problem (JBCP) with per-antenna power constraints (PAPCs) in cooperative cellular networks. This customized application requires careful exploitation of the problem's special structure such as the tightness of the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and the differentiability of the dual. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our custom-application over state-of-the-art benchmarks for the JBCP.</description>

      <title>Non-collocated vibration absorption using delayed resonator for spectral and spacial tuning -- analysis and experimental validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-collocated vibration absorption (NCVA) concept using delayed resonator for in-situ tuning is analyzed and experimentally validated. There are two critical contributions of this work. One is on the scalable analytical pathway for verifying the concept of resonant substructure as the basis of the ideal vibration absorption. The second is to experimentally validate the spatial and spectral tunability of NCVA structures for the first time. For both novelties arbitrarily large dimensions of interconnected mass-spring-damper chains are considered. Following the state of the art on NCVA, control synthesis is performed over the resonant substructure comprising the delayed resonator and a part of the primary structure involved in the vibration absorption. The experimental validation of the proposed NCVA concept is performed on a mechatronic setup with three interconnected cart-bodies. Based on the spectral analysis, an excitation frequency is selected for which a stable vibration suppression can be achieved sequentially for all the three bodies, one collocated and two non-collocated. The experimental results closely match the simulations for complete vibration suppression at the targeted bodies, and thus validating the crucial spatial tunability characteristic as well as the traditional spectral tuning.</description>

      <title>Semidefinite lower bounds for covering codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K_q(n,r)$ denote the minimum size of a $q$-ary covering code of word length $n$ and covering radius $r$. In other words, $K_q(n,r)$ is the minimum size of a set of $q$-ary codewords of length $n$ such that the Hamming balls of radius $r$ around the codewords cover the Hamming space $\{0,\ldots,q-1\}^n$. The special case $K_3(n,1)$ is often referred to as the football pool problem, as it is equivalent to finding a set of forecasts on $n$ football matches that is guaranteed to contain a forecast with at most one wrong outcome.
  In this paper, we build and expand upon the work of Gijswijt (2005), who introduced a semidefinite programming lower bound on $K_q(n,r)$ via matrix cuts. We develop techniques that strengthen this bound, by introducing new semidefinite constraints inspired by Lasserre's hierarchy for 0-1 programs and symmetry reduction methods, and a more powerful objective function. The techniques lead to sharper lower bounds, setting new records across a broad range of values of $q$, $n$, and $r$.</description>

      <title>A unifying view on the irreversible investment exercise boundary in a stochastic, time-inhomogeneous capacity expansion problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09878v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper devises a way to apply the Bank and El Karoui Representation Theorem to find the investment boundary of a rich stochastic, continuous time capacity expansion problem with irreversible investment on the finite time interval $[0, T]$, despite the presence of a state dependent scrap value associated with the production facility at the terminal time $T$. Standard variational methods are not feasible for the proposed singular stochastic control problem but it admits some first order conditions, complicated however by an extra, non integral term involving the scrap value function and depending on the initial capacity $y$, which are solved by devising a way to apply the Representation Theorem. Such devise, new and of interest in its own right, provides the existence of the base capacity $l^{\star}_y(t)$, a positive level which the optimal investment process is shown to become active at. As far as we know the Representation Theorem has never been applied to this extent. In the special case of deterministic coefficients, under a further assumption specific to the scrap value case, a unifying view on the curve at which it is optimal to invest emerges: the base capacity equals the investment boundary ${\hat y}(t)$ obtained by variational methods.</description>

      <title>Equitably allocating wildfire resilience investments for power grids: The curse of aggregation and vulnerability indices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11520v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social vulnerability indices have increased traction for guiding infrastructure investment decisions to prioritize communities that need these investments most. One such plan is the Biden-Harris Justice40 initiative, which aims to guide equitable infrastructure investments by ensuring that disadvantaged communities defined by the Climate &amp; Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) receive 40% of the total benefit realized by the investment. However, there is limited research on the practicality of applying vulnerability indices like the CEJST to real-world decision-making for policy outcomes. In this paper, we study this gap by examining the effectiveness of vulnerability indices in a case study focused on power shutoff and undergrounding decisions in wildfire-prone regions. Using a mixed-integer program and a high-fidelity synthetic transmission network in Texas, we model resource allocation policies inspired by Justice40 and evaluate their impact on reducing power outages and mitigating wildfire risk for vulnerable groups. Our analysis reveals that the Justice40 framework may fail to protect certain communities facing high wildfire risk. In our case study, we show that indigenous groups are particularly impacted. We posit that this outcome is likely due to information losses from data aggregation and the use of generalized vulnerability indices. Through the use of explicit group-level protections, we are able to bound the best possible outcome for population groups that are proportionally most affected.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on multi-agent stochastic differential games for jump-diffusion systems. On one hand, we study the multi-agent game for optimal investment in a jump-diffusion market. We derive constant Nash equilibria and provide sufficient conditions for their existence and uniqueness for exponential, power, and logarithmic utilities, respectively. On the other hand, we introduce a computational framework based on the actor-critic method in deep reinforcement learning to solve the stochastic control problem with jumps. We extend this algorithm to address the multi-agent game with jumps and utilize parallel computing to enhance computational efficiency. We present numerical examples of the Merton problem with jumps, linear quadratic regulators, and the optimal investment game under various settings to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed method. In particular, neural network solutions numerically converge to the derived constant Nash equilibrium for the multi-agent game.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21863v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the invariance of observability for the observed backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with constant coefficients, relative to the filtered probability space. This signifies that the observability of these observed BSDEs with constant coefficients remains unaffected by the selection of the filtered probability space. As an illustrative application, we demonstrate that for stochastic control systems with constant coefficients, weak observability, approximate null controllability with cost, and stabilizability are equivalent across some or any filtered probability spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven inverse optimization seeks to estimate unknown parameters in an optimization model from observations of optimization solutions. Many existing methods are ineffective in handling noisy and suboptimal solution observations and also suffer from computational challenges. In this paper, we build a connection between inverse optimization and the Fenchel-Young (FY) loss originally designed for structured prediction, proposing a FY loss approach to data-driven inverse optimization. This new approach is amenable to efficient gradient-based optimization, hence much more efficient than existing methods. We provide theoretical guarantees for the proposed method and use extensive simulation and real-data experiments to demonstrate its significant advantage in parameter estimation accuracy, decision error and computational speed.</description>

      <title>Are Convex Optimization Curves Convex?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study when we might expect the optimization curve induced by gradient descent to be \emph{convex} -- precluding, for example, an initial plateau followed by a sharp decrease, making it difficult to decide when optimization should stop. Although such undesirable behavior can certainly occur when optimizing general functions, might it also occur in the benign and well-studied case of smooth convex functions? As far as we know, this question has not been tackled in previous work. We show, perhaps surprisingly, that the answer crucially depends on the choice of the step size. In particular, for the range of step sizes which are known to result in monotonic convergence to an optimal value, we characterize a regime where the optimization curve will be provably convex, and a regime where the curve can be non-convex. We also extend our results to gradient flow, and to the closely-related but different question of whether the gradient norm decreases monotonically.</description>

      <title>Stability of Schr\"odinger bridges and Sinkhorn semigroups for log-concave models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15963v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we obtain several new results and developments in the study of entropic optimal transport problems (a.k.a. Schr\"odinger problems) with general reference distributions and log-concave target marginal measures. Our approach combines transportation cost inequalities
  with the theory of Riccati matrix difference equations arising in filtering and optimal control theory. This methodology is partly based on a novel entropic stability of Schr\"odinger bridges and closed form expressions of a class of discrete time algebraic Riccati equations. In the context of regularized entropic transport these techniques provide new sharp entropic map estimates. When applied to the stability of Sinkhorn semigroups, they also yield
  a series of novel contraction estimates in terms of the fixed point of Riccati equations.
  The strength of our approach is that it is applicable to a large class of models arising in machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. We illustrate the impact of our results in the context of regularized entropic transport, proximal samplers and diffusion generative models as well as diffusion flow matching models</description>

      <title>A point cloud reconstruction method based on uncertainty feature enhancement for aerodynamic shape optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precision of shape representation and the dimensionality of the design space significantly influence the cost and outcomes of aerodynamic optimization. The design space can be represented more compactly by maintaining geometric precision while reducing dimensions, hence enhancing the cost-effectiveness of the optimization process. This research presents a new point cloud autoencoder architecture, called AE-BUFE, designed to attain efficient and precise generalized representations of 3D aircraft through uncertainty analysis of the deformation relationships among surface grid points. The deep learning architecture consists of two components: the uncertainty index-based feature enhancement module and the point cloud autoencoder module. It learns the shape features of the point cloud geometric representation to establish a low-dimensional latent space. To assess and evaluate the efficiency of the method, a comparison was conducted with the prevailing point cloud autoencoder architecture and the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) linear dimensionality reduction method under conditions of complex shape deformation. The results showed that the new architecture significantly improved the extraction effect of the low-dimensional latent space. Then, we developed the SBO optimization framework based on the AE-BUFE parameterization method and completed a multi-objective aerodynamic optimization design for a wide-speed-range vehicle considering volume and moment constraints. While ensuring the take-off and landing performance, the aerodynamic performance is improved at transonic and hypersonic conditions, which verifies the efficiency and engineering practicability of this method.</description>

      <title>Compressed Zeroth-Order Algorithm for Stochastic Distributed Nonconvex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the stochastic distributed nonconvex optimization problem over a network of agents, where agents only access stochastic zeroth-order information about their local cost functions and collaboratively optimize the global objective over bandwidth-limited communication networks. To mitigate communication overhead and handle the unavailability of explicit gradient information, we propose a communication compressed zeroth-order stochastic distributed (CZSD) algorithm. By integrating a generalized contractive compressor and a stochastic two-point zeroth-order oracle, CZSD achieves convergence rates comparable to its exact communication counterpart while reducing both communication overhead and sampling complexity. Specifically, to the best of our knowledge, CZSD is the first compressed zeroth-order algorithm achieving linear speedup, with convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{p}/\sqrt{nT})$ and $\mathcal{O}(p/(nT))$ under general nonconvex settings and the Polyak--{\L}ojasiewicz condition, respectively. Numerical experiments validate the algorithm's effectiveness and communication efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Newton Interior-Point Method for $\ell_0$ Factor Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Factor Analysis is an effective way of dimensionality reduction achieved by revealing the low-rank plus sparse structure of the data covariance matrix. The corresponding model identification task is often formulated as an optimization problem with suitable regularizations. In particular, we use the nonconvex discontinuous $\ell_0$ norm in order to induce the sparsity of the covariance matrix of the idiosyncratic noise. This paper shows that such a challenging optimization problem can be approached via an interior-point method with inner-loop Newton iterations. To this end, we first characterize the solutions to the unconstrained $\ell_0$ regularized optimization problem through the $\ell_0$ proximal operator, and demonstrate that local optimality is equivalent to the solution of a stationary-point equation. The latter equation can then be solved using standard Newton's method, and the procedure is integrated into an interior-point algorithm so that inequality constraints of positive semidefiniteness can be handled. Finally, numerical examples validate the effectiveness of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the regularized Kohn-Sham iteration in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.05389v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kohn-Sham iteration of generalized density-functional theory on Banach spaces with Moreau-Yosida regularized universal Lieb functional and an adaptive damping step is shown to converge to the correct ground-state density. This result demands state spaces for (quasi)densities and potentials that are uniformly convex with modulus of convexity of power type. The Moreau-Yosida regularization is adapted to match the geometry of the spaces and some convex analysis results are extended to this type of regularization. Possible connections between regularization and physical effects are pointed out as well. The proof of convergence presented here (Theorem 23) contains a critical mistake that has been noted and fixed for the finite-dimensional case in arXiv:1903.09579. Yet, the proposed correction is not straightforwardly generalizable to a setting of infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. This means the question of convergence in such a case is still left open. We present this draft as a collection of techniques and ideas for a possible altered, successful demonstration of convergence of the Kohn--Sham iteration in Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Distributed Optimization for Cooperative Robotics: from Setups and Algorithms to Toolboxes and Research Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several interesting problems in multi-robot systems can be cast in the framework of distributed optimization. Examples include multi-robot task allocation, vehicle routing, target protection, and surveillance. While the theoretical analysis of distributed optimization algorithms has received significant attention, its application to cooperative robotics has not been investigated in detail. In this paper, we show how notable scenarios in cooperative robotics can be addressed by suitable distributed optimization setups. Specifically, after a brief introduction on the widely investigated consensus optimization (most suited for data analytics) and on the partition-based setup (matching the graph structure in the optimization), we focus on two distributed settings modeling several scenarios in cooperative robotics, i.e., the so-called constraint-coupled and aggregative optimization frameworks. For each one, we consider use-case applications, and we discuss tailored distributed algorithms with their convergence properties. Then, we revise state-of-the-art toolboxes allowing for the implementation of distributed schemes on real networks of robots without central coordinators. For each use case, we discuss its implementation in these toolboxes and provide simulations and real experiments on networks of heterogeneous robots.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Exploration-Exploitation Dilemma in Evolutionary Algorithms: A Novel Human-Centered Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are widely employed tools for complex search and optimization tasks; however, the absence of an overarching operational framework that permits a systematic regulation of the exploration-exploitation tradeoff--critical for efficient convergence--restricts the full actualization of their potential, leading to the so-called exploration-exploitation dilemma in algorithm design. A systematic resolution to this dilemma requires: (1) an independent yet coordinated control over exploration and exploitation, and (2) an explicit, computationally feasible, adaptive regulation mechanism. The current, almost decentralized, traditional parameter tuning-centeric approach--lacks the foundation to satisfy these requirements under encoding-imposed structural constraints.
  We propose a Human-Centered Two-Phase Search (HCTPS) framework, in which the actualization of (1) and (2) is enabled through an external configuration variable--the Search Space Control Parameter (SSCP). As the sole control knob of HCTPS, the SSCP centralizes exploration adjustments, sparing users from micromanaging traditional parameters with unintelligible interdependencies. To this construct, the human user serves as a meta-parameter, adaptively steering the regulatory process via SSCP adjustments. We prove that the HCTPS strictly surpasses the current approach in terms of search space coverage without disrupting the EAs' inherent convergence mechanisms, demonstrate a concrete instantiation of it--using the Genetic Algorithm as the underlying heuristic on a suite of global benchmark unconstrained optimization problems, provide a through assessment of the proposed framework, and envision future research directions.
  Any search algorithm prone to this dilemma can be applied in light of the proposed framework, being algorithm-agnostic by design.</description>

      <title>On the number of defects in optimal quantizers on closed surfaces: the hexagonal torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a strategy for proving an asymptotic upper bound on the number of defects (non-hexagonal Voronoi cells) in the $n$ generator optimal quantizer on a closed surface (i.e., compact 2-manifold without boundary). The program is based upon a general lower bound on the optimal quantization error and related upper bounds for the L\"oschian numbers $n$ (the norms of the Eisenstein integers) arising from the Goldberg-Coxeter construction. A gap lemma is used to reduce the asymptotics of the number of defects to precisely the asymptotics for the gaps between L\"oschian numbers. We apply this strategy on the hexagonal torus and prove that the number of defects is at most $O(n^{1/4})$ -- strictly fewer than surfaces with boundary -- and conjecture (based upon the number-theoretic L\"oschian gap conjecture) that it is in fact $O(\log n)$. Incidentally, the method also yields a related upper bound on the variance of the areas of the Voronoi cells. We show further that the bound on the number of defects holds in a neighborhood of the optimizers. Finally, we remark on the remaining issues for implementation on the 2-sphere.</description>

      <title>Ensuring Safe and Smooth Control in Safety-Critical Systems via Filtered Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In safety-critical control systems, ensuring both system safety and smooth control input is essential for theoretical guarantees and practical deployment. Existing Control Barrier Function (CBF) frameworks, especially High-Order CBFs (HOCBFs), effectively enforce safety constraints but often lead to nonsmooth or discontinuous control inputs that can degrade system performance or violate actuator limitations. This paper introduces Filtered Control Barrier Functions (FCBFs), which extend HOCBFs by incorporating an auxiliary dynamic system - referred to as input regularization filter - to produce Lipschitz continuous control inputs. The proposed framework ensures safety, control bounds, and smoothness simultaneously by integrating FCBFs and HOCBFs within a unified quadratic program (QP). Theoretical guarantees are provided and simulations on a unicycle model demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to standard and smoothness-penalized HOCBF approaches.</description>

      <title>Bridging conformal prediction and scenario optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction and scenario optimization constitute two important classes of statistical learning frameworks to certify decisions made using data. They have found numerous applications in control theory, machine learning and robotics. Despite intense research in both areas, and apparently similar results, a clear connection between these two frameworks has not been established. By focusing on the so-called vanilla conformal prediction, we show rigorously how to choose appropriate score functions and set predictor map to recover well-known bounds on the probability of constraint violation associated with scenario programs. We also show how to treat ranking of nonconformity scores as a one-dimensional scenario program with discarded constraints, and use such connection to recover vanilla conformal prediction guarantees on the validity of the set predictor. We also capitalize on the main developments of the scenario approach, and show how we could analyze calibration conditional conformal prediction under this lens. Our results establish a theoretical bridge between conformal prediction and scenario optimization.</description>

      <title>Dynamics-aware Diffusion Models for Planning and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of generating dynamically admissible trajectories for control tasks using diffusion models, particularly in scenarios where the environment is complex and system dynamics are crucial for practical application. We propose a novel framework that integrates system dynamics directly into the diffusion model's denoising process through a sequential prediction and projection mechanism. This mechanism, aligned with the diffusion model's noising schedule, ensures generated trajectories are both consistent with expert demonstrations and adhere to underlying physical constraints. Notably, our approach can generate maximum likelihood trajectories and accurately recover trajectories generated by linear feedback controllers, even when explicit dynamics knowledge is unavailable. We validate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on standard control tasks and a complex non-convex optimal control problem involving waypoint tracking and collision avoidance, demonstrating its potential for efficient trajectory generation in practical applications.</description>
