      <title>Creation of ultracold heteronuclear p-wave Feshbach molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the creation of optically trapped ultracold heteronuclear p-wave Feshbach molecules in a mixture of 23Na and 87Rb atoms. With loss spectroscopy and binding energy measurements, we systematically characterize the interspecies p-wave Feshbach resonances near 284 G. Leveraging this understanding, we use magneto-association to form p-wave NaRb Feshbach molecules, producing both pure samples and mixtures of molecules in different angular momentum states. Additionally, we investigate the inelastic loss of these molecules, primarily influenced by atom-molecule and molecule-molecule collisions. Our results represent a significant step toward realizing tunable p-wave interactions in heteronuclear ultracold systems and provide a foundation for exploring non-zero angular momentum molecules.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Differential Static Polarizability and Frequency of an Inner-Shell Orbital Clock Transition in Lattice-Trapped 174Yb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additional clock transitions of ytterbium atoms based on inner-shell orbital transition could benefit the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Observation of these transitions with high resolution is a prerequisite for making precise frequency measurements. Here, we observe 4.3 Hz-linewidth spectra of the inner-shell orbital transition at 431 nm in lattice-trapped 174Yb. With high-resolution spectra, we precisely determine the differential static polarizability of the transition to be -2.10(4) kHz/(kV/cm)^2. The magnitude of this polarizability is approximately 1/17 of that of the well-known clock transition in 171Yb at 578 nm, indicating a reduced sensitivity to blackbody radiation. We carry out a frequency ratio measurement between the two clock transitions of ytterbium atoms with an uncertainty of 9E-15. The frequency of the 431 nm transition is determined to be 695 175 030 801 776.5(6.3) Hz. These results represent a step forward in future studies on the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Sub-Doppler rubidium atom cooling using a programmable agile integrated PZT-on-SiN resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programmability and precise control of laser frequency are essential for quantum experiments and applications such as atomic clocks, quantum computers, and cold-atom sensors. Current systems use bulky, power-hungry modulators and frequency shifters which are difficult to integrate and limit portability and scalability. We report an electrically controllable, agile optical frequency source based on a semiconductor laser stabilized to a photonic-integrated, lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-actuated resonator cavity. We demonstrate this approach with precision programmable frequency control of a 780-nm laser that can periodically reference to rubidium spectroscopy followed by fast, programmable, arbitrary frequency tuning sequences for quantum control. We use this approach to demonstrate sub-Doppler cooling of rubidium-87 without any external modulators, achieving atom-cloud temperatures as low as 16 $\mu$K. The device achieves a tuning strength up to 1 GHz/V with 11 MHz modulation bandwidth while consuming only 10 nW of electrical power. This work establishes a route toward compact, low-power, and chip-scale laser systems for next-generation quantum and atomic sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Saturable absorption in NV-doped diamond studied by femtosecond Z-scan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate nonlinear optical absorption in diamond crystals containing high densities of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers using open-aperture Z-scan measurements with 230 fs laser pulses at 1032 nm, within the transparency window of diamond. While high-purity electronic-grade diamond exhibits third-order nonlinear absorption, NV-doped samples display pronounced saturable absorption that strengthens with increasing defect concentration. Linear transmission spectroscopy reveals that, in addition to NV centers, the crystals host significant populations of H2 (NVN-) defect complexes whose absorption band partially overlaps the excitation wavelength. By correlating spectroscopic data with nonlinear measurements and modeling the response using an effective two-level system, we show that the observed saturation cannot be attributed solely to NV centers but arises from the combined contribution of NV-related and H2 defects. For the highly doped sample, we determine an effective linear absorption coefficient of alpha0 = 6.52 cm-1 and a saturation intensity of Is = 40.0 GW/cm2. These findings highlight the critical role of the complex defect landscape in governing the nonlinear optical response of NV-doped diamond and underscore the necessity of accounting for ancillary defect species in the design of diamond-based nonlinear and quantum photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion and localization in a disorder-free atomic mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of random walk, in which particles or waves undergo multiple collisions with the microscopic constituents of a surrounding medium, is central to understanding diffusive transport across many research areas. However, this paradigm may break down in complex systems, where quantum interference and memory effects render the particle propagation anomalous, often fostering localization. Here we report on the observation of such anomalous dynamics in a minimal setting: an ultracold mass-imbalanced mixture of two fermionic gases in three dimensions. We release light impurities into a gas of heavier atoms and follow their evolution across different collisional regimes. Under strong interspecies interactions, by lowering the temperature we unveil a crossover from normal diffusion to subdiffusion. Simultaneously, a localized fraction of the light gas emerges, displaying no discernible dynamics over hundreds of collisions. Our findings, incompatible with the conventional Fermi-liquid picture, are instead captured by a model of an atom propagating through a (quasi-)static disordered landscape of point-like scatterers. These results highlight the key role of quantum interference in our mixture, which emerges as a versatile platform for exploring disorder-free localization phenomena.</description>

      <title>Efficient and compact quantum network node based on a parabolic mirror on an optical chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a neutral atom networking node that combines high photon collection efficiency with high atom photon entanglement fidelity in a compact, fiber integrated platform. A parabolic mirror is used both to form the trap and to collect fluorescence from a single rubidium atom, intrinsically mode matching $\sigma$ polarized emitted photons to the fiber and rendering the system largely insensitive to small imperfections or drifts. The core optics consist of millimeter scale components that are pre aligned, rigidly bonded on a monolithic invacuum assembly, and interfaced entirely via optical fibers. With this design, we measure an overall photon collection and detection efficiency of $3.66\%$, from which we infer an overall collection efficiency of $6.6\%$ after the single--mode fiber coupling. We generate atom photon entangled states with a raw Bell state fidelity of 0.93 and an inferred fidelity of 0.98 after correcting for atom readout errors. The same node design has been realized in two independent setups with comparable performance and is compatible with adding high NA objective lenses to create and control atomic arrays at each node. Our results establish a robust, cavity free neutral atom interface that operates near the limit set by the collection optics numerical aperture and provides a practical building block for scalable quantum network nodes and repeaters.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of quartet superfluid state: Quartet Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory and generalized Nambu-Gor'kov formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a quartet superfluid state in fermionic matter by using the quartet Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) variational theory and the Green's function method. We demonstrate that the quartet BCS theory with the multiple-infinite-product ansatz successfully reproduces an exact four-body result in a one-dimensional four-component Fermi gas at the dilute limit, in contrast to the single-infinite-product ansatz. To see the validity of the quartet BCS state, we derive the self-consistent equation for the quartet superfluid order parameter within the generalized imaginary-time Nambu-Gor'kov formalism, which is found to be consistent with the quartet BCS variational equation. Moreover, by numerically computing the momentum-resolved single-particle spectral function in a one-dimensional system, we discuss how the single-particle spectra evolve with increasing the strength of the four-body cluster formation. We show that a coherent BCS-like quasiparticle branch on the weak-coupling side evolves into a strongly damped, continuum-dominated spectrum in the strong-coupling side, while nonzero quartet superfluid order parameter persists throughout the crossover regime. Our results would be useful for understanding beyond-BCS pairing effects and four-body cluster formations in fermionic systems in an interdisciplinary way.</description>

      <title>Bright Heralded Single-Photon Superradiance in a High-Density Thin Vapor Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superradiance is a hallmark of cooperative quantum emission, where radiative decay is collectively enhanced by coherence among emitters. Here, extending superradiant effects to photon pair generation from multi-level atoms, two-photon process offers a pathway to novel quantum light sources and a useful case for practical superradiance. We report bright heralded single-photon superradiance via spontaneous four-wave mixing in a 1-mm-long, high-density cesium vapor cell. By reducing the average distance between atoms in the atomic vapor to 0.29 times the idler photon wavelength, we observe a dramatic narrowing of the temporal two-photon wavefunction. This compression of temporal two-photon wavefunction evidences the superradiance of heralded photons in the collective two-photon emission dynamics. Furthermore, our heralded single-photon superradiance is accompanied by a coincidence-to-accidental ratio of 200 and the detected photon-pair counting exceeding 10^6 pairs/s. These findings establish dense thin atomic vapors as a practical, robust medium for realizing superradiant photon sources, with immediate relevance for quantum optics and the development of efficient photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Universal composite phase gates with tunable target phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic method for constructing universal composite phase gates with a continuously tunable target phase. Using a general Cayley--Klein parametrization of the single-pulse propagator, we design gates from an even number of nominal $\pi$ pulses and derive analytic phase families by canceling, order by order in a small deviation parameter, the leading contributions to the undesired off-diagonal element of the composite propagator, independently of the dynamical phase. The resulting sequences provide intrinsic robustness against generic control imperfections and parameter fluctuations and remain valid for arbitrary pulse shapes. Numerical simulations in a standard two-level model confirm high-order error suppression and demonstrate broad, flat high-fidelity plateaus over wide ranges of simultaneous pulse-area and detuning errors, highlighting the efficiency of the proposed universal composite phase gates for resilient phase control in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Ultra Compact low cost two mode squeezed light source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum-correlated states of light, such as squeezed states, constitute a fundamental resource for quantum technologies, enabling enhanced performance in quantum metrology, quantum information processing, and quantum communications. The practical deployment of such technologies requires squeezed-light sources that are compact, efficient, low-cost, and robust. Here we report a compact narrowband source of two-mode squeezed light at 795 nm based on four-wave mixing in hot 85Rb atomic vapor. The source is implemented in a small, modular architecture featuring a single fiber-coupled input, an electro-optic phase modulator combined with a single Fabry-Perot etalon for probe generation, and two free-space output modes corresponding to the signal and conjugate fields. Optimized for low pump power, the system achieves up to -8 dB of intensity-difference squeezing at an analysis frequency of 0.8 MHz with a pump power of only 300 mW. The intrinsic narrowband character of the generated quantum states makes this source particularly well suited for atomic-based quantum sensing and quantum networking, including interfaces with atomic quantum memories. Our results establish a versatile and portable platform for low-SWaP squeezed-light generation, paving the way toward deployable quantum-enhanced technologies.</description>

      <title>Cumulative Fidelity of LMT Clock Atom Interferometers in the Presence of Laser Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clock atom interferometry is an emerging technique in precision measurements that is particularly well suited for sensitivity enhancement through large momentum transfer (LMT). While current systems have demonstrated momentum separations of several hundreds of photon momenta, next-generation quantum sensors are targeting an LMT enhancement factor beyond $10^4$. However, the viability of LMT clock interferometers has recently come into question due to the potential impact of laser frequency noise. Here, we resolve this concern by analyzing the cumulative fidelity of sequential state inversions in an LMT atom interferometer. We show that the population error from $n$ pulses applied from alternating directions scales linearly with $n$. This is a significant advantage over the $n^2$ scaling that occurs when probing a two-level system $n$ times from the same direction. We further show that contributions to the interferometer signal from parasitic paths generated by imperfect pulses are negligible, for any loss mechanism. These results establish that laser frequency noise is not a practical limitation for the development of high-fidelity LMT clock atom interferometers.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Induced Transparency-Absorption and Normal-Anomalous Dispersion Characteristics of ${}^{87}\text{Rb}$ Medium or Any J-Type Configuration Atomic Vapors Subject to a Vector Magnetic Field and a Weak Resonant Pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02113v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed an analytical framework for magnetically induced transparency-absorption (MITA) and normal-anomalous dispersion (MINAD) in a weakly driven ${}^{87}\text{Rb}$ vapor, or any J-type three-level system, under a vector magnetic field. By solving the Bloch equations in the stationary, quasi-stationary, and short-pulse regimes, we obtained closed-form expressions for the atomic populations and coherences and identified a bifurcation in the oscillatory dynamics at zero longitudinal Zeeman splitting. The Fourier-domain analysis reveals alternating transparency/absorption and normal/anomalous dispersion with frequency-dependent sign reversals, enabling spectrally selective filtering and group-delay effects. Slow oscillatory behavior in the radio-frequency range makes the system suitable for weak magnetic-field sensing, while fast oscillations at optical frequencies suggest applications in spectral filtering and frequency-comb-like signal shaping. The results provide a theoretical basis for experimental observation of MITA/MINAD and for optimizing atomic-vapor platforms for precision magnetometry and related photonic functionalities.</description>

      <title>The 1/3 Geometric Constant: Scale Invariance and the Origin of 'Missing Energy' in 3D Quantum Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a universal geometric constraint on the detection of kinetic energy release (KER) in three-dimensional quantum fragmentation. By investigating the dissociation of localized Slater-type orbitals, we demonstrate that the $4\pi r^2$ radial volume element inherently masks the majority of a system's energy budget, imposing a fundamental peak-to-mean energy bound of $R_E &lt; 0.5$. We introduce a dimensionless scaling law, $M = \alpha \zeta / Q$, and prove that the resulting energy detection ratio is scale-invariant across twelve orders of magnitude, bridging the gap between atomic and subatomic physics. Remarkably, we identify a \textbf{``Geometric Zero-Point''} at $R_E \approx 0.33$, which precisely replicates the 7~eV ``missing energy'' anomaly observed in attosecond $H_2^+$ fragmentation benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this $1/3$ ratio provides a robust geometric baseline for the historical average-to-endpoint discrepancy in beta decay. Our results suggest that a significant portion of what is historically categorized as ``missing energy'' may be a topological artifact of 3D quantum geometry rather than an exclusive signature of undetected particles. This work establishes a universal master curve for energy reconstruction and identifies a \textbf{``detection crisis''} in highly localized systems, where the true interaction energy becomes effectively invisible to peak-centric experimental calorimetry.</description>

Abstract: The spin polarization of Rb atoms undergoing light-induced desorption from a spin-polarized Co (110) surface was investigated. Desorption induced by pulsed UV-light irradiation was driven by a non-thermal mechanism and the spins of the desorbed Rb atoms were polarized. This implies spin transfer between the surface and the adsorbate during desorption.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$-violating axion-mediated interactions in RaOH molecule</title>

Abstract: If axion simultaneously has the scalar couplings to the nucleons and pseudo-scalar couplings to the electrons, it may mediate a $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$-violating interaction between the electronic shell and nuclei in the molecules. The polyatomic molecule RaOH, which is considered as a promising platform for the $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$ violation searches, is studied for its sensitivity to such interactions. Due to the long-range nature (on molecular scales) of the axion-mediated interaction, it is important whether the enhancement parameter would be sensitive to the vibration of the molecule. Our results imply that the impact of the vibrations on the axion-mediated electron-nucleon interaction in the molecule is similar to the impact on the short-range electron-nucleon scalar-pseudoscalar interaction studied earlier.</description>

      <title>Robust Control and Entanglement of Qudits in Neutral Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum devices comprised of elementary components with more than two stable levels - so-called qudits - enrich the accessible Hilbert space, enabling applications ranging from fault-tolerant quantum computing to simulating complex many-body models. While several quantum platforms are built from local elements that are equipped with a rich spectrum of stable energy levels, schemes for the efficient control and entanglement of qudits are scarce. Importantly, no experimental demonstration of multi-qudit control has been achieved to date in neutral atom arrays. Here, we propose a general scheme for controlling and entangling qudits and perform a full analysis for the case of qutrits, encoded in ground and metastable states of alkaline earth atoms. We find an efficient implementation of single-qudit gates via the simultaneous driving of multiple transition frequencies. For entangling operations, we provide a concrete and intuitive recipe for the controlled-Z (CZ) gate for any local dimension d, realized through alternating single qudit and entangling pulses that simultaneously drive up to two Rydberg transitions. We further prove that two simultaneous Rydberg tones are, in general, the minimum necessary for implementing the CZ gate with a global drive. The pulses we use are optimally-controlled, smooth, and robust to realistic experimental imperfections, as we demonstrate using extensive noise simulations. This amounts to a minimal, resource-efficient, and practical protocol for realizing a universal set of gates. Our scheme for the native control of qudits in a neutral atom array provides a high-fidelity route toward qudit-based quantum computation, ready for implementation on near-term devices.</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered moire quasicrystal patterns of ultracold Bose gases in twisted bilayer optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21093</link>

Abstract: We investigate the formation of moire quasicrystal patterns in Bose gasses confined in twisted bilayer optical lattices via Floquet-engineered intralayer atomic interactions. Dynamical evolutions of the total density wave amplitude exhibit the stage for the emergence of moire quasicrystal patterns, where the pattern formation is closely associated with the momenta of collective modes excited by the weak periodic drive. Through analyzing the radial and angular density wave amplitude, we find that these new collective modes are only coupled radially and cannot be decoupled eventually. The symmetry of quasicrystal patterns can be easily manipulated by the modulation frequencies and amplitudes. Reducing the frequencies and increasing the amplitudes can both facilitate lattice symmetry breaking and the subsequent emergence of rotational symmetry. Notably, a twelve-fold quasicrystal pattern emerges under specific parameters, closely resembling the moire quasicrystal in twisted bilayer graphene. The momentum-space distributions also exhibit high rotational symmetry, which is consistent with the real-space patterns at specific evolution times. Our findings establish a new quantum platform for exploring quasicrystals and their symmetry properties in ultracold bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Coherent Two-State Oscillations in False Vacuum Decay Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent two-state oscillations are observed in numerical simulations of the one-dimensional transverse-longitudinal-field Ising model (TLFIM) within false vacuum decay regimes. Starting from the false vacuum (a nearly fully polarized ferromagnetic state), we show that in moderate-sized systems, at resonances $h\approx 2J/n$ (with longitudinal field $h$, transverse field $J$, and an integer $n$), the expected decay can give way to coherent oscillations between the false vacuum and a symmetric resonant state. The oscillation frequency, i.e., the tunneling splitting, is observed notably to exhibit a superradiant-like $\sqrt{L}$ enhancement, as confirmed by a Schrieffer-Wolff analysis. In large chains, coherence remains for $n\gtrsim L/2$ due to bubble-size blockade and is robust against stronger transverse fields; for small $n$, long-range interactions can stabilize the oscillations by lifting multi-bubble degeneracies, establishing a robust many-body coherence mechanism beyond perturbative and finite-size limits.</description>
