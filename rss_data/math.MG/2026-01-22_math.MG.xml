      <title>Chebyshev sets and ball operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chebyshev set of a bounded set $K$ in a normed space is the set of centers of all minimal enclosing balls of $K$. We use the concept of ball intersection and ball hull operators to derive new properties of Chebyshev sets in normed spaces. These results give a better picture on how Chebyshev sets, ball intersections, ball hulls, and completions of bounded sets are related to each other. It is shown that the Chebyshev set of a bounded set $K$ always contains the Chebyshev set of some completion of $K$. Moreover, for a special class of sets we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition that the Chebyshev set of the respective set is a singleton. We obtain new results on critical sets of Chebyshev centers, and for that purpose, surprisingly, notions from the combinatorial geometry of convex bodies play an essential role. Also we give a complete geometric description of the ball hull of a finite planar set. This can be taken as starting point for algorithmical constructions of the ball hull of such sets.</description>

      <title>Barycenters in Disintegrated optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove existence and duality on a wide class of metric spaces, and uniqueness results on any connected, complete Riemannian manifold, with or without boundary, for classical Monge--Kantorovich barycenters. In particular, this is the first and only uniqueness result with no restriction on the geometry of the manifold aside from connectedness and completeness. We obtain these via the corresponding results for barycenter problems associated to a new two-parameter family of metrics on probability measures on a general metric fiber bundle, called the $\textit{disintegrated Monge--Kantorovich metrics}$ (previously introduced by the authors).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the following isoperimetric-type inequality: for every convex body $K$ in $\mathbb R^n$ and some $\sigma\subset[n]:=\{1,\dots,n\}$ there exists a suitable Hanner polytope $B_K$ with the same volume as $K$ and such that the volume of each of its orthogonal projections onto every subspace whose basis is formed by the canonical vectors $\{e_i:i\in\tau\cup([n]\setminus\sigma)\}$, for every $\tau\subseteq\sigma$, bounds from below the volume of the corresponding projections of $K$.</description>

      <title>Tropical balls, geodesics and honeycomb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry of tropical balls in $\mathbb{R}^n$ equipped with the tropical metric introduced by Cohen, Gaubert and Quadrat, an additive form of Hilbert's projective metric. After defining the tropical length of rectifiable curves, we formulate tropical geodesics in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and then characterize compact tropically geodesic sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Next, we present several equivalent descriptions of the tropical unit ball: as a zonotope (Minkowski sum of tropical unit segments), via its tropical generating set, as a union of $n+1$ tropical unit hypercubes, and as the tropical geodesic hull of the tropical unit vectors. Finally, we give an explicit proof that translates of the tropical unit ball whose centers lie in a sublattice of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ form a facet-to-facet honeycomb tiling of $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <title>Urysohn width and macroscopic scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the macroscopic version of Gromov's Urysohn width conjecture for scalar curvature is false in dimensions four and above. This is based on (1) a novel estimate on the codimension two Urysohn width of circle bundles over manifolds with large hypersphericity radius, and (2) a notion of ruling for Riemannian manifolds that yields circle bundles with total spaces admitting metrics of positive macroscopic scalar curvature. Along the way, we also show that Urysohn width is not continuous under Cheeger-Gromov collapsing limits. This article is a continuation of our study of metric invariants and scalar curvature for circle bundles over large Riemannian manifolds initiated in [KS25].</description>

      <title>Quasi-isometry Invariance of discrete Higher Filling functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that homological filling functions over a ring $R$ equipped with the discrete norm are quasi-isometry invariants for all groups of type $\mathrm{FP}_n$. This confirms a conjecture of Bader-Kropholler-Vankov in the case of discrete norms. The proof uses a technique of equipping free chain complexes with a geometric structure, allowing for analogues of cellular constructions in the purely algebraic setting. As a further application we prove quasi-isometry invariance for a weighted version of integral and discrete filling functions originally introduced in the study of the rapid decay property.</description>

      <title>Typical hyperbolic surfaces have an optimal spectral gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first non-zero Laplace eigenvalue of a hyperbolic surface, or its spectral gap, measures how well-connected the surface is: surfaces with a large spectral gap are hard to cut in pieces, have a small diameter and fast mixing times. For large hyperbolic surfaces (of large area or large genus $g$, equivalently), we know that the spectral gap is asymptotically bounded above by $\frac 14$. The aim of these talks is to present joint work with Nalini Anantharaman, where we prove that most hyperbolic surfaces have a near-optimal spectral gap. That is to say, we prove that, for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, the Weil--Petersson probability for a hyperbolic surface of genus $g$ to have a spectral gap greater than $\frac 14- \epsilon$ goes to one as $g$ goes to infinity. This statement is analogous to Alon's 1986 conjecture for regular graphs, proven by Friedman in 2003. I will present our approach, which shares many similarities with Friedman's work, and introduce new tools and ideas that we have developed in order to tackle this problem.</description>

      <title>A synthetic Lorentzian Cartan-Hadamard theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate and prove a synthetic Lorentzian Cartan-Hadamard theorem. This result both transfers the corresponding statement for locally convex metric spaces established by S. Alexander and R. Bishop to the Lorentzian setting, and simultaneously generalizes the smooth Lorentzian theorem discussed by J. Beem and P. Ehrlich to the recently established framework of synthetic Lorentzian geometry. Our approach is based on an appropriate notion of local concavity for Lorentzian (pre-)length spaces, which allows us to establish existence and uniqueness of timelike geodesics between any pair of timelike related points under the additional assumptions of global hyperbolicity and future one-connectedness. We also provide a globalization result for our notion of concavity in the setting of Lorentzian length spaces, and apply our results to obtain a globalization statement for nonnegative upper timelike curvature bounds.</description>

      <title>Peeling metric spaces of strict negative type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a unified and computationally tractable framework for finding outliers in, and maximum-diversity subsets of, finite metric spaces of strict negative type. Examples of such spaces include finite subsets of Euclidean space and finite subsets of a sphere without antipodal points. The latter accounts for state-of-the-art text embeddings, and we apply our framework in this context to sketch a hallucination mitigation strategy and separately to a class of path diversity optimization problems with a real-world example.</description>

      <title>On the universality of fluctuations for the cover time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.02255v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider random walks on finite vertex-transitive graphs $\Gamma$ of bounded degree. We find a simple geometric condition which characterises the cover time fluctuations: the suitably normalised cover time converges to a standard Gumbel variable if and only if $\mathrm{Diam}(\Gamma)^2 = o(n/\log n)$, where $n = |\Gamma|$. We prove that this condition is furthermore equivalent to the decorrelation of the uncovered set. The arguments rely on recent breakthroughs by Tessera and Tointon on finitary versions of Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth, which we leverage into strong heat kernel bounds, and refined quantitative estimates on Aldous and Brown's exponential approximation of hitting times, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On Viscosity Solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi Equations in the Wasserstein space and the Vanishing Viscosity Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this article is twofold. First, we develop a unified framework for viscosity solutions to both first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations and semilinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations driven by the idiosyncratic operator, defined on the Wasserstein Space. Second, we establish a vanishing-viscosity limit-extending beyond the classical control-theoretic setting-for solutions of semilinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations, proving their convergence to the corresponding first-order solution as the idiosyncratic noise vanishes. Our approach provides an optimal convergence rate. We also present some results of independent interest. These include existence theorems for the first-order equation, obtained through an appropriate Hopf-Lax representation, and a useful description of the action of the idiosyncratic operator on geodesically convex functions.</description>
