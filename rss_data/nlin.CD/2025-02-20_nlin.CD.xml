      <title>A reduced-order mean-field synchronization model for thermoacoustic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synchronization phenomena in thermoacoustic systems leading to oscillatory instability can effectively be modeled using Kuramoto oscillators. Such models consider the nonlinear response of flame as an ensemble of Kuramoto phase oscillators constrained to collectively evolve at the rhythm of acoustic fluctuations. However, these high-dimensional models are analytically intractable and computationally expensive. In this study, we reduce the dimensionality of such a high-dimensional model and present a low-order, analytically tractable model for predicting transitions to thermoacoustic instability. We reduce the dimensionality of the phase oscillator model coupled to the acoustic field using the Ott-Antonsen ansatz. Using the reduced-order equations, we estimate the transitions to thermoacoustic instability and compare these transitions with the experiment. We validate the model for two combustor configurations, viz., the bluff-body stabilized dump combustor and the swirl-stabilized annular combustor. The low-order model accurately captures the continuous and abrupt secondary transitions observed experimentally in these distinct combustors.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing chaos with projected ensembles of process tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process tensor provides a general representation of a quantum system evolving under repeated interventions and is fundamental for numerical simulations of local many-body dynamics. In this work, we introduce the projected process ensemble, an ensemble of pure output states of a process tensor in a given basis of local interventions, and use it to define increasingly more fine-grained probes of quantum chaos. The first moment of this ensemble encapsulates numerous previously studied chaos quantifiers, including the Alicki-Fannes quantum dynamical entropy, butterfly flutter fidelity, and spatiotemporal entanglement. We discover characteristic entanglement structures within the ensemble's higher moments that can sharply distinguish chaotic from integrable dynamics, overcoming deficiencies of the quantum dynamical and spatiotemporal entropies. These conclusions are supported by extensive numerical simulations of many-body dynamics for a range of spin-chain models, including non-interacting, interacting-integrable, chaotic, and many-body localized regimes. Our work elucidates the fingerprints of chaos on spatiotemporal correlations in quantum stochastic processes, and provides a unified framework for analyzing the complexity of unitary and monitored many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bridging Entanglement and Magic Resources through Operator Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local operator entanglement (LOE) dictates the complexity of simulating Heisenberg evolution using tensor network methods, and serves as strong dynamical signature of quantum chaos. We show that LOE is also sensitive to how non-Clifford a unitary is: its magic resources. In particular, we prove that LOE is always upper-bound by three distinct magic monotones: $T$-count, unitary nullity, and operator stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. Moreover, in the average case for large, random circuits, LOE and magic monotones approximately coincide. Our results imply that an operator evolution that is expensive to simulate using tensor network methods must also be inefficient using both stabilizer and Pauli truncation methods. A direct corollary of our bounds is that any quantum chaotic dynamics cannot be simulated classically. Entanglement in operator space therefore measures a unified picture of non-classical resources, in stark contrast to the Schr\"odinger picture.</description>
