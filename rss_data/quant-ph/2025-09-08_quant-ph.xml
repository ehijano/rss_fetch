      <title>A Quantum Guitar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A guitar string represents a wave, and by associating a qubit to each of its playable states we get a quantum wave. This is the principle behind our Quantum Guitar: `quantising all strings of a guitar'. In order to achieve this quantisation, we couple a guitar with Moth's Actias quantum synth, and for qubit manipulations including measurements the musician uses foot controllers - hence using all four limbs like a drummer. Our Quantum Guitar also allows for smooth continuous transition from `quantum' to `classical' sound, and vice versa. We have used our Quantum Guitar in several live performances in a variety of venues, playing a number different musical styles, hence demonstrating that it is a very uniquely versatile and reliable instrument. For example, in some performances Quantum Guitar was used in industrial music, by the band Black Tish, who are currently recording an album with it. In other performances Quantum Guitar represented a qubit within a sonified Bell-pair under measurement, the other qubit being mentally realised with a Grand Piano. Classical-quantum and quantum-classical transitions prove particularly useful in musical performance. A link to a demo video of Quantum Guitar is provided.</description>

      <title>The Structure and Interpretation of Quantum Programs I: Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qubits are a great way to build a quantum computer, but a limited way to program one. We replace the usual "states and gates" formalism with a "props and ops" (propositions and operators) model in which (a) the C*-algebra of observables supplies the syntax; (b) states, viewed as linear functionals, give the semantics; and (c) a novel diagrammatic calculus unifies the two. The first part develops the basic objects of the framework, encoding consistent patterns of operator correlation, recovering Hilbert space via the GNS construction, and re-deriving the Bloch sphere as the set of all consistent correlations of operators in the Pauli algebra.
  We then turn to intervention, showing how measurement modifies state, proving an operator-algebraic version of the Knill-Laflamme conditions, and expressing stabilizer codes with the same diagrammatic machinery. This provides a concise, representation-agnostic account of quantum error correction. The result is a self-contained foundation in which C*-algebras, and their dual Hilbert spaces, offer a rich and universal substrate for quantum programming; forthcoming papers will build a high-level language and quantum software applications on top of this substrate.</description>

      <title>The Kerr-Induced Superradiant Tricritical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of interaction and dissipation in open quantum systems can forge phase transitions beyond conventional paradigms. In the canonical quantum Rabi model, we demonstrate that a photon-photon (Kerr) interaction transforms the celebrated superradiant phase transition, inducing a line that separates continuous, second-order behavior from discontinuous, first-order regimes. Strikingly, this is not a line of tricritical points. Instead, we prove that genuine tricriticality is an isolated phenomenon, emerging only at a single, mathematically exact dissipation rate: the ``sweet spot'' of $\kappa_t^2 = (\sqrt{13}-2)/3$. Our discovery pinpoints the precise and restrictive conditions for realizing a rare multicritical point in a foundational quantum optical system, identifying this critical dissipation as a unique gateway to a higher order of criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normalized wave packets express particles in nature. Their sizes are determined by their interactions with matter, and depend on environments. Nevertheless, these characterize scatterings processes in realistic situations, and govern the absolute values of transition probabilities. This paper studies the wave packet sizes and their implications.</description>

      <title>Measuring Multiparticle Indistinguishability with the Generalized Bunching Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The indistinguishability of many bosons undergoing passive linear transformations followed by number basis measurements is fully characterized by its visible state. However, measuring all of the parameters in the visible state is experimentally demanding. We argue that the generalized bunching probability -- which is the probability that all the input bosons arrive in a given subset of the output modes -- provides useful partial information about the indistinguishability of the input bosons, by establishing that it is monotonic with respect to certain partial orders of distinguishability of the bosons. As an intermediate result, we prove that if Lieb's permanental-dominance conjecture holds, then among states that are invariant under permutations of the occupied visible modes, the generalized bunching probability is maximized when the bosons are perfectly indistinguishable. As a corollary, we show that if Lieb's conjecture holds, then the generalized bunching probability is monotonic with respect to the refinement partial order on what we refer to as partially labelled states. We also prove, unconditionally, that for states such that the single-particle density matrix is the same for each particle, the Haar average of the generalized bunching probability is Schur convex with respect to the eigenvalues of said single-particle density matrix. As an application of the Schur-convexity, we show that when the single-particle density matrix is a Gibbs state, the mean generalized bunching probability serves as a thermometer.</description>

      <title>Free Snacks in Quantum Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating ground-state energies is a cornerstone problem in Hamiltonian complexity, and in general requires exponential resources even on quantum computers. It is in this context we analyse the recently developed Imaginary-Time Quantum Dynamical Emulation (ITQDE). This method enables estimation of spectral densities, partition functions, and low-lying gaps, but requires only minimal coherent control, modest classical post-processing, and no state preparation. Using a quadrature-based formulation, we derive scaling and stability criteria that diagnose when its estimates are reliable, and introduce a controlled smoothing that yields a principled bias-variance trade off. The resulting picture preserves the hardness of exact eigenvalue resolution but reveals a practical regime - a "free snack" - here coarse-grained spectral information is obtainable with only polynomial resources. By recasting sampling costs as explicit bounds on resolvable bandwidths, the intermediate regime between trivial and intractable complexity becomes accessible on near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Tailoring spatial correlations with quantum interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon correlations represent a central resource in many quantum optics experiments, with applications ranging from quantum information protocols to sensing. Engineering such correlations is often challenging, especially in multi-particle scenarios. In this work we describe an effective method for shaping spatial correlations between photons by patterning their distinguishability in a quantum interference setup. We show how to write and edit these bi-photon correlations between the two output channels of a beam-splitter, hiding this encoded information from conventional intensity measurements. Our scheme offers an easy extension to multiparticle scenarios and facilitates the transmission of high-dimensional quantum information, with potential applications to quantum communication and imaging protocols.</description>

      <title>Qumode-Based Variational Quantum Eigensolver for Molecular Excited States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Qumode Subspace Variational Quantum Eigensolver (QSS-VQE), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for computing molecular excited states using the Fock basis of bosonic qumodes in circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) devices. This approach harnesses the native universal gate sets of qubit-qumode architectures to construct highly expressive variational ansatze, offering potential advantages over conventional qubit-based methods. In QSS-VQE, the electronic structure Hamiltonian is first mapped to a qubit representation and subsequently embedded into the Fock space of bosonic qumodes, enabling efficient state preparation and reduced quantum resource requirements. We demonstrate the performance of QSS-VQE through simulations of molecular excited states, including dihydrogen and a conical intersection in cytosine. Additionally, we explore a bosonic model Hamiltonian to assess the expressivity of qumode gates, identifying regimes where qumode-based implementations outperform purely qubit-based approaches. These results highlight the promise of leveraging bosonic degrees of freedom for enhanced quantum simulation of complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Cavity QED based on strongly localized modes: exponentially enhancing single-atom cooperativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large single-atom cooperativity in quantum systems is important for quantum information processing. Here, we propose to exponentially enhance the single-atom cooperativity parameter by exploiting the strongly localized effect of modes in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) systems. By increasing the wing width of a cavity with special geometry symmetry, the interference property allows us to exponentially improves the quality factor Q without altering the mode volume V for cavities supporting subwavelength light modes. This effectively overcomes the trade-off between Q and V in conventional subwavelength Fabry-Perot cavities. Consequently, we demonstrate the occurrence of ultra-long vacuum Rabi oscillations and the generation of strong photon blockade by enhancing the single-atom cooperativity parameter. This work offers a promising approach for advancing coherent manipulation and holds significant potential for applications in establishing longer-distance quantum communication networks, enhancing the precision and stability of quantum sensors, and improving the efficiency of quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Tracking Quantum Dynamics in an Optical Cavity for Recovering Purity and Squeezing via Quantum State Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracking the dynamics of a quantum system is conventionally achieved by monitoring the system continuously in time and filtering the information contained in measurement records via the causal quantum trajectory approach. However, in practical scenarios there is often loss of information to the environment, leading to filtered states that are impure because of decoherence. If real-time tracking is not required, the lost information can be maximally extracted via acausal quantum state smoothing, which has been theoretically proven to better restore the system's coherence (purity) than causal filtering. Interestingly, quantum state smoothing requires assumptions of how any lost quantum information (unobserved by the experimenter) was turned into classical information by the environment. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate smoothing scenarios, using an optical parametric oscillator and introducing `observed' and `unobserved' channels by splitting the output beam into two independent homodyne detectors. We achieve improvement in state purification of 10.3% +/- 1.6%, squeezing restoration of 7.6% +/- 2.6%, and show that smoothed states are better estimates of hidden true states than those from conventional filtering. The estimation techniques used in this paper are promising for many applications in quantum information that incorporate post-processing.</description>

      <title>Improving initial-state-dependent quantum circuit optimization by introducing state labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the capabilities of quantum hardware have significantly advanced in recent years, executing quantum algorithms as quantum circuits at the lowest possible cost remains crucial, regardless of the hardware progress. We are developing a quantum-state-dependent circuit optimizer called AQCEL. Our guiding principle, implemented as the AQCEL optimization protocol, is to optimize quantum circuits by measuring the states of the control qubits to identify and eliminate unnecessary control operations. In this paper, we introduce two key improvements: the state label manager that reduces unnecessary state measurements and the $CX$-pair removal process that eliminates redundant gate pairs. These enhancements significantly reduce the number of two-qubit gates, improving the fidelity of quantum circuits executed on quantum hardware. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we apply AQCEL to quantum circuits for the quantum parton shower algorithm. Experimental results using the IBM quantum computer show a substantial reduction in gate counts and an improvement in fidelity compared to the conventional optimization technique as well as the original AQCEL protocol. Our findings highlight the potential of state-dependent circuit optimization for enhancing the performance of quantum algorithms on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Fast entangling gates on fluxoniums via parametric modulation of plasmon interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In superconducting quantum processors, exploring diverse control methods could offer essential versatility and redundancy to mitigate challenges such as frequency crowding, spurious couplings, control crosstalk, and fabrication variability, thus leading to better system-level performance. Here we introduce a control strategy for fast entangling gates in a scalable fluxonium architecture, utilizing parametric modulation of the plasmon interaction. In this architecture, fluxoniums are coupled via a tunable coupler, whose transition frequency is flux-modulated to control the inter-fluxonium plasmon interaction. A bSWAP-type interaction is activated by parametrically driving the coupler at the sum frequency of the plasmon transitions of the two fluxoniums, resulting in the simultaneous excitation or de-excitation of both plasmon modes. This strategy therefore allow the transitions between computational states and non-computational plasmon states, enabling the accumulation of conditional phases on the computational subspace and facilitating the realization of controlled-phase gates. By focusing on a specific case of these bSWAP-type interactions, we show that a simple drive pulse enables sub-100ns CZ gates with an error below $10^{-4}$. Given its operational flexibility and extensibility, this approach could potentially offer a foundational framework for developing scalable fluxonium-based quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Unbounded-input explicit Bell inequalities for general quantum networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum nonlocality in networks featuring multiple independent sources underpins large-scale quantum communication and poses fundamental challenges for its characterization. In this work, we construct a family of explicit nonlinear Bell inequalities to verify the nonlocality across the general multi-input quantum networks. The construction of these inequalities relies on the number of leaf nodes, a network parameter that can be identified by a linear-time algorithm. Our approach establishes a structural connection between bipartite full-correlation Bell inequalities and network Bell inequalities, enabling the analytical derivation of optimal quantum violations and the conditions under which they occur. We further quantify the upper bound on maximal violations achievable by arbitrary two-qubit mixed states in such networks, under separable measurements, and evaluate the noise robustness of the proposed inequalities via the visibilities of Werner states. Finally, we demonstrate that these inequalities can, in a device-independent manner, distinguish between network topologies of equal size that differ in the number of leaf nodes.</description>

      <title>Transmon-assisted high-fidelity controlled-Z gates for integer fluxonium qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluxoniums, as partially-protected superconducting qubits are promising to be employed to build high-performance large-scale quantum processor. The recently proposed ``integer fluxonium" operates at zero external flux bias, with a frequency of approximately 3 GHz. Single-qubit gate fidelity has been demonstrated to exceed $99.9\%$, while two-qubit gate schemes and scalable architectures remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate a fluxonium-transmon-fluxonium (FTF) coupling architecture using integer fluxoniums. We first confirm suppression of $ZZ$ interaction in the FTF system and then propose two high-fidelity controlled-$Z$ (CZ) gate schemes utilizing the coupler control: a flux-activated adiabatic gate scheme and a microwave-activated non-adiabatic gate scheme. Both schemes are capable of achieving low coherent error on the order of $1 \times 10^{-6}$ within gate durations of several tens of nanoseconds. Additionally, we discuss a hybrid circuit system in which an integer fluxonium is coupled to a conventional fluxonium through a transmon coupler. Our proposal provides insights for future implementations of large-scale quantum circuits based on integer fluxonium devices.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of Qubit Dynamical Maps in the Presence of Symmetry and Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between symmetries and thermodynamic transformations by analyzing how global energy conservation and coherence resources affect the local dynamics of subsystems. We prove that U(1) conservation fundamentally constrains quantum thermodynamic operations through charge conservation of Pauli strings. Our no-go theorem shows that U(1) dynamics cannot generate local coherence from diagonal thermal states, restricting thermal operations to phase-covariant maps. Breaking this hierarchy requires environmental coherence with odd charge parity that couples unequal energy states. We establish the minimal resource requirements through a two-qubit construction that achieves Gibbs-preserving transformations beyond thermal operations. We demonstrate measurable thermodynamic advantages in work extraction and state distinguishability, revealing the fundamental role of quantum coherence in enhancing thermodynamic performance.</description>

      <title>Distributed-HISQ: A Distributed Quantum Control Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of a scalable Quantum Control Architecture (QCA) faces two primary challenges. First, the continuous growth in qubit counts has rendered distributed QCA inevitable, yet the nondeterministic latencies inherent in feedback loops demand cycleaccurate synchronization across multiple controllers. Existing synchronization strategies -- whether lock-step or demand-driven -- introduce significant performance penalties. Second, existing quantum instruction set architectures are polarized, being either too abstract or too granular. This lack of a unifying design necessitates recurrent hardware customization for each new control requirement, which limits the system's reconfigurability and impedes the path toward a scalable and unified digital microarchitecture.
  Addressing these challenges, we propose Distributed-HISQ, featuring: (i) HISQ, A universal instruction set that redefines quantum control with a hardware-agnostic design. By decoupling from quantum operation semantics, HISQ provides a unified language for control sequences, enabling a single microarchitecture to support various control methods and enhancing system reconfigurability. (ii) BISP, a booking-based synchronization protocol that can potentially achieve zero-cycle synchronization overhead. The feasibility and adaptability of Distributed-HISQ are validated through its implementation on a commercial quantum control system targeting superconducting qubits. We performed a comprehensive evaluation using a customized quantum software stack. Our results show that BISP effectively synchronizes multiple control boards, leading to a 22.8% reduction in average program execution time and a $\sim$5$\times$ reduction in infidelity when compared to an existing lock-step synchronization scheme.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Scheduling with Problem-Aware Calibration on a Quantum Annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the application of quantum annealing (QA) to a real-world combinatorial optimisation problem-room scheduling for sports camps at the Australian Institute of Sport-using both classical and quantum approaches. Due to current hardware limitations, the full problem cannot be embedded on existing QA platforms, motivating a hybrid method combining classical heuristics with quantum subroutines. We develop an improved formulation and a novel problem-aware calibration scheme, leveraging multi-qubit statistics to enhance the annealing performance. Our results show that the optimal annealing time aligns with the coherence time of the D-Wave Advantage 2 prototype (approximately 100 ns), with longer anneals yielding poorer outcomes before slow thermal recovery. Despite calibration and formulation improvements, QA performance degrades with increased connectivity and problem size, highlighting the need for improved qubit quality and parameter precision. These findings clarify the capabilities and limitations of current QA hardware and suggest strategies for extending its practical utility through hybrid methods and informed calibration.</description>

      <title>Control Protocol for Dynamic Synthesis of Qubit and Qudit Gates Using Photonic Pulses and Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical control protocol designed for the dynamic synthesis of single qubit and four-level qudit quantum gates using external parameters, such as photonic Gaussian pulses and magnetic fields, in a microcavity quantum well system. Our approach takes advantage of tunable coherent light matter interactions that can be modulated by the magnetic field between the exciton and negative trion coupled to the lowest photonic mode. We demonstrate that it is possible to achieve precise manipulation of populations of encoded quantum states through the unitary evolution of the system. In particular, we illustrate our optimization method for generating a single qubit gate with a mean fidelity of 99.99 as well as the realization of an iSWAP gate in the four level qudit case with a fidelity of 99.6.</description>

      <title>Nonintegrability of the Fredkin spin chain and its truncated versions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conservation laws serve as the hallmark of integrability. The absence of conserved charges typically implies that the model is nonintegrable. The recently proposed Fredkin spin chain exhibits rich structures, and its ground state is analytically known. However, whether the Fredkin spin chain is integrable remains an open question. In this work, through rigorous analytical calculations, we demonstrate that the Fredkin spin chain, under both periodic and open boundary conditions, lacks local conserved charges, thereby confirming its nonintegrable nature. Furthermore, we find that when one or a portion of the Hamiltonian terms are removed (referred to as the truncated Fredkin spin chain), local conserved charges are still absent. Our findings suggest that in models involving three-site interactions, integrable models are generally rare.</description>

      <title>Histogram Driven Amplitude Embedding for Qubit Efficient Quantum Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a compact and hardware efficient method for compressing color images using near term quantum devices. The approach segments the image into fixed size blocks called bixels, and computes the total intensity within each block. A global histogram with B bins is then constructed from these block intensities, and the normalized square roots of the bin counts are encoded as amplitudes into an n qubit quantum state. Amplitude embedding is performed using PennyLane and executed on real IBM Quantum hardware. The resulting state is measured to reconstruct the histogram, enabling approximate recovery of block intensities and full image reassembly. The method maintains a constant qubit requirement based solely on the number of histogram bins, independent of the resolution of the image. By adjusting B, users can control the trade off between fidelity and resource usage. Empirical results demonstrate high quality reconstructions using as few as 5 to 7 qubits, significantly outperforming conventional pixel level encodings in terms of qubit efficiency and validating the practical application of the method for current NISQ era quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum non-Gaussian high Fock states of light pulses and their superpositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of high Fock states of light pulses and their superpositions with provable quantum non-Gaussian features is still very challenging, although the power of conditional methods to herald the approximate state from the available Gaussian states is growing. The atom-light interaction in the high-Q cavity has been considered a viable alternative to the heralded Fock states of the light pulses from nonlinear optics limited to three-photon Fock states for the last decade. Here, by optimizing the realistic protocol combining it with available optical delay elements we conclusively predict filtering of Fock states up to ten photons with a high success rate of $20\%$ using a hierarchy of quantum non-Gaussian criteria. Moreover, the filtering protocol enables the preparation of superposition of Fock states and we analyse this emerging case up to two photons with with provable quantum non-Gaussian coherence and high success rate $50\%$. To demonstrate their quality for applications, we evaluate the robustness of such features, the bunching capability in a linear network, and the sensing capability to estimate the magnitude of unknown force, noise and phase, These assessments outline the essential conditions and application criteria for realistic optical cavity QED interaction on light pulses to outperform photon detection methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiency and power are two central measures of the performance of thermal machines. We here study the power-efficiency-stability trade-off in a finite-time quantum Carnot information engine, in which an information reservoir replaces the usual cold bath of a quantum Carnot engine. We analytically evaluate mean and variance of the work output, and demonstrate that maximum efficiency can be reached at both finite work output and finite work output fluctuations. We additionally show that the relative work output fluctuations may be smaller than those of the corresponding Carnot heat engine. This result implies that the finite-time quantum Carnot information engine can be more stable than the quantum Carnot heat engine, an important property for practical applications.</description>

      <title>RobQFL: Robust Quantum Federated Learning in Adversarial Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) merges privacy-preserving federation with quantum computing gains, yet its resilience to adversarial noise is unknown. We first show that QFL is as fragile as centralized quantum learning. We propose Robust Quantum Federated Learning (RobQFL), embedding adversarial training directly into the federated loop. RobQFL exposes tunable axes: client coverage $\gamma$ (0-100\%), perturbation scheduling (fixed-$\varepsilon$ vs $\varepsilon$-mixes), and optimization (fine-tune vs scratch), and distils the resulting $\gamma \times \varepsilon$ surface into two metrics: Accuracy-Robustness Area and Robustness Volume. On 15-client simulations with MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, IID and Non-IID conditions, training only 20-50\% clients adversarially boosts $\varepsilon \leq 0.1$ accuracy $\sim$15 pp at $&lt; 2$ pp clean-accuracy cost; fine-tuning adds 3-5 pp. With $\geq$75\% coverage, a moderate $\varepsilon$-mix is optimal, while high-$\varepsilon$ schedules help only at 100\% coverage. Label-sorted non-IID splits halve robustness, underscoring data heterogeneity as a dominant risk.</description>

      <title>Investigation of tantalum films growth for coplanar resonators with internal quality factors above ten million</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alpha-tantalum on silicon is a promising platform for high-coherence superconducting quantum circuits. However, the growth mechanism of alpha-tantalum on silicon remains poorly understood. We present a comprehensive study on alpha-tantalum films growth on various substrate. The decisive role of a substrate material Debye temperature on phase selection mechanism in tantalum films growth is experimentally confirmed, contradicting the prior assumptions on substrate temperature influence. Crucially, we confirm that alpha-tantalum starts growing only after a 7-10 nm thick beta-tantalum underlayer. It results in ranging the critical temperature of {\alpha}-Ta films from 3.77 K to 4.39 K for the total thickness from 20 to 150 nm, respectively. Finally, we compared high-quality Al and Ta coplanar resonators on silicon, demonstrating compact tantalum resonators (4/10.5/4 um) with an internal quality factor exceeding 10 million at single-photon excitation powers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient characterization of large-scale quantum systems, especially those produced by quantum analog simulators and megaquop quantum computers, poses a central challenge in quantum science due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space with respect to system size. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), with its aptitude for high-dimensional pattern recognition and function approximation, have emerged as a powerful tool to address this challenge. A growing body of research has leveraged AI to represent and characterize scalable quantum systems, spanning from theoretical foundations to experimental realizations. Depending on how prior knowledge and learning architectures are incorporated, the integration of AI into quantum system characterization can be categorized into three synergistic paradigms: machine learning, and, in particular, deep learning and language models. This review discusses how each of these AI paradigms contributes to two core tasks in quantum systems characterization: quantum property prediction and the construction of surrogates for quantum states. These tasks underlie diverse applications, from quantum certification and benchmarking to the enhancement of quantum algorithms and the understanding of strongly correlated phases of matter. Key challenges and open questions are also discussed, together with future prospects at the interface of AI and quantum science.</description>

      <title>Geometric Discord of any arbitrary dimensional bipartite system and its application in quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled quantum states are regarded as a key resource in quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. However, quantum correlations, other than entanglement can also play a significant role the QKD protocols. In this work, we will focus on one such measure of quantum correlation, known as geometric quantum discord (GQD). Firstly, we derive an analytical expression of GQD for two-qutrit quantum systems and further generalize it for $d_1\otimes d_2$ dimensional systems. Next, we apply the concept of GQD in studying QKD. In particular, we derive the lower bound for a distillable secret key rate $K_D$ in terms of GQD when two communicating parties uses private states for generating a secret key in the presence of an eavesdropper. The lower bound of $K_D$ depends upon the GQD of $\frac{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}{2}$ and $\frac{\sigma_2+\sigma_3}{2}$, where $\sigma_i$'s, $i=0,1,2,3$ are the density matrices. We find that for a certain range of GQD, the successful generation of the secret key is not guaranteed. We further study the behavior of distillable key rate when the geometric discord of $\frac{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}{2}$ and $\frac{\sigma_2+\sigma_3}{2}$ increases, decreases or remains constant, with the help of a few examples. Moreover, we find that even when $\sigma_i$'s are separable or positive partial transpose entangled states, the distillable key can still be generated. %Thus, indicating that entanglement is not strictly necessary for a successful QKD protocol.</description>

      <title>Dynamically encircling an exceptional point through phase-tracked closed-loop control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intricate complex eigenvalues of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians manifest as Riemann surfaces in control parameter spaces. At the exceptional points (EPs), the degeneracy of both eigenvalues and eigenvectors introduces noteworthy topological features, particularly during the encirclement of the EPs. Traditional methods for probing the state information on the Riemann surfaces involve static measurements; however, realizing continuous encircling remains a formidable challenge due to non-adiabatic transitions that disrupt the transport paths. Here we propose an approach leveraging the phase-locked loop (PLL) technique to facilitate smooth, dynamic encircling of EPs while maintaining resonance. Our methodology strategically ties the excitation frequencies of steady states to their response phases, enabling controlled traversal along the Riemann surfaces of real eigenvalues. This study advances the concept of phase-tracked dynamical encircling and explores its practical implementation within a fully electrically controlled non-Hermitian microelectromechanical system, highlighting robust in-situ tunability and providing methods for exploring non-Hermitian topologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing enables parallelism through superposition and entanglement and offers advantages over classical computing architectures. However, due to the limitations of current quantum hardware in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, classical simulation remains a critical tool for developing quantum algorithms. In this research, we present a comprehensive parallelization solution for the Q$^2$Chemistry software package, delivering significant performance improvements for the full-amplitude simulator on both CPU and GPU platforms. By incorporating batch-buffered overlap processing, dependency-aware gate contraction and staggered multi-gate parallelism, our optimizations significantly enhance the simulation speed compared to unoptimized baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of hybrid-level parallelism in HPC systems. Benchmark results show that Q$^2$Chemistry consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art open-source simulators across various circuit types. These benchmarks highlight the capability of Q$^2$Chemistry to effectively handle large-scale quantum simulations with high efficiency and high portability.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity two-qubit gates with transmon qubits using bipolar flux pulses and tunable couplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity two-qubit gates are essential for scalable quantum computing. We present a scheme based on superconducting transmon qubits and a control pulse delivery protocol that enables arbitrary controlled-phase gates modulated solely by an independent arbitrary waveform generator pulse. We combined a tunable coupler design with bipolar flux-pulsing to demonstrate a high-fidelity gate with a performance of $99.5\%$. Our gates inherit the advantages of both approaches: minimal residual ZZ coupling, built-in echo-like low-frequency noise protection, and time-scale control pulse reproducibility, while remaining easy to calibrate. We optimize the system energy levels to mitigate leakage to the coupler and suppress residual interactions. Numerical simulations of the scheme as three qutrits indicate that an error below $1 \times 10^{-4}$ is achievable. We confirm the scalability potential of the proposed scheme on a high-fidelity 4-qubit quantum processor.</description>

      <title>Exploring an implementation of quantum learning pipeline for support vector machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a fully quantum approach to support vector machine (SVM) learning by integrating gate-based quantum kernel methods with quantum annealing-based optimization. We explore the construction of quantum kernels using various feature maps and qubit configurations, evaluating their suitability through Kernel-Target Alignment (KTA). The SVM dual problem is reformulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, enabling its solution via quantum annealers. Our experiments demonstrate that a high degree of alignment in the kernel and an appropriate regularization parameter lead to competitive performance, with the best model achieving an F1-score of 90%. These results highlight the feasibility of an end-to-end quantum learning pipeline and the potential of hybrid quantum architectures in quantum high-performance computing (QHPC) contexts.</description>

      <title>Surpassing the wave-particle duality relation via feed-forward of phase information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complementarity constitutes a central aspect of quantum theory. It manifests itself, for example, in a two-way interferometer, where the simultaneous observation of an interference pattern and the acquisition of which-way information are limited by an inequality known as the duality relation. Here, we investigate which-way information in a double-slit interferometer and show that it can be correlated to the phase of the quantum object at the detection screen, leading to a phase-dependent which-way knowledge. In specific cases, this knowledge can locally exceed the limit set by the duality relation. Based on this observation, we propose a feed-forward protocol that aims at maximizing the which-way information locally for each phase after the particle has been recorded on the screen. This allows us to surpass the duality relation limit even globally. We present analytical results as a proof of principle of our protocol as well as numerical outcomes quantifying the amount of maximally achievable which-way knowledge.</description>

      <title>A Modular, Adaptive, and Scalable Quantum Factoring Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shor's algorithm for integer factorization offers an exponential speedup over classical methods but remains impractical on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware due to the need for many coherent qubits and very deep circuits. Building on our recent work on adaptive and windowed phase-estimation methods, we have developed a modular, windowed formulation of Shor's algorithm that mitigates these limitations by restructuring phase estimation into shallow, independent circuit blocks that can be executed sequentially or in parallel, followed by lightweight classical postprocessing. This approach allows for a reduction in the size of the phase (or counting) register from thousands of qubits down to a small, fixed block size of only a few qubits (for example, three or four), while leaving the work register requirement unchanged. The independence of the blocks allows for parallel execution and makes the approach more compatible with near-term hardware than the standard Shor's formulation. An additional feature of the framework is the overlap mechanism, which introduces redundancy between blocks and enables robust reconstruction of phase information, though zero-overlap configurations can also succeed in certain regimes. Numerical simulations verify the correctness of the modular formulation while also showing substantial reductions in counting qubits per block.</description>

      <title>Embezzlement as a "Self-Test" for Infinite Copies of Entangled States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the operator-algebraic structure underlying entanglement embezzlement, a phenomenon where a fixed entangled state (the catalyst) can be used to generate arbitrary target entangled states without being consumed. We show that the ability to embezzle a target state $g$ imposes strong internal constraints on the catalyst state $f$: specifically, $f$ must contain infinitely many mutually commuting, locally structured copies of $g$. This property is formalized using C*-algebraic tools and is analogous to a form of self-testing, certifying the presence of infinite copies of $g$ within $f$. Using this infinite-copy certification, we give an elementary proof that any universal embezzler must generate a Type~III$_1$ von Neumann factor, avoiding the use of modular theory. Our results clarify the structural requirements for embezzlement and provide new conceptual tools for analyzing state certification in infinite-dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <title>QCA-MolGAN: Quantum Circuit Associative Molecular GAN with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigating the vast chemical space of molecular structures to design novel drug molecules with desired target properties remains a central challenge in drug discovery. Recent advances in generative models offer promising solutions. This work presents a novel quantum circuit Born machine (QCBM)-enabled Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), called QCA-MolGAN, for generating drug-like molecules. The QCBM serves as a learnable prior distribution, which is associatively trained to define a latent space aligning with high-level features captured by the GANs discriminator. Additionally, we integrate a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning network to guide molecular generation with desired targeted properties, optimising key metrics such as quantitative estimate of drug-likeness (QED), octanol-water partition coefficient (LogP) and synthetic accessibility (SA) scores in conjunction with one another. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances the property alignment of generated molecules with the multi-agent reinforcement learning agents effectively balancing chemical properties.</description>

Abstract: Space-division multiplexing using multimode optical fibers has been applied to quantum-level signals with time-bin and phase encoding, achieving Mqubits per second over 8 km of few-mode fiber. The dead time of single-photon detectors, typically considered a bottleneck in quantum transmission, is effectively utilized here to eliminate modal cross-talk between quantum channels.</description>

      <title>Suppression of measurement-induced state transitions in cos{\phi}-coupling transmon readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drive-induced unwanted state transitions (DUST) are limiting both for microwave readout and parametric operations of superconducting qubits. Among them, measurement-induced state transitions (MIST) are due to intrinsic resonances described by the readout Hamiltonian. They were previously studied with a qubit linearly coupled to its readout mode, which constitutes the usual readout Hamiltonian. Since MIST can appear even at moderate powers, they limit the readout SNR and the QND readout fidelity. In this work, we study the high-power readout regime in a different transmon readout scheme, implementing a nonlinear coupling called the cos{\phi}-coupling. This coupling stems from a transmon molecule circuit and has symmetry properties that suppress nonparity-conserving MIST. We succeed in performing multi-state single-shot readout up to the fifth excited state of the transmon, which enables us to identify leakage pathways from the computational subspace. The measurements indicate that the system is free of MIST up to high powers, with more than 300 photons in the readout mode. The MIST can be controllably turned on by breaking the parity symmetry of the coupling using flux-tuning. These experimental results are corroborated by branch analysis and simulations of the classical chaotic dynamics, showing that the cos{\phi}-coupling is very robust to readout photons compared to the usual transverse coupling.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-Integrated InGaAs/InP SPAD Arrays for Quantum Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic integration is a promising route to miniaturise the hardware of quantum key distribution (QKD), yet the monolithic integration of single photon detectors remains a significant challenge. QKD receiver chips integrating superconducting detectors have been demonstrated, but their requirement for cryogenic cooling restricts their practical applications. High-frequency gated single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) provide a mature non-cryogenic alternative and their fabrication into compact arrays would enable scalable hybrid integration. However, this faces several challenges related to efficient GHz array gating, inter-pixel crosstalk, and scalable waveguide coupling, which to date remain unaddressed. Here, we overcome the key challenges and develop GHz-gated InGaAs/InP SPAD arrays with performance viable for QKD and negligible inter-pixel crosstalk. We combine the arrays with low-loss silica waveguide chips to produce compact hybrid QKD receivers and perform BB84 protocol experiments, achieving secure key rates over 2 Mbps at short distances and 15 kbps over 100 km of fibre. Our work provides a method for flexible and scalable integration of waveguide-coupled SPADs for quantum information processing applications.</description>

      <title>Casimir-Lifshitz theory for cavity-modification of ground-state energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theory for ground-state modifications of matter embedded in a Fabry-Perot cavity and whose excitations are described as harmonic oscillators is presented. Based on Lifshitz's theory for vacuum energy and employing a Lorentz model for the material permittivity, a non-perturbative macroscopic QED model was built that accounts for the infinite number of cavity modes with a continuum of their wavevectors. Differences from the commonly used single-mode Hopfield Hamiltonian are revealed. The non-resonant role of polaritons in the ground-state energy shift is also demonstrated, showing that the cavity effect is mainly caused by static screening occurring at very low frequencies. The theory allows for a straightforward incorporation of losses and temperature effects.</description>

      <title>Laser-enhanced quantum sensing boosts sensitivity and dynamic range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetometers based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as the most important solid-state quantum sensors. However, ensembles are limited in optical contrast to typically a few percent and high-sensitivity variants usually possess only a few $\mathrm{\mu}$T dynamic range. Here, we demonstrate a laser threshold magnetometry-based NV system that avoids these limitations. By integrating the NV centers into a laser cavity and showing magnetic-field-dependent shifts of the laser threshold, we observe 100\,\% contrast with strong output signals up to 50\,mW. The resulting system exhibits a dynamic range of $\pm$280\,$\mathrm{\mu}$T with a photon-shot-noise-limited sensitivity of 670\,fT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, which we demonstrate to improve super-linearly with contrast. The ratio of these sensing-relevant parameters, that can be traded at the cost of each other, marks an improvement factor of 780 over typical fluorescence-based readout and vapor cell sensors. Such performance improvements open the door to new generations of sensors for applications including magnetoencephalography, magnetic navigation, and magnetic anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic preparation of thermal states and entropy-noise relation on noisy quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of preparing thermal equilibrium states at finite temperature on quantum computers. Assuming thermalization, we show that states that are locally at thermal equilibrium can be prepared by evolving adiabatically an initial thermal Gibbs state of a simple Hamiltonian with an interpolating time-dependent Hamiltonian, identically to adiabatic ground state preparation. We argue that the entropy density of local density matrices is conserved during the adiabatic evolution, so that both the entropy and energy of the final state can be computed, and thus the final temperature too. We show that in the presence of hardware noise, the entropy created by the noisy evolution can be evaluated with mirror circuits. We give numerical evidence that the resulting thermal state preparation protocol is noise-resilient, in the sense that the energy-temperature curve measured on a noisy quantum computer is remarkably insensitive to noise. We finally propose a protocol to estimate the lack of adiabaticity in a given actual Trotter implementation of the dynamics. We test our protocol on Quantinuum's H1-1 ion-trap device. We measure that a circuit with $640$ two-qubit gates implemented on hardware generates an entropy per site of $0.166 \pm 0.0045$, giving a benchmark metric for this state preparation. We report the preparation of a thermal state with temperature $2.56 \pm 0.26$ of the Ising model in size $5\times 4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic state cultivation is a state-of-the-art protocol to prepare ultra-high fidelity non-Clifford resource states for universal quantum computation. It offers a significant reduction in spacetime overhead compared to traditional magic state distillation techniques. Cultivation protocols involve measuring a transversal logical Clifford operator on an initial small-distance code and then rapidly growing to a larger-distance code. In this work, we present a new cultivation scheme in which we measure the fold-transversal Hadamard of the unrotated surface code, and leverage unitary techniques to grow within the surface code family. Using both stabilizer and state vector simulations we find that this approach achieves the lowest known spacetime overhead for magic state cultivation. Practical implementation of our protocol is best suited to architectures with non-local connectivity, showing the strength of architectures where such connectivity is readily available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement properties of quantum states associated with directed graphs. Using a measure derived from the Fubini-Study metric, we quantitatively relate multipartite entanglement to the local connectivity of the graph. In \emph{Entanglement in Directed Graph States}, (2025), arXiv:2505.10716, it is demonstrated that the vertex degree distribution fully determines this entanglement measure and remains invariant under vertex relabeling, highlighting its topological character. As a consequence, the measure depends only on the total degree of each vertex, making it independent of the distinction between incoming and outgoing edges. We apply our framework to several specific graph structures, including hierarchical networks, neural network-inspired graphs, full binary tree and linear bridged cycle graphs, demonstrating how their combinatorial properties influence entanglement distribution. These results provide a geometric perspective on quantum correlations in complex systems, offering potential applications in the design and analysis of quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Cultivating T states on the surface code with only two-qubit gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity T magic states are a key requirement for fault-tolerant quantum computing in 2D. It has generally been assumed that preparing high-fidelity T states requires noisy injection of T states followed by lengthy distillation routines. This assumption has been recently challenged by the introduction of cultivation, in which careful state injection and postselection alone are used to prepare T states close to the fidelity required for quantum algorithms. Cultivation was originally proposed for the color code, but can also be done on the $RP^2$ code, a code similar to the surface code.
  In this work, we demonstrate how to cultivate T states directly on the surface code. Besides its simplicity compared to color or $RP^2$ cultivation, surface code cultivation offers a number of advantages, including: (1) It is more directly compatible with neutral atom architectures than ${RP}^2$ cultivation (2) Cultivated surface code states can be used in transversal CNOT gates with other surface codes, unlike color code states (3) Surface code cultivation can be done at any distance, unlike color and ${RP}^2$ cultivation which requires odd distances. Under a standard depolarizing error model, our $d=3,\ (4),\ (5)$ cultivation circuit reaches an error rate of $1\cdot 10^{-6},\ (1\cdot10^{-8}),\ (2\cdot10^{-9})$ and an acceptance rate of $34\%,\ (6\%),\ (1\%)$, meeting or exceeding the fidelity of color and $RP^2$ cultivation with comparable acceptance rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uhlmann's theorem is a fundamental result in quantum information theory that quantifies the optimal overlap between two bipartite pure states after applying local unitary operations (called Uhlmann transformations). We show that optimal Uhlmann transformations are rigid -- in other words, they must be unique up to some well-characterized degrees of freedom. This rigidity is also robust: Uhlmann transformations achieving near-optimal overlaps must be close to the unique optimal transformation (again, up to well-characterized degrees of freedom). We describe two applications of our robust rigidity theorem: (a) we obtain better interactive proofs for synthesizing Uhlmann transformations and (b) we obtain a simple, alternative proof of the Gowers-Hatami theorem on the stability of approximate representations of finite groups.</description>

      <title>Magic for Hybrid Boson-Fermion Systems: A Grassmann Phase-Space Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness enables universality beyond Gaussian/Clifford dynamics, yet no resource theory exists for systems combining bosonic and fermionic modes. Using the Grassmann approach of Cahill and Glauber, we develop a phase-space framework defining hybrid magic via the $L_p$ norm of a hybrid Wigner function. We demonstrate it in the Holstein polaron, where phonon-electron coupling enhances magic growth, and in the fermionic Jaynes-Cummings model, examining dependence on atomic and cavity states. At the gate level, we define the non-stabilizer power of hybrid operations and derive a closed-form result for the conditional displacement gate. This establishes a unified quantification of non-stabilizerness in realistic hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Excitable quantum systems: the bosonic avalanche laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a lasing system that is driven by a current of bosonic (quasi-) particles via a dissipative three-mode mixing process. A semi-classical analysis of this system predicts distinct dynamical regimes, where both the cavity mode and the gain medium can undergo lasing transitions. Of particular interest is an intermediate self-pulsing phase that exhibits the characteristics of an excitable system and converts random input signals into separated, quasi-periodic pulses at the output. By performing exact Monte-Carlo simulations, we extend this analysis into the quantum regime and show that despite being dominated by huge bosonic particle number fluctuations, this effect of coherence resonance survives even for rather low average photon numbers. Our system thus represents a intriguing model for an excitable quantum many-body system with practical relevance for quantum detectors or autonomous quantum machines. As an illustration, we discuss the realization of this system with superconducting quantum circuits and its application as a number-resolved avalanche detector for microwave photons.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of the variational quantum eigensolver and quantum optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When does a variational quantum algorithm converge to a globally optimal problem solution? Despite the large literature around variational approaches to quantum computing, the answer is largely unknown. We address this open question by developing a convergence theory for the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). By leveraging the terminology of quantum control landscapes, we prove a sufficient criterion that characterizes when convergence to a ground state of a Hamiltonian can be guaranteed for almost all initial parameter settings. More specifically, we show that if (i) a parameterized unitary transformation allows for moving in all tangent-space directions (local surjectivity) in a bounded manner and (ii) the gradient descent used for the parameter update terminates, then the VQE converges to a ground state almost surely. We develop constructions that satisfy both aspects of condition (i) and analyze two commonly employed families of quantum circuit ans\"atze. Finally, we discuss regularization techniques for guaranteeing gradient descent to terminate, as for condition (ii), and draw connections to the halting problem.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Statistics for Bosonic Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12444v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics opens new frontiers in quantum statistics and enriches the schemes for topological quantum computing. In this work, we propose a novel type of SPNA statistics in one-dimensional strongly correlated bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and reveal its exotic universal features through a comprehensive investigation. Specifically, we show a universal result for a wide range of bosonic SPT phases described by real Hamiltonians: the SPNA statistics of topological zero modes fall into two distinct classes. The first class exhibits conventional braiding statistics of hard-core bosons. Furthermore, we discover a second class of unconventional braiding statistics, featuring a fractionalization of the first class and reminiscent of the non-Abelian statistics of symmetry-protected Majorana pairs. The two distinct classes of statistics have a topological origin in the classification of non-Abelian Berry phases in braiding processes of real-Hamiltonian systems, distinguished by whether the holonomy involves a reflection operation. To illustrate, we focus on a specific bosonic SPT phase with particle number conservation and particle-hole symmetry, and demonstrate that both classes of braiding statistics can be feasibly realized in a tri-junction with the aid of a controlled local defect. In this example, the zero modes are protected by unitary symmetries and are therefore immune to dynamical symmetry breaking. Numerical results support our theoretical predictions. We demonstrate how to encode logical qubits and implement both single- and two-qubit gates using the two classes of SPNA statistics. Finally, we propose feasible experimental schemes to realize these SPNA statistics, paving the way for experimental validation of our predictions and their application in quantum information science.</description>

Abstract: We develop a high-parametric-gain SU(1,1) interferometer based on an aperiodically poled Potassium Titanyl Phosphate (apKTP) crystal, enabling frequency-domain low-coherence interferometry with undetected mid-infrared photons. The system achieves a signal-to-noise ratio as high as 40 dB and axial resolution of 30 $\mu$m, with a 3 $\mu$m-centered idler beam. By increasing the poling-period range, we also improve the axial resolution to 17 $\mu$m, demonstrating a straightforward route to enhance the performance by working on the crystal design</description>

      <title>From Faraday and Maxwell to Quantum Physics. The later story of the Electromagnetic Vector Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of quantum mechanics by Heisenberg in 1925 exactly a century ago, the quantization of the electromagnetic field became an important goal for our founding fathers, whom we are here to celebrate. It was realized very soon that a consistent picture of quantum electrodynamics (QED) requires the quantization of not just the electromagnetic field ${\bf A}({\bf r},t)$, but the electron field ${\bf \psi}({\bf r},t)$ as well. The electron field is now a Dirac spinor field and it becomes a major partner for the vector potential. Together these two fields form a duet which yearns for a unification which is not often emphasized in text books, but no one knows how to do this yet. The underlying structure appears to be a super-symmetric one where bosons and fermions live comfortably as a single field that could by some yet unknown process produce QED. This area is still at the forefront of current research with names like Super-symmetric Quantum Electrodynamics (SQED), strings and others. Ironically for a variety of reasons, the number of fields in SQED has to be increased and not decreased, defying the objective of an economical unification. Furthermore it is now known that Maxwell's theory is incomplete and that there are situations due to boundaries or topology that demand the vector potential must itself be gauge invariant.
  (This paper is dedicated to the celebration of 100 years of quantum mechanics, on the anniversary of Heisenberg's founding paper on the subject in July 1925, delivered by Miguel Ortu\~no at the IQSA 2025 Conference at Tropea in Calabria, Italy from 30 June to 4th July 2025. The proceedings will be published as a celebratory volume by World Scientific Publications, Singapore in 2026).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that non-invertible symmetry protected topological phases (SPT), due to the lack of a stacking structure, do not have symmetric entanglers (globally symmetric finite-depth quantum circuits) connecting them. Using topological holography, we argue that a symmetric entangler should in fact exist for $1+1$d systems whenever the non-invertible symmetry has SPT phases connected by fixed-charge dualities (FCD). Moreover, we construct an explicit example of a symmetric entangler for the two SPT phases with $\mathrm{Rep}(A_4)$-symmetry, as a matrix product unitary (MPU).</description>

      <title>A systematic search for conformal field theories in very small spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Groundstates of 1+1d conformal field theories (CFTs) satisfy a local entropic condition called the vector fixed point equation. This condition is surprisingly well satisfied by groundstates of quantum critical lattice models even at small system sizes. We perform a search in the space of states of very small systems (four qubits and four qutrits) and examine the states that satisfy this condition. By reconstructing a local Hamiltonian from each state, we are able to identify many of these solutions with known CFTs; others are gapped fixed points, or involve large relevant perturbations, and others are CFTs we have not yet identified. These ideas are also useful for identifying continuous quantum phase transitions in a given family of Hamiltonians, and for identifying the nature of the critical theory in small systems.</description>

      <title>Simulated Laser Cooling and Magneto-Optical Trapping of Group IV Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scheme for laser cooling and magneto-optical trapping of the Group IV (a.k.a. Group 14 or tetrel) atoms silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), tin (Sn), and lead (Pb). These elements each possess a strong Type-II transition ($J \rightarrow J' = J-1$) between the metastable $s^2p^2 \,^3 P_1$ state and the excited $s^2ps'\, ^3P_0^o$ state at an accessible laser wavelength, making them amenable to laser cooling and trapping. We focus on the application of this scheme to Sn, which has several features that make it attractive for precision measurement applications. We perform numerical simulations of atomic beam slowing, capture into a magneto-optical trap (MOT), and subsequent sub-Doppler cooling and compression in a blue-detuned MOT of Sn atoms. We also discuss a realistic experimental setup for realizing a high phase-space density sample of Sn atoms.</description>

      <title>Reduced density matrix description of high-harmonic generation in multi-electron atoms: exploring sub-cycle correlation effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) is one of the fundamental processes at the heart of attosecond physics. Traditionally viewed as an effective single-particle effect, recent advances have focused on contributions beyond this single-particle picture to the harmonic spectrum, as well as on probing electron correlations through HHG in atoms, molecules, and solids. In this paper, we introduce a reduced density matrix description to explore and to quantify correlation effects on a sub-cycle time scale and apply this approach to prototypical multi-electron atoms. By comparing noble gas atoms (He, Ne) with alkaline earth atoms (Be, Mg) exposed to driving fields with similar Keldysh parameters, we show that the sub-cycle variation of correlation parameters differs markedly for noble gases and alkaline earth atoms. We provide an intuitive explanation of these surprising effects based on the dynamics of natural orbitals and discuss the effect of this ultrafast correlation dynamics on the HHG spectrum.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Equations of Motion Solved with the Multiconfigurational Ehrenfest Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Being a numerically exact method for the simulation of dynamics in open quantum systems, the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) still suffers from the curse of dimensionality. In this study, we propose a novel MCE-HEOM method, which introduces the multiconfigurational Ehrenfest (MCE) ansatz to the second quantization formalism of HEOM. Here, the MCE equations of motion are derived from the time-dependent variational principle in a composed Hilbert-Liouville space, and each MCE coherent-state basis can be regarded as having an infinite hierarchical tier, such that the truncation tier of auxiliary density operators in MCE-HEOM can also be considered to be infinite. As demonstrated in a series of representative spin-boson models, our MCE-HEOM significantly reduces the number of variational parameters and could efficiently handle the strong non-Markovian effect, which is difficult for conventional HEOM due to the requirement of a very deep truncation tier. Compared with MCE, MCE-HEOM reduces the number of effective bath modes and circumvents the initial samplings for finite temperature, eventually resulting in a huge reduction of computational cost.</description>

      <title>Experiment to test the incompleteness of quantum mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For almost 100 years, the incompleteness of quantum formalism and the probabilistic nature of measurement have been debated without any experiment being able to settle these questions. There exist contingent quantum interpretations that share the same mathematical formalism but have contradictory world views. In double-slit interference experiments, standard quantum theory does not take particle size into account, which is not the case in de Broglie's double solution theory. We use the large size of Rydberg atoms to propose an experiment to test the incompleteness of the standard quantum formalism. We present an interference experiment with asymmetric slits, a large slit that allows Rydberg atoms to pass through and a grating of small slits that do not. We show with numerical simulations that the transmission densities in the standard interpretation and in the double solution interpretation give very different results (one peak instead of two). Experimental implementation now seems possible and would be a crucial test between these two interpretations.</description>

Abstract: An entropy function is proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 251602] as a way to detect criticality even when the system size is small. In this note we apply this strategy in the search for criticality of lattice transfer matrices constructed based on the topological holographic principle. We find that the combination of strategy is indeed a cost-effective and efficient way of identifying critical boundary conditions, estimating central charges and moreover, plotting entire phase diagrams in a multi-dimensional phase space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent macroscopic descriptions of matter, such as hydrodynamics, are central to our description of complex physical systems across a wide spectrum of energy scales. The conventional understanding of these many-body phenomena has recently been shaken by a number of experimental findings. Collective behavior of matter has been observed in \emph{mesoscopic} systems, such as high-energy hadron-hadron collisions, or ultra-cold gases with only few strongly interacting fermions. In such systems, the separation of scales between macroscopic and microscopic dynamics (at the heart of any effective theory) is inapplicable. To address the conceptual challenges that arise from these observations and explore the universality of emergent descriptions of matter, the EMMI Rapid Reaction Task Force was assembled. This document summarizes the RRTF discussions on recent theoretical and experimental advances in this rapidly developing field. Leveraging technological breakthroughs in the control of quantum systems, we can now quantitatively explore what it means for a system to exhibit behavior beyond the sum of its individual parts. In particular, the report highlights how the (in)applicability of hydrodynamics and other effective theories can be probed across three principal frontiers: the size frontier, the equilibrium frontier, and the interaction frontier.</description>

      <title>Supersolidity induced flux magnetism with magnetic atoms in an anti-magic wavelength optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersolidity and magnetism are fundamental phenomena characterizing strongly correlated states of matter. Here, we unveil a mechanism that establishes a direct connection between these quantum regimes and can be experimentally accessed in ultracold atomic systems. Specifically, we exploit the distinctive properties of ultracold magnetic lanthanide atoms trapped in a one dimensional anti-magic wavelength optical lattice. This allows us to design a realistic implementation of a triangular Bose-Hubbard ladder featuring two essential ingredients: strong long-range interactions and tunable gauge fields. Thanks to these unconventional properties, our numerical analysis highlights that, among the others, a robust lattice supersolid regime with finite fluxes in each triangular plaquette occurs. Remarkably, we show that the specific density distribution of the supersolid phase leads to the magnetic ordering of fluxes, which can form ferrimagnetic and ferromagnetic structures. Our results thus discover a fascinating quantum mechanical effect that bridges supersolidity and magnetism.</description>

      <title>Efficient iPEPS Simulation on the Honeycomb Lattice via QR-based CTMRG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a QR-based corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) framework for contracting infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) on honeycomb lattices. Our method explicitly uses the lattice's native C3v symmetry at each site, generalizing QR-based acceleration (previously limited to square lattices) to enable efficient and stable contractions. This approach achieves order-of-magnitude speedups over conventional singular value decomposition (SVD)-based CTMRG while maintaining high numerical precision. Comprehensive benchmark calculations for the spin-1/2 Heisenberg and Kitaev models demonstrate higher computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. We further employ our method to study the Kitaev-Heisenberg model, where we provide numerical evidence for the universal 1/r^4 decay of the dimer-dimer correlation function within the quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. Our work establishes a framework for extending QR-based CTMRG to other lattice geometries, opening new avenues for studying exotic quantum phases with tensor networks.</description>

      <title>Topology and criticality in non-Hermitian multimodal optical resonators through engineered losses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian topological matter provides a platform for engineering phenomena that go beyond the capabilities of Hermitian systems, enabling the use of losses to engineer topological phenomena. Non-Hermitian models often rely on artificial platforms made of engineered lattices because controlling losses in natural compounds is challenging. Although typical models for non-Hermitian photonic matter are often single mode, photonic systems are often multimodal, producing mixing between different normal modes in each site. In this work, we explore a generalized family of multimodal non-Hermitian lattices, featuring multiple resonant modes. We show that these multimodal models are capable of featuring topological modes and criticality, similar to the artificial single-mode models often considered. We analyze the robustness of these non-Hermitian topological modes to fluctuation of local losses, disorder, and artificial gauge field. We show that these effects can be captured via both a full microscopic model and effective multiorbital models. Specifically, we show that due to their multiorbital nature, the localization properties of non-Hermitian multiorbital models can be controlled by an external gauge field. Our results demonstrate that internal orbital degrees of freedom provide a promising strategy to engineer controllable non-Hermitian topology and criticality.</description>

      <title>Model predictive quantum control: A modular approach for efficient and robust quantum optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is one of the most successful modern control methods. It relies on repeatedly solving a finite-horizon optimal control problem and applying the beginning piece of the optimal input. In this paper, we develop a modular framework for improving efficiency and robustness of quantum optimal control (QOC) via MPC. We first provide a tutorial introduction to basic concepts of MPC from a QOC perspective. We then present multiple MPC schemes, ranging from simple approaches to more sophisticated schemes which admit stability guarantees. This yields a modular framework which can be used 1) to improve efficiency of open-loop QOC and 2) to improve robustness of closed-loop quantum control by incorporating feedback. We demonstrate these benefits with numerical results, where we benchmark the proposed methods against competing approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the spin density matrix of a heavy quark-antiquark pair ($b\bar{b}$, $c\bar{c}$ or $s\bar{s}$) diffractively produced in Deep Inelastic Scattering and Ultraperipheral Collisions. We show that the Pomeron exchange leaves characteristic imprints on the entanglement pattern between the quark and the antiquark. For the longitudinally polarized virtual photon, the pair always exhibits maximal entanglement and maximal violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. For the transversely polarized photon, the pair is always entangled and Bell-violating, reaching maximal entanglement and maximal violation simultaneously when the transverse momentum approximately equals the quark mass.</description>

      <title>Efficient optical configurations for trapped-ion entangling gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity and parallel realization in scalable platforms of the two-qubit entangling gates fundamental to universal quantum computing constitutes one of the largest challenges in implementing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Integrated optical addressing of trapped-ion qubits offers routes to scaling the high-fidelity optical control demonstrated to date in small systems. Here we show that in addition to scaling, capabilities practically enabled by integrated optics can substantially alleviate laser powers required for both light-shift (LS) and Molmer-Sorensen (MS) geometric phase gates acting on long-lived ground-state qubit encodings in a broad range of ion species. In the proposed gate schemes utilizing carrier nulling via ion positioning at phase-stable standing-wave (SW) nodes, our calculations suggest that suppressed spontaneous photon scattering at the SW node allows for gate drives operating at smaller Raman detunings, resulting in approximately an order-of-magnitude reduction in power requirement (and significantly larger in certain parameter regimes) for gates of a given duration and scattering-limited fidelity as compared to conventional running wave (RW)-based approaches. The SW schemes have the additional benefit of simultaneously eliminating undesired coherent couplings that typically limit gate speeds. Our work quantifies power requirements for multiple ion species and enhancements to be expected from carrier-nulled configurations practically enabled by integrated delivery, and informs experiments and systems for realization of fast and power-efficient laser-based entangling gates in scalable platforms.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Circuit Learning of Born Machine: Towards Realization of Amplitude Embedding and Quantum Data Loading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum data loading plays a central role in quantum algorithms and quantum information processing. Many quantum algorithms hinge on the ability to prepare arbitrary superposition states as a subroutine, with claims of exponential speedups often predicated on access to an efficient data-loading oracle. In practice, constructing a circuit to prepare a generic $n$-qubit quantum state typically demands computational efforts scaling as $\mathcal{O}(2^n)$, posing a significant challenge for quantum algorithms to outperform their classical counterparts. To address this critical issue, various hybrid quantum-classical approaches have been proposed. However, many of these solutions favor simplistic circuit architectures, which are susceptible to substantial optimization challenges.
  In this study, we harness quantum circuits as Born machines to generate probability distributions. Drawing inspiration from methods used to investigate electronic structures in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics, we propose a framework called Adaptive Circuit Learning of Born Machine, which dynamically expands the ansatz circuit. Our algorithm is designed to selectively integrate two-qubit entangled gates that best capture the intricate entanglement present within the target state. Empirical experiments underscore the efficacy of our approach in encoding real-world data through amplitude embedding, demonstrating not only compliance with but also enhancement over the performance benchmarks set by prior research.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Quantum Processing Unit: An Autonomous Thermal Computing Machine &amp; its Physical Limitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computation is an input-output process, where a program encoding a problem to be solved is inserted into a machine that outputs a solution. Quantum computation conventionally relies on classical, external control outside the quantum computer to execute a program, obscuring computational and thermodynamic resources required. To understand the fundamental limits of computation, however, it is pivotal to work with a fully self-contained description of a quantum computation, modeling the resources on the same footing as the computation itself. By developing a framework that we dub the autonomous Quantum Processing Unit (aQPU) we model quantum computation in the framework of autonomous thermal machines. Consisting of an internal quantum timekeeping mechanism, instruction register and memory system the aQPU allows investigating relationships between thermodynamic cost, complexity, speed and fidelity of a desired quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Expansion of higher-dimensional cubical complexes with application to quantum locally testable codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a high-dimensional cubical complex, for any dimension t&gt;0, and apply it to the design of quantum locally testable codes. Our complex is a natural generalization of the constructions by Panteleev and Kalachev and by Dinur et. al of a square complex (case t=2), which have been applied to the design of classical locally testable codes (LTC) and quantum low-density parity check codes (qLDPC) respectively.
  We turn the geometric (cubical) complex into a chain complex by relying on constant-sized local codes $h_1,\ldots,h_t$ as gadgets. A recent result of Panteleev and Kalachev on existence of tuples of codes that are product expanding enables us to prove lower bounds on the cycle and co-cycle expansion of our chain complex.
  For t=4 our construction gives a new family of "almost-good" quantum LTCs -- with constant relative rate, inverse-polylogarithmic relative distance and soundness, and constant-size parity checks. Both the distance of the quantum code and its local testability are proven directly from the cycle and co-cycle expansion of our chain complex.</description>

      <title>Localized statistics decoding for quantum low-density parity-check codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check codes are a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computing with considerably reduced overhead compared to the surface code. However, the lack of a practical decoding algorithm remains a barrier to their implementation. In this work, we introduce localized statistics decoding, a reliability-guided inversion decoder that is highly parallelizable and applicable to arbitrary quantum low-density parity-check codes. Our approach employs a parallel matrix factorization strategy, which we call on-the-fly elimination, to identify, validate, and solve local decoding regions on the decoding graph. Through numerical simulations, we show that localized statistics decoding matches the performance of state-of-the-art decoders while reducing the runtime complexity for operation in the sub-threshold regime. Importantly, our decoder is more amenable to implementation on specialized hardware, positioning it as a promising candidate for decoding real-time syndromes from experiments.</description>

Abstract: We classify quantum cellular automata whose cells are qubits, on hypercubic lattices $\mathbb Z^s$, with the von Neumann neighborhood scheme, in terms of realizability as finite-depth quantum circuits. We show the most general structure of such automata and use its characterisation to simulate a few steps of evolution and evaluate the rate of entanglement production between one cell and its surroundings.</description>

      <title>Towards violations of Local Friendliness with quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15302v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local Friendliness (LF) inequalities follow from seemingly reasonable assumptions about reality: (i) ``absoluteness of observed events'' (e.g., every observed event happens for all observers) and (ii) ``local agency'' (e.g., free choices can be made uncorrelated with other events outside their future light cone). Extended Wigner's Friend Scenario (EWFS) thought experiments show that textbook quantum mechanics violates these inequalities. Thus, experimental evidence of these violations would make these two assumptions incompatible. In [Nature Physics 16, 1199 (2020)], the authors experimentally implemented an EWFS, using a photonic qubit to play the role of each of the ``friends'' and measured violations of LF. One may question whether a photonic qubit is a physical system that counts as an ``observer'' and thereby question whether the experiment's outcome is significant. Intending to measure increasingly meaningful violations, we propose using a statistical measure called the ``branch factor'' to quantify the ``observerness'' of the system. We then encode the EWFS as a quantum circuit such that the components of the circuit that define the friend are quantum systems of increasing branch factor. We run this circuit on quantum simulators and hardware devices, observing LF violations as the system sizes scale. As errors in quantum computers reduce the significance of the violations, better quantum computers can produce better violations. Our results extend the state of the art in proof-of-concept experimental violations from branch factor 0.0 to branch factor 16.0. This is an initial result in an experimental program for measuring LF violations at increasingly meaningful branch factors using increasingly more powerful quantum processors and networks. We introduce this program as a fundamental science application for near-term and developing quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Classical optimization with imaginary time block encoding on quantum computers: The MaxCut problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization problems in finance, physics and computer science are typically very hard to tackle in classical computing and quantum computing could help speed up computations and provide efficient methods for tackling large problems. Typically, to treat the problem with a quantum computer, the optimal solution is cast as the ground state of a diagonal Hamiltonian. We develop a new method, called ITE-BE, based on a recent imaginary time algorithm, which requires no variational parameter optimization as all parameters can be derived analytically from the target Hamiltonian. We also demonstrate that our method can be successfully combined with other quantum algorithms such as quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). For illustration, here we study the MaxCut problem. We find that the QAOA ansatz increases the post-selection success of ITE-BE, and shallow QAOA circuits, when boosted with ITE-BE, achieve better performance than deeper QAOA circuits. For the special case of the transverse initial state, we adapt our block encoding scheme to allow for a deterministic application of the first layer of the circuit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00923v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement structure of a generic $M$-particle Bethe wavefunction (not necessarily an eigenstate of an integrable model) on a 1d lattice by dividing the lattice into $L$ parts and decomposing the wavefunction into a sum of products of $L$ local wavefunctions. Using the fact that a Bethe wavefunction accepts a \textit{fractal} multipartite decomposition -- it can always be written as a linear combination of $L^M$ products of $L$ local wavefunctions, where each local wavefunction is in turn also a Bethe wavefunction -- we then build \textit{exact, analytical} tensor network representations with finite bond dimension $\chi=2^M$, for a generic planar tree tensor network (TTN), which includes a matrix product states (MPS) and a regular binary TTN as prominent particular cases. For a regular binary tree, the network has depth $\log_{2}(N/M)$ and can be transformed into an adaptive quantum circuit of the same depth, composed of unitary gates acting on $2^M$-dimensional qudits and mid-circuit measurements, that deterministically prepares the Bethe wavefunction. Finally, we put forward a much larger class of \textit{generalized} Bethe wavefunctions, for which the above decompositions, tensor network and quantum circuit representations are also possible.</description>

Abstract: Highly correlated biphoton states are powerful resources in quantum optics, both for fundamental tests of the theory and practical applications. In particular, high-dimensional spatial correlation has been used in several quantum information processing and sensing tasks, for instance, in ghost imaging experiments along with several quantum key distribution protocols. Here, we introduce a technique that exploits spatial correlations, whereby one can nonlocally access the result of an arbitrary unitary operator on an arbitrary input state without the need to perform any operation themselves. The method is experimentally validated on a set of spatially periodic unitary operations in one-dimensional and two-dimensional spaces. Our findings pave the way for efficiently distributing quantum simulations and computations in future instances of quantum networks where users with limited resources can nonlocally access the results of complex unitary transformations via a centrally located quantum processor.</description>

      <title>System-environmental entanglement in critical spin systems under $ZZ$-decoherence and its relation to strong and weak symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open quantum many-body systems exhibit nontrivial behavior under decoherence. In particular, system-environmental entanglement (SEE) is one of the efficient quantities for classifying mixed states subject to decoherence. In this work, we investigate the SEE of critical spin chains under nearest-neighbor $ZZ$-decoherence. We numerically show that the SEE exhibits a specific scaling law, in particular, its system-size-independent term (``$g$-function'') changes drastically its behavior in the vicinity of phase transition caused by decoherence. For the XXZ model in its gapless regime, a transition diagnosed by strong R\'{e}nyi-2 correlations occurs as the strength of the decoherence increases. We determine the location of the phase transition by investigating the $g$-function that exhibits a sharp change in the critical region of the transition. Furthermore, we find that the value of the SEE is twice that of the system under single-site $Z$-decoherence, which was recently studied by conformal field theory. From the viewpoint of R\'{e}nyi-2 Shannon entropy}, which is closely related to the SEE at the maximal decoherence, we clarify the origin of this $g$-function behavior.</description>

Abstract: We propose a singlet-only always-on gapless exchange (SAGE) spin qubit that encodes a single qubit in the spins of four electrons while allowing universal baseband control. While conventional exchange-only qubits suffer from magnetic-field-gradient-induced leakage and coherent errors, for instance due to local nuclear environments and variations in the $g$-factor, the SAGE qubit subspace is protected from coherent errors due to local magnetic field gradients and leakage out of the computational subspace is energetically suppressed due to the exchange interactions between electrons being always-on. Consequently, we find that when magnetic gradient noise dominates over charge noise, coherence times and single-qubit gate infidelities of the SAGE qubit improve by an order of magnitude compared to conventional exchange-only qubits. Moreover, using realistic parameters, two-qubit gates can be performed with a single interqubit exchange pulse with times comparable in duration to conventional exchange-only qubits but with a significantly simplified pulse sequence.</description>

      <title>Multiparticle Quantum Heat Engine: Exploring the Impact of Criticality on Efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems present substantial technical challenges from both analytical and numerical perspectives. Despite these difficulties, some progress has been made, including studies of interacting atomic gases and interacting quantum spins. Furthermore, the potential for criticality to enhance engine performance has been demonstrated, suggesting a promising direction for future investigation. Here, we explore the performance of a quantum Otto cycle using a long-range Ising chain as the working substance. We consider an idealized cycle consisting of two adiabatic transformations and two perfect thermalizations, eliminating dissipation. Analyzing both engine and refrigerator modes, we investigate the influence of particle number, varied from 10 to 100, on efficiencies and behavior near the critical point of the phase transition, which we characterize using a scaling factor. We also examine how internal factors; specifically, the power-law exponent, the number of particles, and the hot and cold reservoir temperatures, affect the system's operation in different modes. Our results reveal that these factors have a different impact compared to their classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Efficient Magic State Cultivation on the Surface Code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic state cultivation is a newly proposed protocol that represents the state of the art in magic state generation. It uses the transversality of the $H_{XY}$ gate on the 2D triangular color-code, together with a novel grafting mechanism to transform the color-code into a matchable code with minimal overhead. Still, the resulting code has a longer cycle time and some high weight stabilizers. Here, we introduce three new cultivation protocols, each yielding a different magic state. These protocols avoid grafting by exploiting transversal operations on the surface code using non-local connectivity, allowing for a much lower post-selection rates in the expansion process. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our protocol achieves state-of-the-art infidelities and acceptance rates for magic state generation, on par with another recent proposal on the $\mathbb{RP}^2$ code, while still preserving the local geometry of the surface code. Moreover, in platforms such as cold atoms and trapped ions, where idle error rates are lower than two-qubit gate errors, we demonstrate that cultivation exhibits an even greater advantage, yielding an additional order-of-magnitude reduction in resource requirements. Lastly, we analyze the effect of erasure qubits on cultivation and show that \emph{algorithmically-relevant} infidelities can be achieved using only 9 erasure qubits on a distance-2 surface code with a single cultivation round.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Qudits can be described by a state vector in a $q$-dimensional Hilbert space, enabling a more extensive encoding and manipulation of information compared to qubits. This implies that conducting fault-tolerant quantum computations using qudits rather than qubits might entail less overhead. In this work, we investigate the viability of qudits in error correction codes by creating and simulating the quantum circuitry for the smallest qudit error correction code with a multidimensional circuit-level noise model and specifically adapted decoders. After introducing a flag qudit to protect the code from hook errors, comparable error thresholds of the order of $10^{-4}$ are obtained for qudits of dimensions $2$, $3$ and $5$.</description>

      <title>Quantum metasurfaces as probes of vacuum particle content</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum vacuum of the electromagnetic field is inherently entangled across distinct spatial sub-regions, resulting in non-trivial particle content across these sub-regions. However, accessing this particle content in a controlled laboratory experiment has remained out of experimental reach. Here we propose to overcome this challenge with a quantum mirror made from a two-dimensional sub-wavelength array of atoms that divides a photonic cavity. The arrays response to light is tunable between transmissive and reflective states by a control atom that is excited to a Rydberg state. We find that photon content from entangled sub-regions of the vacuum causes subtle frequency shifts that are accessible to sub-wavelength atom array platforms. This novel approach for probing vacuum particle content stems from the systems unique ability to create coherent dynamics of superpositions of transmissive and reflective states, providing a quantum-enhanced platform for observing particle content from entangled spatial sub-regions of the electromagnetic field vacuum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feedback cooling plays a critical role in stabilizing quantum systems and achieving low temperatures, where a key question is to determine the fundamental thermodynamic limits on cooling performance. We establish a fundamental bound on quantum feedback cooling in Gaussian systems, by deriving a generalized second law of thermodynamics involving the kinetic temperatures of the system and a measure of quantum information flow obtained by continuous measurement. In contrast to previously known bounds, the obtained bound can be saturated by experimentally feasible situations using the quantum Kalman filter with a large feedback gain, where the cooling efficiency approaches its maximum. Our theoretical result is numerically demonstrated using parameters from an experiment of levitated nanoparticles. Our theory provides a general framework for understanding the thermodynamic constraints on quantum feedback cooling.</description>

      <title>Exploration of Design Alternatives for Reducing Idle Time in Shor's Algorithm: A Study on Monolithic and Distributed Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shor's algorithm is one of the most prominent quantum algorithms, yet finding efficient implementations remains an active research challenge. While many approaches focus on low-level modular arithmetic optimizations, a broader perspective can provide additional opportunities for improvement. By adopting a mid-level abstraction, we analyze the algorithm as a sequence of computational tasks, enabling systematic identification of idle time and optimization of execution flow. Building on this perspective, we first introduce an alternating design approach to minimize idle time while preserving qubit efficiency in Shor's algorithm. By strategically reordering tasks for simultaneous execution, we achieve a substantial reduction in overall execution time. Extending this approach to distributed implementations, we demonstrate how task rearrangement enhances execution efficiency in the presence of multiple distribution channels. Furthermore, to effectively evaluate the impact of design choices, we employ static timing analysis (STA) -- a technique from classical circuit design -- to analyze circuit delays while accounting for hardware-specific execution characteristics, such as measurement and reset delays in monolithic architectures and ebit generation time in distributed settings. Finally, we validate our approach by integrating modular exponentiation circuits from QRISP and constructing circuits for factoring numbers up to 64 bits. Through an extensive study across neutral atom, superconducting, and ion trap quantum computing platforms, we analyze circuit delays, highlighting trade-offs between qubit efficiency and execution time. Our findings provide a structured framework for optimizing compiled quantum circuits for Shor's algorithm, tailored to specific hardware constraints.</description>

      <title>Closing the detection loophole in the triangle network with high-dimensional photonic states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bell nonlocality without input settings, e.g. in the triangle network, has been perceived to be particularly fragile, with low robustness to noise in physical implementations. Here we show to the contrary that nonlocality based on N00N states already for $N=2$ has an exceptionally high robustness to photon loss. For the dominant noise factor, single photon loss in the transmission channels, we can certify noise robustness up to $10\%$ loss, while for a realistic noise model we use neural network-based heuristics to observe $\sim 50\%$ robustness. Moreover we show that the robustness holds even for imperfect sources based on SPDC sources, where the heralding information of the sources can be used to avoid any global post-processing of the outcomes, such as discarding rounds when photons fail to arrive, and thus demonstrate how the detection loophole in the triangle network can be closed.</description>

      <title>Gauging Quantum Phases: A Matrix Product State Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing the framework of matrix product states, we investigate gauging as a method for exploring quantum phases of matter. Specifically, we describe how symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phases in one-dimensional spin systems behave under twisted gauging, a generalization of the well-known gauging procedure for globally symmetric states. Compared to previous, order parameter-based, approaches our analysis is not limited to the case of maximally non-commutative (MNC) phases and we use our findings to propose a generalization of the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation to the non-MNC setting. A key result of our work is that gauging produces configurations characterized by a combination of MNC order and symmetry breaking, when applied to non-MNC SPT phases. More generally, we conjecture a precise correspondence between SSB and non-MNC SPT phases, possibly enabling the detection of such phases using local and string order parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent proposals for quantum proof of work protocols, we investigate approaches for simulating linear optical interferometers using digital quantum circuits. We focus on a second quantisation approach, where the quantum computer's registers represent optical modes. We can then use standard quantum optical techniques to decompose the unitary matrix describing an interferometer into an array of 2 by 2 unitaries, which are subsequently synthesised into quantum circuits and stitched together to complete the circuit. For an $m$ mode interferometer with $n$ identical photons, this method requires approximately $\mathcal{O}(m \log(n))$ qubits and a circuit depth of $\mathcal{O}(m n^4 \log_2(n) \: \textrm{polylog}(n^4 / \epsilon))$. We present a software package Aquinas (A quantum interferometer assembler) that uses this approach to generate such quantum circuits. For reference, an arbitrary five mode interferometer with two identical photons is compiled to a 10 qubit quantum circuit with a depth of 1972.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certifying a quantum state in a device independent (DI) manner, in which no trust is placed on the internal workings of any physical components, is a fundamental task bearing various applications in quantum information theory. The composability of a state certification protocol is key to its integration as a subroutine within information theoretic protocols. In this work, we present a composable certification of quantum states in a DI manner under the assumption that a source prepares a finite sequence of independent quantum states that are not necessarily identical. We show that the security relies on the DI analog of the fidelity, called the extractability. We develop methods to compute this quantity under local operations and classical communication in certain Bell scenarios that self test the singlet state, which may also be of independent interest. Finally, we demonstrate our framework by certifying the singlet state in a composable and DI manner using the Clauser Horne Shimony Holt inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional manipulations over quantum systems for such as coherent population trapping and unidirectional transfer focus on Hamiltonian engineering while regarding the system's manifold geometry and constraint equation as secondary causes. Here we treat them on equal footing in controlling a finite-dimensional quantum system under a time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, which is inspired by the D'Alembert principle of regarding active force, constraint force, and inertial force in an unbiased way. Under the biorthogonal condition, the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian could be triangularized in a constraint picture spanned by a set of completed and orthonormal basis states, which is found to be a sufficient condition to construct at least one universal nonadiabatic passage in both bra and ket spaces. The passage ends up with a desired target state that is automatically normalized without artificial normalization in the existing treatments for non-Hermitian quantum systems. Moreover, the passage is found to be robust against the parametric deviation when the real part of its global phase is rapidly varying with time. Our protocol is explicitly verified for the perfect population transfer in the two-level system and the chiral population transfer in the three-level system. It generalizes our framework of universal quantum control to the field of the biorthogonal quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the Hubbard model on a graphene hexagon: Strengths of IQPE and noise constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers transformative potential for simulating real-world materials, providing a powerful platform to investigate complex quantum systems across quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. In this work, we leverage this capability to simulate the Hubbard model on a six-site graphene hexagon using Qiskit, employing the Iterative Quantum Phase Estimation (IQPE) and adiabatic evolution algorithms to determine its ground-state properties. Our results show that a single Slater determinant is sufficient to initialize IQPE and accurately recover ground-state energies (GSEs) in small-scale Hubbard systems. In noiseless simulations, IQPE converges within a few iterations to exact GSEs, while adiabatic simulations yield charge and spin densities and correlation functions in excellent agreement with exact diagonalization. However, deploying IQPE and adiabatic evolution on today's noisy quantum hardware remains highly challenging. To investigate these limitations in IQPE, we use the Qiskit Aer simulator with a custom noise model tailored to the characteristics of IBM's real hardware. This model includes realistic depolarizing gate errors, thermal relaxation, and readout noise, allowing us to explore how these factors degrade simulation accuracy. Further, we implement the IQPE algorithm on IBM's ibm_strasbourg and ibm_fez devices for a reduced three-site Hubbard model, enabling direct comparison between simulated and real hardware noise. While ibm_fez runs closely match exact results, discrepancies highlight the gap between modeled and physical noise. This study demonstrates both the IQPE's potential and current limitations for simulating strongly correlated systems under realistic conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Useful applications of quantum information technologies can be found by identifying tasks in which quantum resources outperform their classical counterparts. In this work, we introduce a two-party communication primitive, random exclusion code (REC), which is a single-shot prepare-and-measure protocol where a sender encodes a random message into a shorter sequence and a receiver attempts to exclude a randomly chosen letter in the original message. We present quantum advantages in RECs in two ways: probability and dimension. We show that RECs with quantum resources achieve higher success probabilities than classical strategies. We verify that the quantum resources required to describe detection events of RECs have a smaller dimension than classical ones. We also show that a guessing counterpart, random access codes (RACs), may not have a dimension advantage over classical resources. Our results elucidate various possibilities of achieving quantum advantages in two-party communication.</description>

      <title>Explicit C*-algebraic Protocol for Exact Universal Embezzlement of Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an explicit construction of a universal embezzlement protocol in the C*-algebraic model of quantum information, that is equivalent to the commuting operator model. Our protocol enables exact embezzlement of arbitrary bipartite pure states using a single, fixed catalyst state. Unlike prior constructions that achieve only approximate embezzlement or require state-dependent catalysts, our approach is both exact and state-independent. The construction is explicit, based on simple *-automorphisms acting locally on infinite tensor products of CAR algebras with the underlying idea of the Hilbert hotel. In the dense-state case, the protocol naturally recovers the Type III_1 factor via the GNS construction, consistent with recent classification results. We further extend the construction to allow exact embezzlement of all states, at the cost of working with a non-separable C*-algebra. Despite the increase in algebraic size, the operational structure remains simple and localized. This offers a conceptually intuitive model for universal entanglement embezzlement in infinite-dimensional settings.</description>

Abstract: Perturbation theory is used to investigate the evolution of the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem of a bipartite quantum system under the action of a unitary matrix, in the limit where that matrix is close to the unit matrix. The physical context for such process would be scattering with weak short-ranged interactions where the unitary matrix is the S matrix. We find surprisingly simple criteria for the initial state and the S matrix that guarantee that the subsystem entropy increases. The class of initial states that meet these criteria are more correlated than simple product states of the subsystems. They form a subclass of the set of all separable states, and they can therefore be assembled by classical processes alone.</description>

Abstract: A single excitation in a quantum spin network described by the Heisenberg model can effect a variety of continuous-time quantum walks on unweighted graphs, including those governed by the discrete Laplacian, adjacency matrix, and signless Laplacian. In this paper, we show that the Heisenberg model can effect these three quantum walks on signed weighted graphs, as well as a generalized Laplacian equal to the discrete Laplacian plus a real-valued multiple of the degree matrix, for which the standard Laplacian, adjacency matrix, and signless Laplacian are special cases. We explore the algorithmic consequence of this generalized Laplacian quantum walk when searching a weighted barbell graph consisting of two equal-sized, unweighted cliques connected by a single signed weighted edge or bridge, with the search oracle constituting an external magnetic field in the spin network. We prove that there are two weights for the bridge (which could both be positive, both negative, or one of each, depending on the multiple of the degree matrix) that allow amplitude to cross from one clique to the other -- except for the standard and signless Laplacians that respectively only have one negative or positive weight bridge -- boosting the success probability from 0.5 to 0.820 or 0.843 for each weight. Moreover, one of the weights leads to a two-stage algorithm that further boosts the success probability to 0.996.</description>

Abstract: We tackle the issue of estimating dynamical parameters in quantum electrodynamics. We numerically compute the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) of physical parameters in electron-muon and Compton scattering at tree level. In particular, we consider the estimation of centre-of-mass three-momentum magnitude and polar scattering angle through measurements on the internal degrees of freedom (helicity or polarisation) of the scattered particles. Computations are carried out for pure and maximally mixed initial states. The QFIM values are then used to compute the quantum Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds on the estimations at hand. Further, we compare such ultimate bounds to the classical Fisher information of local polarisation or helicity degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian generalized eigenvalue problems (GEPs) play a significant role in many practical applications, such as mechanical engineering. Based on the generalized Schur decomposition, we propose a variational quantum algorithm for solving the GEPs in non-Hermitian systems. The algorithm transforms the generalized eigenvalue problem into a process of searching for unitary transformation matrices. We develop a method for evaluating both the loss function and its gradients on near-term quantum devices. We validate numerically the algorithm's performance through simulations, and demonstrate its application to GEPs in ocean acoustics. The algorithm's robustness is further confirmed through noise simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Informed Machine Learning for Predicting Spatiotemporal Chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19861v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum-informed machine learning (QIML) framework for the long-term dynamical behavior of high-dimensional chaotic systems. The method combines a one-time, offline-trained quantum generative model with a classical autoregressive predictor for spatiotemporal field generation. The quantum model learns a quantum prior (Q-Prior) that guides the representation of small-scale interactions and improves the modeling of fine-scale dynamics. We evaluate QIML on three representative systems: the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, the two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow, and a cross-section of fully developed three-dimensional turbulent channel flow used as a realistic inflow condition. Compared to the classical baseline, QIML yields up to 17.25% improvement in predictive distribution accuracy and a 29.36% improvement in the fidelity of the predicted full energy spectrum. For turbulent channel inflow, the Q-Prior is essential: without it, the model fails to evolve in time, while QIML produces stable, physically consistent forecasts that surpass leading machine learning models for PDEs, including the Fourier Neural Operator and Markov Neural Operator, whose errors diverge. Beyond accuracy, QIML also achieves a memory advantage, compressing multi-megabyte datasets into a kilobyte-scale Q-Prior that captures only the invariant measure needed to guide the classical model, thus circumventing Holevo's bound by avoiding full data reconstruction. Our findings provide a practical and scalable pathway for integrating the advantages brought by quantum devices into large-scale scientific, engineering modeling and simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum Fisher information, the quantum analogue of the classical Fisher information, is a central quantity in quantum metrology and quantum sensing due to its connection to parameter estimation and fidelity susceptibility. Using numerically exact methods applied to a paradigmatic open quantum system, the spin-boson model, we calculate both static and dynamical quantum Fisher information matrix elements with respect to spin-bath couplings and magnetic field strengths. As the spin-bath interaction increases, we first show that the coupling-coupling matrix elements relative to the ground state of the Hamiltonian are linked to the entanglement growth and signal the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition through their non-monotonic behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the time-dependent matrix elements can reveal non-Markovian effects as well as the transition from the coherent to incoherent regime at the Toulouse point, remaining robust under pure dephasing noise. Non-monotonic signatures of the quantum Fisher information matrix reflect changes in quantum resources such as entanglement and coherence, quantify non-Markovian behavior, and enable criticality-enhanced quantum sensing, thereby shedding light on key features of open quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: We present a realistic implementation of a quantum engine powered by a phaseonium gas of coherently prepared three-level atoms -- where quantum coherence acts as a thermodynamic resource. Using a collision model framework for phaseonium-cavity interactions and cavity optomechanics, we construct a full engine cycle based on two non-thermal reservoirs, each characterized by coherence-induced effective temperatures. This configuration enhances the efficiency of a simple optomechanical engine operating beyond standard thermal paradigms. We further address scalability by coupling a second cavity in cascade configuration, where the same phaseonium gas drives both cycles. Our results demonstrate the operational viability of coherence-driven quantum engines and their potential for future thermodynamic applications.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is the cornerstone of quantum technology and enables quantum devices to outperform classical systems in terms of performance. However, detecting entanglement in high-dimensional systems remains a significant challenge due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with the number of particles. In this work, we use machine learning to classify entangled states and separable states, focusing on the application of classical Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA). By adapting classical statistical learning techniques to quantum state discriminant analysis, we present the theoretical foundations, a practical implementation strategy, and the advantages of FLDA in this context. We systematically evaluate the performance of this method on different quantum states and demonstrate its effectiveness as a tool for efficient quantum state classification. Finally, we investigate multi-qubit quantum states with high accuracy and classify these states.</description>

      <title>Unilateral Criticality and Phase Transition in the Cavity-Ising Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superradiant phase transitions from cavity light-matter coupling have been widely explored across platforms. Here, we report a unilateral critical endpoint (UCEP) and a tricritical point (TCP) in the phase diagram of the cavity-coupled transverse Ising model with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. At zero temperature, we demonstrate that this model hosts three phases separated by two second-order and one first-order transitions. These lines intersect at a TCP and a UCEP, the latter not captured by existing phase-transition paradigms. The UCEP displays one-sided criticality: approaching the point from one side, the system behaves as a second-order transition, while from the other side it is first-order. Correspondingly, two order parameters, respectively, undergo the first- and the second-order phase transitions at the same point. We construct a minimal description of UCEP with the density of the free energy $f = c_{1}(\tilde{\alpha}^{2}+c_{2})+(\tilde{\alpha}^{2}+c_{2})^{2}\ln{\vert\tilde{\alpha}^{2}+c_{2}\vert}$, with the UCEP at $(c_{1},c_{2})=(1/e,0)$ and $\tilde{\alpha}$ being the order parameter. We further map the finite-temperature phase diagram and perform a symmetry analysis. By unifying first- and second-order signatures in a single, direction-dependent endpoint, the UCEP introduces a qualitatively new class of phase transition and may have applications in fields such as quantum measurement and quantum sensing. This work also provides an intriguing platform for exploring novel critical phenomena in cavity-coupled many-body systems with or without dissipation.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, the quantum computing method has been used to address the sign problem in traditional Monte Carlo lattice gauge theory (LGT) simulations. We propose that the Coulomb gauge (CG) should be used in quantum simulations of LGT. This is because the redundant degrees of freedom can be eliminated in CG. Therefore, the Hamiltonian in CG does not need to be gauge invariance, allowing the gauge field to be discretized naively. We point out that discretized gauge fields and fermion fields should be placed on momentum and position lattices, respectively. Under this scheme, the CG condition and Gauss's law can be conveniently preserved by solving algebraic equations of polarization vectors. We also discuss the procedure for mapping gauge fields to qubits, and then demonstrate the polynomial scaling of qubits and the complexity of time evolution. Finally, we calculate the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the U(1) plaquette operator and the Wilson loop on a classical device to test the performance of our discretization scheme.</description>

      <title>Field-sensitive dislocation bound states in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet is grown on a substrate, the interplay of momentum-dependent spin splittings arising from altermagnetism and Rashba spin-orbit coupling gives rise to a nodal band structure with band degeneracies enforced by a $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry. If we break the $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry by an exchange field, the band degeneracies are found to be immediately lifted, leading to a topological band structure characterized by nontrivial strong and weak topological indices. Remarkably, both the strong topological index and the $Z_{2}$-valued weak topological indices depend sensitively on the direction of the exchange field. As a consequence of the bulk-defect correspondence, we find that the unique dependence of weak topological indices on the exchange field in this system dictates that the presence or absence of topological bound states at lattice dislocations also depends sensitively on the direction of the exchange field. When the substrate is an $s$-wave superconductor, we find that a similar dependence of band topology on the exchange field gives rise to field-sensitive dislocation Majorana zero modes. As topological dislocation bound states are easily detectable by scanning tunneling microscopy, our findings unveil a promising experimental diagnosis of altermagnetic materials among an ever growing list of candidates.</description>

      <title>Circular dichroism on the edge of quantum Hall systems: From many-body Chern number to anisotropy measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Hall states are characterized by a topological invariant, the many-body Chern number, which determines their quantized Hall conductivity. This invariant also emerges in circular dichroic responses, namely, by applying a circular drive and comparing excitation rates for opposite orientations. This work explores the dichroic response of confined, isolated quantum Hall systems, where bulk and edge contributions cancel exactly: When the edge response is properly isolated, the circular dichroic signal becomes quantized, serving as a direct and elegant probe of the many-body Chern number encoded in the edge physics. We demonstrate that this quantized edge response is entirely captured by low-energy chiral edge modes, allowing for a universal description of this effect based on Wen's edge theory. Its low-energy nature implies that the quantized edge response can be distinguished from the bulk response in the frequency domain. The edge response is also shown to be a sensitive diagnostic of geometric features. This opens the possibility of characterizing the shape of quantum Hall droplets through edge spectroscopic measurements, without requiring knowledge of the system's boundary profile. We illustrate our findings using realistic models of integer and fractional Chern insulators, with different edge geometries, and propose detection schemes suitable for ultracold atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) magnets have opened a new avenue of opportunities encompassing various interesting phases. Co1/3TaS2-an intercalated metallic vdW antiferromagnet-is one of the latest additions to this growing list of materials due to its unique topologically nontrivial triple-Q (3Q) ground state. This 3Q tetrahedral structure, which critically depends on the Co content, yields the highest-density Skyrmion lattice with scalar spin chirality, resulting in a noticeable anomalous Hall effect. In this work, we demonstrate control of this topological phase via ionic gating. Using four CoxTaS2 devices with different Co compositions, we show that ionic gating can cover the entire 3Q topological phase and reveal the nature of the thermodynamically inaccessible phase space. Another striking finding in our data is the existence of an adiabatic discontinuity in the phase boundary between the 3Q and 1Q phases. Our work constitutes one of the first examples of electrical control of scalar spin chirality using an antiferromagnetic metal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The demand for high-performance computing in machine learning and artificial intelligence has led to the development of specialized hardware accelerators like Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). A key strategy to enhance these accelerators is the reduction of precision in arithmetic operations, which increases processing speed and lowers latency - crucial for real-time AI applications. Precision reduction minimizes memory bandwidth requirements and energy consumption, essential for large-scale and mobile deployments, and increases throughput by enabling more parallel operations per cycle, maximizing hardware resource utilization. This strategy is equally vital for solving NP-hard quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems common in machine learning, which often require high precision for accurate representation. Special hardware solvers, such as quantum annealers, benefit significantly from precision reduction. This paper introduces a fully principled Branch-and-Bound algorithm for reducing precision needs in QUBO problems by utilizing dynamic range as a measure of complexity. Experiments validate our algorithm's effectiveness on an actual quantum annealer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superradiance emerges from collective spontaneous emission in optically pumped gases, and is characterized by photon emission enhancements of up to $\frac{1}{4}N^{2}$ in an $N$ atom system. The gain mechanism derives from correlations developed within the decay medium rather than from stimulated emission as in lasing, so analog of this process should be possible for fermionic final states. We introduce here the concept of superradiant neutrino emission from a radioactive Bose Einstein condensate, which can form the basis for a superradiant neutrino laser. A plausible experimental realization based on a condensate of electron-capture isotope $^{83}$Rb could exhibit effective radioactive decay rates accelerated from 86.2 days to minutes in viably sized rubidium condensates of $10^{6}$ atoms.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the gravitational impulse by using the generalized formulation of the quantum Boltzmann equation (QBE), wherein the initial states are taken as wave packets rather than plane waves. The QBE operates within an open quantum system framework. Using this approach, we can analyze the two-body gravitational scattering by considering one body as part of the environment and the other as the system. Through this procedure, we obtain the system's impulse up to the second order for two massive objects. Similarly, we apply the forward scattering of the QBE to the gravitational impulse of a photon due to a massive object, during which we consider the photon as the system and the massive object as the environment. In this methodology, we use the QBE to compute the time evolution of the momentum operator associated with the system. While the forward scattering term vanishes when considering point particles, we demonstrate its persistence when using wave packets to describe both massive particles and the photon field. The results reported here are entirely consistent with the previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Quantum implicit representation of vortex filaments in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entangled vortex filaments are essential to turbulence, serving as coherent structures that govern nonlinear fluid dynamics and support the reconstruction of fluid fields to reveal statistical properties. This study introduces an quantum implicit representation of vortex filaments in turbulence, employing a level-set method that models the filaments as the intersection of the real and imaginary zero iso-surfaces of a complex scalar field. Describing the fluid field via the scalar field offers distinct advantages in capturing complex structures, topological properties, and fluid dynamics, while opening new avenues for innovative solutions through quantum computing platforms. The representation is reformulated into an eigenvalue problem for Hermitian matrices, enabling the conversion of velocity fields into complex scalar fields that embed the vortex filaments. The resulting optimization is addressed using a variational quantum eigensolver, with Pauli operator truncation and deep learning techniques applied to improve efficiency and reduce noise. The proposed quantum framework achieves a near-linear time complexity and a exponential storage reduction while maintaining a balance of accuracy, robustness, and versatility, presenting a promising tool for turbulence analysis, vortex dynamics research, and machine learning dataset generation.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Sensors for Ultraheavy Dark Matter Searches via Long-range Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter candidates with masses around the Planck-scale are theoretically well-motivated, and it has been suggested that it might be possible to search for dark matter solely via gravitational interactions in this mass range. In this work, we explore the pathway towards searching for dark matter candidates with masses around the Planck-scale using mechanical sensors while considering realistic experimental constraints, and develop analysis techniques needed to conduct such searches. These dark matter particles are expected to leave tracks as their signature in mechanical sensor arrays, and we show that we can effectively search for such tracks using statistical approaches to track-finding. We analyze a range of possible experimental setups and compute sensitivity projections for searches for ultraheavy dark matter coupling to the Standard Model via long-range forces. We find that while a search for Planck-scale dark matter purely via gravitational couplings would be exceedingly difficult, requiring $\sim 80\,\mathrm{dB}$ of quantum noise reduction with a $100^3$ array of devices, there is a wide range of currently unexplored dark matter candidates which can be searched for with already existing or near-term experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Blurred orbits and blurred particles: Heisenberg's 1926 helium atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work analyses the extent to which the "blurred orbits" of the current model for the atom, drafted by Heisenberg in 1926, fits the image of a bunch of wandering electrons around a nucleus. We will deal with early appearances of the concept of indistinguishable particles within the frame of quantum mechanics. There are few studies on the use of this concept in Heisenberg's 1926 papers on helium, in contrast with the large number of them on its use in Bose--Einstein's 1924 papers. We will discuss to what extent Heisenberg's approach leads to a purely statistical interpretation of this concept. We will also study the viewpoint of Dirac, who dealt with the same topic few months later. Although the indistinguishability of the electrons and indeterminacy are common explanations for the blurring of electron orbits, we argue that such an image is an oversimplification which masks interesting aspects of: a) the dynamics of bound electrons and b) the deeper implications of indistinguishability in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Kernel $k$-Medoids as General Vector Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is a widely used technique in machine learning and data compression, valued for its simplicity and interpretability. Among hard VQ methods, $k$-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approaches represent two prominent yet seemingly unrelated paradigms -- one distance-based, the other rooted in probability density matching. In this paper, we investigate their connection through the lens of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). We compare a heuristic QUBO formulation for $k$-medoids, which balances centrality and diversity, with a principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based VQ. Surprisingly, we show that the KDE-QUBO is a special case of the $k$-medoids-QUBO under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map. This reveals a deeper structural relationship between these two approaches and provides new insight into the geometric interpretation of the weighting parameters used in QUBO formulations for VQ.</description>

      <title>Tuning the the fundamental periodicity of the current-phase relation in multiterminal diffusive Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional superconductor/insulator/superconductor (SIS) Josephson junctions, devices where two superconductors are separated by a tunnel barrier are technologically important as elements in quantum circuits, particularly with their key role in superconducting qubits. An important characteristic of Josephson junctions is the relation between the supercurrent Is and the phase difference $\phi$ between them. For SIS junctions, the current-phase relation is sinusioidal and 2$\pi$ periodic. Other types of Josephson junctions, where the material between the superconductors is a weak link or a normal metal (N) may have non-sinusoidal current-phase relations that are still 2$\pi$ periodic. We show here that a multi-terminal diffusive SNS Josephson junction with 4 superconducting contacts can show a current phase relation between two of the contacts that is a superposition of 2$\pi$ and 4$\pi$ periodic components whose relative strength is controlled by the phase difference between the other two contacts, becoming 2$\pi$ or 4$\pi$ periodic for certain values of this phase difference. This tunability might have applications in tailoring the Hamiltonians of superconducting quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Inspiration, Classical Advantage: Dequantized particle algorithm for the nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a dequantization algorithm for the Vlasov--Poisson (VP) system, termed the dequantized particle algorithm, by systematically dequantizing the underlying many-body quantum theory. Starting from the second-quantized Hamiltonian description, we derive a finite-dimensional dequantized system and show that it furnishes a structure-preserving discretization of the Schr\"odinger--Poisson (SP) equations. Through the Wigner or Husimi transformations, this discretization provides an efficient approximation of the VP system when quantum effects are negligible. Unlike conventional structure-preserving algorithms formulated in 6D phase space, this dequantized particle algorithm operates in 3D configuration space, potentially offering more compact and efficient representations of physical information under appropriate conditions. A numerical example of the classical nonlinear two-stream instability, simulated using merely 97 dequantized particles, demonstrates the efficiency, accuracy, and conservation properties of the algorithm and confirms its potential as a foundation for developing quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms for kinetic plasma dynamics.</description>

      <title>Search for thermodynamically stable ambient-pressure superconducting hydrides in GNoME database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrides are considered to be one of the most promising families of compounds for achieving high temperature superconductivity. However, there are very few experimental reports of ambient-pressure hydride superconductivity, and the superconducting critical temperatures ($T_{\rm c}$) are typically less than 10 K. At the same time several hydrides have been predicted to exhibit superconductivity around 100 K at ambient pressure but in thermodynamically unfavorable phases. In this work we aim at assessing the superconducting properties of thermodynamically stable hydride superconductors at room pressure by investigating the GNoME material database, which has been recently released and includes thousands of hydrides thermodynamically stable at 0K. To scan this large material space we have adopted a multi stage approach which combines machine learning for a fast initial evaluation and cutting edge ab initio methods to obtain a reliable estimation of ($T_{\rm c}$). Ultimately we have identified 22 cubic hydrides with ($T_{\rm c}$) above 4.2~K and reach a maximum ($T_{\rm c}$) of 17 K. While these critical temperatures are modest in comparison to some recent predictions, the systems where they are found, being stable, are likely to be experimentally accessible and of potential technological relevance.</description>
