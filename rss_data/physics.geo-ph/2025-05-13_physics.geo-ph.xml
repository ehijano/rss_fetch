      <title>Dynamic Analysis of Flexible Stepping Frames for Earthquakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the nonlinear dynamics of stepping flexible frames under seismic excitation. The conventional iterative method of solution of peak quasi-dynamic displacement of stepping frames is not guaranteed to converge. To address this limitation, we present closed-form solutions and stability criteria for displacement response of stepping flexible frames. Bifurcation of displacements in response of such systems is next studied through the extension of dynamics of stepping rigid bodies. An approximate analytical expression is presented to account for the effects of moving resonance under earthquake ground motions. The closed-form solutions for displacement demand can be readily adjusted to incorporate the influence of moving resonance on the quasi-dynamic response of stepping oscillators. While the quasi-dynamic method of analysis may be useful in the early stages of design, numerical integration of the nonlinear system of differential equations of motion is recommended for the solution of dynamic response in such applications. Implications for formal limit-state analysis of stepping response are discussed, accompanied by several examples demonstrating the procedures.</description>

      <title>Accessing the dipole-multipole transition in rapidly rotating spherical shell dynamos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarity reversals are a key feature of Earth's magnetic field, yet the processes governing them are still poorly understood. Dipole reversals have been found in many numerical dynamo simulations and often occur close to the transition between dipolar and multipolar regimes. Simulated conditions are far from those in Earth's liquid iron core because of the long runtimes needed to capture polarity transitions. We develop a unidimensional path theory in an attempt to simplify the search for the dipole-multipole transition at increasingly realistic physical conditions. We build 3 paths, all based on a constant magnetic Reynolds number $Rm$; one aiming for Magnetic, Coriolis, and Archimedean (MAC), and 2 aiming for inertia-MAC force balance. We add inertia due to its role in simulated reversals. Results show reasonable agreement with predictions within the accessible parameter space, but deviate from predicted behaviour for certain quantities, e.g. magnetic field strength and magnetic/kinetic energy ratio. Further, simulations move into the dipolar non-reversing regime as they are advanced along the path. By increasing the buoyancy driving (via higher Rayleigh number) above the values predicted by the path theory, we are able to access the dipole-multipole transition down to an Ekman number $E\sim 10^{-6}$, comparable to the most extreme conditions reported to date. Results demonstrate that our approach is an efficient method for seeking the dipole-multipole transition at low $E$. However, the conditions under which we access the dipole-multipole transition become increasingly hard to access numerically and also increasingly unrealistic because $Rm$ rises beyond plausible bounds inferred from geophysical observations. Future work combining path theory with variations in the core buoyancy distribution, appears a promising approach to accessing the transition at extreme physical conditions.</description>

      <title>A thermal acid calcification cause for seasonal oscillations in the increasing Keeling curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why do atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rise and fall seasonally measured on Mauna Loa? This study explores the thermal acid-calcification (TAC) hypothesis, suggesting that seasonal temperature shifts in surface seawater trigger acid pH-driven CO2 emissions caused by calcification. Using oceanographic data, we modeled how temperature affects dissolved inorganic carbon including CO2, bicarbonate, and carbonate. Our findings reveal that warming waters absorb atmospheric CO2 by promoting calcium carbonate formation, acidifying seawater and boosting CO2 release to the atmosphere in late autumn and winter, when atmospheric CO2 becomes highest. The model predicts a net annual CO2 rise of 2 ppmv, driven by calcification rather than land-based processes. Seasonal pH swings of 0.04 units corroborate this mechanism. The TAC hypothesis indicates that continued ocean warming, not just fossil fuels, contribute to rising CO2 levels, calling for deeper investigation into marine carbon dynamics.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Antarctic sea ice thickness from sparse satellite laser altimetry data using a partial convolutional neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The persistent lack of spatially complete Antarctic sea ice thickness (SIT) data at sub-monthly resolution has fundamentally constrained the quantitative understanding of large-scale sea ice mass balance processes. In this study, a pan-Antarctic SIT dataset at 5-day and 12.5 km resolution was developed based on sparse Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat: 2003-2009) and ICESat-2 (2018-2024) along-track laser altimetry SIT retrievals using a deep learning approach. The reconstructed SIT was quantitatively validated against independent upward-looking sonar (ULS) observations and showed higher accuracy than the other four satellite-derived and reanalyzed Antarctic SIT datasets. The temporal evolution of the reconstructed SIT was further validated by ULS and ICESat-2 observations. Consistent seasonal cycles and intra-seasonal tendencies across these datasets confirm the reconstruction's reliability. Beyond advancing the mechanistic understanding of Antarctic sea ice variability and climate linkages, this reconstruction dataset's near-real-time updating capability offers operational value for monitoring and forecasting the Antarctic sea ice state.</description>

      <title>Intensification of Oceanic Inverse Energy Cascade Under Global Warming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic energy (KE) cascade in the turbulent ocean is pivotal in connecting diverse scales of oceanic motions, redistributing energy, and influencing ocean circulation and climate variability. However, its response to global warming remains poorly understood. Using a 24-year satellite altimetry dataset, we identify a pronounced intensification of inverse geostrophic kinetic energy cascade at the sea surface across most ocean regions during 1994-2017, with cascade amplitude increasing by 1% to 2% per decade. This intensification occurs not only in energetic regions but also in expansive quiescent areas. Contributing factors to this intensification of geostrophic KE cascade include enhanced vertical shear of horizontal velocity, deepened mixed layer, strengthened stratification, weakened eddy killing as well as changes in the KE budget. The dominant factors vary across regions. Our findings offer new insights into the ocean's response to global warming and improve understanding of feedback mechanisms for ocean circulation changes.</description>

      <title>Evolving dunes under flow reversals: from an initial heap toward an inverted dune</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sand dunes are ubiquitous in nature, and are found in abundance on Earth and other planetary environments. One of the most common types are crescent-shaped dunes known as barchans, whose mid-line could be assumed to behave as 2D dunes. In this work, we (i) compare the morphology of the mid-line of 3D barchans with 2D dunes; and (ii) track the evolution of 3D barchans and 2D dunes while reversing flow conditions. We performed experiments on 2D dunes in a 2D flume and Euler-Lagrange simulations of 3D bedforms. In all reversal experiments and simulations, the initial condition start with a conical heap deforming into a steady-state dune, which is then perturbed by reversing the flow, resulting in an inverted dune. We show that during the reversal the grains on the lee side immediately climb back onto the dune while its internal part and toe remain static, forming a new lee face of varying angle on the previous stoss slope. We show that (i) the characteristic time for the development of 2D dunes scales with that for 3D barchans, (ii) that the time for dune reversal is twice the time necessary to develop an initial triangular or conical heap to steady-state, and (iii) that a considerable part of grains remain static during the entire process. Our findings reveal the dynamics for dune reversal, and highlight that numerical computations of barchans based on 2D slices, which are more feasible in geophysical scales, predict realistic outcomes for the relevant time-scales.</description>

      <title>Surface tension estimation of bubble nuclei in magma using spinodal pressure and nonclassical nucleation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efforts to estimate the magma decompression rate from the vesicular texture of volcanic products have progressed through the development of theoretical models and laboratory experiments. The theoretical model is based on nucleation theory, with the surface tension between the melt and bubble nucleus being the parameter that most strongly governs nucleation. Since direct estimation of surface tension is difficult, it has been calculated by inverting the bubble number density (BND) from experimental samples using classical or nonclassical nucleation theory formulas. However, in the nonclassical case, which accounts for the supersaturation dependence of surface tension, the pressure at the spinodal limit (where surface tension becomes zero) was previously unknown, necessitating complex mathematical operations. In this study, the spinodal pressure determined from the Gibbs energy curve was substituted into the nonclassical formula by approximating the water-saturated silicate melt as a two-component symmetric regular solution composed of silicate and water. This approach allowed for a more straightforward estimation of surface tension using data from past decompression experiments. Nevertheless, the resulting surface tension values were more scattered than those obtained using the classical formula, suggesting that applying the nonclassical formula to magma vesiculation is not valid at present. Resolving this issue will likely require an integrated understanding of the dependence of surface tension on both supersaturation and bubble radius. Such understanding would enable more accurate estimation of surface tension and contribute to reconciling the discrepancy between theoretical and experimental BND values.</description>

      <title>Recognizing Salt Wave Events in Coastal Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Saltwater intrusion is a critical challenge to coastal ecosystems, impacting freshwater resources, biogeochemical cycles, and habitat stability. While relevant studies often focus on the long-term trends of salinity, its episodic variability and resulting ecological disturbance remains underexplored. Here, we introduce the concept of "coastal salt waves" - periods of elevated salinity anomalies, akin to heat waves - to better characterize extreme salinity events and emphasize their significance. Using cases studies, we show that coastal salt waves exhibit significant spatial and temporal variability based on their duration, intensity, frequency, cumulation, and timing, with drivers and impacts that may differ from gradual saltwater intrusion. In years with similar average salinity, salt waves may still vary greatly in characteristics like intensity, resulting in varying environmental impacts. Furthermore, systems without rising average salinity may still face more frequent or intense salt waves. This framework supports monitoring and management strategies to mitigate coastal salinization risks.</description>

      <title>Exact closed-form solutions for Lamb's problem (III): The case for buried source and receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we derive the exact closed-form solution for the displacement in the interior of an elastic half-space due to a buried point force with Heaviside step function time history. It is referred to as the tensor Green's function for the elastic wave equation in a uniform half-space, also a natural generalization of the classical 3-D Lamb's problem, for which previous solutions have been restricted to the cases of either the source or the receiver or both are located on the free surface. Starting from the complex integral solutions of Johnson, we follow the similar procedures presented by Feng and Zhang to obtain the closed-form expressions in terms of elementary functions as well as elliptic integrals. Numerical results obtained from our closed-form expressions agree perfectly with those of Johnson, which validates our explicit formulae conclusively.</description>

      <title>Exact closed-form solutions for Lamb's problem (II): a moving point load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we report on an exact closed-form solution for the displacement in an elastic homogeneous half-space elicited by a downward vertical point source moving with constant velocity over the surface of the medium. The problem considered here is an extension to Lamb's problem. Starting with the integral solutions of Bakker \textit{et al.}, we followed the method developed in Feng and Zhang, which focuses on the displacement triggered by a fixed point source observed on the free surface, to obtain the final solution in terms of elementary algebraic functions as well as elliptic integrals of the first, second and third kind. Our closed-form results agree perfectly with the numerical results of Bakker \textit{et al.}, which confirms the correctness of our formulas. The solution obtained in this article may lay a solid foundation for further consideration of the response of an actual physical moving load, such as a high-speed rail train.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Object Geographic Coordinate Recognition: An Attitude-Free and Reference-Free Framework via Intrinsic Linear Algebraic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Earth, a temporal complex system, is witnessing a shift in research on its coordinate system, moving away from conventional static positioning toward embracing dynamic modeling. Early positioning concentrates on static natural geographic features, with the emergence of geographic information systems introducing a growing demand for spatial data, the focus turns to capturing dynamic objects. However, previous methods typically rely on expensive devices or external calibration objects for attitude measurement. We propose an applied mathematical model that utilizes time series, the nature of dynamic object, to determine relative attitudes without absolute attitude measurements, then employs SVD-based methods for 3D coordinate recognition. The model is validated with negligible error in a numerical simulation, which is inherent in computer numerical approximations. What in follows, to assess our model in the engineering scenario, we propose a framework featuring the integration of applied mathematics with AI, utilizing only three cameras to capture an UAV. We enhance the YOLOv8 model by leveraging time series for the accurate 2D coordinate acquisitions, which is then used as input for 2D-to-3D conversion via our mathematics model. As a result, the framework demonstrates high precision, as evidenced by low error metrics including root mean square error, mean absolute error, maximum error, and a strong R-squared value. It is important to note that the mathematical method itself is inherently error-free; any observed inaccuracies are due solely to external hardware or the AI-based 2D coordinate acquisition process, which represents an improved version of the current state-of-the-art. Our framework enriches geodetic theory by providing a streamlined model for the 3D positioning of non-cooperative targets, minimizing input attitude parameters, leveraging applied mathematics and AI.</description>

      <title>Turbulence-induced anti-Stokes flow: experiments and theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report experimental evidence of an Eulerian-mean flow, $\overline{u}(z)$, created by the interaction of surface waves and tailored ambient sub-surface turbulence, which partly cancels the Stokes drift, $u_s(z)$, and present supporting theory. Water-side turbulent velocity fields and Eulerian-mean flows were measured with particle image velocimetry before vs after the passage of a wave group, and with vs without the presence of regular waves. We compare different wavelengths, steepnesses and turbulent intensities. In all cases, a significant change in the Eulerian-mean current is observed, strongly focused near the surface, where it opposes the Stokes drift. The observations support the picture that when waves encounter ambient sub-surface turbulence, the flow undergoes a transition during which Eulerian-mean momentum is redistributed vertically (without changing the depth-integrated mass transport) until a new equilibrium state is reached, wherein the near-surface ratio between $\mathrm{d}\overline{u}/\mathrm{d}z$ and $|\mathrm{d}u_s/\mathrm{d} z|$ approximately equals the ratio between the streamwise and vertical Reynolds normal stresses. This accords with a simple statistical theory derived here and holds regardless of the absolute turbulence level, whereas stronger turbulence means faster growth of the Eulerian-mean current. We present a model based on Rapid Distortion Theory which describes the generation of the Eulerian-mean flow as a consequence of the action of the Stokes drift on the background turbulence. Predictions are in qualitative, and reasonable quantitative, agreement with experiments on wave groups, where equilibrium has not yet been reached. Our results could have substantial consequences for predicting the transport of water-borne material in the oceans.</description>

      <title>FASTDASH: An Implementation of 3D Earthquake Cycle Simulation on Complex Fault Systems Using the Boundary Element Method Accelerated by H-matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fault systems have geometrically complex structures in nature, such as stepovers, bends, branches, and roughness. Many geological and geophysical studies have shown that the geometrical complexity of fault systems in nature decisively influences the initiation, arrest, and recurrence of seismic and aseismic events. However, a vast majority of models of slip dynamics are conducted on planar faults due to algorithmic limitations. We develop a 3D quasi-dynamic slip dynamics model to overcome this restriction. The calculation of the elastic response due to slip is a matrix-vector multiplication in boundary element method, which can be accelerated by using hierarchical matrices. The computational complexity is reduced from the order of O(N^2) to O(N log N), where N is the number of degree of freedoms used. We validate our code with a static crack analytical solution and the SEAS benchmark/validation exercise from Southern California Earthquake Center. We further employ this method on a realistic fault system with complex geometry that was reactivated during the 2023 Kahramanmaras - Turkiye doublet earthquakes, generating slip sequences that closely match real observations.</description>

Abstract: Different approaches to using data-driven methods for subgrid-scale closure modeling have emerged recently. Most of these approaches are data-hungry, and lack interpretability and out-of-distribution generalizability. Here, we use {online} learning to address parametric uncertainty of well-known physics-based large-eddy simulation (LES) closures: the Smagorinsky (Smag) and Leith eddy-viscosity models (1 free parameter) and the Jansen-Held (JH) backscattering model (2 free parameters). For 8 cases of 2D geophysical turbulence, optimal parameters are estimated, using ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI), such that for each case, the LES' energy spectrum matches that of direct numerical simulation (DNS). Only a small training dataset is needed to calculate the DNS spectra (i.e., the approach is {data-efficient}). We find the optimized parameter(s) of each closure to be constant across broad flow regimes that differ in dominant length scales, eddy/jet structures, and dynamics, suggesting that these closures are {generalizable}. In a-posteriori tests based on the enstrophy spectra and probability density functions (PDFs) of vorticity, LES with optimized closures outperform the baselines (LES with standard Smag, dynamic Smag or Leith), particularly at the tails of the PDFs (extreme events). In a-priori tests, the optimized JH significantly outperforms the baselines and optimized Smag and Leith in terms of interscale enstrophy and energy transfers (still, optimized Smag noticeably outperforms standard Smag). The results show the promise of combining advances in physics-based modeling (e.g., JH) and data-driven modeling (e.g., {online} learning with EKI) to develop data-efficient frameworks for accurate, interpretable, and generalizable closures.</description>
