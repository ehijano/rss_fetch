      <title>Proof-Driven Clause Learning in Neural Network Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of deep neural networks (DNNs) requires efficient techniques for safety verification. Existing methods struggle to scale to real-world DNNs, and tremendous efforts are being put into improving their scalability. In this work, we propose an approach for improving the scalability of DNN verifiers using Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) -- an approach that has proven highly successful in SAT and SMT solving. We present a novel algorithm for deriving conflict clauses using UNSAT proofs, and propose several optimizations for expediting it. Our approach allows a modular integration of SAT solvers and DNN verifiers, and we implement it on top of an interface designed for this purpose. The evaluation of our implementation over several benchmarks suggests a 2X--3X improvement over a similar approach, with specific cases outperforming the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Free Modal Logics: Sahlqvist -- Van Benthem Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extension and generalization of Sahlqvist--Van Benthem correspondence to the case of distribution-free modal logic, with, or without negation and/or implication connectives. We follow a reductionist strategy, reducing the correspondence problem at hand to the same problem, but for a suitable system of sorted modal logic (the modal companion of the distribution-free system). The reduction, via a fully abstract translation, builds on duality between normal lattice expansions and sorted residuated frames with relations (a generalization of classical Kripke frames with relations). The approach is scalable and it can be generalized to other systems, with or without distribution, such as distributive modal logic, or substructural logics with, or without additional modal operators.</description>

      <title>Propositional Dynamic Logic has Craig Interpolation: a tableau-based proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL) has the Craig Interpolation Property. This question has been open for many years. Three proof attempts were published, but later criticized in the literature or retracted. Our proof is based on the main ideas from Borzechowski (1988). We define a cyclic tableau system for PDL with a loading mechanism to recognize successful repeats. For this system, we show soundness and completeness via a game. To show interpolation, we modify Maehara's method to work for tableaux with repeats: we first define pre-interpolants at each node, and then use a quasi-tableau to define interpolants for clusters (strongly connected components). In different terms, our method solves the fixpoint equations that characterize the desired interpolants, and the method ensures that the solutions to these equations can be expressed within PDL. The proof is constructive and we show how to compute interpolants. We also make available a Haskell implementation of the proof system that provides interpolants. Lastly, we mention ongoing work to formally verify this proof in the interactive theorem prover Lean, and several questions for future work.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Approach to Moralisation and Triangulation of Probabilistic Graphical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moralisation and Triangulation are transformations allowing to switch between different ways of factoring a probability distribution into a graphical model. Moralisation allows to view a Bayesian network (a directed model) as a Markov network (an undirected model), whereas triangulation works in the opposite direction. We present a categorical framework where these transformations are modelled as functors between a category of Bayesian networks and one of Markov networks. The two kinds of network (the objects of these categories) are themselves represented as functors, from a `syntax' domain to a `semantics' codomain. Notably, moralisation and triangulation are definable inductively on such syntax, and operate as a form of functor pre-composition. This approach introduces a modular, algebraic perspective in the theory of probabilistic graphical models.</description>

      <title>A Natural Transformation between the Completeness and Compactness Theorems in Classical Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a categorical framework that reveals the deep relationship between the completeness and compactness theorems in classical logic. Although these theorems have traditionally been approached by distinct methods, our study shows that they are naturally equivalent through the lens of category theory. By introducing the basic concepts of categories, functors, and natural transformations, we establish that the model constructions derived from each theorem can be viewed as functors from the category of logical theories to the category of their models. In particular, one functor is defined using the Henkin construction from the completeness theorem, while another is defined based on the finite satisfiability condition of the compactness theorem. We then prove the existence of a natural transformation between these two functors, which demonstrates that the models produced by each method are isomorphic in a canonical way. This result not only bridges the gap between the proof-theoretic and model-theoretic perspectives but also provides a unified, conceptual framework that can be extended to other areas of mathematical logic. Our exposition is designed to be accessible, offering insight into both the categorical formalism and its implications for understanding fundamental logical theorems.</description>

      <title>A study of the Antlion Random Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper treats a new type of random walk referred to as an Antlion Random Walk (ARW), which is motivated by mathematical modeling of the decision-making process using chaotic semiconductor lasers with memory parameters. We discuss the dependency of the property of the probability distribution of ARWs on the memory parameter $\alpha$ and discuss uniqueness of them in contrast to the conventional, simple RWs through similarity to the normal distribution.</description>

      <title>Automated Verification of Equivalence Properties in Advanced Logic Programs -- Bachelor Thesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19806v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increase in industrial applications using Answer Set Programming, the need for formal verification tools, particularly for critical applications, has also increased. During the program optimisation process, it would be desirable to have a tool which can automatically verify whether an optimised subprogram can replace the original subprogram. Formally this corresponds to the problem of verifying the strong equivalence of two programs. In order to do so, the translation tool anthem was developed. It can be used in conjunction with an automated theorem prover for classical logic to verify that two programs are strongly equivalent. With the current version of anthem, only the strong equivalence of positive programs with a restricted input language can be verified. This is a result of the translation $\tau^*$ implemented in anthem that produces formulas in the logic of here-and-there, which coincides with classical logic only for positive programs. This thesis extends anthem in order to overcome these limitations. First, the transformation $\sigma^*$ is presented, which transforms formulas from the logic of here-and-there to classical logic. A theorem formalises how $\sigma^*$ can be used to express equivalence in the logic of here-and-there in classical logic. Second, the translation $\tau^*$ is extended to programs containing pools. Another theorem shows how $\sigma^*$ can be combined with $\tau^*$ to express the strong equivalence of two programs in classical logic. With $\sigma^*$ and the extended $\tau^*$, it is possible to express the strong equivalence of logic programs containing negation, simple choices, and pools. Both the extended $\tau^*$ and $\sigma^*$ are implemented in a new version of anthem. Several examples of logic programs containing pools, negation, and simple choice rules, which the new version of anthem can translate to classical logic, are presented. Some a...</description>

      <title>Hoare meets Heisenberg: A Lightweight Logic for Quantum Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.08939v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Gottesman's (1998) semantics for Clifford circuits based on the Heisenberg representation gives rise to a lightweight Hoare-like logic for efficiently characterizing a common subset of quantum programs. Our applications include (i) certifying whether auxiliary qubits can be safely disposed of, (ii) determining if a system is separable across a given bipartition, (iii) checking the transversality of a gate with respect to a given stabilizer code, and (iv) computing post-measurement states for computational basis measurements. Further, this logic is extended to accommodate universal quantum computing by deriving Hoare triples for the $T$-gate, multiply-controlled unitaries such as the Toffoli gate, and some gate injection circuits that use associated magic states. A number of interesting results emerge from this logic, including a lower bound on the number of $T$ gates necessary to perform a multiply-controlled $Z$ gate.</description>

      <title>Complete Test Suites for Automata in Monoidal Closed Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformance testing of automata is about checking the equivalence of a known specification and a black-box implementation. An important notion in conformance testing is that of a complete test suite, which guarantees that if an implementation satisfying certain conditions passes all tests, then it is equivalent to the specification.
  We introduce a framework for proving completeness of test suites at the general level of automata in monoidal closed categories. Moreover, we provide a generalization of a classical conformance testing technique, the W-method. We demonstrate the applicability of our results by recovering the W-method for deterministic finite automata, Moore machines, and Mealy machines, and by deriving new instances of complete test suites for weighted automata and deterministic nominal automata.</description>
