      <title>Too Hot to Handle: Searching for Inflationary Particle Production in Planck Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-adiabatic production of massive particles is a generic feature of many inflationary mechanisms. If sufficiently massive, these particles can leave features in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) that are not well-captured by traditional correlation function analyses. We consider a scenario in which particle production occurs only in a narrow time-interval during inflation, eventually leading to CMB hot- or coldspots with characteristic shapes and sizes. Searching for such features in CMB data is analogous to searching for late-Universe hot- or coldspots, such as those due to the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. Exploiting this data-analysis parallel, we perform a search for particle-production hotspots in the Planck PR4 temperature dataset, which we implement via a matched-filter analysis. Our pipeline is validated on synthetic observations and found to yield unbiased constraints on sufficiently large hotspots across $\approx 60\%$ of the sky. After removing point sources and tSZ clusters, we find no evidence for new physics and place novel bounds on the coupling between the inflaton and massive particles. These bounds are strongest for larger hotspots, produced early in inflation, whilst sensitivity to smaller hotspots is limited by noise and beam effects. Through such methods we can constrain particles with masses $\mathcal{O}(100)$ times larger than the inflationary Hubble scale, which represents possibly the highest energies ever directly probed with observational data.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from cosmic strings in LISA: reconstruction pipeline and physics interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the LISA template databank for stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds sourced by cosmic strings. We include two templates, an analytical template, which enables more flexible searches, and a numerical template derived directly from large Nambu-Goto simulations of string networks. Using searches based on these templates, we forecast the parameter space within the reach of the experiment and the precision with which their parameters will be reconstructed, provided a signal is observed. The reconstruction permits probing the Hubble expansion and new relativistic DoF in the early universe. We quantify the impact that astrophysical foregrounds can have on these searches. Finally, we discuss the impact that these observations would have on our understanding of the fundamental models behind the string networks. Overall, we prove that LISA has great potential for probing cosmic string models and may reach tensions as low as $G\mu =10^{-16} - 10^{-17} $, which translates into energy scales of the order $10^{11}~\text{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>The Population II Extragalactic Distance Scale: A TRGB Distance to the Fornax Cluster with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differences between the local value of the Hubble constant measured via the distance ladder versus the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background with the assumption of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model have reached over 5$\sigma$ significance. To determine if this discrepancy is due to new physics or more mundane systematic errors, it is essential to remove as many sources of systematic uncertainty as possible by developing high-precision distance ladders that are independent of the traditional Cepheid and Type Ia supernovae route. Here we present JWST observations of three early-type Fornax Cluster galaxies, the first of fourteen observations from a Cycle 2 JWST program. Our modest integration times allow us to measure highly precise tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distances, and will also be used to perform measurements of Surface Brightness Fluctuations (SBF). From these three galaxies, we determine an average TRGB distance modulus to the Fornax Cluster of $\mu$ = 31.424 $\pm$ 0.077 mag, or D = 19.3 $\pm$ 0.7 Mpc. With eleven more scheduled observations in nearby elliptical galaxies, our program will allow us set the zero point of the SBF scale to better than 2$\%$ for more distant measurements, charting a path towards a high-precision measurement of $H_{0}$ that is independent of the traditional Cepheid-SN Ia distance ladder.</description>

      <title>Exploring Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos with Diverse Baryonic Distributions: A Parametric Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies residing in dark matter halos exert significant gravitational effects that alter halo structure and dynamics. The complexity of these interactions escalates with the diversity of galactic structures and the variability in dark matter halo profiles under self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models. This work extends the parametric model for dark matter-only halos presented in arXiv:2305.16176 to incorporate baryons. We adapt this model to consistently represent the SIDM halo density profile over time, highlighting the role of a gravothermal phase in characterizing the state of an SIDM halo. Given this phase, the density profile in SIDM is determined by a fictitious progenitor -- consisting of an NFW halo influenced by a baryonic potential -- that has evolved to its present state. In the temporal dimension, the model incorporates a form factor that rescales the evolution time in the dark matter-only case, thereby enabling the introduction of a universal phase. In the radial dimension, the halo density profile is parametrized to reflect the influences of baryons. We calibrate the model through N-body simulations with baryon potentials to fit various stellar-to-halo mass ratios and size-mass relationships. Our parametric approach is numerically efficient, enabling the exploration of SIDM effects across a diverse set of halos, as exemplified by a case study using an illustrative sample that spans five orders of magnitude in the mass range. We also demonstrate that the effects of evolution history and the specific SIDM model can be separated from the current states of galaxies and halos, leaving the task of identifying consistent SIDM models to dedicated post-processing analyses.</description>

      <title>Assessing observational constraints on dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational constraints on time-varying dark energy ({\it e.g.}, quintessence) are commonly presented on a $w_0$-$w_a$ plot that assumes the equation of state of dark energy strictly satisfies $w(z)= w_0+ w_a z/(1+z)$ as a function of the redshift $z$. Recent observations favor a sector of the $w_0$-$w_a$ plane in which $w_0 &gt; -1$ and $w_0+w_a&lt; -1$, suggesting that the equation of state underwent a transition from violating the null energy condition (NEC) at large $z$ to obeying it at small $z$. In this paper, we demonstrate that this impression is misleading by showing that simple quintessence models satisfying the NEC for all $z$ predict an observational preference for the same sector. We also find that quintessence models that best fit observational data can predict a value for the dark energy equation of state at present that is significantly different from the best-fit value of $w_0$ obtained assuming the parameterization above. In addition, the analysis reveals an approximate degeneracy of the $w_0$-$w_a$ parameterization that explains the eccentricity and orientation of the likelihood contours presented in recent observational studies.</description>

      <title>MEET-U Project I: The key drivers of the preference for dynamic dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint analysis of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurement by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) first data release, Type Ia supernovae (SNe) of the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DES5YR) release and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data favors a quintom-like dynamic dark energy model over the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model at $3.9\sigma$ level (Adame et al. 2024). We demonstrate that the preference for dynamic dark energy does not rely on the detailed modeling of CMB physics and remains at $3.2\sigma$ level when the full CMB likelihood is replaced by a CMB acoustic-oscillation angle ($\theta_\star$) prior and a baryon abundance ($\Omega_bh^2$) prior. By comparing the data with over $10^4$ $\Lambda$CDM-based simulations, we find that both the SNe and BAO data contribute significantly to the preference for dynamic dark energy. The preference for dynamic dark energy is unlikely (probability $\lesssim 0.02$) due to unknown systematics in DES5YR SNe and statistical fluctuations in DESI BAO, or vice versa.</description>

      <title>Foreground biases in strong gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing is a competitive tool to probe the dark matter and energy content of the universe. However, significant uncertainties can arise from the choice of lens model, and in particular the parameterisation of the line of sight. In this work, we consider the consequences of ignoring the contribution of foreground perturbers in lens modelling. We derive the explicit form of the degeneracy between the foreground shear and the ellipticity of a power law lens, which renders both quantities effectively unmeasurable from strong lensing observables. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that this degeneracy does not affect measurements of the Einstein radius. Foreground tidal effects are also not expected to bias the slope of the potential, and further that any biases in this slope should not affect the recovery of the Hubble constant. The foreground convergence term adds an additional uncertainty to the measurement of $H_0$, and we show that this uncertainty will be on the order of $1\%$ for lensing systems located along random lines of sight. There is evidence to indicate that the probability of strong lensing is higher towards overdense lines of sight, and this could result in a small systematic bias towards overestimations of $H_0$.</description>

      <title>Extracting parity-violating gravitational waves from projected tidal force tensor in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) may be produced by various mechanisms in the early universe. In particular, if parity is violated, it may lead to the production of parity-violating GWs. In this paper, we focus on GWs on the scale of the large-scale structure. Since GWs induce tidal deformations of the shape of galaxies, one can extract such GW signals by observing images of galaxies in galaxy surveys. Conventionally the detection of such signals is discussed by considering the three-dimensional power spectra of the $E/B$-modes. Here, we develop a complementary new technique to estimate the contribution of GWs to the tidal force tensor field projected on the celestial sphere, which is a directly observable quantity. We introduce two two-dimensional vector fields constructed by taking the divergence and curl of the projected tidal field in three dimensions. Their auto-correlation functions naturally contain contributions of the scalar-type tidal field. However, we find that the divergence of the curl of the projected tidal field, which is a pseudo-scalar quantity, is free from the scalar contribution and thus enables us to extract GW signals. We also find that we can detect parity-violating signals in the GWs by observing the nonzero cross-correlation between the divergence of the projected tidal field and the curl of it. It roughly corresponds to measuring the cross-power spectrum of E and B-modes, but these are complementary to each other in the sense that our estimator can be naturally defined locally in position space. Finally we present expressions of the correlation functions in the form of Fourier integrals, and discuss the properties of the kernels specific to the GW case, which we call the overlap reduction function, borrowing the terminology used in the pulsar timing array experiments.</description>

      <title>DESI 2024: Reconstructing Dark Energy using Crossing Statistics with DESI DR1 BAO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement Crossing Statistics to reconstruct in a model-agnostic manner the expansion history of the universe and properties of dark energy, using DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) BAO data in combination with one of three different supernova compilations (PantheonPlus, Union3, and DES-SN5YR) and Planck CMB observations. Our results hint towards an evolving and emergent dark energy behaviour, with negligible presence of dark energy at $z\gtrsim 1$, at varying significance depending on data sets combined. In all these reconstructions, the cosmological constant lies outside the 95\% confidence intervals for some redshift ranges. This dark energy behaviour, reconstructed using Crossing Statistics, is in agreement with results from the conventional $w_0$--$w_a$ dark energy equation of state parametrization reported in the DESI Key cosmology paper. Our results add an extensive class of model-agnostic reconstructions with acceptable fits to the data, including models where cosmic acceleration slows down at low redshifts. We also report constraints on \Hord\ from our model-agnostic analysis, independent of the pre-recombination physics.</description>

      <title>CMB spectrum in unified EFT of dark energy: scalar-tensor and vector-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation in the unified description of the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy that accommodates both scalar-tensor and vector-tensor theories. The boundaries of different classes of theories are universally parameterised by a new EFT parameter $\alpha_V$ characterising the vectorial nature of dark energy and a set of consistency relations associated with the global/local shift symmetry. After implementing the equations of motion in a Boltzmann code, as a demonstration, we compute the CMB power spectrum based on the $w$CDM background with the EFT parameterisation of perturbations and a concrete Horndeski/generalised Proca theory. We show that the vectorial nature generically prevents modifications of gravity in the CMB spectrum. On the other hand, while the shift symmetry is less significant in the perturbation equations unless the background is close to the $\Lambda$CDM, it requires that the effective equation of state of dark energy is in the phantom region $w_{\rm DE}&lt;-1$. The latter is particularly interesting in light of the latest result of the DESI+CMB combination as the observational verification of $w_{\rm DE}&gt;-1$ can rule out shift-symmetric theories including vector-tensor theories in one shot.</description>

      <title>The forest at EndEoR: The effect of Lyman Limit Systems on the End of Reionisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The final stages of cosmic reionisation (EndEoR) are expected to be strongly regulated by the residual neutral hydrogen in the already ionised regions of the Universe. Its presence limits the mean distance that ionising photons can travel and hence, the extent of the regions that sources of ionising photons can affect. The structures containing most of this residual neutral hydrogen are typically unresolved in large-scale simulations of reionisation. Here, we investigate and compare a range of approaches for including the effect of these small-scale absorbers, also known as Lyman limit systems (LLS), in such simulations. We evaluate the impact of these different approaches on the reionisation history, the evolution of the ultraviolet background, and its fluctuations. We also compare to observational results on the distribution of Lyman-$\alpha$ opacity towards the EndEoR and the measured mean free path of ionising photons. We further consider their effect on the 21-cm power spectrum. We find that although each of the different approaches can match some of the observed probes of the final stages of reionisation, only the use of a redshift-dependent and position-dependent LLS model is able to reproduce all of them. We therefore recommend that large-scale reionisation simulations, which aim to describe both the state of the ionised and neutral intergalactic medium use such an approach, although the other, simpler approaches are applicable depending on the science goal of the simulation.</description>

      <title>Cosmology from one galaxy in voids?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding galaxy properties may be the key to unlocking some of the most intriguing mysteries of modern cosmology. Recent work relied on machine learning to extract cosmological constraints on $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ using only $\textit{one}$ galaxy. But if this is true, how should we select $\textit{the}$ galaxy to use for cosmology inference? In this paper, we consider selecting a galaxy that lies in cosmic voids, the underdense regions of the cosmic web, and compare the constraints obtained with the ones obtained when randomly selecting a galaxy in the whole sample. We use the IllustrisTNG galaxy catalog from the CAMELS project and the VIDE void finder to identify galaxies inside voids. We show that void galaxies provide stronger constraints on $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ compared to randomly selected galaxies. This result suggests that the distinctive characteristics of void galaxies may provide a cleaner and more effective environment for extracting cosmological information.</description>

      <title>Robust constraints on tensor perturbations from cosmological data: a comparative analysis from Bayesian and frequentist perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze primordial tensor perturbations using the latest cosmic microwave background and gravitational waves data, focusing on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, and the tensor spectral tilt, $n_t$. Utilizing data from Planck PR4, BICEP/Keck, and LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, we employ both Bayesian and frequentist methods to provide robust constraints on these parameters. Our results indicate more conservative upper limits for $r$ with profile likelihoods compared to Bayesian credible intervals, highlighting the influence of prior selection and volume effects. The profile likelihood for $n_t$ shows that the current data do not provide sufficient information to derive quantitative bounds, unless extra assumptions on $r$ are used. Additionally, we conduct a 2D profile likelihood analysis of $r$ and $n_t$, indicating a closer agreement between both statistical methods for the largest values of $r$. This study not only updates our understanding of the tensor perturbations but also highlights the importance of employing both statistical methods to explore less constrained parameters, crucial for future explorations in cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential Chromatic Refraction (DCR) is caused by the wavelength dependence of our atmosphere's refractive index, which shifts the apparent positions of stars and galaxies and distorts their shapes depending on their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). While this effect is typically mitigated and corrected for in imaging observations, we investigate how DCR can instead be used to our advantage to infer the redshifts of supernovae from multi-band, time-series imaging data. We simulate Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the proposed Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Deep Drilling Field (DDF), and evaluate astrometric redshifts. We find that the redshift accuracy improves dramatically with the statistical quality of the astrometric measurements as well as with the accuracy of the astrometric solution. For a conservative choice of a 5-mas systematic uncertainty floor, we find that our redshift estimation is accurate at $z &lt; 0.6$. We then combine our astrometric redshifts with both host galaxy photometric redshifts and supernovae photometric (light-curve) redshifts and show that this considerably improves the overall redshift estimates. These astrometric redshifts will be valuable especially since Rubin will discover a vast number of supernovae for which we will not be able to obtain spectroscopic redshifts.</description>

Abstract: The applications of artificial neural networks in the cosmological field have shone successfully during the past decade, this is due to their great ability of modeling large amounts of datasets and complex nonlinear functions. However, in some cases, their use still remains controversial because their ease of producing inaccurate results when the hyperparameters are not carefully selected. In this paper, to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters to artificial neural networks, we propose to take advantage of the genetic algorithms. As a proof of the concept, we analyze three different cosmological cases to test the performance of the architectures achieved with the genetic algorithms and compare them with the standard process, consisting of a grid with all possible configurations. First, we carry out a model-independent reconstruction of the distance modulus using a type Ia supernovae compilation. Second, the neural networks learn to infer the equation of state for the quintessence model, and finally with the data from a combined redshift catalog the neural networks predict the photometric redshift given six photometric bands (urgizy). We found that the genetic algorithms improve considerably the generation of the neural network architectures, which can ensure more confidence in their physical results because of the better performance in the metrics with respect to the grid method.</description>

      <title>Percolating Cosmic String loops from evaporating primordial black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pulsar timing data from NANOGrav Collaboration has regenerated interest in the possibility of observing stochastic gravitational wave background arising from cosmic strings. In the standard theory, the cosmic string network forms during spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phase transition in the whole universe via the so called Kibble mechanism. This scenario would not be possible, e.g., in models of low energy inflation, where the reheat temperature is much lower than the energy scale of cosmic strings. We point out a very different possibility, where a network of even high energy scale cosmic strings can form when the temperature of the Universe is much lower. We consider local heating of plasma in the early universe by evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs). It is known that for suitable masses of PBHs, their Hawking radiation may re-heat the surrounding plasma to high temperatures, restoring certain symmetries {\it locally} which are broken at the ambient temperature at that stage. Expansion of the hot plasma cools it so that the {\it locally restored symmetry} is spontaneously broken again. If this SSB supports formation of cosmic strings, then string loops will form in this region around the PBH. Further, resulting temperature gradients lead to pressure gradients such that plasma develops radial flow with the string loops getting stretched as they get dragged by the flow. For a finite density of PBHs of suitable masses, one will get local hot spots, each one contributing to expanding cosmic string loops. For suitable PBH density, the loops from different regions may intersect. Intercommutation of strings can then lead to percolation, leading to the possibility of formation of infinite string network, even when the entire universe never goes through the respective SSB phase transition.</description>

      <title>Feedback mechanisms stopping the star formation in a pair of massive galaxies in the early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedback is the key physical mechanism regulating galaxy formation. Stars in galaxies form when baryons radiatively cool down and fall into gravitational wells. Eventually, star formation quenches as gas is depleted and/or perturbed by feedback processes, no longer being able to collapse and condense. For massive galaxies, astronomers identify feedback from accreting supermassive black holes (active galactic nuclei, AGN) as the main agent responsible for quenching. We report the first spatially resolved spectroscopic observations of a massive, completely quiescent galaxy at $z=3.714$ (Jekyll) and its neighborhood. Jekyll is part of a galaxy pair with a compact, dusty, massive star-forming companion (Hyde). We find large amounts of ionized and neutral gas in the intergalactic medium around the pair, yet Jekyll has remained quiescent for more than 500~Myr. The emitting gas is consistent with AGN photoionization, but no AGN is observed in Jekyll. We find that, in contrast to standard scenarios, AGN in satellite galaxies can be critical contributors for keeping massive galaxies quiescent in the early Universe. After the accelerated formation and quenching of the massive central galaxy, tidally induced gas stripping additionally contributes to the star-formation regulation on subsequent satellite galaxy generations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under the assumption that the recent pulsar timing array evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background at nanohertz frequencies is generated by metastable cosmic strings, we analyze the potential of present and future GW observatories for probing the change of particle degrees of freedom caused, e.g., by a supersymmetric (SUSY) extension of the Standard Model (SM). We find that signs of the characteristic doubling of degrees of freedom predicted by SUSY could be detected at Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer even if the masses of the SUSY partner particles are as high as about $10^4$ TeV, far above the reach of any currently envisioned particle collider. We also discuss the detection prospects for the case that some entropy production, e.g. from a late decaying modulus field inducing a temporary matter domination phase in the evolution of the universe, somewhat dilutes the GW spectrum, delaying discovery of the stochastic GW background at LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. In our analysis we focus on SUSY, but any theory beyond the SM predicting a significant increase of particle degrees of freedom could be probed this way.</description>

      <title>Large Scale Overdensity of Lyman Break Galaxies Around the z=6.3 Ultraluminous Quasar J0100+2802</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the environment of the z=6.33 ultraluminous quasar SDSS J010013.02+280225.8 (J0100) to understand its association with large-scale structure. Theoretical models propose high-redshift quasars as markers of galaxy overdensities residing in the most massive dark matter halos (DMHs) in the early universe. J0100 is an ultraluminous quasar with the most massive black hole known at z&gt;6, suggesting a high likelihood of residing in a massive DMH. We present wide-field ($\sim$522 square arcminute) imaging in the r-, i-, and z-bands from the Large Binocular Camera on the Large Binocular Telescope, with Y- and J-band imaging from the Wide-field Infrared Camera on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, centered on J0100. Applying color selections, we identify 23 objects as i-droput Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG) candidates in the J0100 field. We use the deep photometric catalog in the 1.27 square degree COSMOS field to calculate the density of LBGs in a blank field, and to estimate the selection completeness and purity. The observed surface density of LBG candidates in the J0100 field corresponds to a galaxy overdensity of $\delta$=4 (at 8.4$\sigma$). This large-scale overdensity suggests that the $\sim$ 22 square arcminute overdensity found by Kashino et al. using JWST data extends out to much larger scales. We calculate the angular auto-correlation function of the candidates and find a positive correlation on $\lesssim$ 10 arcminute scales as well as evidence of asymmetries in their spatial distribution, further suggesting a direct detection of large-scale structure around the ultra-luminous quasar J0100.</description>

      <title>The MOST Hosts Survey: spectroscopic observation of the host galaxies of ~40,000 transients using DESI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the MOST Hosts survey (Multi-Object Spectroscopy of Transient Hosts). The survey is planned to run throughout the five years of operation of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and will generate a spectroscopic catalog of the hosts of most transients observed to date, in particular all the supernovae observed by most public, untargeted, wide-field, optical surveys (PTF/iPTF, SDSS II, ZTF, DECAT, DESIRT). Scientific questions for which the MOST Hosts survey will be useful include Type Ia supernova cosmology, fundamental plane and peculiar velocity measurements, and the understanding of the correlations between transients and their host galaxy properties. Here, we present the first release of the MOST Hosts survey: 21,931 hosts of 20,235 transients. These numbers represent 36% of the final MOST Hosts sample, consisting of 60,212 potential host galaxies of 38,603 transients (a transient can be assigned multiple potential hosts). Of these galaxies, 40% do not appear in the DESI primary target list and therefore require a specific program like MOST Hosts. Of all the transients in the MOST Hosts list, only 26.7% have existing classifications, and so the survey will provide redshifts (and luminosities) for nearly 30,000 transients. A preliminary Hubble diagram and a transient luminosity-duration diagram are shown as examples of future potential uses of the MOST Hosts survey. The survey will also provide a training sample of spectroscopically observed transients for photometry-only classifiers, as we enter an era when most newly observed transients will lack spectroscopic classification. The MOST Hosts DESI survey data will be released through the Wiserep platform on a rolling cadence and updated to match the DESI releases. Dates of future releases and updates are available through the https://mosthosts.desi.lbl.gov website.</description>

      <title>Finite modular majoron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that the accidental $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry can arise from a finite modular symmetry $\Gamma_N$ in the type-I seesaw. The finite modular symmetry is spontaneously broken in such a way that the residual $\mathbb{Z}^T_N$ discrete symmetry, associated with the $T$-transformation which shifts the modulus $\tau \to \tau+ 1$, remains unbroken. This discrete $\mathbb{Z}^T_N$ symmetry mimics $U(1)_{B-L}$, and hence the majoron appears as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson of $U(1)_{B-L}$. Without introducing additional interactions, the modulus $\tau$ can be stabilized by the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) potential given by the Majorana mass terms of the right-handed neutrinos. We study cosmological implications of the majoron, with particular interests in the dark matter and dark radiation, where the latter may alleviate the Hubble tension. We also find that the CW potential can have a wide range of nearly exponential shape which prevents $\tau$ from overshooting, and makes the amount of dark radiation not too large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question of geodesic completeness of cosmological spacetimes has recently received renewed scrutiny. A particularly interesting result is the observation that the well-known Borde-Guth-Vilenkin (BGV) theorem may misdiagnose geodesically complete cosmologies. We propose a simple amendment to the BGV theorem which addresses such loopholes while retaining much of its generality. We give straightforward proofs of some recently offered conjectures concerning (generalized) Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes: geodesic completeness implies (i) the existence of a bounce, loitering phase or an emergent cosmology, and (ii) a phase of accelerated expansion with strictly increasing Hubble rate. Our results are purely kinematic and do not assume general relativity or energy conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how topologically stable superheavy magnetic monopoles and primordial black holes can be generated at observable levels by the waterfall field in hybrid inflation models based on grand unified theories. In $SU(5) \times U(1)_\chi$ grand unification, the monopole mass is of order $4 \times 10^{17}$ GeV, and it carries a single unit ($2 \pi /e$) of Dirac magnetic charge as well as screened color magnetic charge. The monopole density is partially diluted to an observable value, and accompanied with the production of primordial black holes with mass of order $10^{17}$-$10^{19}$ g which may make up the entire dark matter in the universe. The tensor to scalar ratio $r$ is predicted to be of order $10^{-5}$ - $10^{-4}$ which should be testable in the next generation of CMB experiments such as CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD. The gravitational wave spectrum generated during the waterfall transition is also presented.</description>

      <title>Accretion mediated spin-eccentricity correlations in LISA massive black hole binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine expected effective spin ($\chi_{{\rm eff},1\rm yr}$) and orbital eccentricity ($e_{1\rm yr}$) correlations for a population of observable equal-mass massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with total redshifted mass $M_z\sim[10^{4.5},10^{7.5}]~{\rm M}_\odot$ embedded in a circumbinary disc (CBD), one-year before merging in the LISA band. We find a strong correlation between measurable eccentricity and negative effective spin for MBHBs that are carried to merger by retrograde accretion. This is due to the well-established eccentricity pumping of retrograde accretion and the formation of retrograde CBD-aligned mini-discs, as observed in hydrodynamical simulations. Conversely, prograde accretion channels result in positive $\chi_{{\rm eff},1\rm yr}$ and non-measurable $e_{1\rm yr}$. This clear contrast between the two CBD orientations -- and particularly the unique signature of retrograde configurations -- provides a promising way to unlock the mysteries of MBHB formation channels in the LISA era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflationary models with a non-zero background curvature are ill-defined in general relativity because scalar modes cannot be canonically quantized. Therefore, there is no consensus on the primordial power spectrum that should be considered at large scales in a curved Universe. In this letter, we propose a model of curved inflation where canonical quantization is possible for any curvature, and we unambiguously obtain the resulting primordial power spectra. The framework is a recently proposed modification of general relativity in which a non-dynamical topological term is added to the Einstein equation. The main strength of this model is that no additional degree of freedom compared to the standard model of cosmology is needed, giving a natural solution to the problem of constructing curved inflation, and at the same time providing an additional argument for this topological modification of general relativity.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational positivity bounds provide consistency conditions for effective field theories with gravity. They turn out to be phenomenologically useful by providing lower bounds in parameters of new physics beyond the Standard Models (BSM). In this paper, we derive constraints on millicharged fermion dark matter models with massless dark photon using gravitational positivity bounds. Combining them with upper bounds from cosmological and astrophysical observations, we can severely constrain the parameter space of the model. In particular, we show that when the dark matter mass is lighter than the solar core temperature, most of the parameter region is excluded by combining gravitational positivity bounds and the stellar bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 4D eigenvector 1 (E1) sequence has emerged as a powerful tool for organizing the observational and physical characteristics of type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the metallicity of the broad line region gas, incorporating both new data and previously published findings, to assess the presence of any trend along the sequence. We perform a multi-component analysis on the strongest UV and optical emission lines, compute $\sim 10$ diagnostic ratios, and compare them with the prediction of CLOUDY photoionization simulations, identifying a photoionization solution closest to the data. Our investigation reveals a consistent pattern along the optical plane of the E1. We observe a systematic progression in metallicity, ranging from sub-solar values to metallicity levels several times higher than solar values. These findings underscore the role of metallicity as a fundamental correlate of the 4DE1/main sequence. Extreme values of metallicity, at least several tens solar, are confirmed in low-$z$ AGNs radiating at a high Eddington ratio, although the origin of the extreme enrichment remains open to debate.</description>

Abstract: This study presents results on detecting neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) 21cm absorption in the spectrum of PKS1413+135 at redshift $z=0.24670041$. The observation was conducted by FAST, with a spectral resolution of 10 Hz, using 10 minutes of observing time. The global spectral profile is examined by modeling the absorption line using a single Gaussian function with a resolution of 10 kHz within a 2 MHz bandwidth. The goal is to determine the rate of the latest cosmic acceleration by directly measuring redshift evolution of H I 21 cm absorption line with Hubble flow towards a same background Quasar over a decade or longer time span. This will serve as a detectable signal generated by the accelerated expansion of the Universe at redshift $z &lt; 1$, referred to as redshift drift $\dot{z}$ or the SL effect. The measured HI gas column density in this DLA system is approximately equivalent to the initial observation value, considering uncertainties of the spin temperature of a spiral host galaxy. The high signal-to-noise ratio of 57, obtained at a 10 kHz resolution, strongly supports the feasibility of using the H I 21 cm absorption line in DLA systems to accurately measure the redshift drift rate at a precision level of around $10^{-10}$ per decade.</description>

      <title>Angular Correlation Function from sample covariance with BOSS and eBOSS LRG</title>

Abstract: The Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) are one of the most used probes to understand the accelerated expansion of the Universe. Traditional methods rely on fiducial model information within their statistical analysis, which may be a problem when constraining different families of models. This work aims to provide a method that constrains $\theta_{BAO}$ through a model-independent approach using the covariance matrix from the galaxy sample from thin redshift bins, later validated with a mock sample covariance matrix. We used widths of $\delta z = 0.002$ separation for all samples as the basis for a sample covariance matrix weighted by the statistical importance of the redshift bin. Each sample belongs to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: BOSS1, BOSS2, and eBOSS, with effective redshift $z_{eff}$: 0.35, 0.51, 0.71, and different numbers of bins with 50, 100, and 200. To get $\theta_{BAO}$, we correct the angular separation from the polynomial fit ($\theta_{fit}$) by comparing each bin correlation function with the correlation function of the whole set, a parameter named $\tilde{\alpha}$. We also tested such correction by choosing the bin at $z_{eff}$ and found that for eBOSS $\theta_{BAO}$ is in $1 \sigma$ agreement with the Planck 18 model. Finally, we found that the sample covariances are noisy compared to the mocks for lower $z$ samples, something expected due to nonlinear effects. Such noise impact can be seen in the parameter constraints but does not affect the eBOSS covariance sample. It is shown that mocks' results do tend to its chosen fiducial cosmology $\theta_{BAO}$. BOSS1 and BOSS2 showed agreement with Planck 18 and an agreement with Pantheon + S$H_0$ES when $\tilde{\alpha}$ is based on the bin $z=z_{eff}$.</description>

      <title>Tomographic cross correlations between galaxy surveys and the CMB gravitational lensing potential. Effect of the redshift bin mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upcoming surveys of the large-scale structure of our Universe will employ a large coverage area of about half of the sky and will significantly increase the observational depth. With these surveys, we will be able to cross-correlate CMB gravitational lensing and galaxy surveys divided into narrow redshift bins to map the evolution of the cosmological parameters with redshift. In this paper, we study the effect of the redshift bin mismatch of objects that is due to photometric redshift errors in tomographic cross-correlation measurements. We used the code FLASK to create Monte Carlo simulations of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and Planck CMB lensing convergence. We simulated log-normal fields and divided galaxies into nine redshift bins with the Gaussian and modified Lorentzian photometric redshift errors. To estimate the parameters, we used angular power spectra of CMB lensing and galaxy density contrast fields and the maximum likelihood estimation method. We show that even with simple Gaussian errors with a standard deviation of $\sigma(z)=0.02(1+z)$, the galaxy auto-power spectra in tomographic bins are offset by $2-15\%$. The estimated cross-power spectra between galaxy clustering and CMB lensing are also biased, with smaller deviations $&lt;5\%$. As a result, the $\sigma_{8}$ parameter deviates between $0.2-1.2\,\sigma$ due to the redshift bin mismatch of the objects. We propose a computationally fast and robust method based on the scattering matrix approach of Zhang et al. (2010), to correct for the redshift bin mismatch of the objects. The estimates of the parameters in tomographic studies such as the linear galaxy bias, the cross-correlation amplitude, and $\sigma_{8}$ are biased due to the redshift bin mismatch of the objects. The biases in these parameters are alleviated with our scattering matrix approach.</description>

      <title>Testing the cosmological Poisson equation in a model-independent way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how one can test the cosmological Poisson equation by requiring only the validity of three main assumptions: the energy-momentum conservation equations of matter, the equivalence principle, and the cosmological principle. We first point out that one can only measure the combination ${\mathcal M}\equiv \Omega_m^{(0)}\mu$, where $\mu$ quantifies the deviation of the Poisson equation from the standard one and $\Omega_m^{(0)}$ is the fraction of matter density at present. Then we employ a recent model-independent forecast for the growth rate $f(z)$ and the expansion rate $E(z)$ to obtain constraints on ${\mathcal M}$ for a survey that approximates a combination of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and Euclid. We conclude that a constant ${\mathcal M}$ can be measured with a relative error $\sigma_{\mathcal{M}}=4.5\%$, while if ${\mathcal M}$ is arbitrarily varying in redshift, it can be measured only to within $13.4\%$ (1 $\sigma$ c.l.) at redshift $z=0.9$, and 15-22\% up to $z=1.5$. We also project our constraints on some parametrizations of ${\mathcal M}$ proposed in literature, while still maintaining model-independence for the background expansion, the power spectrum shape, and the non-linear corrections. Generally speaking, as expected, we find much weaker model-independent constraints than found so far for such models. This means that the cosmological Poisson equation remains quite open to various alternative gravity and dark energy models.</description>

      <title>Hubble tension as a window on the gravitation of the dark matter sector: Exploration of a family of models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A family of simple and minimal extensions of the standard cosmological $\Lambda$CDM model in which dark matter experiences an additional long-range scalar interaction is demonstrated to alleviate the long lasting Hubble-tension while letting primordial nucleosynthesis predictions unaffected and passing by construction all current local tests of general relativity. This article describes their theoretical formulation and their implications for dark matter. Then, it investigates their cosmological signatures, both at the background and perturbation levels. A detailed comparison to astrophysical data is performed to discuss their ability to fit existing data. A thorough discussion of the complementarity of the low- and high-redshift data and on their constraining power highlights how these models improve the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model whatever the combination of datasets used and why they can potentially resolve the Hubble tension. Being fully predictive in any environment, they pave the way to a better understanding of gravity in the dark matter sector.</description>

      <title>Bubble-wall velocity in local thermal equilibrium: hydrodynamical simulations vs analytical treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform real-time hydrodynamical simulations of the growth of bubbles formed during cosmological first-order phase transitions under the assumption of local thermal equilibrium. We confirm that pure hydrodynamic backreaction can lead to steady-state expansion and that bubble-wall velocity in such case agrees very well with the analytical estimates. However, this is not the generic outcome. Instead, it is much more common to observe runaways, as the early-stage dynamics right after the nucleation allow the bubble walls to achieve supersonic velocities before the heated fluid shell in front of the bubble is formed. This effect is not captured by other methods of calculation of the bubble-wall velocity which assume stationary solutions to exist at all times and would have a crucial impact on the possible generation of both baryon asymmetry and gravitational wave signals.</description>

Abstract: Modern galaxy surveys demand extensive survey volumes and resolutions surpassing current dark matter-only simulations' capabilities. To address this, many methods employ effective bias models on the dark matter field to approximate object counts on a grid. However, realistic catalogs necessitate specific coordinates and velocities for a comprehensive understanding of the Universe. In this research, we explore sub-grid modeling to create accurate catalogs, beginning with coarse grid number counts at resolutions of approximately $5.5\,h^{-1}\rm Mpc$ per side. These resolutions strike a balance between modeling nonlinear damping of baryon acoustic oscillations and facilitating large-volume simulations. Augmented Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (ALPT) is utilized to model the dark matter field and motions, replicating the clustering of a halo catalog derived from a massive simulation at $z=1.1$. Our approach involves four key stages:
  Tracer Assignment: Allocating dark matter particles to tracers based on grid cell counts, generating additional particles to address discrepancies.
  Attractor Identification: Defining attractors based on particle cosmic web environments, acting as gravitational focal points.
  Tracer Collapse: Guiding tracers towards attractors, simulating structure collapse.
  Redshift Space Distortions: Introducing redshift space distortions to simulated catalogs using ALPT and a random dispersion term.
  Results demonstrate accurate reproduction of monopoles and quadrupoles up to wave numbers of approximately $k=0.6\,h$ Mpc$^{-1}$. This method holds significant promise for galaxy surveys like DESI, EUCLID, and LSST, enhancing our understanding of the cosmos across scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the primordial non-Gaussianity of inflationary perturbations is crucial for testing the inflation paradigm of the early universe. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the angular bispectrum and trispectrum of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in the presence of local-type primordial non-Gaussianity parameterized by $f_\mathrm{NL}$ and $g_\mathrm{NL}$, deriving their semi-analytical formulae for the first time. Our findings indicate that it is the presence of primordial non-Gaussianity that leads to a non-Gaussian SIGW background, suggesting that the angular bispectrum and trispectrum of SIGWs could serve as probes of the primordial non-Gaussianity. Our numerical results further illustrate that $f_\mathrm{NL}$ and $g_\mathrm{NL}$ exert significant impacts on the spectral amplitudes, potentially reaching up to $10^{-5}$ for the former and $10^{-8}$ for the latter. In particular, we demonstrate that the angular bispectrum and trispectrum exhibit characteristic dependence on the angular multipoles and frequency bands. They hold potentials to be measured by gravitational-wave detectors that may advance our understanding of the origin of the universe.</description>

      <title>Cosmic dipoles of active galactic nuclei at optical and radio wavelengths display much larger amplitudes than the cosmic microwave background dipole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sky distributions of large samples of distant active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have shown dipoles significantly larger than the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole. However, a recent Bayesian analysis of the QUAIA sample, comprising 1.3 million quasars, has yielded a dipole that seems to be in tandem with the CMB dipole, in contravention of most previous studies of AGN dipoles. Since the question has large cosmological implications, we investigate the QUAIA quasar sample afresh, by directly computing the dipole from asymmetries observed in the source number counts. We instead find a dipole 3-4 times as large as the CMB dipole though in the same direction. Further, it has been claimed elsewhere that the difference between the CMB dipole and the radio dipole estimated from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), the first large catalogue that showed an AGN dipole about four times larger than the CMB dipole, can be fully accounted for by incorporating the shot-noise and clustering contributions to the total NVSS dipole. A careful reinvestigation of the NVSS dipole, however, shows that the random phenomena like shot noise or clustering cannot account for the actually observed NVSS asymmetries, which show a systematic dipole pattern over the sky.</description>

      <title>Novel tests of gravity using nano-Hertz stochastic gravitational-wave background signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravity theories that modify General Relativity in the slow-motion regime can introduce nonperturbative corrections to the stochastic gravitational-wave background~(SGWB) from supermassive black-hole binaries in the nano-Hertz band, while remaining perturbative in the highly-relativistic regime and satisfying current post-Newtonian~(PN) constraints. We present a model-agnostic formalism to map such theories into a modified tilt for the SGWB spectrum, showing that negative PN corrections (in particular -2PN) can alleviate the tension in the recent pulsar-timing-array data if the detected SGWB is interpreted as arising from supermassive binaries. Despite being preliminary, current data have already strong constraining power, for example they set a novel (conservative) upper bound on theories with time-varying Newton's constant at least at the level of $\dot{G}/G \lesssim 10^{-5} \text{yr}^{-1}$ for redshift $z=[0.1\div1]$. We also show that NANOGrav data are best fitted by a broken power-law interpolating between a dominant -2PN or -3PN modification at low frequency, and the standard general-relativity scaling at high frequency. Nonetheless, a modified gravity explanation should be confronted with binary eccentricity, environmental effects, nonastrophysical origins of the signal, and scrutinized against statistical uncertainties. These novel tests of gravity will soon become more stringent when combining all pulsar-timing-array facilities and when collecting more data.</description>

Abstract: An explanation of the nature of dark energy has been treated in extra dimensions within the scheme of string theory. One of the most successful models is inspired by the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model, in which the universe is a 4-dimensional brane embedded in a 5-dimensional Minkowski space-time. In this landscape, the study of the evolution of the normal branch has led us to different kinds of dark energy, where the most simple case is the cosmological constant $\Lambda$. Moreover, other viable cosmological solutions are related to agegraphic dark energy, which allows a late cosmic acceleration within an interacting mechanism. To explore the viability of these solutions and possible gravitational leakage, in this paper, we present constraints on such models using recent standard sirens forecasting in addition to local observables such as Pantheon (SNIa), $H(z)$ measurements, baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO). Our results show that the value associated with the species of quantum fields $n$ in these models is strongly restricted for supernovae observations to $n=20$, and for GW standard sirens mock data prefers a value of $n=1$.</description>

      <title>Compact objects in and beyond the Standard Model from non-perturbative vacuum scalarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a theory in which a real scalar field is Yukawa-coupled to a fermion and has a potential with two non-degenerate vacua. If the coupling is sufficiently strong, a collection of N fermions deforms the true vacuum state, creating energetically-favored false-vacuum pockets in which fermions are trapped. We embed this model within General Relativity and prove that it admits self-gravitating compact objects where the scalar field acquires a non-trivial profile due to non-perturbative effects. We discuss some applications of this general mechanism: i) neutron soliton stars in low-energy effective QCD, which naturally happen to have masses around 2 solar masses and radii around 10 km even without neutron interactions; ii) Higgs false-vacuum pockets in and beyond the Standard Model; iii) dark soliton stars in models with a dark sector. In the latter two examples, we find compelling solutions naturally describing centimeter-size compact objects with masses around 10^-6 solar masses, intriguingly in a range compatible with the OGLE+HSC microlensing anomaly. Besides these interesting examples, the mechanism of non-perturbative vacuum scalarization may play a role in various contexts in and beyond the Standard Model, providing a support mechanism for new compact objects that can form in the early universe, can collapse into primordial black holes through accretion past their maximum mass, and serve as dark matter candidates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a formulation of Stochastic Inflation in full general relativity that goes beyond the slow-roll and separate universe approximations. We show how gauge invariant Langevin source terms can be obtained for the complete set of Einstein equations in their ADM formulation by providing a recipe for coarse-graining the spacetime in any small gauge. These stochastic source terms are defined in terms of the only dynamical scalar degree of freedom in single-field inflation and all depend simply on the first two time derivatives of the coarse-graining window function, on the gauge-invariant mode functions that satisfy the Mukhanov-Sasaki evolution equation, and on the slow-roll parameters. It is shown that this reasoning can also be applied to include gravitons as stochastic sources, thus enabling the study of all relevant degrees of freedom of general relativity for inflation. We validate the efficacy of these Langevin dynamics directly using an example in uniform field gauge, obtaining the stochastic e-fold number in the long wavelength limit without the need for a first-passage-time analysis. As well as investigating the most commonly used gauges in cosmological perturbation theory, we also derive stochastic source terms for the coarse-grained BSSN formulation of Einstein's equations, which enables a well-posed implementation for 3+1 numerical relativity simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum tunneling in the early universe: Stable magnetic monopoles from metastable cosmic strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel mechanism for producing topologically stable monopoles (TSMs) from the quantum mechanical decay of metastable cosmic strings in the early universe. In an $SO(10)$ model this mechanism yields TSMs that carry two units ($4\pi/e$) of Dirac magnetic charge as well as some color magnetic charge which is screened. For a dimensionless string tension parameter $G\mu \approx 10^{-9} - 10^{-5}$, the monopoles are superheavy with masses of order $10^{15} - 10^{17}$ GeV. Monopoles with masses of order $10^8 - 10^{14}$ GeV arise from metastable strings for $G\mu$ values from $\sim 10^{-22}$ to $10^{-10}$. We identify the parameter space for producing these monopoles at an observable level with detectors such as IceCube and KM3NeT. For lower $G\mu$ values the ultra-relativistic monopoles should be detectable at Pierre Auger and ANITA. The stochastic gravitational wave emission arises from metastable strings with $G\mu\sim 10^{-9}-10^{-5}$ and should be accessible at HLVK and future detectors including the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. An $E_6$ extension based on this framework would yield TSMs from the quantum mechanical decay of metastable strings that carry three units ($6\pi/e$) of Dirac magnetic charge.</description>

      <title>Analysis of anomalous contribution to galactic rotation curves due to stochastic spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the model put forth by Ref. [1], in which it is claimed that "post-quantum classical gravity" (PQCG), a stochastic theory of gravity, leads to modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) behavior on galactic scales that reproduces galactic rotation curves. We show that this analysis has three basic problems: (i) the equations of PQCG do not lead to a new large scale force of the form claimed in the paper, and (ii) the form claimed is not of the MONDian form anyhow and so does not correspond to observed galactic dynamics, and (iii) the spectrum of fluctuations is very different from observations.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Cosmic Space and Horizon Thermodynamics from Kaniadakis Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing Kaniadakis entropy associated with the apparent horizon of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe and applying the emergence of cosmic space paradigm, we deduce the modified Friedmann equation for a non-flat (n+1)-dimensional universe. Employing the first law of thermodynamics, we arrive at the same modified Friedmann equation, showing the connection between emergence of cosmic space and first law of thermodynamics. We also establish the condition to satisfy the Generalized second law of thermodynamics within the Kaniadakis framework. Our study illuminates the intricate connection between the law of emergence and horizon thermodynamics, offering a deeper insight through the lens of Kaniadakis entropy.</description>
