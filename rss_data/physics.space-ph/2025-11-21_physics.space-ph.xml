      <title>Nowcasting of Aviation Radiation Using Geospace Environment Properties: A Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation exposure at aviation altitudes presents significant health risks to aircrews due to the cumulative effects of ionizing radiation. Physics-based models estimate radiation levels based on geophysical and atmospheric parameters, but often struggle to capture the highly dynamic and complex nature of the radiation environment, limiting their real-time predictive capabilities. To address this challenge, we investigate machine learning (ML) methods to enhance real-time radiation nowcasting. Leveraging newly compiled ML-ready datasets, publicly available at https://dmlab.cs.gsu.edu/rdp/, we train supervised models capable of capturing both linear and non-linear relationships between Geospace conditions and atmospheric radiation levels. Our experiments demonstrate that the XGBoost model achieves approximately 10 percent improvement in prediction accuracy over the considered physics-based model. Furthermore, feature importance analysis reveals that certain Geospace properties, specifically solar polar fields, solar wind properties, and neutron monitor data, are impacting the nowcast of the radiation levels at flight altitudes. These findings suggest meaningful physical relationships between the near-Earth space environment and atmospheric radiation, and highlight the potential of ML-based approaches for operational space weather applications.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Active-Passive Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: experimental implementation and microdosimetric characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Space radiation is one of the major obstacles to space exploration. If not mitigated, radiation can interact both with biological and electronic systems, inducing damage and posing significant risk to space missions. Countermeasures can only be studied effectively with ground-based accelerators that act as a proxy for space radiation. Following an in-silico design and optimization process we have developed a galactic cosmic ray (GCR) simulator using a hybrid active-passive methodology. In this approach, the primary beam energy is actively switched and the beam interacts with specifically designed passive modulators. In this paper, we present the implementation of such a GCR simulator and its experimental microdosimetric characterization. Measuring the GCR field is of paramount importance, both before providing it to the user as a validated radiation field and for achieving the best possible radiation description. The issue is addressed in this paper by using a tissue equivalent proportional counter to measure radiation quality and by comparing experimental measurements with Monte Carlo simulations. In conclusion, we will demonstrate the GCR simulator's capability to reproduce a GCR field.</description>
