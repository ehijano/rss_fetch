      <title>Gradient Descent is Pareto-Optimal in the Oracle Complexity and Memory Tradeoff for Feasibility Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide oracle complexity lower bounds for finding a point in a given set using a memory-constrained algorithm that has access to a separation oracle. We assume that the set is contained within the unit $d$-dimensional ball and contains a ball of known radius $\epsilon&gt;0$. This setup is commonly referred to as the feasibility problem. We show that to solve feasibility problems with accuracy $\epsilon \geq e^{-d^{o(1)}}$, any deterministic algorithm either uses $d^{1+\delta}$ bits of memory or must make at least $1/(d^{0.01\delta }\epsilon^{2\frac{1-\delta}{1+1.01 \delta}-o(1)})$ oracle queries, for any $\delta\in[0,1]$. Additionally, we show that randomized algorithms either use $d^{1+\delta}$ memory or make at least $1/(d^{2\delta} \epsilon^{2(1-4\delta)-o(1)})$ queries for any $\delta\in[0,\frac{1}{4}]$. Because gradient descent only uses linear memory $\mathcal O(d\ln 1/\epsilon)$ but makes $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ queries, our results imply that it is Pareto-optimal in the oracle complexity/memory tradeoff. Further, our results show that the oracle complexity for deterministic algorithms is always polynomial in $1/\epsilon$ if the algorithm has less than quadratic memory in $d$. This reveals a sharp phase transition since with quadratic $\mathcal O(d^2 \ln1/\epsilon)$ memory, cutting plane methods only require $\mathcal O(d\ln 1/\epsilon)$ queries.</description>

      <title>Fuel-optimal powered descent guidance for lunar pinpoint landing using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Neural Networks (NNs) based approach for designing the Fuel-Optimal Powered Descent Guidance (FOPDG) for lunar pinpoint landing. According to Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, the optimality conditions are first derived. To generate the dataset of optimal trajectories for training NNs, we formulate a parameterized system, which allows for generating each optimal trajectory by a simple propagation without using any optimization method. Then, a dataset containing the optimal state and optimal thrust vector pairs can be readily collected. Since it is challenging for NNs to approximate bang-bang (or discontinuous) type of optimal thrust magnitude, we introduce a regularisation function to the switching function so that the regularized switching function approximated by a simple NN can be used to represent the optimal thrust magnitude. Meanwhile, another two well-trained NNs are used to predict the thrust steering angle and time of flight given a flight state. Finally, numerical simulations show that the proposed method is capable of generating the FOPDG that steers the lunar lander to the desired landing site with acceptable landing errors.</description>

      <title>Combination of Site-Wide and Real-Time Optimization for the Control of Systems of Flexible Energy Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of renewable energy sources introduces significant volatility and unpredictability to the energy supply chain, challenging the stability and reliability of the power grid. This work presents a method that enhances existing static optimization models by converting them into dynamic models suitable for the real-time optimization of flexible energy resources. By adapting static models for real-time application, the proposed two-stage optimization strategy allows for flexible adjustments of operational plans, facilitating the seamless integration of renewable energy sources. This approach not only ensures grid reliability but also improves economic efficiency by optimizing resource utilization. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through a case study involving a system of electrolyzers, showcasing significant advantages over traditional static optimization methods in aligning energy consumption with renewable energy generation.</description>

      <title>A Global Stochastic Maximum Principle for Mean-Field Forward-Backward Stochastic Control Systems with Quadratic Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our paper is devoted to the study of Peng's stochastic maximum principle (SMP) for a stochastic control problem composed of a controlled forward stochastic differential equation (SDE) as dynamics and a controlled backward SDE which defines the cost functional. Our studies combine the difficulties which come, on one hand, from the fact that the coefficients of both the SDE and the backward SDE are of mean-field type (i.e., they do not only depend on the control process and the solution processes but also on their law), and on the other hand, from the fact that the coefficient of the BSDE is of quadratic growth in $Z$. Our SMP is novel, it extends in a by far non trivial way existing results on SMP.</description>

      <title>Quadratically Regularized Optimal Transport: Existence and Multiplicity of Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal transport problem with quadratic regularization is useful when sparse couplings are desired. The density of the optimal coupling is described by two functions called potentials; equivalently, potentials can be defined as a solution of the dual problem. We prove the existence of potentials for a general square-integrable cost. Potentials are not necessarily unique, a phenomenon directly related to sparsity of the optimal support. For discrete problems, we describe the family of all potentials based on the connected components of the support, for a graph-theoretic notion of connectedness. On the other hand, we show that continuous problems have unique potentials under standard regularity assumptions, regardless of sparsity. Using potentials, we prove that the optimal support is indeed sparse for small regularization parameter in a continuous setting with quadratic cost, which seems to be the first theoretical guarantee for sparsity in this context.</description>

      <title>Peak Time-Windowed Risk Estimation of Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a method to upper-bound extreme-values of time-windowed risks for stochastic processes. Examples of such risks include the maximum average or 90\% quantile of the current along a transmission line in any 5-minute window. This work casts the time-windowed risk analysis problem as an infinite-dimensional linear program in occupation measures. In particular, we employ the coherent risk measures of the mean and the expected shortfall (conditional value at risk) to define the maximal time-windowed risk along trajectories. The infinite-dimensional linear program must then be truncated into finite-dimensional optimization problems, such as by using the moment-sum of squares hierarchy of semidefinite programs. The infinite-dimensional linear program will have the same optimal value as the original nonconvex risk estimation task under compactness and regularity assumptions, and the sequence of semidefinite programs will converge to the true value under additional properties of algebraic characterization. The scheme is demonstrated for</description>

      <title>Algebraic Proofs of Path Disconnectedness using Time-Dependent Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two subsets of a given set are path-disconnected if they lie in different connected components of the larger set. Verification of path-disconnectedness is essential in proving the infeasibility of motion planning and trajectory optimization algorithms. We formulate path-disconnectedness as the infeasibility of a single-integrator control task to move between an initial set and a target set in a sufficiently long time horizon. This control-infeasibility task is certified through the generation of a time-dependent barrier function that separates the initial and final sets. The existence of a time-dependent barrier function is a necessary and sufficient condition for path-disconnectedness under compactness conditions. Numerically, the search for a polynomial barrier function is formulated using the moment-sum-of-squares hierarchy of semidefinite programs. The barrier function proves path-disconnectedness at a sufficiently large polynomial degree. The computational complexity of these semidefinite programs can be reduced by elimination of the control variables. Disconnectedness proofs are synthesized for example systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a Hegselmann-Krause type opinion formation model for a system of two populations. The two groups interact with each other via subsets of individuals, namely the leaders, and natural time delay effects are considered. By using careful estimates of the system's trajectories, we are able to prove an asymptotic convergence to consensus result. Some numerical tests illustrate the theoretical result and point out some possible applications.</description>

      <title>Gaining or losing perspective for convex multivariate functions on box domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MINLO (mixed-integer nonlinear optimization) formulations of the disjunction between the origin and a polytope via a binary indicator variable is broadly used in nonlinear combinatorial optimization for modeling a fixed cost associated with carrying out a group of activities and a convex cost function associated with the levels of the activities. The perspective relaxation of such models is often used to solve to global optimality in a branch-and-bound context, but it typically requires suitable conic solvers and is not compatible with general-purpose NLP software in the presence of other classes of constraints. This motivates the investigation of when simpler but weaker relaxations may be adequate. Comparing the volume (i.e., Lebesgue measure) of the relaxations as a measure of tightness, we lift some of the results related to the simplex case to the box case. In order to compare the volumes of different relaxations in the box case, it is necessary to find an appropriate concave upper bound that preserves the convexity and is minimal, which is more difficult than in the simplex case. To address the challenge beyond the simplex case, the triangulation approach is used.</description>

      <title>Zero-one Laws for a Control Problem with Random Action Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many control problems there is only limited information about the actions that will be available at future stages. We introduce a framework where the Controller chooses actions $a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots$, one at a time. Her goal is to maximize the probability that the infinite sequence $(a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots)$ is an element of a given subset $G$ of $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$. The set $G$, called the goal, is assumed to be a Borel tail set. The Controller's choices are restricted: having taken a sequence $h_{t} = (a_{0}, \ldots, a_{t-1})$ of actions prior to stage $t \in \mathbb{N}$, she must choose an action $a_{t}$ at stage $t$ from a non-empty, finite subset $A(h_{t})$ of $\mathbb{N}$. The set $A(h_{t})$ is chosen from a distribution $p_{t}$, independently over all $t \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $h_{t} \in \mathbb{N}^{t}$. We consider several information structures defined by how far ahead into the future the Controller knows what actions will be available.
  In the special case where all the action sets are singletons (and thus the Controller is a dummy), Kolmogorov's 0-1 law says that the probability for the goal to be reached is 0 or 1. We construct a number of counterexamples to show that in general the value of the control problem can be strictly between 0 and 1, and derive several sufficient conditions for the 0-1 ``law" to hold.</description>

      <title>POD Suboptimal Control of Evolution Problems: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work is organized as follows. First an introduction is given in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2 we introduce the POD method in finite and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and discuss various applications. Chapter 3 is devoted to to POD-based Galerkin schemes for evolution problems. Mainly, we study linear problems taking different discretization methods into account. We provide a certified a-priori and a-posteriori error analysis. Furthermore, the numerical realizations are explained and illustrated by test examples. Quadratic programming problems governed by liner evolution problems are investigated in Chapter 4. As in Chapter 3 we present a certified a-priori and a-posteriori error analysis. Moreover, we discuss basis update strategies. In Chapter 5 we give an outlook to further directions in reduced-order modeling in optimal control and optimization. More precisely, a nonlinear optimal control problem is studied. Moreover, state-constrained optimization problems are solved by a tailored combination of primal-dual active set methods and POD-aesed reduced-order modeling. Furthermore, POD Galerkin methods for multiobjective optimal control problems are investigated. Finally, some required theoretical foundations are summarized in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Learned Finite-Time Consensus for Distributed Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most algorithms for decentralized learning employ a consensus or diffusion mechanism to drive agents to a common solution of a global optimization problem. Generally this takes the form of linear averaging, at a rate of contraction determined by the mixing rate of the underlying network topology. For very sparse graphs this can yield a bottleneck, slowing down the convergence of the learning algorithm. We show that a sequence of matrices achieving finite-time consensus can be learned for unknown graph topologies in a decentralized manner by solving a constrained matrix factorization problem. We demonstrate numerically the benefit of the resulting scheme in both structured and unstructured graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a connection between multiplication operators and shift operators. Moreover, we derive positive semidefinite conditions of finite rank moment sequences and use these conditions to strengthen Lasserre's hierarchy for real and complex polynomial optimization. Integration of the strengthening technique with sparsity is considered. Extensive numerical experiments show that our strengthening technique can significantly improve the bound (especially for complex polynomial optimization) and allows to achieve global optimality at lower relaxation orders, thus providing substantial computational savings.</description>

      <title>A Gauss-Newton Approach for Min-Max Optimization in Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel first-order method is proposed for training generative adversarial networks (GANs). It modifies the Gauss-Newton method to approximate the min-max Hessian and uses the Sherman-Morrison inversion formula to calculate the inverse. The method corresponds to a fixed-point method that ensures necessary contraction. To evaluate its effectiveness, numerical experiments are conducted on various datasets commonly used in image generation tasks, such as MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR10, FFHQ, and LSUN. Our method is capable of generating high-fidelity images with greater diversity across multiple datasets. It also achieves the highest inception score for CIFAR10 among all compared methods, including state-of-the-art second-order methods. Additionally, its execution time is comparable to that of first-order min-max methods.</description>

      <title>Compressed Gradient Tracking for Decentralized Optimization Over General Directed Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.07243v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two communication efficient decentralized optimization algorithms over a general directed multi-agent network. The first algorithm, termed Compressed Push-Pull (CPP), combines the gradient tracking Push-Pull method with communication compression. We show that CPP is applicable to a general class of unbiased compression operators and achieves linear convergence rate for strongly convex and smooth objective functions. The second algorithm is a broadcast-like version of CPP (B-CPP), and it also achieves linear convergence rate under the same conditions on the objective functions. B-CPP can be applied in an asynchronous broadcast setting and further reduce communication costs compared to CPP. Numerical experiments complement the theoretical analysis and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) scheme with relaxed stability criteria, based on the idea of generalized discrete-time control Lyapunov functions. These functions need to satisfy an average descent over a finite window of time, rather than a descent at every time step. One feature of this scheme is that it allows for implementing a flexible number of control inputs in each iteration, in a computationally attractive manner, while guaranteeing recursive feasibility and stability. The benefits of our flexible-step implementation are also demonstrated in an application to nonholonomic systems, where the one-step standard implementation may suffer from lack of asymptotic convergence.</description>

      <title>Linearized Optimal Power Flow for Multiphase Radial Networks with Delta Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a linear approximation of the alternating current optimal power flow problem for multiphase distribution networks with voltage-dependent loads connected in both wye and delta configurations. We establish a set of linear equations that exactly describes the relationship between power changes at a bus and the corresponding values from a delta-connected device under specific assumptions necessary for a widely accepted linear model. Numerical studies on IEEE test feeders demonstrate that the proposed linear model provides solutions with reasonable error bounds efficiently, as compared with an exact nonconvex formulation and a convex conic relaxation. Our experiments reveal that modeling delta-connected, voltage-dependent loads as if they are wye-connected can lead to significantly different voltage profiles. We also investigate the limitations of the proposed linear approximation stemming from the underlying assumptions, while emphasizing its robust performance in practical situations.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Optimization Filters for Stochastic Time-Varying Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We look at a stochastic time-varying optimization problem and we formulate online algorithms to find and track its optimizers in expectation. The algorithms are derived from the intuition that standard prediction and correction steps can be seen as a nonlinear dynamical system and a measurement equation, respectively, yielding the notion of nonlinear filter design. The optimization algorithms are then based on an extended Kalman filter in the unconstrained case, and on a bilinear matrix inequality condition in the constrained case. Some special cases and variations are discussed, notably the case of parametric filters, yielding certificates based on LPV analysis and, if one wishes, matrix sum-of-squares relaxations. Supporting numerical results are presented from real data sets in ride-hailing scenarios. The results are encouraging, especially when predictions are accurate, a case which is often encountered in practice when historical data is abundant.</description>

      <title>Nash equilibria for relative investors with (non)linear price impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.18161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the strategic interaction of $n$ investors who are able to influence a stock price process and at the same time measure their utilities relative to the other investors. Our main aim is to find Nash equilibrium investment strategies in this setting in a financial market driven by a Brownian motion and investigate the influence the price impact has on the equilibrium. We consider both CRRA and CARA utility functions. Our findings show that the problem is well-posed as long as the price impact is at most linear. Moreover, numerical results reveal that the investors behave very aggressively when the price impact is beyond a critical parameter.</description>

      <title>Primal-Dual iLQR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00748v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new algorithm for solving unconstrained discrete-time optimal control problems. Our method follows a direct multiple shooting approach, and consists of applying the SQP method together with an $\ell_2$ augmented Lagrangian primal-dual merit function. We use the LQR algorithm to efficiently solve the primal-dual Newton-KKT system. As our algorithm is a specialization of NPSQP, it inherits its generic properties, including global convergence, fast local convergence, and the lack of need for second order corrections or dimension expansions, improving on existing direct multiple shooting approaches such as acados, ALTRO, GNMS, FATROP, and FDDP. As our algorithm avoids sequential rollouts of the nonlinear dynamics, it can be combined with (S\"arkk\"a and Garc\'ia-Fern\'andez, 2023) to run in $O(\log(N))$ parallel time per iteration (where $N$ is the number of stages), as well as $O(1)$ parallel time per line search iteration. Therefore, this paper provides a practical, theoretically sound, and highly parallelizable (for example, with a GPU) method for solving nonlinear discrete-time optimal control problems.</description>

      <title>Expander graphs are globally synchronizing</title>

Abstract: The Kuramoto model is fundamental to the study of synchronization. It consists of a collection of oscillators with interactions given by a network, which we identify respectively with vertices and edges of a graph. In this paper, we show that a graph with sufficient expansion must be globally synchronizing, meaning that a homogeneous Kuramoto model of identical oscillators on such a graph will converge to the fully synchronized state with all the oscillators having the same phase, for every initial state up to a set of measure zero. In particular, we show that for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and $p \geq (1 + \varepsilon) (\log n) / n$, the homogeneous Kuramoto model on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n, p)$ is globally synchronizing with probability tending to one as $n$ goes to infinity. This improves on a previous result of Kassabov, Strogatz, and Townsend and solves a conjecture of Ling, Xu, and Bandeira. We also show that the model is globally synchronizing on any $d$-regular Ramanujan graph, and on typical $d$-regular graphs, for large enough degree $d$.</description>

      <title>Theory of Compression Channels for Post-selected Quantum Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-selected quantum metrological scheme is especially advantageous when the final measurements are either very noisy or expensive in practical experiments. In this work, we put forward a general theory on the compression channels in post-selected metrology. We define the basic notions characterizing the compression quality and illuminate the underlying structure of lossless compression channels. Previous experiments on post-selected optical phase estimation and weak-value amplification are shown to be particular cases of this general theory. Furthermore, for two categories of bipartite systems, we show that the compression loss can be made arbitrarily small even when the compression channel acts only on one subsystem. These findings can be employed to distribute quantum measurements so that the measurement noise and cost are dramatically reduced.</description>

      <title>Global $\mathcal{L}^2$ minimization at uniform exponential rate via geometrically adapted gradient descent in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15487v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the scenario of supervised learning in Deep Learning (DL) networks, and exploit the arbitrariness of choice in the Riemannian metric relative to which the gradient descent flow can be defined (a general fact of differential geometry). In the standard approach to DL, the gradient flow on the space of parameters (weights and biases) is defined with respect to the Euclidean metric. Here instead, we choose the gradient flow with respect to the Euclidean metric in the output layer of the DL network. This naturally induces two modified versions of the gradient descent flow in the parameter space, one adapted for the overparametrized setting, and the other for the underparametrized setting. In the overparametrized case, we prove that, provided that a rank condition holds, all orbits of the modified gradient descent drive the ${\mathcal L}^2$ cost to its global minimum at a uniform exponential convergence rate; one thereby obtains an a priori stopping time for any prescribed proximity to the global minimum. We point out relations of the latter to sub-Riemannian geometry. Moreover, we generalize the above framework to the situation in which the rank condition does not hold; in particular, we show that local equilibria can only exist if a rank loss occurs, and that generically, they are not isolated points, but elements of a critical submanifold of parameter space.</description>
