      <title>Pattern Formation as a Resilience Mechanism in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical and computational modelling in oncology has played an increasingly important role in not only understanding the impact of various approaches to treatment on tumour growth, but in optimizing dosing regimens and aiding the development of treatment strategies. However, as with all modelling, only an approximation is made in the description of the biological and physical system. Here we show that tissue-scale spatial structure can have a profound impact on the resilience of tumours to immunotherapy using a classical model incorporating IL-2 compounds and effector cells as treatment parameters. Using linear stability analysis, numerical continuation, and direct simulations, we show that diffusing cancer cell populations can undergo pattern-forming (Turing) instabilities, leading to spatially-structured states that persist far into treatment regimes where the corresponding spatially homogeneous systems would uniformly predict a cancer-free state. These spatially-patterned states persist in a wide range of parameters, as well as under time-dependent treatment regimes. Incorporating treatment via domain boundaries can increase this resistance to treatment in the interior of the domain, further highlighting the importance of spatial modelling when designing treatment protocols informed by mathematical models. Counter-intuitively, this mechanism shows that increased effector cell mobility can increase the resilience of tumours to treatment. We conclude by discussing practical and theoretical considerations for understanding this kind of spatial resilience in other models of cancer treatment, in particular those incorporating more realistic spatial transport.</description>

      <title>BioX-CPath: Biologically-driven Explainable Diagnostics for Multistain IHC Computational Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of biologically interpretable and explainable models remains a key challenge in computational pathology, particularly for multistain immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. We present BioX-CPath, an explainable graph neural network architecture for whole slide image (WSI) classification that leverages both spatial and semantic features across multiple stains. At its core, BioX-CPath introduces a novel Stain-Aware Attention Pooling (SAAP) module that generates biologically meaningful, stain-aware patient embeddings. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both Rheumatoid Arthritis and Sjogren's Disease multistain datasets. Beyond performance metrics, BioX-CPath provides interpretable insights through stain attention scores, entropy measures, and stain interaction scores, that permit measuring model alignment with known pathological mechanisms. This biological grounding, combined with strong classification performance, makes BioX-CPath particularly suitable for clinical applications where interpretability is key.

      <title>Image segmentation of treated and untreated tumor spheroids by Fully Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) are advanced cell culture systems for assessing the impact of combinatorial radio(chemo)therapy. They exhibit therapeutically relevant in-vivo-like characteristics from 3D cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions to radial pathophysiological gradients related to proliferative activity and nutrient/oxygen supply, altering cellular radioresponse. State-of-the-art assays quantify long-term curative endpoints based on collected brightfield image time series from large treated spheroid populations per irradiation dose and treatment arm. Here, spheroid control probabilities are documented analogous to in-vivo tumor control probabilities based on Kaplan-Meier curves. This analyses require laborious spheroid segmentation of up to 100.000 images per treatment arm to extract relevant structural information from the images, e.g., diameter, area, volume and circularity. While several image analysis algorithms are available for spheroid segmentation, they all focus on compact MCTS with clearly distinguishable outer rim throughout growth. However, treated MCTS may partly be detached and destroyed and are usually obscured by dead cell debris. We successfully train two Fully Convolutional Networks, UNet and HRNet, and optimize their hyperparameters to develop an automatic segmentation for both untreated and treated MCTS. We systematically validate the automatic segmentation on larger, independent data sets of spheroids derived from two human head-and-neck cancer cell lines. We find an excellent overlap between manual and automatic segmentation for most images, quantified by Jaccard indices at around 90%. For images with smaller overlap of the segmentations, we demonstrate that this error is comparable to the variations across segmentations from different biological experts, suggesting that these images represent biologically unclear or ambiguous cases.</description>
