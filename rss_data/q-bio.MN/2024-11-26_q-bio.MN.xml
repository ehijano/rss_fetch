      <title>Finding Thermodynamically Favorable Pathways in Reaction Networks using Flows in Hypergraphs and Mixed Integer Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding pathways that optimize the formation of a particular target molecule in a chemical reaction network is a key problem in many settings, including reactor systems. Reaction networks are mathematically well represented as hypergraphs, a modeling that facilitates the search for pathways by computational means. We propose to enrich an existing search method for pathways by including thermodynamic principles. In more detail, we give a mixed-integer linear programming (mixed ILP) formulation of the search problem into which we integrate chemical potentials and concentrations for individual molecules, enabling us to constrain the search to return pathways containing only thermodynamically favorable reactions. Moreover, if multiple possible pathways are found, we can rank these by objective functions based on thermodynamics. As an example of use, we apply the framework to a reaction network representing the HCN-formamide chemistry. Alternative pathways to the one currently hypothesized in literature are queried and enumerated, including some that score better according to our chosen objective function.</description>

      <title>Prior Biological Knowledge And Epigenetic Information Enhances Prediction Accuracy Of Bayesian Wnt Pathway</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4296</link>
      <description>arXiv:1307.4296v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational modeling of Wnt signaling pathway has gained prominence for its use as computer aided diagnostic tool to develop therapeutic cancer target drugs and predict of test samples as cancerous and non cancerous. This manuscript focuses on development of simple static bayesian network models of varying complexity that encompasses prior partially available biological knowledge about intra and extra cellular factors affecting the Wnt pathway and incorporates epigenetic information like methylation and histone modification of a few genes known to have inhibitory affect on Wnt pathway. It might be expected that such models not only increase cancer prediction accuracies and also form basis for understanding Wnt signaling activity in different states of tumorigenesis. Initial results in human colorectal cancer cases indicate that incorporation of epigenetic information increases prediction accuracy of test samples as being tumorous or normal. Receiver Operator Curves (ROC) and their respective area under the curve (AUC) measurements, obtained from predictions of state of test sample and corresponding predictions of the state of activation of transcription complex of the Wnt pathway for the test sample, indicate that there is significant difference between the Wnt pathway being on (off) and its association with the sample being tumorous (normal). Two sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test confirm the statistical deviation between the distributions of these predictions. At a preliminary stage, use of these models may help in understanding the yet unknown effect of certain factors like DKK2, DKK3-1 and SFRP-2/3/5 on {\beta}-catenin transcription complex.</description>

      <title>Biological insights from RIL-seq in bacteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bacteria reside in constantly changing environments and require rapid and precise adjustments of gene expression to ensure survival. Small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) are a crucial element that bacteria utilize to achieve this. sRNAs are short RNA molecules that modulate gene expression usually through base-pairing interactions with target RNAs, primarily mRNAs. These interactions can lead to either negative outcomes such as mRNA degradation or translational repression or positive outcomes such as mRNA stabilization or translation enhancement. In recent years, high-throughput approaches such as RIL-seq (RNA interaction by ligation and sequencing) revolutionized the sRNA field by enabling the identification of sRNA targets on a global scale, unveiling intricate sRNA-RNA networks. In this review, we discuss the insights gained from investigating sRNA-RNA networks in well-studied bacterial species as well as in under-studied bacterial species. Having a complete understanding of sRNA-mediated regulation is critical for the development of new strategies for controlling bacterial growth and combating bacterial infections.</description>

      <title>Exact computation of Transfer Entropy with Path Weight Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to quantify the directional flow of information is vital to understanding natural systems and designing engineered information-processing systems. A widely used measure to quantify this information flow is the transfer entropy. However, until now, this quantity could only be obtained in dynamical models using approximations that are typically uncontrolled. Here we introduce a computational algorithm called Transfer Entropy-Path Weight Sampling (TE-PWS), which makes it possible, for the first time, to quantify the transfer entropy and its variants exactly for any stochastic model, including those with multiple hidden variables, nonlinearity, transient conditions, and feedback. By leveraging techniques from polymer and path sampling, TE-PWS efficiently computes the transfer entropy as a Monte-Carlo average over signal trajectory space. We apply TE-PWS to linear and nonlinear systems to reveal how transfer entropy can overcome naive applications of the data processing inequality in the presence of feedback.</description>
