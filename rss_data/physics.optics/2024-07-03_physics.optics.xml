      <title>Quantum microwave photonic mixer with a large spurious-free dynamic range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of the most fundamental functionalities of microwave photonics, microwave frequency mixing plays an essential role in modern radars and wireless communication systems. However, the commonly utilized intensity modulation in the systems often leads to inadequate spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) for many sought-after applications. Quantum microwave photonics technique offers a promising solution for improving SFDR in terms of higher-order harmonic distortion. In this paper, we demonstrate two types of quantum microwave photonic mixers based on the configuration of the intensity modulators: cascade-type and parallel-type. Leveraging the nonlocal RF signal encoding capability, both types of quantum microwave photonic mixers not only exhibit the advantage of dual-channel output but also present significant improvement in SFDR. Specifically, the parallel-type quantum microwave photonic mixer achieves a remarkable SFDR value of 113.6 dB.Hz1/2, which is 30 dB better than that of the cascade-type quantum microwave photonic mixer. When compared to the classical microwave photonic mixer, this enhancement reaches a notable 53.6 dB at the expense of 8 dB conversion loss. These results highlight the superiority of quantum microwave photonic mixers in the fields of microwave and millimeter-wave systems. Further applying multi-photon frequency entangled sources as optical carriers, the dual-channel microwave frequency conversion capability endowed by the quantum microwave photonic mixer can be extended to enhance the performance of multiple-paths microwave mixing which is essential for radar net systems.</description>

      <title>A versatile quantum microwave photonic signal processing platform based on coincidence window selection technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum microwave photonics (QMWP) is an innovative approach that combines energy-time entangled biphoton sources as the optical carrier with time-correlated single-photon detection for high-speed RF signal recovery. This groundbreaking method offers unique advantages such as nonlocal RF signal encoding and robust resistance to dispersion-induced frequency fading. This paper explores the versatility of processing the quantum microwave photonic signal by utilizing coincidence window selection on the biphoton coincidence distribution. The demonstration includes finely-tunable RF phase shifting, flexible multi-tap transversal filtering (with up to 15 taps), and photonically implemented RF mixing, leveraging the nonlocal RF mapping characteristic of QMWP. These accomplishments significantly enhance the capability of microwave photonic systems in processing ultra-weak signals, opening up new possibilities for various applications.</description>

      <title>Wavefront sensing with a Gradient Phase Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wavefront sensors have now become core components in the fields of metrology of optical systems, biomedical optics, and adaptive optics systems for astronomy. However, none of the designs used or proposed so far achieve simultaneously a high spatial resolution at the pupil of the tested optics and absolute measurement accuracy comparable to those of modern laser-interferometers. This paper presents an improved wavefront sensor concept that reaches both previous goals. This device named Crossed-sine phase sensor (CSPS) is based on a fully transparent gradient phase filter (GPF) placed at an intermediate location between the virtual pupil and image planes of the tested optics. The theoretical principle of the sensor is described in Fourier optics formalism. Numerical simulations confirm that a measurement accuracy of Lambda/100 RMS is achievable. The CSPS also offers the advantages of being quasi-achromatic and working on spatially or spectrally extended, natural or artificial light sources</description>

      <title>Optical vortex-antivortex crystallization in free space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stable vortex lattices are basic dynamical patterns which have been demonstrated in physical systems including superconductor physics, Bose-Einstein condensates, hydrodynamics and optics. Vortex-antivortex (VAV) ensembles can be produced, self-organizing into the respective polar lattices. However, these structures are in general highly unstable due to the strong VAV attraction. Here, we demonstrate that multiple optical VAV clusters nested in the propagating coherent field can crystallize into patterns which preserve their lattice structures over distance up to several Rayleigh lengths. To explain this phenomenon, we present a model for effective interactions between the vortices and antivortices at different lattice sites. The observed VAV crystallization is a consequence of the globally balanced VAV couplings. As the crystallization does not require the presence of nonlinearities and appears in free space, it may find applications to high-capacity optical communications and multiparticle manipulations. Our findings suggest possibilities for constructing VAV complexes through the orbit-orbit couplings, which differs from the extensively studied spin-orbit couplings.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Kerr-Induced Satellites in Multi-Pulse CPA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amplification of bursts of ultrashort pulses is very challenging when the intraburst repetition frequency reaches the THz range, corresponding to (sub)-ps intervals between consecutive pulses. Periodic interference significantly modifies conditions for chirped pulse amplification (CPA) which gives rise to temporal and spectral distortions during CPA due to the optical Kerr nonlinearity. Multi-pulse chirped amplification to mJ energies may lead to a pronounced degradation of burst fidelity and the appearance of periodic temporal satellites after de-chirping the amplified waveform. We study, experimentally and numerically, the limitations of THz burst-mode CPA caused by self- and cross-phase modulation. A number of practical recipes to suppress nonlinear distortions and improve energy scaling by optimizing burst parameters and applying modulation techniques are presented.</description>

      <title>SPIDERweb: a Neural Network approach to spectral phase interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliably characterised pulses are the starting point of any application of ultrafast techniques. Unfortunately, experimental constraints do not always allow optimising the characterisation conditions. This dictates the need for refined analysis methods. Here we show that neutral networks can provide a viable characterisation when applied to data from SPIDER. We have adopted a cascade of convolutional networks, addressing the multiparameter structure of the interferogram with a reasonable computing power. In particular, the necessity of precalibration is reduced, thus pointing towards the introduction of neural networks in more generic arrangements.</description>

      <title>Dielectric Fano Nanoantennas for Enabling Sub-Nanosecond Lifetimes in NV-based Single Photon Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state quantum emitters are essential sources of single photons, and enhancing their emission rates is of paramount importance for applications in quantum communications, computing, and metrology. One approach is to couple quantum emitters with resonant photonic nanostructures, where the emission rate is enhanced due to the Purcell effect. Dielectric nanoantennas are promising as they provide strong emission enhancement compared to plasmonic ones, which suffer from high Ohmic loss. Here, we designed and fabricated a dielectric Fano resonator based on a pair of silicon (Si) ellipses and a disk, which supports the mode hybridization between quasi-bound-states-in-the-continuum (quasi-BIC) and Mie resonance. We demonstrated the performance of the developed resonant system by interfacing it with single photon emitters (SPEs) based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers in nanodiamonds (NDs). We observed that the interfaced emitters have a Purcell enhancement factor of ~10, with sub-ns emission lifetime and a polarization contrast of 9. Our results indicate a promising method for developing efficient and compact single-photon sources for integrated quantum photonics applications.</description>

      <title>Visible, Near-, and Mid-infrared Computational Spectrometer Enabled by Single-Spinning Film Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational spectrometers are pivotal in enabling low-cost, in-situ and rapid spectral analysis, with potential applications in chemistry, biology, and environmental science. However, filter-based spectral encoding approaches typically use filter arrays, complicating the manufacturing process and hindering device consistency. By capitalizing on the polarization separation effect under oblique incidence (PSEOI), we pioneer the use of a single filter for highly efficient spectral encoding, and propose a novel computational spectrometer spanning visible to mid-infrared wavelengths by combining the Single-Spinning Film Encoder (SSFE) with deep learning-based reconstruction algorithm. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is employed to optimize the film configuration of SSFE, achieving low-correlation and high-complexity spectral responses under different polarizations and spinning angles, thereby enhancing both spectral resolution and accuracy of reconstruction across diverse spectral ranges. Spectral resolutions up to 0.5 nm, 2 nm, 10 nm can be realized for single-peak narrowband spectra, and 3 nm, 6 nm, 20 nm for dual-peak narrowband spectra, over the visible, near-, and mid-infrared wavelength ranges, respectively. Moreover, the proposed spectrometer demonstrates an overall 81.38% precision for the classification of 220 chemical compounds, confirming its robustness and precision in practical scenarios, along with the capability for compact, cost-effective spectroscopic solutions.</description>

      <title>Frequency-selective terahertz wave amplification by a time-boundary-engineered Huygens metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast manipulation of optical resonance can establish the time-boundary effect in time-variant media leading to a new degree of freedom for coherent control of electromagnetic waves. Here, we demonstrate that a free-standing all dielectric Huygens metasurface of degenerate electric and magnetic resonances can prompt the broadband near-unity transmission in its static state, whereas it enables wave amplification in the presence of time boundary. The time boundary is realized by femtosecond laser excitations that transiently inject free carriers into the constituent meta-atoms for dynamic removal of a pre-established two-fold degeneracy. We observe that the transmittance in the photo-excited Huygens metasurface can exceed unity transmittance, i.e., THz wave amplification, by a factor over 20% in intensity at frequencies tunable by varying the arrival of time boundary with respect to that of the seed terahertz pulse. By numerical simulations and analysis with time-dependent coupled mode theory, we show that the wave amplification results from the ultrafast Q-switching and shift in resonant frequencies. This work demonstrates a new approach to achieve tunable amplification in an optical microcavity by exploiting the concept of time-variant media and the unique electromagnetic properties of Huygens metasurface.</description>

      <title>Optically Pumped Terahertz Amplitude Modulation in Type-II Ge QD/Si heterostructures grown via Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article exploits group-IV germanium (Ge) quantum dots (QDs) on Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) in order to explore its optical behaviour in the Terahertz (THz) regime. In this work, Ge QDs, pumped by an above bandgap near infrared wavelength, exhibit THz amplitude modulation in the frequency range of 0.1-1.0 THz. The epitaxial Ge QDs outperform reference SOI substrate in THz amplitude modulation owing to higher carrier generation in weakly confined dots compared to its bulk counterpart. This is further corroborated using theoretical model based on the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method. This model enables the calculation of photo carriers generated (PCG) and their confinement in the Ge QD region. Our model also reroutes the calculation from PCG to corresponding plasma frequency and hence to refractive index and THz photo-conductivity. Moreover, the photo-generated confined holes accumulation at the Ge QDs-Si interface is elevated after optical illumination, leading to a decreased THz photo-conductivity. This augmentation in THz photo-conductivity contributes to a significant enhancement of THz modulation depth ~77% at Ge QDs-Si interfaces compared to bare SOI at 0.1 THz.</description>

      <title>Programmable Photonic Extreme Learning Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic neural networks offer a promising alternative to traditional electronic systems for machine learning accelerators due to their low latency and energy efficiency. However, the challenge of implementing the backpropagation algorithm during training has limited their development. To address this, alternative machine learning schemes, such as extreme learning machines (ELMs), have been proposed. ELMs use a random hidden layer to increase the feature space dimensionality, requiring only the output layer to be trained through linear regression, thus reducing training complexity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a programmable photonic extreme learning machine (PPELM) using a hexagonal waveguide mesh, and which enables to program directly on chip the input feature vector and the random hidden layer. Our system also permits to apply the nonlinearity directly on-chip by using the systems integrated photodetecting elements. Using the PPELM we solved successfully three different complex classification tasks. Additioanlly, we also propose and demonstrate two techniques to increase the accuracy of the models and reduce their variability using an evolutionary algorithm and a wavelength division multiplexing approach, obtaining excellent performance. Our results show that programmable photonic processors may become a feasible way to train competitive machine learning models on a versatile and compact platform.</description>

      <title>Programming universal unitary transformations on a general-purpose silicon photonics platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General-purpose programmable photonic processors provide a versatile platform for integrating diverse functionalities on a single chip. Leveraging a two-dimensional hexagonal waveguide mesh of Mach-Zehnder interferometers, these systems have demonstrated significant potential in microwave photonics applications. Additionally, they are a promising platform for creating unitary linear transformations, which are key elements in quantum computing and photonic neural networks. However, a general procedure for implementing these transformations on such systems has not been established yet. This work demonstrates the programming of universal unitary transformations on a general-purpose programmable photonic circuit with a hexagonal topology. We detail the steps to split the light on-chip, demonstrate that an equivalent structure to the Mach-Zehnder interferometer with one internal and one external phase shifter can be built in the hexagonal mesh, and program both the triangular and rectangular architectures for matrix multiplication. We recalibrate the system to account for passive phase deviations. Experimental programming of 3x3 and 4x4 random unitary matrices yields fidelities &gt; 98% and bit precisions over 5 bits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that random unitary matrices are demonstrated on a general-purpose photonic processor and pave the way for the implementation of programmable photonic circuits in optical computing and signal processing systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantitative phase image formation process is posed as a problem of parameter estimation from intensity measurements. This approach is inclusive of traditional pixel-oriented imaging, where the sought parameters are the pixel values. The resulting optimization process to find the parameters is then seen to depend on the Sensitivity Field: this is the gradient of the scattered field with respect to the parameters, and it turns out to obey a scattering relationship that is analogous to that of the original scattered field. Examples are given from several regimes of scattering strength.</description>

      <title>Optimized Receiver Design for Entanglement-Assisted Communication using BPSK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of pre-shared entanglement in entanglement-assisted communication offers a superior alternative to classical communication, especially in the photon-starved regime and highly noisy environments. In this paper, we analyze the performance of several low-complexity receivers that use optical parametric amplifiers. The simulations demonstrate that receivers employing an entanglement-assisted scheme with phase-shift-keying modulation can outperform classical capacities. We present a 2x2 optical hybrid receiver for entanglement-assisted communication and show that it has a roughly 10% lower error probability compared to previously proposed optical parametric amplifier-based receivers for more than 10 modes. However, the capacity of the optical parametric amplifier-based receiver exceeds the Holevo capacity and the capacities of the optical phase conjugate receiver and 2x2 optical hybrid receiver in the case of a single mode. The numerical findings indicate that surpassing the Holevo and Homodyne capacities does not require a large number of signal-idler modes. Furthermore, we find that using unequal priors for BPSK provides roughly three times the information rate advantage over equal priors.</description>

      <title>Towards an Innate Cell-Environment Nanothermometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the PubMed database, there are around 260 manuscripts describing nanothermometers. These research articles detail the synthesis, performance, and application of intracellular nanothermometers. This intracellular prevalence is due to the significant importance, complexity, and utility of the intracellular compartments for understanding cell metabolism and disease treatment. However, in recent years, the extracellular environment of the cell has emerged as a crucial factor in medicine, particularly in hyperthermia and immunotherapy. Despite this, we have not seen evidence in the literature describing the utilization or performance of a nanothermometer designed for extracellular temperature measurements. This oversight not only neglects the potential for measuring extracellular temperature but also fails to address the extracellular environment of the cell. Here, we introduce a nanothermometer designed specifically for measuring extracellular temperature by directly converting serum proteins into nanothermometers (either unmodified or labeled with the clinically approved dye Fluorescein). Additionally, leveraging the extracellular localization of these nanothermometers, we demonstrate (1) the enhancement of their temperature sensitivity by combining them with gold nanorods, and (2) their capability to generate damage and disrupt the plasma membrane, thus opening the door to their use as photodynamic therapy agents. We firmly believe that these advancements represent not only a broadening of the applications of nanothermometry but also a pioneering step in showcasing the ability of nanothermometers to induce cell death.</description>

Abstract: Thouless pumping is an emblematic manifestation of topology in physics, referring to the ability to induce a quantized transport of charge across a system by simply varying one of its parameters periodically in time. The original concept of Thouless pumping involves a non-interacting system, and has been implemented in several platforms. One current challenge in the field is to extend this concept to interacting systems. In this article, we propose a Thouless pump that solely relies on nonlinear physics, within a chain of coupled Kerr resonators. Leveraging the driven-dissipative nature of the system, we modulate in space and time the onsite Kerr interaction energies, and generate 1+1-dimensional topological bands in the Bogoliubov spectrum of excitations. These bands present the same topology as the ones obtained within the Harper-Hofstadter framework, and the Wannier states associated to each band experience a net displacement and show quantized transport according to the bands Chern numbers. Remarkably, we find driving configurations leading to band inversion, revealing an interaction-induced topological transition. Our numerical simulations are performed using realistic parameters inspired from exciton polaritons, which form a platform of choice for investigating driven topological phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Multiscale Modeling of Colloidal Plasmonic Nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel fully atomistic multiscale classical approach to model the optical response of solvated real-size plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) is presented. The model is based on the coupling of the Frequency Dependent Fluctuating Charges and Fluctuating Dipoles ($\omega$FQF$\mu$), specifically designed to describe plasmonic substrates, and the polarizable Fluctuating Charges (FQ) classical force field to model the solvating environment. The resulting $\omega$FQF$\mu$/FQ approach accounts for the interactions between the radiation and the NP, as well as with the surrounding solvent molecules, by incorporating mutual interactions between the plasmonic substrate and solvent. $\omega$FQF$\mu$/FQ is validated against reference TD-DFTB/FQ calculations, demonstrating remarkable accuracy, particularly in reproducing plasmon resonance frequency shifts for structures below the quantum-size limit. The flexibility and reliability of the approach are also demonstrated by simulating the optical response of homogeneous and bimetallic NPs dissolved in pure solvents and solvent mixtures.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gouy Rotation of Electron Vortex beams in uniform magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rotation of electron vortex beams (EVBs) presents a complex interplay of the Gouy phase characterizing free-space behavior and Landau states or Larmor rotation observed in magnetic fields. Despite being studied separately, these phenomena manifest within a single beam during its propagation in magnetic fields, lacking a comprehensive description. We address this by utilizing exact solutions of the relativistic paraxial equation in magnetic fields, termed "paraxial Landau modes". The paraxial Landau modes describe the quantum states of EVBs in magnetic fields. Our study of rotation angles demonstrates consistency with experimental data, supporting the practical presence of these modes. We provide a unified description of different regimes under generalized Gouy rotation, linking the Gouy phase to EVB rotation angles. This connection enhances our understanding of the Gouy phase and can be extended to nonuniform magnetic fields. Our theoretical analysis is validated through numerical simulations using the Chebyshev method. This work offers new insights into the dynamics of EVBs in magnetic fields and suggests practical applications in beam manipulation and beam optics of vortex particles.</description>

      <title>Multiple topological transitions and spectral singularities in non-Hermitian Floquet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between Floquet driving and non-Hermitian gain/loss could give rise to intriguing phenomena including topological funneling of light, edge-state delocalization, anomalous topological transitions and Floquet non-Hermitian skin effects. In this work, we uncover two unique phenomena in Floquet systems caused by gain and loss. First, multiple topological transitions from anomalous Floquet second-order topological insulators to anomalous Floquet first-order topological insulators and then to normal insulators can be induced by gain and loss. Interestingly, the resulting anomalous Floquet insulators further carry hybrid skin-topological boundary modes, which could either be fully localized or localized to different edges at different time slices and traversing along all edges in a single driving period. The topological phase transitions are also shown to be detectable through studies of transmission properties in the setting of coupled ring resonators. Second, gain and loss are found to induce singularities in the Floquet spectral, around which anomalous transmissions at flat quasienergy bands are predicted. These discoveries not only enhanced our understanding of topological matter and phase transitions in driven non-Hermitian systems, but also promoted their experimental realizations in optical and acoustic settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cycling performance of lithium-ion batteries is closely related to the expansion effect of anode materials during charge and discharge processes. Studying the mechanical field evolution of anode materials is crucial for evaluating battery per-formance. Here, we propose a phase-sensitive ultra-high spatial resolution optical frequency domain reflectometry tech-nique, in which the test fiber is embedded into the anode of a lithium-ion battery to monitor the mechanical evolution of the anode material during cycling. We investigated the strain evolution of the anode material under different loading levels and used this method to infer the morphological changes of the material. Furthermore, combining this with battery capacity in-formation provides a new approach for assessing the performance of lithium-ion batteries.</description>

Abstract: The complexation of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) and thermoresponsive microgels is widely exploited for applications. Yet, a microscopic description of the mechanisms governing spatial organization of the NPs is still lacking. Combining small angle X-ray scattering, state-of-the-art numerical simulations and a simple toy model, we uncover how the volume phase transition of microgels drives NP-NP interactions, inducing NP progressive rearrangement with temperature. These results are directly compared to the extinction spectra of microgel-NPs complexes, allowing us to establish for the first time a microscopic link between plasmon coupling and NP local structure.</description>

Abstract: We report a candidate with unique advantages in the cultivation of solid-state nuclear clock material, Th:SrF2 crystal. It not only has a segregation coefficient close to 1, which can achieve highly efficient and uniform doping of Th, but also ensures a high transmittance (~69% at 150 nm) while achieving extremely high doping concentration (232Th&gt;6*10^20 cm^(-3). In addition, SrF2 crystal will not be irradiated-colored under strong {\alpha} radiation like CaF2 crystal, Th:SrF2 crystal is expected to fully unleash its high concentration doping characteristics while ensuring its transmission performance in nuclear transition band not be severely affected by 229Th radiation damage.</description>

      <title>Controlling Plasmonic Catalysis via Strong Coupling with Electromagnetic Resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic excitations decay within femtoseconds, leaving non-thermal (often referred to as "hot") charge carriers behind that can be injected into molecular structures to trigger chemical reactions that are otherwise out of reach -- a process known as plasmonic catalysis. In this Letter, we demonstrate that strong coupling between resonator structures and plasmonic nanoparticles can be used to control the spectral overlap between the plasmonic excitation energy and the charge injection energy into nearby molecules. Our atomistic description couples real-time density-functional theory self-consistently to Maxwell's equations via the radiation-reaction potential. Control over the resonator provides then an additional knob for non-intrusively enhancing plasmonic catalysis and dynamically reacting to deterioration of the catalyst -- a new facet of modern catalysis.</description>

      <title>Generation and characterization of customized perfect Laguerre-Gaussian beams with arbitrary profiles</title>

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the generation of customized perfect Laguerre-Gaussian (PLG) beams whose intensity maxima localized around any desired curves. The principle is to act appropriate algebraic functions on the angular spectra of PLG beams. We characterize the propagation properties of these beams and compare them with non-diffraction caustic beams possessing the same intensity profiles. The results manifest that the customized-PLG beams can maintain their profiles during propagation and suffer less energy loss than the non-diffraction caustic beams, and hence are able to propagate a longer distance. This new structure beam would have potential applications in areas such as optical communication, soliton routing and steering, optical tweezing and trapping, atom optics, etc.</description>

      <title>Theory of the linewidth-power product of photonic-crystal surface-emitting lasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11246v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general theory for the intrinsic (Lorentzian) linewidth of photonic--crystal surface--emitting lasers (PCSELs) is presented. The effect of spontaneous emission is modeled by a classical Langevin force entering the equation for the slowly varying waves. The solution of the coupled--wave equations, describing the propagation of four basic waves within the plane of the photonic crystal, is expanded in terms of the solutions of the associated spectral problem, i.e. the laser modes. Expressions are given for photon number, rate of spontaneous emission into the laser mode, Petermann factor and effective Henry factor entering the general formula for the linewidth. The theoretical framework is applied to the calculation of the linewidth--power product of air--hole and all--semiconductor PCSELs. For output powers in the Watt range, intrinsic linewidths in the kHz range are obtained in agreement with recent experimental results.</description>

      <title>Stimulated emission tomography for efficient characterization of spatial entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stimulated emission tomography (SET) is an excellent tool for characterizing the process of spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), which is commonly used to create pairs of entangled photons for use in quantum information protocols. The use of stimulated emission increases the average number of detected photons by several orders of magnitude compared to the spontaneous process. In a SET measurement, the parametric down-conversion is seeded by an intense signal field prepared with specified mode properties rather than by broadband multi-modal vacuum fluctuations, as is the case for the spontaneous process. The SET process generates an intense idler field in a mode that is the complex conjugate to the signal mode. In this work we use SET to estimate the joint spatial mode distribution (JSMD) in the Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) basis of the two photons of an entangled photon pair. The pair is produced by parametric down-conversion in a beta barium borate (BBO) crystal with type-II phase matching pumped at a wavelength of 405 nm along with a 780-nm seed signal beam prepared in a variety of LG modes to generate an 842-nm idler beam of which the spatial mode distribution is measured. We observe strong idler production and good agreement with the theoretical prediction of its spatial mode distribution. Our experimental procedure should enable the efficient determination of the photon-pair wavefunctions produced by low-brightness SPDC sources and the characterization of high-dimensional entangled-photon pairs.</description>

      <title>Entanglement engineering of optomechanical systems by reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is fundamental to quantum information science and technology, yet controlling and manipulating entanglement -- so-called entanglement engineering -- for arbitrary quantum systems remains a formidable challenge. There are two difficulties: the fragility of quantum entanglement and its experimental characterization. We develop a model-free deep reinforcement-learning (RL) approach to entanglement engineering, in which feedback control together with weak continuous measurement and partial state observation is exploited to generate and maintain desired entanglement. We employ quantum optomechanical systems with linear or nonlinear photon-phonon interactions to demonstrate the workings of our machine-learning-based entanglement engineering protocol. In particular, the RL agent sequentially interacts with one or multiple parallel quantum optomechanical environments, collects trajectories, and updates the policy to maximize the accumulated reward to create and stabilize quantum entanglement over an arbitrary amount of time. The machine-learning-based model-free control principle is applicable to the entanglement engineering of experimental quantum systems in general.</description>
