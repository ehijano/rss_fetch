      <title>Can the 3 neutrino masses really be found using SN 1987A data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino masses remain a significant unsolved problem in physics and their nonzero value proves the Standard Model is incomplete. Currently, the values of the three masses only have upper limits from cosmology and experiments like KATRIN. This paper shows that the SN 1987A neutrino data can remarkably yield values for the three neutrino masses, and not merely upper limits. Although this seemingly preposterous idea was suggested a dozen years ago by the author, here it is demonstrated in a much more convincing manner with many new elements, including a stronger statistical treatment, a theoretical linkage to possible CPT violation, and most importantly, a thorough explanation of why the method used to find the three masses from supernova SN 1987A neutrino data really works. The key to finding the three neutrino masses is realizing why three normally accepted assumotions are unjustified, The three rejected assumptions are:(a) the 5-hr early LSD (Mont Blanc) neutrinos are unrelated to SN 1987A, (b) any masses $&gt;1 eV/c^2$ would be inconsistent with upper limits from KATRIN and other data, and (c) the spread in neutrino emission times from SN 1987A is too great for the method to work.</description>

      <title>Searches for electroweak states at future plasma wakefield colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantify the discovery potential of future multi-TeV plasma wakefield colliders for new electroweak multiplets. We include beam-beam effects through realistic luminosity spectra, comparing five collider configurations: $e^+e^-$ and $e^-e^-$ machines with round- and flat-beams, and a $\gamma\gamma$ collider. The beam-beam effects qualitatively change search strategies relative to idealized mono-energetic lepton colliders, highlighting the importance of the low-energy part of the luminosity spectrum and additional beam-induced initial-state channels. Our results have implications for accelerator R&amp;D priorities, since key electroweak targets may remain accessible even if efficient positron acceleration and flat-beam delivery prove technically challenging at the multi-TeV scale.</description>

      <title>Constraining Gravitational Dark Matter with LHAASO and Fermi-LAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use diffuse Galactic high energy gamma ray data from LHAASO and Fermi-LAT to constrain gravitationally produced decaying dark matter (DM). Focusing on four benchmark candidates: a dark photon, a heavy right-handed neutrino (RHN), a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB), and a non-minimally coupled scalar we derive bounds on the DM mass and its couplings to the visible sector. For dark photons, RHNs, and pNGBs, the combined data constrain the relevant interaction strength to $\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^{-30})$ for DM masses $\gtrsim\mathcal{O}$(TeV), while the non-minimally coupled scalar is limited to $\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^{-10})$. Moreover, photon-dark photon oscillations yield strong constraints for massive dark photon beyond 10 GeV, closing a region of parameter space previously left unconstrained.</description>

      <title>The Four Polarizations of the $W$ at High Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate polarization-induced interference and off-shell effects in predictions for high-energy, multi-leg processes with intermediate weak bosons carrying fixed helicities. Building on the ``truncated propagator'' paradigm, we carry out our analysis at the level of helicity amplitudes and squared amplitudes. We introduce bookkeeping devices, suitable for covariant and axial gauge choices, that simplify the analytical evaluation of polarized amplitudes, and make power counting of mass-over-energy factors more manifest. Among other results, we show that polarization interference (i) is generally non-zero, even in on-shell limits, (ii) can be negative and comparable to longitudinal contributions, and (iii) is generated by helicity inversion and therefore suppressed (or zero) in high-energy limits for $s$- and $t$-channel exchanges. Connections between gauge invariance and the scalar polarization are also discussed, as is a scheme for reducing gauge dependence in predictions for polarized scattering rates. As case studies, we consider charged-current processes, including $W$(+jets), top quark decay, and neutrino deep-inelastic scattering.</description>

      <title>Living on the edge: radius effects in the angular substructure of heavy-ion jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet substructure observables serve as essential tools for probing the quark-gluon plasma produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Their interpretation, however, is often complicated by edge effects, which arise when correlated particles fall outside the reconstructed jet radius, introducing distortions that obscure the underlying QCD dynamics. In this work, we present a comprehensive phenomenological study of edge effects in soft-insensitive angular observables, taking the two-point energy correlator (EEC) as a representative example. We argue that these distortions scale linearly with the average angular separation between the winner-take-all and $E$-scheme axes $\langle \phi \rangle$, and validate this behavior across proton-proton (p-p) simulations with Pythia8 and Herwig7, as well as lead-lead (Pb-Pb) simulations using JEWEL and CoLBT. In p-p collisions, edge effects are strongly suppressed, scaling as $(R_L/R)^4$, whereas medium-modified jets can exhibit larger distortions, with contributions scaling as $(R_L/R)^2$ and $(R_L/R)^4$. Taking Pb-Pb/p-p ratios of the EEC substantially reduces, but does not completely eliminate, these distortions, highlighting the need of accounting for edge effects in the interpretation of heavy-ion jet substructure measurements. Since edge effects are largely governed by the $\langle \phi \rangle$ distribution, studying this distribution provides a new handle for benchmarking and constraining the modeling of edge effects in heavy-ion event generators.</description>

      <title>Constraining non-commutative geometry with W/Z+jet production at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive calculation of the squared matrix elements for all partonic channels contributing to $W^\pm/Z$+jet production at hadron colliders within the framework of the non-commutative Standard Model (NCSM), including leptonic decays $W\to e\nu$ and $Z\to e^+e^-$. Our computation incorporates both $\mathcal{O}(\Theta)$ corrections to the Standard Model vertices and additional interaction terms inherent to the NCSM. A key finding is that the production amplitudes receive first-order corrections at $\mathcal{O}(\Theta)$, a distinctive feature compared to many other processes where non-commutative effects enter only at $\mathcal{O}(\Theta^2)$. The leptonic decay widths, in contrast, are modified solely at $\mathcal{O}(\Theta^2)$. This $\mathcal{O}(\Theta)$ enhancement provides improved sensitivity to non-commutative geometry, allowing us to probe for and constrain the non-commutative energy scale in the multi-TeV range. We provide numerical predictions for angular (azimuthal and rapidity) distributions and the forward--backward asymmetry, and compare them to state-of-the-art Standard Model predictions at leading and next-to-leading order from the \texttt{MCFM} Monte Carlo program. Finally, we test the NCSM with experimental data by analyzing an unbinned, particle-level $Z$+jet dataset from the ATLAS experiment. From this data, we calculate the azimuthal spectrum and forward-backward asymmetry, which are then used to derive stringent lower bounds on the non-commutative scale $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Potential for the discovery of the protophobic boson at the STCF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the morphology of the main drift chamber (MDC) proposed to be built around the collision point at the upcoming Super tau-charm facility (STCF), to check for its suitability in discovering the 17 MeV protophobic boson (X17 boson), hypothesised as a solution to the persistent ATOMKI nuclear-transition anomalies. These anomalies, observed in the excited $^8$Be, $^4$He, $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O nuclear transitions, have been interpreted as evidence for a $\sim$17 MeV, protophobic vector boson. Using the TrackEff framework, we perform detector-level simulations of the STCF MDC, and evaluate displaced-vertex sensitivities towards the protophobic boson, across the relevant mass-coupling parameter space. We study benchmark scenarios with visible and dark decay channels to perform likelihood-based significance estimates in order to determine the 5$\sigma$ discovery reach for the protophobic boson. We find that STCF can discover the protophobic boson while tolerating $\sim 10^4$ background events for specific regions of the parameter space around the 17 MeV peak. Our analysis establishes the first feasibility study of displaced light-boson searches at the STCF, motivating a full Geant-4 simulation.</description>

      <title>Unpolarized GPDs at small $x$ and non-zero skewness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the small-$x$ asymptotics of unpolarized generalized parton distributions (GPDs) and generalized transverse momentum distributions (GTMDs). Unlike the previous works in the literature, we consider the case of non-zero (but small) skewness while allowing for non-linear contributions to the evolution equations. We show that unpolarized GPDs and GTMDs at small $x$ are related to the eikonal dipole amplitude $N$, whose small-$x$ evolution is given by the BK/JIMWLK evolution equations, and to the odderon amplitude $\cal O$, whose evolution is also known in the literature. We show that the effect of non-zero skewness $\xi \neq 0$ is to modify the value of the evolution parameter (rapidity) in the arguments for the dipole amplitudes $N$ and $\cal O$ from $Y = \ln (1/x)$ to $Y = \ln \min \left\{ 1/|x| , 1/|\xi| \right\}$.</description>

      <title>Towards the Direct Detection of Composite Ultraheavy Dark Matter in Quantum Sensor Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensor arrays have recently been proposed as a promising platform for the direct detection of ultraheavy dark matter, which is typically assumed to behave as a point-like particle. However, particles with masses at or above the Planck scale cannot be elementary; instead, they must exist as composite objects with finite spatial extent. Such spatially extended dark matter models lead to distinctive phenomenology in these detectors, particularly when the dark matter also interacts through long-range forces with their own characteristic length scales. In this work, we study the sensitivity of quantum sensor arrays to composite, ultraheavy dark matter interacting via both gravity and a novel Yukawa force. We consider three phenomenologically motivated density profiles -- a tophat, a Gaussian, and an exponential -- and contrast their signals with the point-like limit. Using a Monte Carlo analysis based on the predicted impulse signals and estimates of thermal and quantum noise, we obtain sensitivity projections for a future realization of a quantum sensor array. We find a non-trivial interplay between the dark-matter scale radius, the inter-sensor spacing, and the Yukawa screening length. Future accelerometer arrays would provide valuable information about the mass and size of composite ultraheavy dark matter, and our work will help to characterize the signatures of different theoretical models of ultraheavy dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the recent progress achieved, using Resonance Chiral Theory, in the hadronic contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. These include the hadronic vacuum polarization, either using $e^+e^-$ or $\tau$ decays into hadron final states as input; and the hadronic light-by-light part, where in addition to previous results on the lightest pseudoscalar and tensor-poles contributions, we first present the evaluation of the pseudoscalar box using this formalism. We also discuss the scalar, axial-pole and other subleading pieces. The results obtained are consistent with the White Paper 2 values, with comparable precision.</description>

      <title>Perturbative limits on axion-SU(2) gauge dynamics during inflation from the energy density of spin-2 particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the conditions under which the perturbative treatment of the backreaction of spin-2 particles on the dynamics of an axion-SU(2) gauge field system breaks down during cosmic inflation. This condition is based on the ratio of the energy density of spin-2 particles from the SU(2) gauge field to that of the background field. The perturbative treatment breaks down when this ratio exceeds unity. We show that this occurs within a parameter space nearly identical to the strong backreaction regime identified in previous studies. However, in some cases, the ratio exceeds unity even before the system enters the strong backreaction regime. Our results suggest that attempts to study the strong backreaction regime using perturbation theory are necessarily limited. Reliable calculations require non-perturbative treatments, such as three-dimensional lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Studies on quark-mass dependence of the $N^*(920)$ pole from $\pi N$ $\chi$PT amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quark-mass dependence of the $N^*(920)$ pole is analyzed using $K$-matrix method, with the $\pi N$ scattering amplitude calculated up to $O(p^3)$ order in chiral perturbation theory. As the quark mass increases, the $N^*(920)$ pole gradually approaches the real axis in the complex $w$-plane (where $w=\sqrt{s}$). Eventually, in the $O(p^2)$ case, it crosses the $u$-cut on the real axis and enters the adjacent Riemann sheet when the pion mass reaches $526~{\rm MeV}$. At order $O(p^3)$, the rate at which it approaches the real axis slows down; however, we argue that it will ultimately cross the $u$-cut and enter the adjacent Riemann sheet as well. Additionally, the trajectory of the \(N^*(920)\) pole is in qualitative agreement with the results from the linear $\sigma$ model calculation.</description>

      <title>A unified approach for the hadronic weak decays of $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma^{\pm}\to N\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a unified approach for the two-body hadronic weak decays of hyperons with $S=-1$, i.e. $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma^\pm$, in the framework of the non-relativistic constitute quark model (NRCQM). A combined analysis shows that the branching ratios and asymmetry parameters of the decay channels $\Lambda\to p\pi^-$ and $\Sigma^\pm\to N\pi$ can be well described in the same framework with the direct pion emission, color suppressed internal $W$ emission, and pole terms included. However, the channel $\Lambda\to n\pi^0$ indicates significant deviations from the experimental data based on these mentioned transition mechanism. We demonstrate that the final state interactions (FSIs) via the coupled-channel rescatterings play a crucial role in $\Lambda\to n\pi^0$. Namely, the dominant decay channel of $\Lambda\to p\pi^-$ can contribute to $\Lambda\to n\pi^0$ via the $p\pi^-\to n\pi^0$ rescatterings. This is a leading correction effect for $\Lambda\to n\pi^0$ at the one-loop level. We find that such FSIs only become the leading effects in $\Lambda\to n\pi^0$, but contribute as subleading contributions in other channels. We also demonstrate that the pole terms are indispensable in these hyperon decays. In particular, for $\Sigma^-\to n\pi^-$ and $\Sigma^+\to n\pi^+$, it shows that $\Lambda(1405)$ as the intermediate state in the pole term amplitude is necessary for reproducing the experimental data. We also find that a dynamic selection rule forbids the radial excitation state $N(1710)$ of the quark model multiplet $|70, ^28,2,0^+,1/2^+\rangle$ from contribution. To some extent, the hyperon hadronic weak decays serve as a special probe for the underlying transition mechanisms and can provide some constraints on the intermediate $J^P=1/2^\pm$ baryon resonances.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic leptogenesis -- an EFT-consistent analysis via Wilson coefficients. Part III. Probing light-neutrino masses and low-energy observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this third part of our EFT-consistent analysis of electromagnetic leptogenesis, we confront the dipole operator that sources the baryon asymmetry with constraints from light-neutrino masses and low-energy observables. Starting from the UV completion and one-loop-matched Wilson coefficient $C_{NB}$ of the gauge-invariant operator $O_{NB}=(\bar{L}\sigma^{\mu\nu}P_RN)\tilde{H}B_{\mu\nu}$, we compute the radiatively induced Weinberg operator $O_5$ and derive the light Majorana mass matrix generated by a double insertion of $O_{NB}$. For the benchmarks that realise successful resonant electromagnetic leptogenesis at the electroweak scale, these contributions yield neutrino masses far below the scale implied by neutrino oscillation data, so that the observed neutrino masses must originate from additional interactions such as one of the seesaw mechanisms, and only in extreme corners of parameter space do they saturate the cosmological bound on $\sum m_{\nu}$. We also show that no additional Dirac neutrino mass is generated at one loop by the dipole operator alone. Furthermore, we derive the charged-lepton dipole operator $O_{e\gamma}$ in LEFT, accounting for one-loop operator mixing in the symmetric phase and two-loop Barr--Zee--type graphs in the broken phase, and evolve its Wilson coefficient $C_{e\gamma}$ down to the muon and electron mass scales using QED renormalisation-group equations. The resulting analytic upper bounds on $\mathrm{BR}(\mu\to e\gamma)$, the electron EDM, and $(g-2)_{\mu}$ lie many orders of magnitude below current experimental sensitivities throughout the BAU-compatible region. Electromagnetic leptogenesis in this EFT framework is therefore robust against present constraints from light-neutrino masses and low-energy dipole probes.</description>

      <title>Probing the di-$J/\Psi$ interaction and the nature of $X(6200)$ with femtoscopic correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent re-analyses of the di-$J/\Psi$ invariant mass spectra reveal a state near the di-$J/\Psi$ threshold, referred to as the $X(6200)$. Yet the nature of this near-threshold pole--whether it is a resonant, bound, or virtual state--remains unresolved due to our limited understanding of the di-$J/\Psi$ interaction. To address this question, we predict the di-$J/\Psi$ and $J/\Psi\Psi(2S)$ femtoscopic correlation functions based on the Koonin-Pratt formula with a Gaussian source and the coupled-channel dynamics. Our results show that the di-$J/\Psi$ correlation function exhibits distinctly different behaviors in each scenario, especially for small source sizes ($R\sim1$ fm), providing a clear experimental observable to distinguish the nature of $X(6200)$. These distinguishing features persist even when quantum statistical effects and coupled-channel dynamics are included and show negligible sensitivity to off-shell ambiguities. Given the high $J/\Psi$ production rates and clean detection channels at the LHC, we hope that these discoveries will stimulate further experimental studies and help clarify the nature of double-vector-charmonium interactions and the nonperturbative dynamics of fully-heavy tetraquark systems.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group evolution induced breaking of $\mu-\tau$ reflection symmetry in MSSM with effects of variation of $tan\beta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the renormalization group (RG) evolution induced breaking of $\mu$--$\tau$ reflection symmetry in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), with a special focus on the effects of varying $\tan\beta \equiv v_u/v_d$, the ratio of MSSM Higgs vacuum expectation values. Starting from an exact $\mu$--$\tau$ reflection symmetry imposed at a high flavor symmetry scale $\Lambda_{\text{FS}}$, we run the complete set of coupled RGEs for neutrino masses, mixing angles, and CP-violating phases down to the electroweak scale, imparting perturbation to the symmetry. We consider a specific value of the SUSY breaking scale, $\Lambda_s=7\ TeV$ during the run. By choosing suitable free parameters at the high-energy scale, we reproduce the low-energy experimental constraints on neutrino observables consistent with $3\nu$ global analysis data. We then examine how the breaking of $\mu$--$\tau$ reflection symmetry is influenced by different values of $\tan\beta$, considering three benchmark choices. In addition, the analysis is performed for both normal ordering (NO) and inverted ordering (IO) of neutrino masses to highlight potential differences in their RG running behavior.</description>

      <title>Quantization of massive Dirac neutrinos in external fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the applications of the quantum field theory (QFT) for the description of massive Dirac neutrinos in external fields. Two particular cases of external background are considered. First, we examine neutrinos in background matter. Then, we study neutrinos with anomalous magnetic moments in a magnetic field. In both situations, we derive the operator valued neutrino wavefunctions, accounting for external fields, which obey the canonical anticommutation relations. Then, we check that the total energy and momentum of a neutrino field have the appropriate forms. Using the exact solution in a Dirac equation in a magnetic field, we also derive the propagator for a massive Dirac neutrino in this external background. The results obtained are of importance for the QFT application to neutrino oscillations in external fields.</description>

      <title>Three-body resonances of $\alpha\alpha M$ clusters ($M=\phi$, $J/\psi$, $\eta_c$) in $^{9}_{M}{\mathrm{Be}}$ nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recently obtained HAL QCD potentials for the $N$-$\phi$, $N$-$J/\psi$, and $N$-$\eta_c$ interactions. interactions, we investigate the structure of the exotic nuclei $^{9}_{\phi}{\text{Be}}$, $^{9}_{J/\psi}{\text{Be}}$, and $^{9}_{\eta_c}{\mathrm{Be}}$ as $\alpha+\alpha+M$ three-body systems ($M$ denotes the meson). The bound and resonant states are calculated consistently using the Gaussian expansion method, with resonances identified via the complex scaling method. For the $\alpha\phi$ and $\alpha$-charmonium interactions, a folding potential is constructed based on the HAL QCD potentials and fitted to a Woods-Saxon form. We find that the $\phi$ meson exhibits a strong "glue-like" effect, binding the $0^+_1$, $2^+_1$, and $4^+_1$ resonant states of $^8$Be into stable states and significantly reducing the $\alpha$-$\alpha$ distance. In contrast, the interactions of $J/\psi$ and $\eta_c$ with the nucleus are weaker, forming only shallow bound states with the $0^+_1$ state of $^8$Be and even increasing the $\alpha$-$\alpha$ separation. Notably, our analysis predicts weakly bound $\alpha$-$J/\psi$ states in the $^4S_{3/2}$ and $^2S_{1/2}$ channels, a result not reported in prior studies, which suggests that $^{9}_{J/\psi}{\text{Be}}$ may not be a Borromean nucleus. The sensitivity of the $^{9}_{\phi}{\text{Be}}(4^+_1)$ state-transitioning from bound to resonant depending on the $\alpha$-particle radius-highlights the subtle dynamics at play. These results provide a systematic theoretical comparison of how different vector mesons modify nuclear clustering, offering critical predictions for future experimental searches of such exotic hadron-nucleus systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present disperon QED, a method to deal with data input in loop processes in Monte Carlo codes. It relies on dispersion relations, automated tools such as OpenLoops, effective field theory methods and a threshold subtraction. We motivate this method and apply it to the process $ee\to\pi\pi$ in McMule to deal with hadronic vacuum polarisation insertions in two-loop contributions as well as the vector form factor of the pion within the form-factor scalar QED approximation. The generality of this method for more complicated processes is emphasised.</description>

      <title>Approximate N$^2$LO and N$^3$LO QCD Predictions for $tW$ Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a calculation of approximate next-to-next-to-leading-order (N$^2$LO) and next-to-N$^2$LO (N$^3$LO) QCD corrections to associated $tW$ production at the LHC, which constitute the dominant contributions to full perturbative predictions. The approximate N$^2$LO corrections consist of the large logarithmic terms $\ln^n (1-Q^2/\hat{s})$ (with $\sqrt{\hat{s}}$ being the partonic center-of-mass energy and $Q$ the invariant mass of the $tW$ system) and the terms proportional to $\delta(1-Q^2/\hat{s})$ at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$, which are obtained by utilizing the newly obtained two-loop hard and soft functions. The approximate N$^3$LO corrections further include the large logarithms at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ by using renormalization group evolution equations and the three-loop soft anomalous dimension, while the $\delta(1-Q^2/\hat{s})$ term is only partially accurate at this order. Numerical evaluation reveals that they increase the NLO cross section by more than $10\%$. The inclusion of these higher-order corrections leads to improved agreement with the experimental data at the LHC, resulting in a direct determination of the CKM matrix element $|V_{tb}|=0.99\pm 0.03({\rm exp.})\pm 0.03({\rm theo.})$ without assuming unitarity of the matrix.</description>

      <title>Partial $A_4$ flavor symmetry of the leptonic 3HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the Higgs doublets in the 3HDM transform as a flavor triplet of the $A_4$ group, the lepton mass matrices accommodate the experimental neutrino mixing angles at arbitrary precision while maintaining the correct mass ordering of the charged and neutral leptons, the latter being Dirac neutrinos in the normal spectrum. Under $A_4$ symmetry, also agreement of the lepton masses with experimental data is obtained for Higgs vacua differing from those for fitting $U_{\text{PMNS}}$. For groups of order equal or less than 600 no contractions different from the one found for $A_4$ yield better agreement with experimental data, and the solution structure presented is unique within the set of groups studied.</description>

      <title>Exploring New Propagation Scales With Galactic Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent observation of high-energy Galactic neutrinos by IceCube allows for searches of new physics affecting neutrino propagation on scales of $O(10^9-10^{15})\,\mathrm{km/GeV}$ in distance over energy. We assess the sensitivity of upcoming measurements of Galactic neutrinos by IceCube and KM3NeT to such new phenomena. We focus on two scenarios: quasi-Dirac neutrinos and neutrino decays. In the quasi-Dirac scenario, we find that joint measurements by IceCube and KM3NeT are sensitive to the mass-squared differences $\delta m^2 \in \left(10^{-13.5}~\mathrm{eV^2}, 10^{-11.9}~\mathrm{eV^2}\right)$ at the $90\%$ confidence level. For neutrino decays, the same measurements are sensitive to mass over lifetime ratios $m / \tau &gt; 10^{-12.3}~\mathrm{eV^2}$ at the same significance. Our results demonstrate that measurements of Galactic neutrinos by a global network of neutrino telescopes can probe signatures of neutrino mass models.</description>

      <title>Electroweak right-handed neutrino portal dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dark matter coupled to the standard model via electroweak scale right-handed neutrinos in a Type-I seesaw framework. We consider a minimal dark sector containing a fermion $\chi$ and a complex scalar $\phi$ whose only connection to the standard model is through renormalizable Yukawa interactions with right-handed Majorana neutrinos, thus realizing a neutrino portal after seesaw mixing. We discuss three representative realizations of electroweak right-handed neutrinos arising from the Type-I seesaw mechanism, spanning small, large, and ultraweak couplings to the standard model sector, so that the dark particles can either undergo secluded freeze-out or be produced via freeze-in. Instead of merely estimating the order of magnitude of the seesaw couplings, we use the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to obtain viable seesaw parameter sets consistent with neutrino data and other constraints, and then compute the coupled evolution of the dark particles and right-handed neutrinos, reproducing the observed dark matter relic abundance in representative benchmark scenarios. For the freeze-in case, we show that internal dark sector interactions can significantly modify the predicted relic density: treating each hidden particle as an independent freeze-in component and simply adding late decays can misestimate the final dark matter abundance by $30\%$, or even $95\%$, depending on the type of internal interactions, compared to a full solution of the coupled Boltzmann equations for all dark species, including the dark sector temperature. Electroweak right-handed neutrino portal dark matter thus provides a robust, testable framework that tightly connects neutrino physics, collider searches for heavy neutral leptons, and the cosmological dark matter relic density, offering a well-motivated benchmark for multi-messenger probes at the high energy frontier.</description>

      <title>Additional results on the four-loop flavour-singlet splitting functions in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have extended our previous computations, performed analytically for a general gauge group, of the even-$N$ moments $\gamma_{\rm ik}^{\,(3)}(N)$ of the four-loop flavour-singlet splitting functions $P_{\rm ik}^{\,(3)}(x)$ to $N = 22$. The numerical QCD results perfectly agree with all predictions resulting from the approximations for $P_{\rm ik}^{\,(3)}(x)$ that we obtained before from the moments $N \leq 20 $ and endpoint constraints, confirming their reliability for collider-physics applications. Due to the additional analytical constraints provided by our new $N = 22$ results, we are now closing in on determining the all-$N$ forms of all non-rational ($\zeta$-function) contributions to $\gamma_{\rm ik}^{\,(3)}(N)$: only the $n_f^{0} \zeta_3$ parts of the quark-to-gluon (gq) and the $n_f^{1} \zeta_3$ parts of the gluon-to-gluon (qg) cases still need to be completed. Finally we extend our approximations for all $P_{\rm ik}^{\,(3)}(x)$ to $n_f^{} = 6$ light flavours and update those for $P_{\rm gq}^{\,(3)}(x)$ at lower $n_f^{}$.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal form factor of chromomagnetic penguin in $B\to K\ell^+\ell^-$ from QCD light-cone sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The branching fraction of the $B \to K\ell^+\ell^-$ decay has been measured recently by the LHC experiments, showing a deviation from theory predictions based on the Standard Model (SM). A major challenge in achieving a complete SM prediction and interpreting this discrepancy lies in the treatment of nonlocal hadronic effects. In $B \to K\ell^+\ell^-$, these effects are cast in a single nonlocal form factor, a function of squared momentum transfer $q^2$ to the lepton pair. One of the previously used methods provides this form factor in the region of spacelike momentum transfer, $q^2&lt;0$, matching the result to the hadronic dispersion relation, which is then continued to the physical region. The calculation done so far was a combination of QCD factorisation for hard-gluon contributions with light-cone sum rules (LCSRs) for soft-gluon ones. In this work, we calculate for the first time the complete nonlocal form factor at $q^2&lt;0$ for one of the effective operators, the chromomagnetic operator $O_{8g}$, applying the method of LCSRs with $ B$-meson distribution amplitudes. We compute, both analytically and numerically, the operator-product expansion (OPE) diagrams with hard-gluon exchanges, analyse their structure and hierarchy, and obtain their spectral density entering the LCSR together with soft-gluon contributions. This study paves the way for our next task, a complete calculation of nonlocal $B \to K\ell^+\ell^-$ form factor at spacelike $q^2$, including the dominant contributions of current-current operators, known as charm-loops.</description>

      <title>Standard Model Benchmarks for $D^0\to K^- K^+, \pi^-\pi^+, K^0_{\rm S} K^0_{\rm S}$ Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-leptonic $D^0\to K^- K^+$ and $D^0\to \pi^-\pi^+$ decays are powerful probes of the Standard Model and are related to each other through the $U$-spin symmetry of the strong interaction. Using lattice QCD inputs we calculate the corresponding colour-allowed tree amplitudes in factorisation and demonstrate that non-factorisable contributions and $U$-spin-breaking effects at the level of 50% allow us to accommodate the measured branching ratios in the Standard Model. An exciting direct probe of such non-factorisable and $U$-spin breaking effects is provided by the $D^0\to K^0_{\rm S} K^0_{\rm S}$ channel. This decay is governed by non-factorisable exchange topologies and essentially vanishes in the $U$-spin limit, although it is experimentally well established with a prominent branching ratio. Extrapolating our $D^0\to K^- K^+$ results using the isospin symmetry, we find a consistent benchmark picture. Specifically, we can accommodate the measured $D^0\to K^0_{\rm S} K^0_{\rm S}$ branching ratio with $U$-spin-breaking effects at the 50% level and exchange amplitudes at the level of 50% of the colour-allowed $D^0\to K^- K^+$, $D^0\to \pi^-\pi^+$ tree contributions. Finally, we explore the resulting range for direct CP violation in $D^0\to K^0_{\rm S} K^0_{\rm S}$, obtaining upper bounds in our benchmark scenarios of a few per mille, offering an exciting target for future measurements.</description>

      <title>Hiding a Light Vector Boson from Terrestrial Experiments: A Chargephobic Dark Photon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the terrestrial, astrophysical and cosmological constraints on a light vector boson that couples to an arbitrary combination of the electromagnetic and $B-L$ currents of the Standard Model. The dark photon and a vector boson coupling to $B-L$ are special cases of our generalized flavor-universal anomaly-free vector boson, requiring just one additional parameter (the "dark mixing angle" corresponding to the linear combination of the electromagnetic and $B-L$ currents) beyond that of the overall coupling strength and the vector boson mass, where we focus on the range $1\, {\rm MeV}$ to $60\, {\rm GeV}$. We perform a detailed investigation of a unique combination where the vector boson couplings to electrically charged leptons and protons are highly suppressed: the "chargephobic dark photon". A chargephobic vector boson is very weakly constrained by current terrestrial experiments including beam dumps and collider experiments, since they rely on couplings to electrons and protons. Instead, neutrino scattering experiments (such as COHERENT), astrophysical sources (supernova emission), and cosmology ($\Delta N_{\rm eff}$) provide the strongest constraints due to the nonzero couplings of the chargephobic vector boson to neutrinos and neutrons. Indeed, we find that supernova emission and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ provide constraints throughout the space of dark mixing angles, demonstrating their importance to provide model-independent constraints. For nearly all of the parameter space, a chargephobic vector boson is the most weakly constrained anomaly-free vector boson that couples to flavor-independent or flavor-dependent combinations of Standard Model currents. Finally, we highlight the importance of future experiments, including SHiP, that are able to probe new regions of the chargephobic parameter space due to the significantly improved detector capabilities.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous nucleation is central to many familiar first-order phase transitions such as the freezing of water and the solidification of metals, and it can also play a crucial role in cosmology. We examine nucleation seeded by preexisting domain walls and demonstrate its strong impact on the dynamics of cosmological phase transitions. The bubble solutions take the form of spherical caps, and the contact angle is fixed by the ratio of the domain-wall tension to the bubble-wall tension. A larger domain-wall tension, or equivalently a smaller contact angle, reduces the wall-seeded bubble volume and lowers the critical nucleation action. For theories with $\mathbb{Z}_{n\geq 3}$ symmetry, domain-wall junctions naturally appear and we find that they seed nucleation even more efficiently than the walls themselves. Using a two-scalar-field model as an illustration, we compute nucleation temperatures for both homogeneous and heterogeneous channels and show that junction-seeded nucleation occurs at a higher temperature and is the dominant mechanism that completes the first-order cosmological phase transition.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions at high and low densities for a rotating QCD matter from holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We applied the exact Andreev soft-wall holographic model to investigate phase transitions in rotating strongly interacting matter at high and low densities. Using the dual description of hadronic matter and quark-gluon plasma via thermal and charged black holes in five-dimensional AdS space with cylindrical symmetry, we find that for relativistic rotations exceeding 16\% of the speed of light, crossover transitions emerge in the low-density regime up to a critical baryon chemical potential $\mu_{CPB}$. These smooth transitions, governed by the negative QCD $\beta$-function, describe a mixed phase of confined and deconfined matter with different angular momenta evolving into a pure plasma at very high temperatures. For $\mu \geq \mu_{CPB}$, first-order transitions dominate, following the critical-temperature curve of non-rotating matter. The critical point separating the low-density crossovers from high-density first-order transitions is numerically estimated as $(\mu_{CPB}, T_{CP}) = (363.554, 58.507)\,\text{MeV}$.</description>

      <title>UV Luminosity Functions from HST and JWST: A Possible Resolution to the High-Redshift Galaxy Abundance Puzzle and Implications for Cosmic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of high redshift galaxies by the James Webb Space Telescope suggest the presence of a bright population of galaxies that is more abundant than predicted by most galaxy formation models. These observations have led to a rethinking of these models, and numerous astrophysical and cosmological solutions have been proposed, including cosmic strings, topological defects that may be remnants of a specific phase transition in the very early moments of the Universe. In this paper, we integrate cosmic strings, a source of nonlinear and non-Gaussian perturbations, into the semi analytical code Zeus21, allowing us to efficiently predict the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF). We conduct a precise study of parameter degeneracies between star-formation astrophysics and cosmic-string phenomenology. Our results suggest that cosmic strings can boost the early-galaxy abundance enough to explain the measured UVLFs from the James Webb and Hubble Space Telescopes from redshift z = 4 to z = 17 without modifying the star-formation physics. In addition, we set a new upper bound on the string tension of $G\mu \lessapprox 10^{-8}$ ($95\%$ credibility), improving upon previous limits from the cosmic microwave background. Although with current data there is some level of model and prior dependence to this limit, it suggests that UVLFs are a promising avenue for future observational constraints on cosmic-string physics.</description>

      <title>Energy Correlator Conformal Blocks and Positivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlation functions of energy flow operators (energy-energy correlators) are one of the simplest observables in quantum field theory and gravity, with diverse applications ranging from real world collider physics to constraining the space of consistent theories. In this paper we further develop the conformal block decomposition of energy-energy correlators in conformal field theories (CFTs), focusing on the source-detector operator product expansion (OPE). We compute the general conformal blocks in this channel for traceless symmetric operators of arbitrary spin in the background of a scalar source, considering both parity-even and parity-odd contributions. Motivated by the availability of data from the conformal bootstrap, we analyze the convergence of this source-detector OPE, taking a tensor product of two decoupled CFTs as an elementary example. Finally, we use positivity of energy correlators to derive novel bounds on OPE coefficients involving the stress-energy tensor in generic CFTs, and demonstrate the application of these bounds in the specific example of the 3d Ising CFT, obtaining new constraints for both parity-even and parity-odd operators.</description>

      <title>ClearPotential: Revealing Local Dark Matter in Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ClearPotential, a data-driven, three-dimensional measurement of the gravitational potential of the local Milky Way using unsupervised machine learning, without the symmetry assumptions, specific functional forms, and binning required in previous work. The potential is modeled as a neural network, optimized to solve the equilibrium collisionless Boltzmann equation for the observed phase space density of Gaia DR3 Red Clump stars within 4 kpc of the Sun. This density is obtained from data using normalizing flows, and our unsupervised solution to the Boltzmann equation automatically corrects for selection effects from crowding and the dust-driven extinction of starlight. Our fully-differentiable model of the gravitational potential allows us to map the acceleration and mass density of the Galaxy in the volume around the Sun, including in the dust-obscured disk towards the Galactic Center. We determine the dark matter density at the Solar radius to be $(0.84 \pm 0.08)\times 10^{-2}\,{M}_\odot/{\rm pc}^3$, and analyze the structure of the dark matter halo. We find strong evidence for a tilted oblate halo, weak preference for a cored inner profile, and the strongest constraints to date on a possible dark matter disk. We place a bound on the timescale of disequilibrium in the local Milky Way, and find mild evidence for disequilibrium using independent acceleration measurements from timings of binary pulsar systems. This work provides the clearest map of the local Galactic potential to date and marks an important step in the era of data-driven astrometry.</description>

      <title>Effective Equations of Motion for Massive Higher Spins with Generic Gyromagnetic Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct consistent effective equations of motion for massive charged particles of spin 2 and spin $3/2$ interacting with constant electromagnetic backgrounds. While tree-level unitarity restricts point-like particles to a universal gyromagnetic ratio $g=2$, long-lived composite states such as the $\Omega^-$ baryon generically deviate from this value. We propose describing such non-minimal couplings without triggering pathologies such as superluminal propagation or the loss of degrees of freedom by treating the system as an Effective Field Theory expanded in powers of the background field strength. By introducing specific operators, we show that algebraic consistency can be restored perturbatively for arbitrary $g$-factors.</description>

      <title>Dynamical correlations across momentum scales in the Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental probes of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) generated in heavy-ion collisions span a broad range in momentum scale: low transverse momentum (low $p_T$) measurements probe collective dynamics, while high $p_T$ measurements probe the response to QGP excitation by jets (jet quenching). However, the dynamical interplay between QGP collective dynamics and jet quenching is currently poorly understood. We present a new framework for exploring dynamical correlations across momentum scales in heavy-ion collisions, based on the $p_T$-differential radial-flow observable $v_0(p_T)$. Measured $v_0(p_T)$ phenomenology is traced to the evolution in strength and coherence of distinct underlying fluctuation modes. We then propose new experimental observables to quantify this evolution. The eigenvalue ratio $\lambda_2/\lambda_1$ of the reference-aligned covariance matrix $V_0$ is shown to measure the effective fluctuation rank, while the $p_T$-dependence of the corresponding eigenvectors maps the evolution from a single coherent soft mode to multi-mode dynamics including coalescence and jet quenching. These observables map the soft-mid-hard correlation structure and provide a unified description of the collective-to-partonic transition in the QGP.</description>

      <title>5D Rotating Black Holes as dark matter in Dark Dimension Scenario: Hawking Radiation versus the Memory Burden Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the possibility that five-dimensional primordial rotating black holes could account for all, or a significant portion, of the dark matter in our universe. Our analysis is performed within the context of the ``dark dimension'' scenario, a theoretical consequence of the Swampland Program that predicts a single micron-scale extra dimension to explain the observed value of dark energy. We demonstrate that within this scenario, the mass loss of a primordial rotating black hole sensitive to the fifth dimension is significantly slower than that of its four-dimensional counterpart. Consequently, primordial black holes with an initial mass of $M\gtrsim 10^{10}$g can survive to the present day and potentially constitute the dominant form of dark matter. Finally, we investigate the memory burden effect and find that it dramatically prolongs the lifetime of five-dimensional rotating primordial black holes, making them compelling candidates for all the dark matter in the universe.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear evolution of the ergoregion instability: Turbulence, bursts of radiation, and black hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spacetimes with an ergoregion that is not connected to a horizon are linearly unstable. While the linear regime has been studied in a number of settings, little is known about the nonlinear evolution of this ergoregion instability. Here, we investigate this by numerically evolving the unstable growth of a massless vector field in a rapidly spinning boson star in full general relativity. We find that the backreaction of the instability causes the star to become more gravitationally bound, accelerating the growth, and eventually leading to black hole formation. During the nonlinear growth phase, small scale features develop in the unstable mode and emitted radiation as nonlinear gravitational interactions mediate a direct turbulent cascade. The gravitational wave signal exhibits bursts, akin to so-called gravitational wave echoes, with increasing amplitude towards black hole formation.</description>

      <title>Application of time-series analysis methods to a multiple-sector TESS observations: the case of the radio-loud blazar 3C 371</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present various time series analysis methods to analyze multiple-sector observations of bright AGN from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and examine whether issues such as gaps and noise in these data can be mitigated. We determine variability timescales and search for quasi-periodicity using these methods and assess any differences. In this paper, we present an analysis of the $\approx$300-day TESS observation of a blazar 3C 371 using power spectrum density, structure-function, and weighted wavelet Z-transform approaches. To reduce the effect of gaps and noise, Continuous auto-regressive moving averages, Bartlett periodogram, and wavelet decomposition methods are used. We have also used recurrence analysis to account for the nonlinearity present in the data and to quantify variability or periodicity as the recurrent state. Considering the entirety of the TESS observations, we derive the variability timescale to be around 4.5 days. Sector-wise analysis found variability timescales in the range of 3.0--7.0 days, values that are found to be consistent using different methods. When analyzing multiple sectors together, significant variability, which could be quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), of duration 3--6 days in individual segments, is detected. These may be attributed to the kink instabilities developed in the jet or the existence of mini-jets inside a jet undergoing precession. We find that these methods, when applied appropriately, can be used to study the variability in TESS data. The noise present in these TESS observations can be minimized using Bartlett's periodogram and wavelet decomposition to recover the real stochastic variability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bound-free channel of electron-positron pair production by a highly charged bare ion in the presence of a strong constant crossed electromagnetic field is studied. To calculate the pair production rate, two different methods are applied and compared with each other: (i) a quasiclassical tunneling theory and (ii) a strong-field approximation, both equipped with appropriate Coulomb correction factors. The resulting rate, which depends nonperturbatively on both the Coulomb field of the ion and the constant crossed field, is calculated in a broad range of applied field strengths and nuclear charge numbers. Its functional form resembles the rate for a dynamically assisted Schwinger-like process, with the assistance being provided by the atomic binding energy of the created electron.</description>

      <title>Efficient pulsar distance measurement with multiple nanohertz gravitational-wave sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have reported evidence for a nanohertz gravitational-wave (GW) background. As radio telescope sensitivity improves, PTAs are also expected to detect continuous gravitational waves from individual supermassive black hole binaries. Nanohertz GWs generate both Earth and pulsar terms in the timing data, and the time delay between the two terms encodes the pulsar distance. Precise pulsar distance measurements are critical to fully exploiting pulsar-term information, which can improve the measurement precision of GW sources' sky position parameters and thus enhance the GW sky-localization capability. In this work, we propose a new pulsar distance estimation method by using pulsar-term phase information from GWs. We construct two-dimensional distance posteriors for pulsar pairs based on the simulated GW signals and combine them to constrain individual pulsar distances. Compared with the existing one-dimensional method, our approach reduces the impact of source-parameter uncertainties on pulsar distance measurements. Considering four GW sources and a PTA of 20 pulsars with a white-noise level of 20 ns, we find that a significant fraction of pulsars at distances $\lesssim 1.4$ kpc can achieve sub-parsec distance precision over a 15-year observation.</description>

      <title>Phase structure of the one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with second nearest-neighbor interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of a one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) model with hard-core bosons at half-filling, extending previous studies by including second nearest-neighbor (2NN) interactions. Using matrix product state techniques within the density matrix renormalization group, we compute charge gap, static structure factor, and pair-pair correlation functions for various interaction strengths and field parameters. We analyze two representative neatest-neighbor interaction strengths ($V_1$) that correspond to the Luttinger liquid (LL) and Mott insulator (MI) phases in the absence of the 2NN interactions. We introduce the 2NN coupling $V_2$ and investigate its impact on the system. Our results reveal very rich behavior. As the 2NN repulsion increases, in the case of small $V_1$, we observe a direct transition from the LL phase to a charge-ordered insulator (COI) phase, whereas for large $V_1$, we observe a transition from the MI phase (previously found with only $V_1$ included), going through an intermediate LL region, and finally reaching the COI regime. Additionally, the inclusion of 2NN interactions enhances charge order and suppresses pair coherence, evidenced by sharp peaks in the structure factor and rapid decay in pair-pair correlators. Our work extends the well-studied phase structure of 1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT models and demonstrates the interplay between gauge fields, confinement, and extended interactions.</description>

      <title>Conformal collider bootstrap in ${\mathcal N}=4$ SYM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a combination of perturbation theory, holography, supersymmetric localization, integrability, and numerical conformal bootstrap methods to constrain the energy-energy correlator in $\text{SU}(N_c)$ ${\mathcal N}=4$ SYM at finite coupling. For finite $N_c$, we derive lower bounds on the second and fourth multipoles of the energy-energy correlator at different couplings, along with a smeared energy-energy correlator as a function of the angle between the two detectors. We present evidence that our lower bounds on the multipoles are nearly saturated by the ${\cal N} = 4$ SYM theory. In the planar limit, we further use dispersive functionals to obtain tight two-sided bounds on both the first three non-trivial multipoles and on the angular dependence of the energy-energy correlator. As the coupling is varied from weak to strong, the energy-energy correlator exhibits a transition from single-trace to double-trace operator dominance in the collinear limit, which we characterize quantitatively. A similar phenomenon occurs in QCD, where a parton-hadron transition is observed as detectors are brought closer together.</description>

      <title>Measuring the neutron star equation of state from EMRIs in dark matter environments with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave observations of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in vacuum are largely insensitive to the internal structure of the small compact companion. We show that this conclusion can change when the central black hole is surrounded by a dense dark matter environment. We compute, for the first time, the relativistic dynamical-friction force on a neutron star moving through a collisionless medium and its impact on the evolution of EMRIs embedded in dense dark matter spikes. We then perform a Bayesian parameter-estimation analysis of simulated LISA observations to assess the measurability of both spike properties and the companion's internal structure. We find that, in our fiducial dark matter spike models, EMRIs with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $\gtrsim 20$ already allow us to distinguish neutron star from black hole companions, while events with SNR $\gtrsim 400$ make it possible to discriminate between different neutron star equations of state.</description>

      <title>Weak Gravity Conjecture in the sky: gravitational waves from preheating in Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective field theory (EFT) concept provides a necessary tool for obtaining general predictions of low-energy theory valid below its unitarity-breaking scale (cutoff scale). Early Universe inflation and subsequent reheating could be a unique setup for testing potentially observable effects coming from the derivative expansion of the corresponding EFT around the flat space vacuum. In this work, we consider an EFT describing perturbative reheating dominated by the decay of inflaton to photons caused by the dimension-5 operator $\phi F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}$. We compute the graviton production during reheating and high frequency gravitational wave signal due to the bremsstrahlung effect in the presence of $R_{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}F^{\mu\nu} F^{\lambda\rho}$ operator. It may lead to the dominant contribution at high momenta if the EFT cutoff is lower than the Planck mass. Assuming the general consequences of the unitarity and causality constraints, which imply that all EFT operators should be present, and be suppressed by the scales following from the dimension analysis, we obtain the observational constraints (CMB bound for the dark radiation) on the mass of the inflaton and UV cutoff of gravity. We find that for the typical parameters of large field inflation models, the gravitational cutoff scale cannot be lower than $10^{15}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Updated and Projected Cosmic Microwave Background Bounds on WIMP Annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive updated Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) constraints on annihilating dark matter, and present forecasts for upcoming CMB surveys. We show that the addition of recent temperature, polarization, and lensing data from ground-based experiments yields only minor improvements ($\approx 10\%$) compared to Planck bounds, confirming that the sensitivity remains dominated by the large-scale E-mode polarization. Forecasts, using a LiteBIRD-like setup, indicate that pairing a low-noise, wide-sky satellite at $\ell &lt; 200$ with high-resolution ground observations nearly saturates the cosmic-variance limit, improving bounds by $\approx 60\%$, where our derived 95th percentile limit is $p_{\rm ann} &lt; 1.27{\times}10^{-28}\,\mathrm{cm^{3}\,s^{-1}\,GeV^{-1}}$. We also consider the inclusion of B-mode polarization for a realistic future experiment.</description>

      <title>Imprint of the black hole interior on thermal four-point correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider correlators smeared against directed wavepackets over a thermal state dual to a single-sided planar AdS black hole. In the large frequency limit, our measurement is simplified using a bulk WKB description. We propose a dictionary that maps the action of smeared boundary operators to flat-space oscillators near an interior bulk point on the thermal state, by analytically continuing late-time operators from the right to the left boundary via an integral transform. Using the dictionary the smeared correlator factorizes to a flat-space like scattering amplitude about the interior event. Our transformed correlators describe local physics in the two-sided black hole interior, while incurring a suppression of $\mathcal{O}(e^{-\beta \omega / 2})$. These measurements necessitate a non-trivial time ordering of operators living on boundary hyperboloids which are causally connected to the past light cone of the bulk point, as well as on a corresponding future branch.</description>

      <title>Detection prospects for heavy WIMP dark matter near supermassive black holes, particularly in M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work analyzes the detection prospects for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) in dark matter (DM) density spikes around nearby supermassive black holes (SMBHs) by observations in very high energy gamma-ray band. Such spikes are unique targets, which provide a possibility to discover the basic thermal s-wave annihilating WIMP with any mass up to the theoretical unitarity limit ~ 100 TeV. All relevant SMBHs were checked, and only MW* and M31* were identified as worthwhile objects. Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) sensitivity to heavy WIMPs in M31* was estimated. It was obtained that CTA will be able to probe a major part of TeV-scale WIMP parameter space in case of optimistic spike density configuration in M31*. In certain scenarios, M31* may yield even stronger constraints than MW*. Relevant systematic uncertainties were explored.</description>

Abstract: Using repeated Laplace transform, We find an analytical solution for DGLAP evolution equations for extracting the pion, kaon and proton Fragmentation Functions (FFs) at NLO approximation. We also study the symmetry breaking of the sea quarks Fragmentation Functions, $D_{\bar q}^h (z,Q^2)$ and simply separated them according to their mass ratio. Finally, we calculate the total Fragmentation Functions of these hadrons and compare them with experimental data and those from global fits. Our results show a good agreement with the FFs obtained from global parameterizations as well as with the experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how the 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) Type-I can explain some excesses recently seen at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in $\gamma\gamma$ and $\tau^+\tau^-$ final states in turn matching Large Electron Positron (LEP) data in $b\bar b$ signatures, all anomalies residing around 95 GeV. The explanation to such anomalous data is found in the aforementioned scenario when in inverted mass hierarchy, in two configurations: i) when the lightest CP-even Higgs state is alone capable of reproducing the excesses; ii) when a combination of such a state and the CP-odd Higgs boson is able to do so. To test further this scenario, we present some Benchmark Points (BPs) of it amenable to phenomenological investigation.</description>

Abstract: Within a scotogenic neutrino mass model we explore the cogenesis of matter from the CP violating decay of a heavy $\mathbb{Z}_2$-odd right handed neutrino that simultaneously populates the visible and a multipartite dark sector. The relic density of a sub-GeV scale freeze-in dark matter is generated by the late time decay of the next-to-lightest dark particle dynamically regulated by an interplay with the thermal scattering processes. We show that this model can simultaneously explain visible matter asymmetry and provide a cosmologically viable sub-GeV dark matter while remaining in consonance with the neutrino parameters and flavour observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19526v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low-energy $J/\psi N$ scattering is important for various reasons: it is related to the hidden-charm $P_c$ pentaquark states, provides insights into the role of gluons in nucleon structures, and is relevant to the $J/\psi$ properties in nuclear medium. The scattering can happen through two distinct mechanisms: the coupled-channel mechanism via open-charm meson-baryon intermediate states, and the soft-gluon exchange mechanism. We investigate the $J/\psi N$ $S$-wave scattering length through both mechanisms, and find that the soft-gluon exchange mechanism leads to a scattering length at least one order of magnitude larger than that from the coupled-channel mechanism and thus is the predominant one. The findings can be verified by lattice calculations and will enhance our understanding of the scattering processes breaking the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07642v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a solution to the SUSY $\mu$-problem within the framework of modular flavor symmetry. The explicit $\mu$-term is prohibited by modular symmetry, and an effective $\mu$-term is regenerated following the stabilization of the modulus field. We examine the stabilization mechanism of a single modulus field with the presence of SUSY breaking contributions described by the non-linear SUSY realization scheme involving a nilpotent Goldstino $\textbf{X}_{nl}$ superfield. A natural small $\mu_{eff}$, significantly smaller than the SUSY scale, can result from either the expansion of typical modular forms using a small deviation parameter near the fixed point $\omega$, or from the combined effects of suppression by powers of $q^{1/24}$ [or $(2\Im\tau)^{-1}$] along with the asymptotic suppression behavior of typical modular forms away from the fixed point $i\infty$, taking the form of appropriate power of the tiny deviation parameter. A natural small $\mu_{eff}$ can also be achieved by a weighton-like mechanism for $H_uH_d$ bilinear.</description>

      <title>Higgs Potential from Instantons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that the Higgs potential, a key element in our understanding of Nature, is partially generated by the instantons of new confining dynamics, perhaps from a hidden sector. In this picture, while the Higgs itself is a fundamental field, it controls the strength of the non-perturbative interactions that give rise to its potential. We examine a simple setup in which this instanton contribution is augmented by a quartic term, which is sufficient for a realistic electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. The minimum of the potential is given by the Lambert $W_0$ function, with these assumptions. We discuss the predictions of this model and how it may be tested through measurements of the Higgs self coupling. Given the connection with non-trivial dynamics, one may also consider the prospects of accessing hidden sector states at colliders; this seems to be typically challenging in our setup. Symmetry restoration in the early Universe in this scenario is briefly examined. We also comment on the possible connection of our general setup with recent work on the physics of field space end points.</description>

Abstract: Generative networks are an exciting tool for fast LHC event fixed number of particles. Autoregressive transformers allow us to generate events containing variable numbers of particles, very much in line with the physics of QCD jet radiation, and offer the possibility to generalize to higher multiplicities. We show how transformers can learn a factorized likelihood for jet radiation and extrapolate in terms of the number of generated jets. For this extrapolation, bootstrapping training data and training with modifications of the likelihood loss can be used.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we propose that a proper constituent gluon mass $m_g$=450 MeV can be applied to identify the hybrids composed of quarks and gluons. By investigating the spectra and decay widths of the light hybrids $(q\bar{q}g)$ with $J^P=1^{-+}$, we find the $\pi_1(1600)$ and $\eta_1(1855)$ may not be explained as $1^{-+}$ hybrids, simultaneously, and the $\eta_1(1855)$ observed by BESIII may not be a hybrid. In addition, we predict an existence of a hybrid $\eta_1(1640)$, which can be verified by searching the $a_1(1260)\pi$ channel. Moreover, we suggest the $K_1(1270)\bar{K}$ and $K_1(1270)\pi$ as the golden channels to search for an isospin-0 and an isospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ hybrids, respectively.</description>

      <title>The TeraZ Mirage: New Physics Lost in Blind Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next generation of high-luminosity electron-positron colliders, such as FCC-ee and CEPC operating at the $Z$ pole (TeraZ), is expected to deliver unprecedented precision in electroweak measurements. These precision observables are typically interpreted within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), offering a powerful tool to constrain new physics. However, the large number of independent SMEFT operators allows for the possibility of blind directions, parameter combinations to which electroweak precision data are largely insensitive. In this work, we demonstrate that such blind directions are not merely an artefact of agnostic effective field theory scans, but arise generically in realistic ultraviolet completions involving multiple heavy fields. We identify several concrete multi-field extensions of the Standard Model whose low-energy SMEFT projections align with known blind subspaces, and show that these persist even after accounting for renormalisation group evolution and finite one-loop matching effects. Our analysis shows that TeraZ will set a new benchmark in precision for indirect searches, but fully probing the space of possible ultraviolet physics requires moving towards a high energy hadron collider. Later FCC-ee runs at higher centre-of-mass energies, together with the FCC-hh, will provide the necessary complementary probes, enabling a far more complete exploration of the SMEFT parameter space.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum of vacuum bubbles in a first-order phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) during a first-order phase transition (FOPT) in a dark sector has been of recent interest. A quantity that characterizes a black hole is its spin. We carry out the first step towards determining the spin of such PBHs, by calculating the spin of spherical false vacuum bubbles induced by cosmological perturbations. The angular momentum is given by the product of density and velocity perturbations. We carefully track the evolution of background quantities and calculate the transfer functions during the FOPT. We find that the dimensionless spin parameter $s = J/(G_{\rm N} M^2)$ of false vacuum bubbles of mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$, take a wide range of values from ${\cal{O}}(10^{-5})$ to ${\cal{O}}(10)$ for FOPTs between 10 keV and 100 GeV and a dark sector that is 0.1 to 0.4 times cooler than the visible sector. We also find a scaling relation between the root-mean-square value of the spin, the FOPT time scale, the bubble wall velocity, and the dark sector-to-visible sector temperature ratio.</description>

      <title>Identification of $D^*_2(3000)$ as the $D_2^*(2^3P_2)$ and exploring potential of undiscovered $2^+$ mesons via $B$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the discovery of the $D^*_2(3000)$, its mass and full width have been extensively studied. Yet its nature remains undetermined to date. Since it was discovered through nonleptonic decay of $B$ meson and the corresponding cascade process, we therefore in this paper investigate the nonleptonic and semileptonic decays of $B$ meson to $J^P = 2^+$ charmed mesons using the Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. Our calculations on nonleptonic $B$ decays reveal that the unconfirmed resonance $D^*_2(3000)$ aligns well with $D^*_2(2^3P_2)$ predictions. Other candidates, including $D^*_2(1^3F_2)$, $D^*_2(3^3P_2)$, and $D^*_2(2^3F_2)$, are excluded due to their very small branching ratios in $B$ decays. Considering that the $D^*_2(1F)$, $D^*_2(3P)$, and $D^*_2(2F)$ have not yet been experimentally observed, we investigate the feasibility of their detection in $B$-meson decays.</description>

      <title>Semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering off a tensor-polarized spin-1 target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering off a tensor-polarized spin-1 target, focusing on the production of an unpolarized hadron. The complete differential cross section is expressed in terms of 23 structure functions, which depend on the spin states of the target and the azimuthal modulations of the final-state hadron. Within the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization framework, we derive the hadronic tensor using quark-quark correlators and quark-gluon-quark correlators up to twist-3. At tree-level, 21 nonvanishing structure functions are obtained at the leading and subleading twist, expressed as convolutions of TMD parton distribution functions and TMD fragmentation functions. The measurement of these nonzero structure functions can be utilized to explore the tensor-polarized structure of spin-1 particles, offering insights into their internal dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A proposed future ultra high energy collider such as the Future Circular Collider is expected to produce intense and collimated neutrino beams from weak hadron decays. In this study, we estimate the production yields of such neutrinos from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 100~TeV and an integrated luminosity of 1~ab$^{-1}$. Based on a hypothetical detector positioned either 0.5~km or 2~km downstream from the interaction point along the beamline, we derive the expected rates of charged current neutrino scattering events and their extension to neutrino energies of up to 50~TeV. We, for the first time, also evaluate the feasibility of observing the experimentally unverified direct production of $W^{\pm}$ bosons from neutrino-nucleus interactions.</description>

      <title>The complementary of CTAO, direct detection and collider searches for dark matter in Effective Field Theories and Simplified models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory to dark matter annihilation in the Galactic Center, within the frameworks of Effective Field Theory and Simplified Models. We present sensitivity forecasts, utilizing an up-to-date instrument configuration and incorporating the latest models for Galactic Diffuse Emission. A key aspect of our work is the inclusion of updated dark matter density profiles, J-factors, and velocity dispersion distributions derived from the FIRE-2 cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which significantly impact the expected indirect detection signals. Furthermore, we update the constraints from direct detection experiments (Xenon1T and LZ) taking into account the astrophysical uncertainties informed by the FIRE-2 simulations, and also investigate limits coming from collider searches (ATLAS and CMS). Our analysis reveals improved constraints on the effective suppression scale ($M_*$) in the Effective Field Theory framework and on the mediator mass ($M_{med}$) in Simplified Models compared to previous studies, highlighting the complementarity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory with direct and collider searches in probing a wide range of dark matter scenarios. We discuss the implications of these results for various dark matter interaction types, including scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and axial-vector mediators, and emphasize the importance of considering realistic astrophysical inputs in interpreting dark matter search results across different experimental fronts.</description>

      <title>High Energy Particle Production from Proton Synchrotron Radiation in Strong Magnetic Fields in Relativistic Quantum Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate photon, pion, and rho-meson production from proton synchrotron radiation in the presence of strong magnetic fields. The proton decay widths and the luminosities of the emitted particles are calculated within a relativistic quantum framework that incorporates Landau quantization. A scaling rule is derived for the transition probability between different Landau levels. This allows an evaluation of transitions for extremely high Landau numbers exceeding $10^{15}$. Furthermore, we calculate the momentum distribution of the emitted particles by properly including the proton recoil effect associated with particle emission. The results differ significantly from conventional semiclassical approaches.</description>

      <title>Scaling properties of nuclear parton distributions in short-range-correlation motivated two-component parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide some critical remarks on the recently proposed two-component parametrization of nuclear parton distribution functions, which was motivated by the apparent correlation between the nuclear modifications of structure functions and nucleon-nucleon short-range correlation phenomena. This parametrization, we show, is invariant under a rescaling transformation of the involved abundance coefficients, which means that the global normalization of these coefficients cannot be meaningfully determined in a fit, and only their ratios should be studied for finding evidence of short-range-correlation type behavior at parton level. As we show, however, the current constraints for the nuclear-mass dependence of these coefficients allow also for interpretations different from short-range correlations. Nevertheless, this two-component parametrization exhibits a similar scaling relation for DIS structure functions as demonstrated in earlier works, and, as we demonstrate, yields testable predictions for structure-function and hard-process cross-section ratios. We also note on the non-trivial isospin dependence of the short-range-correlation motivated parametrization, which under proton-neutron pair dominance assumption can lead to charge-symmetry-violation resembling terms.</description>

      <title>Prompt diphoton production compared to measurements at 13 TeV in $k_t$-factorization: a comparative analysis of UPDF models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform an in-depth comparative analysis of unintegrated parton distribution function (UPDF) models for isolated prompt diphoton production in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV within the $k_t$-factorization framework. Predictions are obtained with three UPDF approaches: Parton Branching (PB), NLO-MRW, and Modified KMRW (MKMRW). Tree-level $q + \bar q\!\to\!\gamma +\gamma$, $q + \bar q\!\to\!\gamma + \gamma + g$, and $q + g\!\to\!\gamma +\gamma + q$ subprocesses are generated with \textsc{KaTie} using off-shell initial states; the loop-induced $g + g\!\to\!\gamma + \gamma$ channel is evaluated independently. We compare differential cross sections with ATLAS measurements across a broad set of observables, including the photon transverse momenta, diphoton invariant mass and transverse momentum, the Collins-Soper angle, acoplanarity, $\phi^*_\eta$, and a transverse thrust-related variable. This comparative study quantifies the impact of the UPDF choice on the diphoton spectra. We find that the PB model provides the most consistent agreement over all distributions, whereas NLO-MRW tends to overshoot in regions correlated with larger factorization scales and MKMRW generally undershoots due to stronger Sudakov suppression. With standard scale variations, our results indicate that $k_t$-factorization with PB UPDFs can accurately describe diphoton production, while fixed-order collinear predictions typically require higher-order corrections together with parton-shower effects to achieve a comparable description.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the ``naive" $T$-odd Collins-Soper moments in the Drell-Yan process as probes of previously unexplored directions in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) parameter space. We show that the moments $A_6$ and $A_7$ in the high invariant mass and transverse momentum region are sensitive to dimension-8 $CP$-odd semi-leptonic four-fermion operators with an additional gluon field strength tensor. Using the projected integrated luminosity of a future high-luminosity LHC, we show that effective ultraviolet scales in the few-TeV range can be probed with this process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the strong decay of $D_{s0}^*(2317)^+$ to $D_s^+ \pi^0$ considering the coupled channels of $D^0 K^+, D^+ K^0, D_s^+ \eta$ and $D_s^+ \pi^0$ within a picture for the interaction based on the local hidden gauge approach. We also address the problem of the radiative decay to $D_s^{*+} \gamma$, using the same information obtained from the molecular picture. We obtain a strong width of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)^+$ of about $71 \,\rm keV$ and a radiative decay of $1.3 \,\rm keV$. The anomalous terms for the radiative decay are considered for the first time, but they are found negligible. We make a thorough discussion of this and other results to the light of the recent measurement of Belle for the ratio of these two decay modes, and make a call for the precise measurement of the two decay widths independently to clarify the present situation concerning the nature of of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)^+$ state.</description>

      <title>Reviving $Z^\prime$ Portal Dark Matter with Conversion Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many new physics models with extended gauge symmetry, the new gauge boson $Z'$ could mediate the interactions between the dark matter and standard model particles. For the conventional $Z^\prime$ portal dark matter, the collider and the direct detection constraints typically pose a significant challenge. To address this pressing issue, we present in this paper a new benchmark model based on the gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, which introduces a Dirac dark fermion $\tilde{\chi}_1$ and a heavier partner $\tilde{\chi}_2$ with zero and nonzero $U(1)_{B-L}$ charge, respectively. Including the mass term $\delta m \bar{\tilde{\chi}}_1\tilde{\chi}_2$ results in the dark fermions $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$ in the mass eigenstate, where the lighter one $\chi_1$ is regarded as the dark matter candidate. Various intriguing processes for the relic density arise with the compressed mass spectrum $m_{\chi_1}\simeq m_{\chi_2}$, such as the coscattering $\chi_2f\to\chi_1f$, the conversion $\chi_2\chi_i\to\chi_1\chi_j$, and the coannihilation $\chi_1\chi_2\to f\bar{f}$ processes. Suppressed by the small mixing angle $\theta$ between the dark fermions, the small effective gauge coupling of dark matter $\chi_1$ to the gauge boson $Z'$ is one distinct feature of this model, rendering phenomenology in many aspects more promising. In this paper, we investigate the production of dark matter through new mechanisms within the frameworks of resonance and secluded scenarios. The impacts of phenomenological constraints from collider, dark matter, and cosmology are also taken into account. We report that the conversion mechanism is both favored by the resonance and secluded scenarios under current constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first baryon resonance was discovered in the early 1950s. The Roper resonance joined the collection ten years later. Today, many baryon resonances are known and more are being discovered. As baryons, these states are the most fundamental three-body systems in Nature. They must all be understood, not just the isolated ground state nucleon. This contribution sketches applications of continuum Schwinger function methods to the baryon resonance problem. Whilst spectroscopy is of value, particular emphasis is placed on resonance electroproduction because transition form factors extracted from electroproduction data provide a keen tool for revealing resonance structure.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive survey of hybrid equations of state in neutron star mergers and constraints on the hadron-quark phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform an extensive study of equation of state (EoS) models featuring a phase transition from hadronic to deconfined quark matter in neutron star merger simulations. We employ three different hadronic EoSs, a constant speed of sound parameterization for the quark phase and a Maxwell construction to generate a large sample of hybrid EoS models. We systematically vary the onset density and density jump of the phase transition as well as the quark matter stiffness and simulate binary neutron star mergers to infer how the properties of the phase transition affect the gravitational-wave signal. In total we simulate mergers with 245 different hybrid EoS models. In particular, we explore in which scenarios a phase transition would be detectable by a characteristically increased postmerger gravitational-wave frequency compared to an estimate from the inspiral signal assuming a purely hadronic EoS. We find that the density jump at the transition (latent heat) has the largest impact on the gravitational-wave frequencies, while the influence of the stiffness of quark matter is smaller. We quantify which range of phase transition properties would be compatible with a certain magnitude or absence of the gravitational-wave postmerger frequency shift. By means of these dependencies, a future detection will thus directly yield constraints on the allowed features of the hadron-quark phase transition.</description>

      <title>Partially Coherent X-Ray Oscilex Radiation from a FEL-Modulated Positron Bunch during Its Planar Channeling in a Crystalline Undulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10205v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiation emitted at zero angle by a microbunched positron bunch undergoing planar channeling in a crystalline undulator (CU) is studied. The bunch energy is assumed to be far above the threshold for radiation generation in the dispersive CU medium. Besides the usual ``hard'' undulator radiation produced by channeling oscillations (channeling undulator radiation) and by the CU bending (crystalline undulator radiation), a ``soft'' medium-polarization component also appears at zero angle due to the oscillations that excite atomic electrons. We refer to this soft component as Oscilex (oscillationally-excited) radiation. Since the two types of oscillations have different frequencies, they yield two distinct frequency components of both undulator and Oscilex radiation. The Oscilex frequencies are set by the plasma frequency and the characteristic oscillation frequency and are, to high accuracy, independent of the positron energy. The CU period is chosen so that the radiation wavelength is not shorter than the microbunch length, ensuring coherent emission from microbunches and partially coherent Oscilex emission from the full bunch. Analytical expressions are obtained for the spectral line shapes and the number of photons of spontaneous Oscilex radiation. For partially coherent emission, Gaussian distributions are used for both the bunch and microbunches. Gain factors for the two Oscilex components, including longitudinal form-factors, and the total number of partially coherent photons are derived. A positron bunch with LCLS parameters, modulated by SASE XFEL, channeling between (1 1 0) planes of a periodically bent diamond crystal is analyzed. The number of spontaneously emitted Oscilex photons exceeds the number of positrons by $1\text{{\div}}2$ orders of magnitude, and the gain factors reach $10^3 \text{{\div}} 10^4$.</description>

Abstract: The standard paradigm of cosmology assumes two distinct dark components, namely dark matter and dark energy. However, the necessity of splitting the dark-side world into two sectors has not been experimentally or theoretically proven. Unified dark fluid models provide an alternative in which a single fluid accounts for both phenomena. It is shown in Wang et al. 2024 that a PAge-like unified dark fluid (PUDF) can explain both the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and late-universe data, with the fitting quality not much worse than the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. Using the Planck 2018 CMB, baryon acoustic oscillations measurement from the dark energy spectroscopic instrument (DESI) data release 2, dark energy survey 5-year supernova data, and cosmic-chronometer data, we update the constraints on PUDF and clarify its physical implications. We show that PUDF can reproduce the primary CMB anisotropies, the background expansion history, and linear growth that are very close to the $\Lambda$CDM prediction. Nevertheless, the combined datasets still favor $\Lambda$CDM, largely due to the significant tension between CMB and DESI + SNe data, which exceeds the $4\sigma$ level in PUDF and remains non-negligible in the $w$CDM framework. Using mock data generated from the Planck best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model, we find that PUDF and $\Lambda$CDM cannot be statistically distinguished, indicating that the precision of current data is insufficient to separate the two models. Overall, the apparent preference for $\Lambda$CDM may be driven by dataset inconsistencies rather than a genuine physical difference, leaving unified dark fluid models as viable alternatives within current observational limits.</description>

      <title>AI-Newton: A Concept-Driven Physical Law Discovery System without Prior Physical Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While current AI-driven methods excel at deriving empirical models from individual experiments, a significant challenge remains in uncovering the common fundamental physics that underlie these models -- a task at which human physicists are adept. To bridge this gap, we introduce AI-Newton, a novel framework for concept-driven scientific discovery. Our system autonomously derives general physical laws directly from raw, multi-experiment data, operating without supervision or prior physical knowledge. Its core innovations are twofold: (1) proposing interpretable physical concepts to construct laws, and (2) progressively generalizing these laws to broader domains. Applied to a large, noisy dataset of mechanics experiments, AI-Newton successfully rediscovers foundational and universal laws, such as Newton's second law, the conservation of energy, and the universal gravitation. This work represents a significant advance toward autonomous, human-like scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Caustic fringes for wave dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wave dark matter is composed of particles sufficiently light that their de Broglie wavelength exceeds the average inter-particle separation. A typical wave dark matter halo exhibits granular substructures due to wave interference. In this paper, we explore the wave interference effects around caustics. These are locations of formally divergent density in cold collisionless systems. Examples include splashback in galaxy clusters, and tidal shells in merging galaxies, where the pile-up of dark matter close to apogee gives rise to caustics. We show that wave interference modifies the density profile in the vicinity of the caustics, giving rise to a fringe pattern well-described by the Airy function. This follows from approximating the gravitational potential as linear close to apogee. This prediction is verified in a series of numerical simulations in which the gravitational potential is computed exactly. We provide a formula expressing the fringe separation in terms of the wave dark matter mass and halo parameters, which is useful for interpreting and stacking data. The fringe separation near caustics can be significantly larger than the naive de Broglie scale (the latter set by the system's velocity dispersion). This opens up the possibility of detecting caustic fringes for a wide range of wave dark matter masses.</description>

      <title>Cosmic sign-reversal: non-parametric reconstruction of interacting dark energy with DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A direct interaction between dark energy and dark matter provides a natural and important extension to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We perform a non-parametric reconstruction of the vacuum energy ($w=-1$) interacting with cold dark matter using the cosmological data from DESI DR2, Planck CMB, and three SNIa samples (PP, DESY5, and Union3). By discretizing the coupling function $\beta(z)$ into 20 redshift bins and assuming a Gaussian smoothness prior, we reconstruct $\beta(z)$ without assuming any specific parameterization. The mean reconstructed $\beta(z)$ changes sign during cosmic evolution, indicating an energy transfer from cold dark matter to dark energy at early times and a reverse flow at late times. At high redshifts, $\beta(z)$ shows a $\sim 2\sigma$ deviation from $\Lambda$CDM. At low redshifts, the results depend on the SNIa sample: CMB+DESI and CMB+DESI+PP yield $\beta(z)$ consistent with zero within $2\sigma$, while CMB+DESI+DESY5 and CMB+DESI+Union3 prefer negative $\beta$ at $\sim2\sigma$. Both $\chi^2$ tests and Bayesian analyses favor the $\beta(z)$ model, with CMB+DESI DR2+DESY5 showing the most significant support through the largest improvement in goodness of fit ($\Delta\chi^2_{\rm MAP}=-17.76$) and strongest Bayesian evidence ($\ln\mathcal{B} = 5.98 \pm 0.69$). Principal component analysis reveals that the data effectively constrain three additional degrees of freedom in the $\beta(z)$ model, accounting for most of the improvement in goodness of fit. Our results demonstrate that the dynamical dark energy preference in current data can be equally well explained by such a sign-reversal interacting dark energy, highlighting the need for future observations to break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Collapsar Disk Outflows III: Detectable Neutrino and Gravitational Wave Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from accretion disks formed during the failed collapse of a rotating massive star (a collapsar). Following black hole formation, a neutrino-cooled, shocked accretion disk forms, which displays non-spherical oscillations for a period of seconds before becoming advective and exploding the star. We compute the neutrino and GW signals (matter quadrupole, frequencies $\lesssim 100$ Hz) from collapsar disks using global axisymmetric, viscous hydrodynamic simulations. The neutrino signal with typical energies of O$(10)$ MeV is maximal during the neutrino-cooled (NDAF) phase that follows shock formation. This phase lasts for a few seconds and is easily detectable within O$(10-100)$ kpc by the IceCube Neutrino Telescope. Additional neutrino signatures from a precursor equatorial shock and by stochastic accretion plumes during the advective phase are detectable within the galaxy. The GW signal during the NDAF phase is detectable in the galaxy by current and next-generation ground-based observatories. The explosion (memory) GW signal is similar to that of standard core-collapse supernovae and can be probed with a deci-Hertz space-based detector. Shock oscillations during the NDAF phase impart time variations with frequency O$(10-100)$ Hz to the neutrino and GW signals, encoding information about the shock dynamics and inner disk. These time variations can be detectable in neutrinos by IceCube within O$(1-10)$ kpc depending on progenitor model, flavor transformation scenario, and detailed properties of the angular momentum transport mechanism.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of a Spherically Symmetric Causal Diamond in Minkowski Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute a gravitational on-shell action of a finite, spherically symmetric causal diamond in $(d+2)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, finding it is proportional to the area of the bifurcate horizon $A_{\mathcal{B}}$. We then identify the on-shell action with the saddle point of the Euclidean gravitational path integral, which is naturally interpreted as a partition function. This partition function is thermal with respect to a modular Hamiltonian $K$. Consequently, we determine, from the on-shell action using standard thermodynamic identities, both the mean and variance of the modular Hamiltonian, finding $\langle K \rangle = \langle (\Delta K)^2 \rangle = \frac{A_{\mathcal{B}}}{4 G_N}$. Finally, we show that modular fluctuations give rise to fluctuations in the geometry, and compute the associated phase shift of massless particles traversing the diamond under such fluctuations.</description>

      <title>New GPU developments in the Madgraph CUDACPP plugin: kernel splitting, helicity streams, cuBLAS color sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05392v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first production release of the CUDACPP plugin for the Madgraph5_aMC@NLO generator, which speeds up matrix element (ME) calculations for leading-order (LO) processes using a data parallel approach on vector CPUs and GPUs, was delivered in October 2024. This was described in previous publications by the team behind that effort. In this paper, I describe my work on some additional developments and optimizations of CUDACPP, mainly but not exclusively for GPUs. The new approach, which represents a major restructuring of the CUDACPP computational engine, primarily consists in splitting the ME calculation, previously performed using a single large GPU kernel, into many smaller kernels. A first batch of changes, involving the move to separate "helicity streams" and the optional offloading of QCD color sums to BLAS, was recently merged into a new CUDACPP release, in collaboration with my colleagues. Since then, I have completed a second batch of changes, involving the possibility to split the calculation into groups of Feynman diagrams in separate source code files. This new feature makes it possible to compute QCD matrix elements for physics processes with a larger number of final state gluons: in particular, I present the first performance results from CUDACPP for the $2\!\rightarrow\!6$ process $gg\!\rightarrow\!t\bar{t}gggg$ on CPUs and GPUs and the $2\!\rightarrow\!7$ process $gg\!\rightarrow\!t\bar{t}ggggg$ on CPUs, which involve over 15k and 230k Feynman diagrams, respectively. I also take this opportunity to describe in detail some previously undocumented features of the CUDACPP software, both in the GPU and vector CPU implementations.</description>
