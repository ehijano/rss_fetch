      <title>Lanes and lattice structures in a repulsive model for self-propelled agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a simple Vicsek-type rule-based model for self-propelled particles, where each particle orients itself antiparallel to the average orientation of particles within a defined neighborhood of radius $R$. The particle orientation is updated asynchronously and randomly across the system. In steady state, particles self-organize into clusters-despite the repulsive interaction-and form two interwoven hexagonal lattices moving in opposite directions chosen spontaneously. Increasing noise in the reorientation step reduces the laning effect, but the global crystalline order remains intact at sufficiently high densities. The mean-squared displacement exhibits super-diffusive growth $ \sim t^{3/2} $ in the transient phase, transitioning to ballistic motion $ \sim t^2 $ in the steady state in the high density and zero noise regime. With an increase in noise and/or decrease in density, the mean-squared displacement grows diffusively $ \sim t $. We observe a cutoff for the ratio $ \frac{R}{L} \sim 0.2-0.3 $, below which laning and crystallization is achieved, suggesting a local but non-microscopic sphere of influence is required to initiate laning.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity scaling of maximally random jammed packings of two-dimensional binary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jammed (mechanically rigid) polydisperse circular-disk packings in two dimensions (2D) are popular models for structural glass formers. Maximally random jammed (MRJ) states, which are the most disordered packings subject to strict jamming, have been shown to be hyperuniform. The characterization of the hyperuniformity of MRJ circular-disk packings has covered only a very small part of the possible parameter space for the disk-size distributions. Hyperuniform heterogeneous media are those that anomalously suppress large-scale volume-fraction fluctuations compared to those in typical disordered systems, i.e., their spectral densities $\tilde{\chi}_{_V}(\mathbf{k})$ tend to 0 as the wavenumber $k\equiv|\mathbf{k}|$ tends to 0 and are described by the power-law $\tilde{\chi}_{_V}(\mathbf{k})\sim k^{\alpha}$ as $k\rightarrow0$ where $\alpha$ is the hyperuniformity scaling exponent. In this work, we generate and characterize the structure of strictly jammed binary circular-disk packings with disk-size ratio $\beta$ and a molar ratio of 1:1. By characterizing the rattler fraction, the fraction of isostatic configurations in an ensemble with fixed $\beta$, and the $n$-fold orientational order metrics of ensembles of packings with a wide range of $\beta$, we show that size ratios $1.2\lesssim \beta\lesssim 2.0$ produce MRJ-like states, which we show are the most disordered packings according to several criteria. Using the large-length-scale scaling of the volume fraction variance, we extract $\alpha$ from these packings, and find the function $\alpha(\beta)$ is maximized at $\beta$ = 1.4 (with $\alpha = 0.450\pm0.002$) within the range $1.2\leq\beta\leq2.0$, and decreases rapidly outside of this range. The results from this work can inform the experimental design of disordered hyperuniform thin-film materials with tunable degrees of orientational and translational disorder. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Regulated polarization of active particles in local osmotic flow fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regulation to a well-defined target state is a fundamental requirement for achieving reliable functionality in living systems and maintaining specific non-equilibrium states. The control of certain properties and functionalities of systems on the microscale presents a particular challenge since thermal fluctuations and environmental perturbations dominate. While synthetic active matter has demonstrated remarkable self-organization capabilities, examples of autonomous regulation processes at the single-particle level remain scarce. Here, we show that the interplay of two non-equilibrium processes leads to a regulated polarization state of active particles in local osmotic flow fields. The balance between thermophoretic repulsion and attraction by thermo-osmotic boundary flows, both generated by a single heat source, yields a steady state at which active particles encircle the heat source at a distance that depends on the temperature of the heat source. The balance of both temperature-induced processes causes a polarization of the active particles that is independent of the heat source temperature. The individual control of heat source and active particles in the experiment allows a detailed investigation of the self-regulated polarization effect in which we find that hydrodynamic interactions dominate. As the effects rely on osmotic flows and phoretic interactions, we expect that the observed phenomena can be generalized to other active systems and flow fields.</description>

      <title>Thermofluidic non-equilibrium assembly of reconfigurable functional structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium assembly, driven by fluxes controllable by continuous external energy inputs, enables dynamic and reconfigurable structures. Such controlled 3D assembly is desired for the design of adaptive materials that exploit structure-function relationships, but has remained challenging. We present a non-equilibrium assembly of colloidal particles mediated by laser-induced local heating and continuous heat dissipation. These 3D out-of-equilibrium structures, assembled in a matter of a few minutes, were highly ordered and exhibited tunable photonic stopbands. We quantify the particle fluxes from the underlying assembly processes and report the growth dynamics of the assembled structures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the modulation of the photonic stopband achieved by modulating the particle fluxes, highlighting the prospects of such thermofluidic assembly for creating reconfigurable functional structures.</description>

      <title>Two characteristic constants of the supercooled liquid transitions of amorphous substances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supercooled liquid state is a particularly interesting state in that it exhibits several unusual physical properties. To illustrate, the liquid displays a single peak relaxation frequency at high temperatures, which splits into $\alpha$ relaxation and $\beta$ relaxation in the moderately supercooled regime, with relaxation a disappearing at the glass transition temperature. The mechanism underlying these unusual physical properties of liquids has always been one of the important research topics in condensed matter. Here, a new mechanism is proposed. A distinctive physical state is built, and its most salient feature is that its independent variables are difficult or impossible to measure. Theoretical calculations indicate that there exist two sets of measurable variables in this physical state that cannot be measure exactly simultaneously. Moreover, it is easy to reach an erroneous conclusion, namely that ``a system in this physical state is in a superposition of some real states, until it is measured''. Further theoretical calculations demonstrate that there are two new transitions and that $\mathrm{e}^{3}$ and $2\mathrm{e}^{3}$ are characteristic values of these two transitions, respectively, where $\mathrm{e}$ is Euler's number. Considerable experimental data shows that the characteristic value of glass transition appears to be concentrated near $2\mathrm{e}^{3}$ and the characteristic value of another transition (for example, the splitting of relaxation peak) appears to be concentrated near $\mathrm{e}^{3}$.</description>

      <title>Simple Method for the Direct Measurement of Cohesive Forces Between Microscopic Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple and inexpensive method for measuring weak cohesive interactions. This technique is applied to the specific case of oil droplets with a depletion interaction, dispersed in an aqueous solution. The experimental setup involves creating a short string of droplets while immobilizing a single droplet. The droplets are held together via depletion interactions and a single cohesive bond holds together nearest neighbours. Initially, the buoyant droplets are held in a flat horizontal chamber. The droplets float to the top of the chamber and are in contact with a flat glass interface. In the horizontal configuration, there is no component of the effective buoyant force acting in the plane of the chamber. The angle of the chamber is gradually increased and the effective buoyant force acting on the string of droplets slowly increases. At a critical point, when the combination of gravity and buoyancy is equal to the cohesive force, the droplet string will detach from the immobile droplet. Our method allows for a simple direct measurement of cohesive forces on the tens of pico-Newton scale. To illustrate the validity of this technique, the droplet radii and concentration of depletant are varied, and their impact on the cohesive force is measured. This method offers a simple, accessible, and reproducible means of exploring cohesive interactions beyond the specific case of oil droplets and a depletion interaction.</description>

      <title>Structure and Dynamic Evolution of Interfaces between Polymer Solutions and Gels and Polymer Interdiffusion: A Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Letting free polymers diffuse from solution into a crosslinked polymer gel is often a crucial processing step in the synthesis of multiphase polymer-based gels, e.g., core-shell microgels. Here we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to obtain molecular insights into this process. We consider idealized situations where the gel is modeled as a regular polymer network with the topology of a diamond lattice, and all free polymers and strands have the same length and consist of the same type of monomer. After bringing the gel and the polymer solution into contact, two time regimes are observed: An initial compression of the gel caused by the osmotic pressure of the solution, followed by an expansion due to swelling. We characterize the time evolution of density profiles, the penetration of free polymers into the gel and the connection between the gel and solution phase. The interfacial structure locally equilibrates after roughly 100 chain relaxation times. At late times, the free chains inside the gel undergo a percolation transition if the polymer concentration in the gel exceeds a critical value, which is of the same order as the overlap concentration. The fluctuations of the interface can be described by a capillary wave model that accounts for the elasticity of the gel. Based on this, we extract the interfacial tension of the gel-solution interface. Interestingly, both the interfacial tension and the local interfacial width increase with increasing free polymer concentration - in contrast to liquid-liquid interfaces, where these two quantities are typically anticorrelated.</description>

      <title>Self-regulated photoresponsive heterogeneous PNIPAM hydrogel actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-regulated actuators harness material intelligence to enable complex deformations and dynamics, representing a significant advancement in automated soft robotics. However, investigations on self-regulated soft actuators, particularly those using simplified actuation modules such as a unidirectional light beam, remain limited. Here, we present a design paradigm for self-regulated actuators based on Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) heterogeneous hydrogel, where self-regulated deformations are actuated by a fixed near-infrared laser. By utilizing the different responsiveness of PNIPAM hydrogels and those integrated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO), we develop three heterogeneous hydrogel configurations: up-down, side-by-side, and hybrid. These designs enable complex biomimetic deformations in soft hydrogel actuators, resembling a bending finger or a flexible industrial manipulator, all actuated by a single fixed laser source. These proposed heterogeneous designs and actuation strategies leverage material intelligence to create soft actuators with enhanced autonomy, paving the way for soft automation, adaptive systems, and biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Differentiating Confined from Adsorbed Water in Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes via Electronic Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we show that it is possible to differentiate between water adsorbed on the outside of a single-walled carbon nanotube and that confined inside. To this aim, we measured the electronic transport of a carbon nanotube based field effect transistor (CNTFET) constructed with an isolated single carbon nanotube subjected to controlled environments. More precisely, this distinction is made possible by observing the evolution of the transfer characteristic as a function of the electric field imposed by the gate voltage. It appears that the presence of water results in a displacement of the electrical neutrality point, corresponding to a charge transfer between the nanotube and its environment. Using this approach, we demonstrate the existence of 3 types of water molecules: (i) chemically adsorbed on the SiO\textsubscript{2} surface of the substrate, i.e., forming silanol groups; (ii) physically adsorbed outside next to the nanotube; and (iii) confined inside the nanotube. The first one can only be eliminated by high temperature treatment under vacuum, the second one desorbs in a moderate vacuum at room temperature, while the confined water can be removed at room temperature at higher vacuum, i.e. $10^{-3}$ mbar. We also observe that both water adsorption outside and water confinement inside the nanotube are spontaneous and rather fast, i.e. less than 1 minute in our experimental conditions, while removing the water adsorbed outside and confined inside takes much longer, i.e. 40-60 minutes, thus indicating that water confinement is thermodynamically favorable. It is also shown that the metallicity of the nanotube has no qualitative influence on its interaction with water. Our results experimentally prove the stronger affinity of water for the inner surface of CNT than for the outer one.</description>

      <title>Reentrant phase behavior in binary topological flocks with nonreciprocal alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a binary metric-free Vicsek model involving two species of self-propelled particles aligning with their Voronoi neighbors, focusing on a weakly nonreciprocal regime, where species $A$ aligns with both $A$ and $B$, but species $B$ does not align with either. Using agent-based simulations, we find that even with a small fraction of $B$ particles, the phase behavior of the system can be changed qualitatively, which becomes reentrant as a function of noise strength: traveling bands arise not only near the flocking transition, but also in the low-noise regime, separated in the phase diagram by a homogeneous polar liquid regime. We find that the ordered bands in the low-noise regime travel through an ordered background, in contrast to their metric counterparts. We develop a coarse-grained field theory, which can account for the reentrant phase behavior qualitatively, provided the higher-order angular modes are taken into consideration.</description>

      <title>Directional Swimming of B. Subtilis Bacteria Near a Switchable Polar Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of swimming bacteria depend on the properties of their habitat media. Recently it was shown that the motion of swimming bacteria dispersed directly in a non-toxic water-based lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal can be controlled by the director field of the liquid crystal. Here we investigate whether the macroscopic polar order of a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal (NF) can be recognized by bacteria B. Subtilis swimming in a water dispersion adjacent to a glassy NF film by surface interactions alone. We show that B. Subtilis tends to move in the direction antiparallel to the spontaneous electric polarization at the NF surface. Their speed was found to be the same with or without a polar NF layer. In contrast to observation on crystal ferroelectric films, the bacteria do not get immobilized. These observations may offer a pathway to creation of polar microinserts to direct bacterial motion in-vivo.</description>

      <title>How glass breaks -- Damage explains the difference between surface and fracture energies in amorphous silica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The difference between free surface energy and fracture toughness in amorphous silica is studied via multi-scale simulations. We combine the homogenization of a molecular dynamics fracture model with a phase-field approach to track and quantify the various energy contributions. We clearly separate free surface energy localized as potential energy on the surface and damage diffusion over a ca. 20 \r{A} range around the crack path. The plastic contribution is negligible. These findings, which clarify brittle fracture mechanisms in amorphous materials, align with toughness measurements in silica.</description>

      <title>Coalescence of viscoelastic drops on a solid substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigated the coalescence of polymer solution drops on the solid substrates. When two drops meet at their contact line on a substrate, the liquid bridge connecting the two drops increases in size with time. The height and radius of the liquid bridge have a power law dependence on time. In the early stage of drop coalescence, the exponents $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of the power law are influenced by the properties of the polymer solution. We argued that the balance between capillarity and viscoelasticity controls the process, where viscoelasticity must be considered in its full time and shear-rate dependency. As a simple proxy for the processes involved, the ratio of the polymer relaxation time to the viscous time of the drop, the elastocapillary ($Ec$), is instructive. In the vicinity of $Ec= 1$ the exponents showed a minimum and increased to lower and higher values of $Ec$. A similar dependency is observed for the damping timescales of the capillary waves. For high elastocapillary numbers, i.e. high polymer relaxation time, drop coalescence on short timescales behaved as in the low viscosity case. In addition, the bridge profile is influenced by a combination of factors including surface tension, viscosity and polymer stress. In summary, we have shown that drop coalescence is strongly influenced by the viscoelasticity of the drops.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics, structure and dynamics of cylindrically confined hard spheres: The role of excess helical twist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hard spheres confined to narrow quasi-one-dimensional cylindrical channels form perfect helical structures at close packing. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulation to show that the thermodynamics, structure and dynamics of the fluid below close packing are dominated by the presence of topological defects that reverse the local twist direction of the helix. When compressed from a random, low density state, or decompressed from high density ordered states with zero excess helical twist, the system equilibrates to an achiral fluid that exhibits two heat capacity maxima along the equation of state. The low density heat capacity maximum corresponds to the onset of helix formation and the high density maximum occurs when the system rapidly loses defects in a Schottky-like anomaly. The local twist auto-correlation function in the achiral fluid exhibits a stretched exponential decay and the structural relaxation times undergo a fragile-to-strong crossover located at the high density heat capacity maximum. We also study the effect of excess helical twist by using initial starting configurations consisting of two helical domains with opposite twist directions of different lengths. This leads to the formation of topologically protected states that are characterized by the presence of loosely bound defect pairs which become more tightly bound with increasing excess helical twist. The local twist auto-correlation function in the chiral fluid decays as a power law at long times. The possible kinetic or thermodynamic origin of this topological protection is discussed.</description>

      <title>Generalizing multiple memories from a single drive: The hysteron latch</title>

Abstract: Far-from-equilibrium systems can form memories of previous deformations or driving. In systems from sheared glassy materials to buckling beams to crumpled sheets, this behavior is dominated by return-point memory, in which revisiting a past extremum of driving restores the system to a previous state. Cyclic driving with both positive and negative strains forms multiple nested memories -- as in a single-dial combination lock -- while asymmetric driving (only positive strain) cannot. We study this case in a general model of hysteresis that considers discrete elements called hysterons. We show how two hysterons with a frustrated interaction can violate return-point memory, realizing multiple memories of asymmetric driving. This reveals a general principle for designing systems that store sequences of cyclic driving, whether symmetric or asymmetric. In disordered systems, asymmetric driving is a sensitive tool for the direct measurement of frustration.</description>

      <title>Vertex model with internal dissipation enables sustained flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex tissue flows in epithelia are driven by intra- and inter-cellular processes that generate, maintain, and coordinate mechanical forces. There has been growing evidence that cell shape anisotropy, manifested as nematic order, plays an important role in this process. Here we extend an active nematic vertex model by replacing substrate friction with internal viscous dissipation, dominant in epithelia not supported by a substrate or the extracellular matrix, which are found in many early-stage embryos. When coupled to cell shape anisotropy, the internal viscous dissipation allows for long-range velocity correlations and thus enables the spontaneous emergence of flows with a large degree of spatiotemporal organisation. We demonstrate sustained flow in epithelial sheets confined to a channel, providing a link between the cell-level vertex model of tissue dynamics and continuum active nematics, whose behaviour in a channel is theoretically understood and experimentally realisable. Our findings also show a simple mechanism that could account for collective cell migration correlated over distances large compared to the cell size, as observed during morphogenesis.</description>

      <title>Instability cascades in crumpling mylar sheets follow a log-Poisson statistic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The process of aging following a hard quench into a glassy state is characterized universally, for a wide class of materials, by logarithmic evolution of state variables and a power-law decay of two-time correlation functions that collapse only for the ratio of those times. This stands in stark contrast with relaxation in equilibrium materials, where time-translational invariance holds. It is by now widely recognized that these aging processes, which ever so slowly relax a complex disordered material after a quench, are facilitated by activated events. Yet, theories often cited to describe such a non-equilibrium process can be shown to miss pertinent aspects that are inherent to many experiments. A case in point are recent experiments on crumpling sheets of mylar loaded by a weight whose acoustic emissions are measured while the material buckles. Analyzing those local avalanches shows that crumpling is a log-Poisson process activated by increasingly rare record-sized fluctuations in a slowly stiffening material. Crumpling thus adds to a range of glassy materials exhibiting the log-Poisson property, which can be used to discriminate between theories.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the granular temperatures in force-free granular gases under exponential resetting. When a resetting event occurs, the granular temperature attains its initial value, whereas it decreases because of the inelastic collisions between the resetting events. We develop a theory and perform computer simulations for granular gas cooling in the presence of Poissonian resetting events. We also investigate the probability density function to quantify the distribution of granular temperatures. Our theory may help us to understand the behavior of nonperiodically driven granular systems.</description>

      <title>Half-integer Topological Defects Paired via String Micelles in Polar Liquids</title>

Abstract: Ferroelectric nematic (NF) liquid crystals present a compelling platform for exploring topological defects in polar fields, while their structural properties can be significantly altered by ionic doping. In this study, we demonstrate that doping the ferroelectric nematic material RM734 with cationic polymers enable the formation of polymeric micelles that connect pairs of half-integer topological defects. Polarizing optical microscopy reveals that these string defects exhibit butterfly textures, featured with a two-dimensional polarization field divided by N\'eel-type kink-walls into domains exhibiting either uniform polarization or negative splay and bend deformations. Through analysis of electrophoretic motion and direct measurements of polarization divergences, we show that the string micelles are positively charged and their side regions exhibit positive bound charges. To elucidate these observations, we propose a charge double layer model for the string defects: the positive charged cationic polymer chains and densely packed RM734 molecules form a Stern charge layer, while small anionic ions and positive bound charges constitute the charge diffusion layer. Notably, our experiments indicate that only cationic polymer doping effectively induces the formation of these unique string defects. These findings enhance our understanding of ionic doping effects and provide valuable insights for engineering polar topologies in liquid crystal systems.</description>

      <title>Designing precise dynamical steady states in disordered networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elastic structures can be designed to exhibit precise, complex, and exotic functions. While recent work has focused on the quasistatic limit governed by force balance, the mechanics at a finite driving rate are governed by Newton's equations. The goal of this work is to study the feasibility, constraints, and implications of creating disordered structures with exotic properties in the dynamic regime. The dynamical regime offers responses that cannot be realized in quasistatics, such as responses at an arbitrary phase, frequency-selective responses, and history-dependent responses. We employ backpropagation through time and gradient descent to design spatially specific steady states in disordered spring networks. We find that a broad range of steady states can be achieved with small alterations to the structure, operating both at small and large amplitudes. We study the effect of varying the damping, which interpolates between the underdamped and the overdamped regime, as well as the amplitude, frequency, and phase. We show that convergence depends on several competing effects, including chaos, large relaxation times, a gradient bias due to finite time simulations, and strong attenuation. By studying the eigenmodes of the linearized system, we show that the systems adapt very specifically to the task they were trained to perform. Our work demonstrates that within physical bounds, a broad array of exotic behaviors in the dynamic regime can be obtained, allowing for a richer range of possible applications.</description>

      <title>Active Polymer Behavior in Two Dimensions: A Comparative Analysis of Tangential and Push-Pull Models</title>

Abstract: In this work, we compare the structural and dynamic behavior of active filaments in two dimensions using tangential and push-pull models, including a variant with passive end monomers. These models serve as valuable frameworks for understanding self-organization in biological polymers and synthetic materials. At low activity, all models exhibit similar behaviors. Differences emerge in the intermediate range as activity increases, though at higher activity levels, their behaviors converge. Importantly, adjusting for differences in mean active force reveals nearly identical behavior across models. Our results highlight the importance of force definitions in active polymer simulations and provide insights into phase transitions across varying filament configurations.</description>

      <title>Role of Wettability, Adhesion, and Instabilities in Transitions During Lubricated Sliding Friction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lubricated contacts in soft materials are important in various engineering systems and natural settings. Three major lubrication regimes are boundary (BL), mixed (ML), and elasto-hydrodynamic (EHL) lubrication, where the contact region is dry, partially wetted, or fully wetted, respectively. The transition between these regimes is insufficiently understood, especially for soft contacts, which impedes desired control of lubricated sliding friction. Here, we report on the role of solid wettability and adhesion on these transitions. Wettability of glycerol on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surface, and adhesion between a glass indenter and PDMS, were varied by exposure of the PDMS to an ultraviolet light-ozone (UV-Ozone) cleaner. By combining friction tests and visualization, we demonstrate that the transition from ML to BL regime is dominated by the wettability of the lubricant; increasing wettability of glycerol makes removal of liquid from the contact region more difficult. Transition from EHL to ML is related to a series of events with increasing normal load, which are thinning of the lubricant layer, sudden jump to contact between the glass indenter and solid substrate across a gap of tens to a few hundreds of nanometers, and attendant elastic instabilities such as wrinkling and stick-slip. These results provide a deeper understanding of transitions in lubricated frictional behavior of soft materials which govern the maximum and minimum friction achievable.</description>

Abstract: We measure the dynamical behavior of colloidal singlets and dumbbells on an inclined magnetic moir\'e pattern, subject to a precessing external homogeneous magnetic field. At low external field strength single colloidal particles and dumbbells move everywhere on the pattern: At stronger external field strengths colloidal singlets and dumbbells are localized in generic locations. There are however nongeneric locations of flat channels that cross the moir\'e Wigner Seitz cell. In the flat channels we find gravitational driven translational and non-translational dynamic phase behavior of the colloidal singlets and dumbbells depending on the external field strength and the precession angle of the external homogeneous magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Diffusive oscillators capture the pulsating states of deformable particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a model of diffusive oscillators whose internal states are subject to a periodic drive. These models are inspired by the dynamics of deformable particles with pulsating sizes, where repulsion leads to arrest the internal pulsation at high density. We reveal that, despite the absence of any repulsion between the diffusive oscillators, our model still captures the emergence of dynamical arrest. We demonstrate that arrest here stems from the discrete nature of internal states which enforces an effective energy landscape analogous to that of deformable particles. Moreover, we show that the competition between arrest and synchronisation promotes spiral waves reminiscent of the pulsating states of deformable particles. Using analytical coarse-graining, we derive and compare the collective dynamics of diffusive oscillators with that of deformable particles. This comparison leads to rationalize the emergence of spirals in terms of a rotational invariance at the coarse-grained level, and to elucidate the role of hydrodynamic fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The motility of eukaryotic cells is strongly influenced by their environment, with confined cells often developing qualitatively different motility patterns from those migrating on simple two-dimensional substrates. Recent experiments, coupled with data-driven methods to extract a cell's equation of motion, showed that cancerous MDA-MB-231 cells persistently hop in a limit cycle when placed on two-state adhesive micropatterns (two large squares connected by a narrow bridge), while they remain stationary on average in rectangular confinements. In contrast, healthy MCF10A cells migrating on the two-state micropattern are bistable, i.e., they settle into either basin on average with only noise-induced hops between the two states. We can capture all these behaviors with a single computational phase field model of a crawling cell, under the assumption that contact with non-adhesive substrate inhibits the cell front. Our model predicts that larger and softer cells are more likely to persistently hop, while smaller and stiffer cells are more likely to be bistable. Other key factors controlling cell migration are the frequency of protrusions and their magnitude of noise. Our results show that relatively simple assumptions about how cells sense their geometry can explain a wide variety of different cell behaviors, and show the power of data-driven approaches to characterize both experiment and simulation.</description>

Abstract: Transport theory describes the response of a macroscopic current to a thermodynamic force, thus producing entropy and apparently violating time-reversal symmetry. In this note I report a pedagogical derivation of the Green-Kubo formula for transport coefficients that highlights the intrinsically dynamical nature of this formula and showcases the relation between the apparent breach of time-reversal symmetry and the non-commutativity of the low-frequency / low-wavevector limits of the conserved-density susceptibilities, from which the formula can be established.</description>
