      <title>The Economics of Equilibrium with Indivisible Goods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a theory of competitive equilibrium with indivisible goods based entirely on economic conditions on demand. The key idea is to analyze complementarity and substitutability between bundles of goods, rather than merely between goods themselves. This approach allows us to formulate sufficient, and essentially necessary, conditions for equilibrium existence, which unify settings with complements and settings with substitutes. Our analysis has implications for auction design.</description>

      <title>Approximate Revenue from Finite Range Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an economic environment where a seller wants to sell an indivisible unit of good to a buyer. We show that revenue from any strategy-proof and individually rational mechanism defined on closed intervals of rich single crossing domains considered in \citep{Goswami1}, can be approximated by the revenue from a sequence of strategy-proof and individually rational mechanisms with finite range. Thus while studying optimal mechanisms without loss of generality we can study mechanisms with finite range.</description>

      <title>On the Robustness of Second-Price Auctions in Prior-Independent Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.10478v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical Bayesian mechanism design relies on the common prior assumption, but such prior is often not available in practice. We study the design of prior-independent mechanisms that relax this assumption: the seller is selling an indivisible item to $n$ buyers such that the buyers' valuations are drawn from a joint distribution that is unknown to both the buyers and the seller; buyers do not need to form beliefs about competitors, and the seller assumes the distribution is adversarially chosen from a specified class. We measure performance through the worst-case regret, or the difference between the expected revenue achievable with perfect knowledge of buyers' valuations and the actual mechanism revenue.
  We study a broad set of classes of valuation distributions that capture a wide spectrum of possible dependencies: independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) distributions, mixtures of i.i.d. distributions, affiliated and exchangeable distributions, exchangeable distributions, and all joint distributions. We derive in quasi closed form the minimax values and the associated optimal mechanism. In particular, we show that the first three classes admit the same minimax regret value, which is decreasing with the number of competitors, while the last two have the same minimax regret equal to that of the single buyer case. Furthermore, we show that the minimax optimal mechanisms have a simple form across all settings: a second-price auction with random reserve prices, which shows its robustness in prior-independent mechanism design. En route to our results, we also develop a principled methodology to determine the form of the optimal mechanism and worst-case distribution via first-order conditions that should be of independent interest in other minimax problems.</description>

      <title>Optimistic and pessimistic approaches for cooperative games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperative game theory studies how to allocate the joint value generated by a set of players. These games are typically analyzed using the characteristic function form with transferable utility, which represents the value attainable by each coalition. In the presence of externalities, coalition values can be defined through various approaches, notably by trying to determine the best and worst-case scenarios. Typically, the optimistic and pessimistic perspectives offer valuable insights into strategic interactions. In many applications, these approaches correspond to the coalition either choosing first or choosing after the complement coalition. In a general framework in which the actions of a group affects the set of feasible actions for others, we explore this relationship and show that it always holds in the presence of negative externalities, but only partly with positive externalities. We then show that if choosing first/last corresponds to these extreme values, we also obtain a useful inclusion result: allocations that do not allocate more than the optimistic upper bounds also do not allocate less than the pessimistic lower bounds. Moreover, we show that when externalities are negative, it is always possible to guarantee the non-emptiness of these sets of allocations. Finally, we explore applications to illustrate how our findings provide new results and offer a means to derive results from the existing literature.</description>

      <title>On the robustness of posterior means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a normal location model $X \mid \theta \sim N(\theta, \sigma^2)$ with known $\sigma^2$. Suppose $\theta \sim G_0$, where the prior $G_0$ has zero mean and variance bounded by $V$. Let $G_1$ be a possibly misspecified prior with zero mean and variance bounded by $V$. We show that the squared error Bayes risk of the posterior mean under $G_1$ is bounded, subjected to an additional tail condition on $G_1$, uniformly over $G_0, G_1, \sigma^2 &gt; 0$.</description>
