      <title>Local texture of three-stage CVD SiC fibre by precession electron diffraction (PED) and XRD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SiC fibre with the transverse isotropic properties is very important to it reinforced metal matrix composites. In this paper, local texture of the CVD SiC fibre was investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and precession electron diffraction (PED) on transmission electron microscopy(TEM). The result from XRD is in agreement with the result obtained from PED. And the result shown that at the first stage of deposition, the preferred direction of SiC grains is almost random and the distribution of grain size is scattered. At the second and third stages of deposition, there are two kinds of texture in SiC fibre, that is, (110),111. and (110),115.. Furthermore, the grain size at the second and third stages is about 200 nm and it is lower at the third stage than at the second stage because of the lower temperature at the third stage. The [110] preferred direction along axial direction for SiC fibre is beneficial to the axial tensile strength.</description>

      <title>Exploiting solute segregation and partitioning to the deformation-induced planar defects and nano-martensite in designing ultra-strong Co-Ni base alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-phase, multi-elements (three or more) with high concentrations show exceptional tensile strength up to ~ 0.8-1.2 GPa. However, they possess a very low 0.2% yield strength (YS), i.e., they can be permanently deformed at very low-stress levels of 300 to 600 MPa. Here, we reveal by exploiting atomic-scale solute interactions with the deformation-induced structures to design ultra-strong single-phase alloys with YS &gt; 2 GPa. This was achieved by controlled thermomechanical processing that introduces stacking-faults (SFs), nano-twins (NTs), and nano-martensite {\epsilon}-laths (NMLs) during cold deformation followed by facilitating solute segregation/partitioning to them by tempering at intermediate temperature. We demonstrate the phenomena in a low stacking faulty energy multi-component (face-centered-cubic, fcc structured) Co-33Ni-24Cr alloy (all in at.%) containing 5at.% Mo as a solute. It is also shown that the degree of strengthening after tempering scales up with the fraction of these structures (before tempering) in the alloy microstructure that can be tuned by the amount and temperature of cold deformation. Cold-rolling with 45% and 65% thickness reduction, followed by tempering at 600{\deg}C for 4 hours, led to an YS of 1.5 GPa and 2 GPa with elongation to fracture (%El) 14% and 7%, respectively. The YS is further enhanced to ~ 2.2 GPa without reduction in %El upon cryo-rolling followed by tempering. The alloy microstructure is stable at 600{\deg}C up to 100 hours and also retains an YS of ~ 1.5 GPa with %El of 18% during tensile test at 600{\deg}C. The derived high YS and high-temperature stability are critically a consequence of solute partitioning to the NMLs that we termed as Solute-Partitioned NMLs (SP-NMLs) in the microstructure.</description>

      <title>Modelling hydrogen storage in metal hydrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a one-dimensional mathematical model for the loading process of hydrogen in a metal hydride tank. The model describes the evolution of the density and pressure of the hydrogen gas, the temperature of the tank, the averaged velocity of the gas through the porous metal structure, and the transformed fraction of metal into a metal hydride. The non-dimensionalisation of the model indicates a possible reduction of the system of equations and also shows that the density and the transformed metal fraction may be decoupled from the temperature equation. The reduced model is solved numerically. Introducing a spatial dependence into the kinetic reaction constant allows to explain unexpected temperature gradients observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>How transparent is graphene? A surface science perspective on remote epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote epitaxy is the synthesis of a single crystalline film on a graphene-covered substrate, where the film adopts epitaxial registry to the substrate as if the graphene is transparent. Despite many exciting applications for flexible electronics, strain engineering, and heterogeneous integration, an understanding of the fundamental synthesis mechanisms remains elusive. Here we offer a perspective on the synthesis mechanisms, focusing on the foundational assumption of graphene transparency. We highlight challenges for quantifying the strength of the remote substrate potential that permeates through graphene, and propose Fourier and beating analysis as a bias-free method for decomposing the lattice potential contributions from the substrate, from graphene, and from surface reconstructions, each at different frequencies. We highlight the importance of graphene-induced reconstructions on epitaxial templating, drawing comparison to moir\'e epitaxy. Finally, we highlight the role of the remote potential in tuning surface diffusion and adatom kinetics on graphene. Tuning the surface diffusion length is crucial in navigating the competition between remote epitaxy and defect-seeded mechanisms like pinhole epitaxy.</description>

      <title>Understanding the fill-factor limit of organic solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the power conversion efficiencies of organic solar cells (OSCs) have surpassed 20%, they still lag behind commercial inorganic solar cells and emerging perovskite solar cells. To bridge this efficiency gap, improving the fill factor (FF) is critical, provided other photovoltaic parameters are not compromised. However, the fundamental understanding of the FF in OSCs remains incomplete. In this work, we systematically investigate a wide range of OSCs with the FF values spanning 0.27 to 0.80, and analyse the effect of free charge generation and recombination on the FF in OSCs. To explain our observations, we developed an analytical model that quantitatively correlates the applied electric field with the energetics of excited states in donor-acceptor blends. By combining device characterisation, spectroscopy, and theoretical modelling, we reveal that the Stark effect and the field-dependent charge transfer significantly impact the FF in state-of-the-art OSCs with low voltage losses. Our findings highlight that suppressing geminate decay by increasing exciton lifetime is a promising strategy for boosting the FF and achieving future efficiency gains in OSCs.</description>

      <title>Steinberg-Guinan strength model for rhenium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhenium, Re, is used as an x-ray shield in laser-driven material property experiments, where its strength at high pressures can be a consideration in the design, modeling, and interpretation. We present a Steinberg-Guinan (SG) strength model for Re, tailored for use in high-pressure dynamic loading simulations. Parameters for the SG model were derived from recent atom-in-jellium predictions of the shear modulus under compression and experimental data on work-hardening from rolled-bar studies. The ambient shear modulus was fixed to the measured value, and the pressure-hardening parameter was fitted to the atom-in-jellium predictions up to 1 TPa. The shear modulus model was still a reasonable fit beyond 25 TPa. Thermal softening was estimated from the thermal expansivity and bulk modulus. Work-hardening parameters were extracted by fitting the model to Knoop microhardness measurements under known plastic strains. The resulting model captures the observed hardening behavior but predicts significantly lower flow stresses at high pressures than diamond anvil cell observations suggest, implying that Re may exhibit enhanced strength at megabar pressures. These results provide a basis for improved modeling of strength in Re under extreme conditions and suggest directions for further theoretical and experimental investigation.</description>

      <title>Strain effects on the fluctuation properties in noncollinear antiferromagnets: a first-principles and macrospin-based study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of epitaxial strain effects on the magnetic fluctuation properties of Mn$_3$Sn noncollinear antiferromagnets. Employing density functional theory (DFT), we uncover significant strain-induced modifications to key magnetic parameters, including magnetic anisotropy and both bilinear and biquadratic exchange interactions. Our findings reveal that the biquadratic exchange, often neglected, plays a crucial role in defining the magnetic energy landscape and its response to strain. These microscopic changes directly impact the energy barriers governing magnetic switching, thereby influencing thermal stability and fluctuation rates. Using macrospin-based simulations based on DFT-derived parameters, we provide a quantitative analysis of the macroscopic magnetic fluctuations influenced by these microscopic interactions. These insights are particularly relevant for applications requiring precisely controlled magnetic behavior, such as hardware for probabilistic computing.</description>

      <title>Bulk Nanostructured Zirconia Ceramics with High Hardness and Toughness via Integration of High-Pressure Torsion and Spark Plasma Sintering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing nanostructured bulk ceramics is a major challenge when conventional high-temperature sintering is employed for consolidation. In the current investigation, yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) with a composition of ZrO2 - 3 mol% Y2O3 is first treated using high-pressure torsion (HPT) and further consolidated using spark plasma sintering (SPS) to produce a nanostructured bulk sample. The material demonstrates phase transformations from tetragonal to dislocation-decorated monoclinic by HPT and reversely transforms to the tetragonal phase after the SPS process while maintaining a mean grain size of 80 nm and large numbers of dislocations. The consolidated ceramic exhibits a density of 6.07 g/cm3 (99% relative density) with a high hardness of 1500 Hv, which is reasonably consistent with the prediction of the Hall-Petch relationship. Examination of the indented areas during the hardness test confirms the absence of cracks, indicating good fracture toughness (KIC) because of the presence of dislocations, while the sample processed only by SPS and without HPT processing forms numerous cracks by indentation and exhibits low KIC.</description>

      <title>Magnetoresistance in the Extreme Quantum Limit: Field-Induced Crossover to the Unitarity Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate magnetoresistance (MR) in the extreme quantum limit (EQL), where the kinetic energy becomes significantly smaller than the cyclotron energy, using the Kubo formula with Green's functions and the $T$-matrix approximation. We uncover a magnetic-field-induced crossover in the scattering rate: $1/\tau \propto B^2$ in the Born regime and $1/\tau \propto B^{-2}$ in the unitarity limit. This crossover gives rise to distinct MR behaviors in the EQL, characterized by linear transverse MR ($\rho_{xx} \propto B$) and negative longitudinal MR ($\rho_{zz} \propto B^{-2}$). This dichotomy implies insulating behavior when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the current, and metallic behavior when it is parallel. In the unitarity limit, we further derive a universal relation that enables direct experimental determination of the impurity density from $\rho_{xx}$ and $\rho_{xy}$. Our results establish a quantum--classical correspondence that remains valid even in the EQL, provided that the field dependences of the scattering rate and quantum corrections are properly incorporated.</description>

      <title>In-Plane Magnetic Anisotropy and Large topological Hall Effect in Self-Intercalated Ferromagnet Cr1.61Te2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-intercalated chromium tellurides Cr1+xTe2 have garnered growing attention due to their high-temperature ferromagnetism, tunable spin structures and air stability, all of which are vital for versatile applications in next-generation memory and information technology. Here, we report strong magnetic anisotropy and a large topological Hall effect (THE) in self-intercalated Cr1.61Te2 single crystals, which are both highly desirable properties for future spintronic applications. Our results demonstrate that Cr1.61Te2 is a soft ferromagnet with strong in-plane magnetic anisotropy. Remarkably, distinct THE behaviors are observed in different temperature regimes, reflecting the intricate spin structures and competing exchange interactions. More interestingly, a large topological Hall resistivity, induced by microscopic non-coplanar spin structures, emerges in the temperature range 70-240 K, reaching a maximum value of 0.93 {\mu}{\Omega} cm at 150 K. Moreover, a sign-reversed and weak THE is observed at low temperatures below ~70 K, indicating the emergence of an additional topological spin structure with opposite topological charges. This work not only offers valuable insights into the correlation between magnetocrystalline anisotropy and topological phenomena in Cr1+xTe2 systems, but also provides a robust platform for engineering the evolution of complex spin textures that can be leveraged in diverse spintronic device applications.</description>

      <title>Phase Competition and Rutile Phase Stabilization of Growing GeO2 Films by MOCVD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rutile germanium dioxide (r-GeO2) is an ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor with potential for ambipolar doping, making it a promising candidate for next-generation power electronics and optoelectronics. Growth of phase-pure r-GeO2 films by vapor phase techniques like metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) is challenging because of polymorphic competition from amorphous and quartz GeO2. Here, we introduce seed-driven stepwise crystallization (SDSC) as a segmented growth strategy for obtaining r-GeO2 films on r-TiO2 (001) substrate. SDSC divides the growth into repeated cycles of film deposition and cooling-heating ramps, which suppress the non-rutile phases. We discuss the underlying mechanisms of phase selection during SDSC growth. We demonstrate continuous, phase-pure, partially epitaxial r-GeO2 (001) films exhibiting x-ray rocking curves with a FWHM of 597 arcsec. SDSC-based growth provides a generalizable pathway for selective vapor-phase growth of metastable or unstable phases, offering new opportunities for phase-selective thin-film engineering.</description>

      <title>Spray flame synthesis of Y2O3-MgO nanoparticles for mid-infrared transparent nanocomposite ceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spray flame synthesis offers a promising method for scalable production of homogeneously mixed Y2O3-MgO nanopowders as next-generation infrared-transparent window material, which has attracted significant attention owing to its excellent optical properties at high temperatures. However, systematic understanding of how flame synthesis parameters influence particle morphology, crystal phase, solid solubility, and subsequent ceramic performance remains insufficiently understood. In this study, we investigated the influence of precursor chemistry on particle crystal phase and examined the solid solubility of MgO in Y2O3 under different flame temperatures, demonstrating that the high-temperature conditions with O2 as dispersion gas allow up to 50 mol% MgO to fully dissolve into Y2O3, far exceeding the equilibrium solubility limit of 7 mol% at the eutectic temperature (2100{\deg}C) and near-zero at room temperature. Furthermore, we systematically evaluated how powder characteristics and sintering parameters-including powder deagglomeration methods, vacuum sintering temperature, hot isostatic pressing (HIP) temperature, and initial powder characteristics-affect ceramic microstructures and infrared transmittance. Despite cracking induced by phase transformation and finer particle sizes, ceramics fabricated from oxygen-synthesized monoclinic-dominated powders exhibited superior near-infrared transmittance (56.2% at 1550 nm), attributed to enhanced atomic mixing and effective grain boundary pinning. After optimization, pure cubic phase powders produced intact and crack-free ceramics with outstanding mid-infrared transparency, achieving a maximum transmittance of 84.6% and an average transmittance of 82.3% in 3-5 um range.</description>

      <title>Unconventional spin texture driven by higher-order spin-orbit interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin splitting and the resulting spin texture are central to emerging spintronic applications. In non-centrosymmetric non-magnetic materials containing heavy elements, spin textures are typically governed by low-order, momentum-dependent spin-orbit interactions, such as Rashba spin-orbit interaction with linear or cubic order in crystal momentum. In this work, we use \textit{ab initio} calculations to reveal a previously unidentified spin texture in the conduction bands of a prototypical ferroelectric nitride LaWN$_3$. In addition to the usual $\Gamma$-centered vortex, we find six new vortices and anti-vortices located at non-high-symmetry points near the Brillouin zone center. Furthermore, by combining group-theoretical analysis and $\textbf{k}\cdot\textbf{p}$ perturbation modeling, we show that, constrained by the $C_{3v}$ point group to which ferroelectric LaWN$_3$ belongs, a 7th-order Weyl spin-orbit interaction is essential to reproduce the unconventional spin structure observed in first-principles calculations. We also find that weak electron doping of LaWN$_3$ leads to a Fermi surface whose spin-arrow contour exhibits an unusual epicycloid pattern--a distinctive signature that is experimentally accessible. Our work demonstrates that higher-order spin-orbit interactions are more than perturbative corrections. They can play a dominant role in shaping the spin texture of non-centrosymmetric materials. Our results open up new avenues for designing spintronic devices that exploit multi-chiral spin textures beyond the conventional spin-orbit paradigm.</description>

      <title>Influence of Built-in Electric Fields on the Optoelectronic and Catalytic Properties of Two-Dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of modern materials science and advanced electronics, ferroelectric materials have emerged as a subject of great intrigue and significance, chiefly due to their remarkable property of reversible spontaneous polarization. This unique characteristic is not just an interesting physical phenomenon; it plays a pivotal role in revolutionizing multiple technological applications, especially in the domains of high-density data storage and the pursuit of fast device operation. In the past few decades, there has been a significant increase in the number of investigations and commercial applications proposed for ferroelectric materials. With the continuous miniaturization of electronic devices and the rapid development of two-dimensional (2D) materials, considerable efforts have been made towards exploring ferroelectricity in 2D materials, driven by the potential for revolutionary advancements in energy storage, data processing, and other emerging technologies. This exploration is fueled by the realization that 2D ferroelectric materials could offer unique properties such as high energy density, fast switching speeds, and scalability, which are crucial for the next generation of electronic devices. The out-of-plane (OOP) ferroelectricity exhibited by these 2D materials is generally more advantageous than the in-plane ferroelectricity, primarily because the vertical polarizability aligns more seamlessly with the requirements of most practical technological applications</description>

      <title>Enhancing interfacial thermal conductance in Si/Diamond heterostructures by phonon bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the mechanism of enhancing interfacial thermal transport performance in Silicon/Diamond (Si/Diamond) heterostructures using the phonon bridge. A heat transfer model for three-layer heterostructures is developed by combining First-principles calculations with the Monte Carlo method. The temperature distribution, spectral heat conductance, and interfacial thermal conductance are compared for Si/Diamond heterostructures with and without a silicon carbide (SiC) interlayer. The results show that the SiC interlayer effectively bridges low-frequency phonons in Si with mid-to-high-frequency phonons in Diamond, which forms a specific phonon bridge, significantly improving interfacial phonon transport. The influence of SiC interlayer thickness is further studied, revealing a size-dependent phonon bridge enhancement. For thin interlayers, intensified phonon boundary scattering weakens the bridging effect. Conversely, excessively thick interlayers increase the bulk thermal resistance, reducing overall interfacial thermal conductance. Thus, an optimal interlayer thickness exists, identified as 40 nm for SiC. Thirteen candidate interlayer materials, including SiC, AlN, {\alpha}-Si3N4, \b{eta}-Si3N4, and AlxGa1-xN (x ranges from 0.1 to 0.9), are compared at various thicknesses. SiC emerges as the most effective interlayer material, increasing interfacial thermal conductance by 46.6% compared to the bilayer heterostructure. AlN ranks second, improving thermal conductance by 21.9%. These findings provide essential insights into the phonon bridge mechanism at heterogeneous interface thermal transport and offer valuable theoretical guidance for designing heterostructures with enhanced thermal transport performance.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure of Bimetallic CoRu Catalysts Modulates SWCNT Nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nucleation of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) via chemical vapour deposition of methane on CoRu bimetallic nanoparticles is simulated using quantum chemical molecular dynamics. By varying the Ru loading in the catalyst, we show that Ru decreases catalytic efficiency; C-H bond activation is impeded, key reactive intermediate species become longer-lived on the catalyst surface, and longer carbon chains are stabilised through the earliest stages of SWCNT nucleation. Analysis of the CoRu nanoparticle structure during the CVD process shows that this influence of Ru is indirect, with the catalyst adopting Ru-Co core-shell or segregated structures throughout nucleation, and Co exclusively driving the catalytic decomposition of the methane precursor. We show that the influence of Ru occurs via the electronic structure of the catalyst itself, by lowering the Fermi level of the catalyst due to lower energy 4d/5s states, in a manner consistent with d-band theory.</description>

      <title>aLLoyM: A large language model for alloy phase diagram prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are general-purpose tools with wide-ranging applications, including in materials science. In this work, we introduce aLLoyM, a fine-tuned LLM specifically trained on alloy compositions, temperatures, and their corresponding phase information. To develop aLLoyM, we curated question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) pairs for binary and ternary phase diagrams using the open-source Computational Phase Diagram Database (CPDDB) and assessments based on CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams). We fine-tuned Mistral, an open-source pre-trained LLM, for two distinct Q&amp;A formats: multiple-choice and short-answer. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that fine-tuning substantially enhances performance on multiple-choice phase diagram questions. Moreover, the short-answer model of aLLoyM exhibits the ability to generate novel phase diagrams from its components alone, underscoring its potential to accelerate the discovery of previously unexplored materials systems. To promote further research and adoption, we have publicly released the short-answer fine-tuned version of aLLoyM, along with the complete benchmarking Q&amp;A dataset, on Hugging Face.</description>

      <title>Broadband ferromagnetic resonance in Ni-Mn-Ga single crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a broadband ferromagnetic resonance study in single crystalline Ni$_{50}$Mn$_{28.1}$Ga$_{21.9}$ in the temperature range from room temperature to 120 {\deg}C in which the transformation from martensite to austenite phase takes place. Our measurements demonstrate that a large change (an order of magnitude) in the magnetocrystalline anisotropy at the martensitic phase transformation results in a sharp change of the resonance magnetic field. In a single variant martensite phase, the resonance fields satisfy the Kittel's resonance condition for a thin film with the gyromagnetic factor g = 2.0. With the magnetic field parallel to the easy c-axis of the single variant martensite, the resonance is observed only for frequencies larger than 22 GHz. For the multivariant martensite case, the magnetic coupling between the twin variants can be taken into account for the satisfactory Kittel's fit. We observe a weak magnetocrystalline anisotropy in the austenite phase, just above the reverse martensite transformation, comparable to the previous reports based on different magnetic measurements.</description>

      <title>Inducing ferromagnetism by structural engineering in a strongly spin-orbit coupled oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic materials with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) are essential for the advancement of spin-orbitronic devices, as they enable efficient spin-charge conversion, complex magnetic structures, spin-valley physics, topological phases and other exotic phenomena. 5d transition-metal oxides such as SrIrO3 feature large SOC, but usually show paramagnetic behavior due to broad bands and a low density of states at the Fermi level, accompanied by a relatively low Coulomb repulsion. Here, we unveil ferromagnetism in 5d SrIrO3 thin films grown on SrTiO3 (111). Through substrate-induced structural engineering, a zigzag stacking of three-unit-cell thick layers along the [111] direction is achieved, stabilizing a ferromagnetic state at the interfaces. Magnetotransport measurements reveal an anomalous Hall effect below ~30 K and hysteresis in the Hall conductivity below 7 K, indicating ferromagnetic ordering. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism further supports these results. Theoretical analysis suggests that the structural engineering of the IrO6 octahedral network enhances the density of states at the Fermi level and thus stabilizes Stoner ferromagnetism. This work highlights the potential of structurally engineered 5d oxides for spin-orbitronic devices, where efficient control of SOC-induced magnetic phases by electric currents can lead to lower energy consumption and improved performance in next-generation device technologies.</description>

      <title>Wafer-scale Programmed Assembly of One-atom-thick Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystalline films offer various physical properties based on the modulation of their thicknesses and atomic structures. The layer-by-layer assembly of atomically thin crystals provides powerful means to arbitrarily design films at the atomic-level, which are unattainable with existing growth technologies. However, atomically-clean assembly of the materials with high scalability and reproducibility remains challenging. We report programmed crystal assembly (PCA) of graphene and monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (ML hBN), assisted by van der Waals interactions, to form wafer-scale films of pristine interfaces with near-unity yield. The atomic configurations of the films are tailored with layer-resolved compositions and in-plane crystalline orientations. We demonstrate batch-fabricated tunnel device arrays with modulation of the resistance over orders of magnitude by thickness-control of the hBN barrier with single-atom precision, and large-scale, twisted multilayer graphene with programmable electronic band structures and crystal symmetries. Our results constitute an important development in the artificial design of large-scale films.</description>

      <title>Cation Engineering of Cu-Doped CsPbI3: Lead Substitution and Dimensional Reduction for Improved Scintillation Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, inorganic halide perovskite nanocrystals show promising contributions in emerging luminescent materials due to their high tolerance to defects. In particular, the development of cesium lead iodide (CsPbI3) has shown its efficiency for light-harvesting properties. However, further implementation is hindered due to the toxicity of the lead content. Therefore, in this study, we introduced Cu atoms to partially substitute Pb atoms (5% Cu) in the CsPbI3 lattice as a solution to reduce Pb toxicity. A partial lead material is substituted using Cu displays a larger Stokes shift (-67 nm) compared to the pristine, and resulted doped CsPbI3 not undergo the undesired self absorption. An outcome is focused on the champion of fast-component (tau_1) decay time ~0.6 ns. Temperature-dependent radioluminescence outlines an incremental change in the emission intensity is marginally centered at 713 +- 16 nm, which indicates Cu-doped CsPbI3 is not greatly affected by temperature. In addition, we report that the light yield (LY) pristine CsPbI3 after doping is increased to 3.0 +- 0.8 photons/keV. Our work provides physical insights into a tunable scintillation property using transition metal doping toward lead-free based scintillating perovskites.</description>

      <title>Density-functional theory study of the interaction between NV$^{-}$ centers and native defects in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NV$^{-}$ color center in diamond has been demonstrated as a nanoscale sensor for quantum metrology. However, the properties that make it ideal for measuring, e.g., minute electric and magnetic fields also make it sensitive to imperfections in the diamond host. In this work, we quantify the impact of nearby native defects on the many-body states of NV$^{-}$. We combine previous quantum embedding results of strain and electric-field susceptibilities of NV$^{-}$ with density-functional theory calculations on native defects. The latter are used to parametrize continuum models in order to extrapolate the effects of native defects up to the micrometer scale. We show that under ideal measuring conditions, the optical properties of NV$^{-}$ are measurably affected by the strain caused by single carbon interstitials and vacancies up to 200 nm away; in contrast, the NV$^{-}$ is measurably affected by the electric field of such charged (neutral) native defects within a micron (100 nm). Finally, we show how measuring multiple individual NV$^{-}$ centers in the vicinity of a native defect can be used to determine the nature of the defect and its charge state.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically driven tilt grain boundaries of monolayer crystals using catalytic liquid alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a method to precisely control the atomic defects at grain boundaries (GBs) of monolayer MoS2 by vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth using sodium molybdate liquid alloys, which serve as growth catalysts to guide the formations of the thermodynamically most stable GB structure. The Mo-rich chemical environment of the alloys results in Mo-polar 5|7 defects with a yield exceeding 95%. The photoluminescence (PL) intensity of VLS-grown polycrystalline MoS2 films markedly exceeds that of the films exhibiting abundant S 5|7 defects, which are kinetically driven by vapor-solid-solid growths. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the enhanced PL intensity is due to the suppression of non-radiative recombination of charged excitons with donor-type defects of adsorbed Na elements on S 5|7 defects. Catalytic liquid alloys can aid in determining a type of atomic defect even in various polycrystalline 2D films, which accordingly provides a technical clue to engineer their properties.</description>

      <title>Coherence of dipole-forbidden Rydberg excitons in Cu$_2$O measured by polarization- and time-resolved multi-photon spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum applications of solid state systems base upon generation and control of coherent electronic excitations. Prominent examples are exciton states in semiconductors excitable by photons. The high oscillator strength of electric-dipole (ED) allowed exciton states favors their efficient coherent generation, but limits also their lifetime. ED-forbidden exciton states with long recombination times might maintain long-lived coherence, especially in highly-quality crystals with suppressed exciton scattering. Here, we propose a multi-photon technique combining two-photon excitation with difference frequency generation (2PE-DFG) for time-resolved measurements of exciton coherence. The technique utilizes polarization tomography for state-selective control in both the pump and probe processes. Its potential is demonstrated by measuring the coherent dynamics of the ED-forbidden $S$ and $D$ excitons in Cu$_2$O crystals. The excited states of the Rydberg excitons with principal quantum number $n=2$, $3$, and $4$ have short dephasing times of a few picoseconds, limited by their relaxation to lower lying states. The dephasing time reaches 3 ns for the $1S$ state. In an external magnetic field up to 10 T, the $1S$ exciton splits into a triplet so that quantum beats are observed after coherent excitation, for which three distinct regimes are found depending on the chosen polarization tomography scheme. These results establish the 2PE-DFG technique as a powerful tool to assess the coherent dynamics of ED-forbidden excitons.</description>

      <title>Phase-engineered Non-degenerate Sliding Ferroelectricity Enables Tunable Photovoltaics in Monolayer Janus In2S2Se</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional sliding ferroelectrics, with their enhanced efficiencies of charge separation and tunability, constitute promising platforms for next-generation photovoltaic devices. However, recent systems predominantly exhibit dual degenerate polarization states with weak intensity, hindering the optimal manipulations of photovoltaic effects through sliding ferroelectricity. Here, we address this limitation by introducing two strengthened and distinct non-degenerate sliding ferroelectric phases (WZ' and ZB') in Janus In2S2Se, which can be achieved by Se-to-S substitution in monolayer In2Se3. First-principles calculations validate the experimental synthesis of this structure and its capability for reversible phase transitions triggered by atomic layer sliding, and a series of superior photovoltaic performances are demonstrated in such unique Janus In2S2Se, accompanied by a detailed analysis of how non-degenerate sliding ferroelectricity modulates distinct photovoltaic characteristics. The WZ' to ZB' transition can increase the carrier mobility and moderate the band gap while inducing an indirect-to-direct transition, yielding a marked red-shift and enhancement of the photocurrent peak in the infrared spectrum. Conversely, the WZ' phase, benefiting from enhanced polarization, delivers superior photoelectric conversion efficiency in the visible light region. This work establishes a phase-engineered framework of how non-degenerate sliding ferroelectricity orchestrates distinct photovoltaic behaviors, and the intrinsic physical correlations may offer novel perspectives for designing and regulating innovative photovoltaic devices.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Pattern Quality on Measurements of Stress Heterogeneity and Geometrically Necessary Dislocation Density by High-Angular Resolution Electron Backscatter Diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the effect of pattern quality on the output of high-angular resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) analyses. Band contrast, as a proxy for pattern quality, was varied by adjusting the number of frames averaged per electron backscatter pattern during data collection. The same region in a deformed sample of the mineral olivine was mapped six times varying the number of frames averaged between 1 and 30 between each map. Each data set was analyzed with HR-EBSD, producing maps of intragranular stress heterogeneity and geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) density. As the number of frames averaged increased, the noise in stress and GND calculations decreased, revealing more substructure in the mapped region. The worst pixels, with low band contrast, are the most improved by increased frame averaging, whereas those with high band contrast are largely unaffected. Additionally, the probability distribution of stresses narrows as high-stress noise is reduced with increased pattern quality, which also affects estimates of dislocation density from statistical analysis of the stress distributions. As regions with high stress and/or high GND density are typically of interest in HR-EBSD maps and are often associated with low band contrast, frame averaging may be used as a tool to improve the quality of these analyses. Most importantly, however, is that comparisons are made between HR-EBSD datasets with similar mean band contrast to ensure that observed differences are microstructural in origin and not an artefact of data collection.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Biaxial Compressive Strain Tuning of 2D semiconductors via Hot Dry Transfer on Polymer Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain engineering is an effective tool for tailoring the properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials, especially for tuning quantum phenomena. Among the limited methods available for strain engineering under cryogenic conditions, thermal mismatch with polymeric substrates provides a simple and affordable strategy to induce biaxial compressive strain upon cooling. In this work, we demonstrate the transfer of unprecedentedly large levels of uniform biaxial compressive strain to single-layer WS$_2$ by employing a pre-straining approach prior to cryogenic cooling. Using a hot-dry-transfer method, single-layer WS$_2$ samples were deposited onto thermally expanded polymeric substrates at 100 $^\circ$C. As the substrate cools to room temperature, it contracts, inducing biaxial compressive strain (up to ~0.5%) in the WS$_2$ layer. This pre-strain results in a measurable blueshift in excitonic energies compared to samples transferred at room temperature, which serve as control (not pre-strained) samples. Subsequent cooling of the pre-strained samples from room temperature down to 5 K leads to a remarkable total blueshift of ~200 meV in the exciton energies of single-layer WS$_2$. This energy shift surpasses previously reported values, indicating superior levels of biaxial compressive strain induced by the accumulated substrate contraction of ~1.7%. Moreover, our findings reveal a pronounced temperature dependence in strain transfer efficiency, with gauge factors approaching theoretical limits for ideal strain transfer at 5 K. We attribute this enhanced efficiency to the increased Young's modulus of the polymeric substrate at cryogenic temperatures.</description>

      <title>High Entropy Engineering of Magnetic Kagome Lattice (Gd,Tb,Dy,Ho,Er)Mn6Sn6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic kagome lattice compound RMn6Sn6 (R=rare earth) is an emerging platform to exploit the interplay between magnetism and topological electronic states where a variety of exciting findings such as flat bands, Dirac points as well as the dramatic dependence of magnetic order on the rare-earth element have been reported. High entropy through rare earth alloying, on the other hand, provides another knob to control over the physical properties in this system. Here, by the marriage of high entropy and the magnetic kagome lattice, we obtain (Gd,Tb,Dy,Ho,Er)Mn6Sn6 single crystals and systematically investigate their magnetic and transport properties. Different from the parent phases, the high entropy 166 material displays multiple novel magnetic transitions induced by temperature and external magnetic fields. Furthermore, linear magnetoresistance persisting up to 20 T has been revealed at 4 K. The intrinsic nontrivial band topology also survives in the high entropy form, as evidenced by the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. Our results highlight high entropy as a powerful approach for tuning the interplay of charge, spin and lattice degree of freedom in magnetic topological materials.</description>

      <title>Revealing Nanoscale Ni-Oxidation State Variations in Single-Crystal NMC811 via 2D and 3D Spectro-Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabling lithium (Li)-ion batteries with higher energy densities, longer cycle life, and lower costs will underpin the widespread electrification of the transportation and large-scale energy storage industries. Nickel (Ni)-rich layered oxide cathodes, such as LiNi$_{x}$Mn$_{y}$Co$_{z}$O$_{2}$ (NMC, x &gt; 0.8), have gained popularity due to their high specific capacities and lower cobalt content. However, the standard polycrystalline morphology suffers from accelerated degradation at voltages above 4.2 V versus graphite, due to its increased mechanical and chemical instability. Single-crystal NMC (SC-NMC) has emerged as a promising morphology for suppressing the mechanical instability by preventing intergranular cracking; however, robust methods of understanding its chemical degradation pathways are required. We demonstrate how a high-throughput data collection strategy unlocks the ability to perform 2D and 3D ptychography in minutes, where it currently requires hours, and combine this with X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) to visualise the local Ni oxidation state behaviour in SC-NMC811, with nanometre-scale spatial resolution, and use this as a proxy for state-of-charge. By employing this technique at various stages during lifetime cycling to high voltages (&gt;4.2 V), direct mapping of chemical degradation along the Li channels, identification of nucleation sites, and observation of Ni oxidation state heterogeneities across both electrode and particle scales can be achieved. We further correlate these heterogeneities with the formation and growth of the rocksalt phase and oxygen-induced planar gliding. This methodology will advance the fundamental understanding of how high-Ni layered oxide materials chemically degrade during high-voltage operation, guiding the design of more durable battery materials.</description>

      <title>Biomimetic Engineering of a Fortified Ice Composite with Enhanced Mechanical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents BioPykrete, a new sustainable bio-composite material created from ice, nano-crystalline cellulose (CNC), and a tailor-made chimera protein designed to bind the two together. We developed and produced the chimera protein by linking AFPIII, an ice-binding protein, with CBM3a, a CNC-binding protein. As the suspension freezes, the CNC chains self-organize into a reinforcing network between the ice crystals. This structural enhancement limits crack propagation to typical pore sizes, allowing BioPykrete to avoid the brittle and sudden failure commonly associated with ice. Instead, it exhibits an elastic-like response to stress, making it suitable for construction and engineering applications. With compressive strength comparable with concrete, BioPykrete offers a sustainable and biodegradable alternative to construction materials suitable for the harsh arctic regions of the world where traditional methods are ineffective, and resources are scarce. Engineering chimera proteins with specific affinity to more than a single material type may help improve or tailor the properties of other composite materials.</description>

      <title>Phase-field modelling of cohesive fracture. Part III: From mathematical results to engineering application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concludes a three-part effort aimed at developing a consistent and unified framework for the phase-field modeling of cohesive fracture. Building on the theoretical foundations established in the first two parts, which included a $\Gamma$-convergence result for a broad class of phase-field energy functionals and the presentation of a rigorous analytical methodology for constructing models tailored to specific cohesive laws, this third paper explores the mechanical response of phase-field models, most of which are novel, associated with different cohesive fracture behaviors within a one-dimensional framework. Particular emphasis is placed on the possibility of formulating distinct phase-field models that, despite exhibiting different evolutions of their phase-field and displacement profiles, yield identical cohesive fracture responses. Thus, this work aims at providing a practical interpretation of the mathematical framework connecting the theoretical insights established in the previous parts for physical relevant applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-fidelity Bayesian Data-Driven Design of Energy Absorbing Spinodoid Cellular Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite element (FE) simulations of structures and materials are getting increasingly more accurate, but also more computationally expensive as a collateral result. This development happens in parallel with a growing demand of data-driven design. To reconcile the two, a robust and data-efficient optimization method called Bayesian optimization (BO) has been previously established as a technique to optimize expensive objective functions. In parallel, the mesh width of an FE model can be exploited to evaluate an objective at a lower or higher fidelity (cost &amp; accuracy) level. The multi-fidelity setting applied to BO, called multi-fidelity BO (MFBO), has also seen previous success. However, BO and MFBO have not seen a direct comparison with when faced with with a real-life engineering problem, such as metamaterial design for deformation and absorption qualities. Moreover, sampling quality and assessing design parameter sensitivity is often an underrepresented part of data-driven design. This paper aims to address these shortcomings by employing Sobol' samples with variance-based sensitivity analysis in order to reduce design problem complexity. Furthermore, this work describes, implements, applies and compares the performance BO with that MFBO when maximizing the energy absorption (EA) problem of spinodoid cellular structures is concerned. The findings show that MFBO is an effective way to maximize the EA of a spinodoid structure and is able to outperform BO by up to 11% across various hyperparameter settings. The results, which are made open-source, serve to support the utility of multi-fidelity techniques across expensive data-driven design problems.</description>

      <title>Monopole Traps for Position-Based Information Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a spin-ice-based heterostructure capable of encoding magnetic monopole quasiparticle positions for non-volatile information storage applications. Building upon two-dimensional magnetic monopole gases formed at the interface between 2-in-2-out spin ice and all-in-all-out antiferromagnetic pyrochlore iridate, the design introduces a 3-in-1-out/1-in-3-out fragmented barrier layer into the spin-ice matrix, defining two energetically stable monopole traps. The occupancy of these traps can be deterministically controlled by an externally applied magnetic field. Monte Carlo simulations reveal robust bistable switching, thermal stability below 0.22 K, and fully reversible field-driven transitions, demonstrating the system's potential for reliable, repeatable memory operation. Crucially, the heterostructure exhibits emergent ferromagnetism linked to monopole position, enabling non-destructive readout of the memory state via spatially resolved magnetic imaging. Unlike topological carriers such as skyrmions, monopoles confined at the sub-nanometer scale offer three orders of magnitude higher information density. These results establish these monopole-trap heterostructures as a scalable platform for next-generation ultra-compact memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Criticality by Interaction Frustration in a Square-Planar Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report experimental and theoretical investigations on ThCr$_2$Ge$_2$C, a metallic compound in which Cr$_2$C planes form a square-planar lattice. Neutron powder diffraction, magnetization, and specific heat measurements reveal no evidence of long-range magnetic order or short-range spin freezing down to 70~mK. Quantum critical behavior was indicated through logarithmic divergences in both the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat divided by temperature. Resistivity measurements exhibit non-Fermi-liquid behavior, with a Fermi liquid recovered under magnetic fields or high pressures. First-principles calculations identify competing nearest-neighbor ($J_1$) and next-nearest-neighbor ($J_2$) exchange interactions, with $J_2/J_1 \sim -0.5$, pointing to strong magnetic frustration. The interaction frustration is reduced, and magnetically ordered phases are stabilized upon the application of negative or positive pressures. This work offers a rare example of zero-field, ambient pressure quantum criticality mainly driven by interaction frustration in a square lattice.</description>

Abstract: We derive a refraction law for superconducting vortices at superconductor/normal metal interfaces. Simulations of the proximity effect under tilted geometries confirm this law and reveal vortex trapping for low effective mass. Under transport currents, we find core displacements due to differing vortex viscosities in the superconductor and normal metal. These results clarify vortex dynamics in proximity-coupled systems and offer design principles for high-current coated superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Material Effects On Direct ToF Signal Response In Optical Tactile Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical tactile sensing holds transformative potential for robotics, particularly in collaborative environments where touch perception enhances safety, adaptability, and cognitive interaction. However, traditional tactile technologies based on total internal reflection (TIR) and frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) - such as those used in touchscreen systems - face significant limitations. These include reliance on multiple infrared light sources and cameras, as well as poor adaptability to the complex, curved geometries often found in robotic systems. To address these challenges, we recently introduced OptoSkin, an advanced optical tactile sensor based on direct Time-of-Flight (ToF) technology, enabling touch and pressure detection. In this study, we investigate how specific material properties, particularly light scattering, influence the sensitivity of contact point detection under direct ToF sensing. Four materials with distinct scattering coefficients were selected to assess their impact on signal quality across different contact scenarios involving various target surfaces.</description>

      <title>Strain-Controlled Topological Phase Transitions and Chern Number Reversal in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical and first-principles study of a two-dimensional altermagnet exhibiting spin-valley locking and strain-tunable topological phases. By constructing a minimal tight-binding model constrained by altermagnetic symmetry, we show that biaxial strain can drive a transition from a trivial insulator to a type-II quantum spin Hall (QSH) phase. Furthermore, we derive an analytical strain-induced perturbation theory that identifies two critical curves, dividing the phase space into four regions corresponding to a trivial insulator, a type-II QSH phase, and two quantum anomalous Hall phases with opposite Chern numbers. Remarkably, the Chern number can be reversed purely by changing the strain direction --without modifying magnetization or applying magnetic fields. The model reveals a universal phase diagram for materials with the same symmetry and valley structure. First-principles calculations on monolayer CrO confirm the predicted topological transitions, establishing strain engineering as an effective route for topological control in two-dimensional altermagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Unconventional hybrid-order topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring topological matters with exotic quantum states can update the understanding of topological phases and broaden the classification of topological materials. Here, we report a class of unconventional hybrid-order topological insulators (HyOTIs), which simultaneously host various different higher-order topological states in a single $d$-dimensional ($d$D) system. Such topological states exhibit a unique bulk-boundary correspondence that is different from first-order topological states, higher-order topological states, and the coexistence of both. Remarkably, we develop a generic surface theory to precisely capture them and firstly discover a $3$D unconventional HyOTI protected by inversion symmetry, which renders both second-order (helical) and third-order (corner) topological states in one band gap and exhibits a novel bulk-edge-corner correspondence. By adjusting the parameters of the system, we also observe the nontrivial phase transitions between the inversion-symmetric HyOTI and other conventional phases. We further propose a circuit-based experimental scheme to detect these interesting results. Particularly, we demonstrate that a modified tight-binding model of bismuth can support the unconventional HyOTI, suggesting a possible route for its material realization. This work shall significantly advance the research of hybrid topological states in both theory and experiment.</description>

Abstract: Here, we report a comprehensive modeling framework to unravel the efficiency roll-off in Perovskite light emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Our model self-consistently accounts for a positive feedback mechanism which involves diverse phenomena like temperature-dependent carrier recombination, space charge effects, Joule heating, and thermal transport. Model predictions compare well with experimental results such as dark current-voltage characteristics and efficiency as well as radiance roll-off under high injection conditions. This work identifies key performance limiting phenomena in current state-of-the-art PeLEDs and could be of broad relevance towards device optimization, thermal design, packaging, and operational lifetime.</description>

Abstract: We show that Yb(trensal) molecular nanomagnet, embedding an electronic spin qubit coupled to a nuclear spin qudit, provides an ideal platform to probe entanglement in a qubit-qudit system.This is demonstrated by developing an optimized pulse sequence to show violation of generalized Bell inequalities and by performing realistic numerical simulations including experimentally measured decoherence. We find that the inequalities are safely violated in a wide range of parameters, proving the robustness of entanglement in the investigated system. Furthermore, we propose a scheme to study qudit-qudit entanglement on a molecular spin trimer, in which two spins 3/2 are linked via an interposed switch to turn on and off their mutual interaction.</description>

      <title>Doubling the magnetorheological effect of magnetic elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most important properties of soft functionalized magnetic composite materials in view of their technological potential is given by the magnetorheological effect. It describes the change in rheological properties such as the shear modulus by application of external magnetic fields. We demonstrate how computational material design can support in approximately doubling the magnitude of this important phenomenon for magnetic elastomers. Key is to work with two perpendicular magnetic field directions. We expect future practical relevance of our concept.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised learning of representative local atomic arrangements in molecular dynamics data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations present a data-mining challenge, given that they can generate a considerable amount of data but often rely on limited or biased human interpretation to examine their information content. By not asking the right questions of MD data we may miss critical information hidden within it. We combine dimensionality reduction (UMAP) and unsupervised hierarchical clustering (HDBSCAN) to quantitatively characterize prevalent coordination environments of chemical species within MD data. By focusing on local coordination, we significantly reduce the amount of data to be analyzed by extracting all distinct molecular formulas within a given coordination sphere. We then efficiently combine UMAP and HDBSCAN with alignment or shape-matching algorithms to partition these formulas into structural isomer families indicating their relative populations. The method was employed to reveal details of cation coordination in electrolytes based on molecular liquids.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper gathers and unifies mechanical stability conditions for all symmetry classes of 3D and 2D materials under arbitrary load. The methodology is based on the spectral decomposition of the fourth-order stiffness tensors mapped to second-order tensors using orthonormal (Mandel) notation, and the verification of the positivity of the so-called Kelvin moduli. An explicit set of stability conditions for 3D and 2D crystals of higher symmetry is also included, as well as a Mathematica notebook that allows mechanical stability analysis for crystals, stress-free and stressed, of arbitrary symmetry under arbitrary loads.</description>

      <title>An alternative GPU acceleration for a pseudopotential plane-waves density functional theory code with applications to metallic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an alternative GPU acceleration for plane waves pseudopotentials electronic structure codes designed for systems that have small unit cells but require a large number of k points to sample the Brillouin zone as happens, for instance, in metals. We discuss the diagonalization of the Kohn and Sham equations and the solution of the linear system derived in density functional perturbation theory. Both problems take advantage from a rewriting of the routine that applies the Hamiltonian to the Bloch wave-functions to work simultaneously (in parallel on the GPU threads) on the wave-functions with different wave-vectors k, as many as allowed by the GPU memory. Our implementation is written in CUDA Fortran and makes extensive use of kernel routines that run on the GPU (GLOBAL routines) or can be called from inside the GPU threads (DEVICE routines). We compare our method with the CPUs only calculation and with the approach currently implemented in Quantum ESPRESSO that uses GPU accelerated libraries for the FFT and for the linear algebra tasks such as the matrix-matrix multiplications as well as OpenACC directives for loop parallelization. We show in a realistic example that our method can give a significant improvement in the cases for which it has been designed.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative Operator Formalism for Noncollinear Functionals in Multicollinear Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate calculation of spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear magnetism requires noncollinear density functionals within the two-component generalized Kohn-Sham (GKS) framework, yet constructing and implementing noncollinear functionals remains challenging. Recently, a well-defined methodology called the multicollinear approach was proposed to extend collinear functionals into noncollinear ones. While previous research focuses on its matrix representation, the present work derives its multiplicative operator formalism. We implement these new equations in our noncollinear functional ensemble named NCXC, which is expected to facilitate compatibility with most DFT software packages. Since the multicollinear approach was proposed for solving nonphysical properties and mathematical singularities in noncollinear functionals, we validate its accuracy in practical periodic systems, including noncollinear magnetism in spin spirals, band structures in topological insulators, and band gaps in semiconducting inorganic materials.</description>

      <title>A Unified Predictive and Generative Solution for Liquid Electrolyte Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid electrolytes are critical components of next-generation energy storage systems, enabling fast ion transport, minimizing interfacial resistance, and ensuring electrochemical stability for long-term battery performance. However, measuring electrolyte properties and designing formulations remain experimentally and computationally expensive. In this work, we present a unified framework for designing liquid electrolyte formulation, integrating a forward predictive model with an inverse generative approach. Leveraging both computational and experimental data collected from literature and extensive molecular simulations, we train a predictive model capable of accurately estimating electrolyte properties from ionic conductivity to solvation structure. Our physics-informed architecture preserves permutation invariance and incorporates empirical dependencies on temperature and salt concentration, making it broadly applicable to property prediction tasks across molecular mixtures. Furthermore, we introduce -- to the best of our knowledge -- the first generative machine learning framework for molecular mixture design, demonstrated on electrolyte systems. This framework supports multi-condition-constrained generation, addressing the inherently multi-objective nature of materials design. As a proof of concept, we experimentally identified three liquid electrolytes with both high ionic conductivity and anion-concentrated solvation structure. This unified framework advances data-driven electrolyte design and can be readily extended to other complex chemical systems beyond electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Mapping of Microstructure Transitions during Rapid Alloy Solidification Using Bayesian-Guided Phase-Field Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study addresses microstructure selection mechanisms in rapid solidification, specifically targeting the transition from cellular/dendritic to planar interface morphologies under conditions relevant to additive manufacturing. We use a phase-field model that quantitatively captures solute trapping, kinetic undercooling, and morphological instabilities across a broad range of growth velocities ($V$) and thermal gradients ($G$), and apply it to a binary Fe-Cr alloy, as a surrogate for 316L stainless steel. By combining high-fidelity phase-field simulations with a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian active learning approach, we efficiently map the microstructure transitions in the multi-dimensional space of composition, growth velocity, and temperature gradient. We compare our PF results to classical theories for rapid solidification. The classical KGT model yields an accurate prediction of the value of $G$ above which the interface is planar for any growth velocity. Microstructures transition from dendrites to cells as the temperature gradient increases close to this value of $G$. We also identify the occurrence of unstable "intermediate" microstructures at the border between dendritic and planar at low $G$, in the absence of banding instability in this Fe-Cr alloy. Our results highlight the capabilities of Bayesian-guided PF approaches in exploring complex microstructural transitions in multidimensional parameters spaces, thereby providing a robust computational tool for designing process parameters to achieve targeted microstructures and properties in rapidly solidified metallic alloys.</description>

      <title>Hop-Decorate: An Automated Atomistic Workflow for Generating Defect Transport Data in Chemically Complex Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemically complex materials (CCMs) exhibit extraordinary functional properties but pose significant challenges for atomistic modeling due to their vast configurational heterogeneity. We introduce Hop-Decorate (HopDec), a high-throughput, Python-based atomistic workflow that automates the generation of defect transport data in CCMs. HopDec integrates accelerated molecular dynamics with a novel redecoration algorithm to efficiently sample migration pathways across chemically diverse local environments. The method constructs a defect-state graph in which transitions are associated with distributions of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, enabling direct input into kinetic Monte Carlo and other mesoscale models. We demonstrate HopDec's capabilities through applications to a Cu-Ni alloy and the spinel oxide (Fe,Ni)Cr2O4, revealing simple predictive relationships in the former and complex migration behaviors driven by cation disorder in the latter. These results highlight HopDec's ability to extract physically meaningful trends and support reduced-order or machine-learned models of defect kinetics, bridging atomic-scale simulations and mesoscale predictions in complex material systems.</description>

      <title>High thermal conductivity dominated by thermal phonons with mean free paths exceeding hundred nanometer in three-dimensional covalent organic framework derivatives: a molecular dynamics study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal properties of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are of fundamental interest owing to exceptional heat conduction properties. Recent studies have suggested that their thermal conductivities can be enhanced by multiple factors such as pore size, mass density, and degree of chain order. However, microscopic processes that govern heat conduction properties have been explored in only a limited number of COFs. Here, we report thermal transport properties of 3D COF derivatives using molecular dynamics simulations. In this work, we have studied six different COF-102 derivatives with different organic linkers and topologies. Among the derivatives studied, we found that COF-102 derivatives with high mass density can exhibit thermal conductivity as high as ~ 27 W/mK, owing to suppressed chain rotation that leads to thermal phonons scattered by anharmonicity. Our results show that the observed orders of magnitude of increase in the thermal conductivity are primarily attributed to low frequency phonon modes that support hundreds of nanometer scale mean free path, which predominantly carry heat. Our study provides a theoretical framework that elucidates the structure-property relationship governing heat conduction in COFs, offering design strategies for thermal management applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of Li-based batteries in the electrification of society cannot be understated, however their operational lifetime is often limited by the formation of dendrites, i.e. the localised deposition of Li that can cause shorts between the two electrodes leading to the failure of the battery. Nanocrystalline bimetallic current collectors can be used for anode-free Li-metal batteries, with improved Li plating and limited or suppressed formation of dendrites. Here, we demonstrate that the microstructure of an alpha-Brass current collector, Cu 63% Zn 37%, used in an anode-free Li-metal battery evolves during cycling. It initially had a nanocrystalline deformation layer approximately 80 nm in thickness after polishing. After 100 cycles, the initial deformed brass layer was partially converted to a ternary Laves phase Cu3ZnLi2 within a nanocrystalline brass matrix that grew to 200 - 250 nm in thickness. Upon Li stripping, the phase partially decomposes electrochemically, but what remains can sequester Li thus forming "dead Li" thereby contributing to capacity loss. We propose a mechanism for the microstructural evolution including dynamic recrystallization and phase formation. Since this ternary Laves phase emerges during electrochemical cycling alone, binary alloy current collectors must be assessed for metastable ternary phase formation under different cycling conditions to either stabilize and exploit such phases or electrochemically fully strip them.</description>

      <title>Alloying as a new route to generating interlayer excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterobilayers formed by stacking two-dimensional atomic crystals are particularly promising for low-dimensional semiconductor optics, as they host interlayer excitons, bound states of electrons and holes residing in different layers. They inherit the valley-contrasting physics of the individual monolayers, leading to a range of unique properties that distinguish them from other solid-state nanostructures. Here, we propose a novel route for the generation of interlayer excitons based on the synthesis of a transition metal dichalcogenide bilayer alloy material, WS$_{2x}$Se$_{2(1-x)}$. Using piezoelectric force microscopy, we demonstrate the existence of an internal electric field oriented in the out-of-plane direction. Interlayer excitons have so far been mostly observed in heterostructures with a type-II band alignment. In the presence of an internal electric field, a similar alignment occurs in the alloy bilayer resulting in an efficient generation of interlayer excitons. Photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements involving circularly polarised light come up with key observations like a negative degree of circular polarization of the interlayer excitons which increases as a function of temperature. A simple theoretical model provides a physical understanding of the major experimentally observed features. With experimentally fitted parameter values, the dominant contribution to the degree of circular polarization is shown to arise from spin polarization and not from valley polarization, a consequence of the spin-valley-layer coupling characteristic of a TMDC bilayer. The room-temperature interlayer excitonic transition in bilayer TMDCs has key implications for fundamental physics, including Bose-Einstein condensation and high-temperature superfluidity, while enabling advanced valleytronic and quantum information functionalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mercury chalcogenides are a class of materials that exhibit diverse structural phases under pressure, leading to a range of exotic physical properties, including topological phases and chiral phonons. In particular, the phase diagram of mercury sulfide (HgS) remains difficult to characterize, with significant uncertainty surrounding the transition pressure between phases. Based on recent experimental results, we employ Density Functional Theory and Superconducting Density Functional Theory to investigate the pressure-induced structural phase transition in HgS and its interplay with the emergence of superconductivity as the crystal transitions from the cinnabar phase (space group P3$_1$21) to the rock salt phase (space group Fm$\bar{3}$m). Remarkably, the rocksalt phase hosts a multigap superconducting state driven by distinct Fermi surface sheets, with two dominant gaps; the unusually high critical temperature of $\sim$11 K emerges naturally within this multiband scenario, highlighting the role of interband coupling beyond isotropic models. These results place HgS among the few systems where multiband superconducting gap structures emerge under pressure.</description>
