      <title>Multidimensional Brownian risk models with random trend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let \(\mathbf B(t)=(B_1(t), \dots,B_d(t))^\top\), \(t\in[0,T]\), \(d\geq 2\) be a \(d\)-dimensional Brownian motion with independent components and let \(\mathbf \eta=(\eta_1,\dots,\eta_d)^\top\) be a random vector independent of \(\mathbf B\) such that
  \[
  \mathbb{P}{\mathbf K_{1}\leq\mathbf\eta\leq\vk K_{2}}
  =\mathbb{P}{K_{11}\leq\eta_1\leq K_{21},\dots,K_{1d}\leq\eta_d\leq K_{2d}}=1,
  \]
  where \(\mathbf K_1=(K_{11},\dots,K_{1d})^\top\) and \(\vk K_2=(K_{21},\dots,K_{2d})^\top\) are fixed \(d\)-dimensional vectors.
  The goal of this paper is to derive asymptotics of
  \[
  \mathbb{P}{\exists_{t\in[0,T]}: X_1(t)&gt;a_1u,\dots,X_d(t)&gt;a_du}, \ \ \mathbf X(t)=\left(X_1(t),\dots,X_d(t)\right)^\top
  =A\mathbf B(t)-\mathbf\eta t
  \]
  as \(u\to\infty\) under certain restrictions on the random vector \(\mathbf\eta\) and constants \(a_1,\dots, a_d\).</description>

      <title>Explicit convergence rates of underdamped Langevin dynamics under weighted and weak Poincar\'e--Lions inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-time convergence behavior of underdamped Langevin dynamics, when the spatial equilibrium satisfies a weighted Poincar\'e inequality, with a general velocity distribution, which allows for fat-tail or subexponential potential energies, and provide constructive and fully explicit estimates in $\mathrm{L}^2$-norm with $\mathrm{L}^\infty$ initial conditions. A key ingredient is a space-time weighted Poincar\'e--Lions inequality, which in turn implies a weak Poincar\'e--Lions inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the theory of stochastic integration developed recently by the authors, in this article is proved an It\^{o} formula for Hilbert space-valued It\^{o} processes defined with respect to a cylindrical-martingale valued measure. This formula is applied to prove an integration by parts formula for It\^{o} processes, to prove a Burkholder inequality for the stochastic integral, and finally to prove an It\^{o} formula for Hilbert space-valued It\^{o} processes defined with respect to a L\'evy process.</description>

      <title>Trickle-Down in Localization Schemes and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trickle-down is a phenomenon in high-dimensional expanders with many important applications -- for example, it is a key ingredient in various constructions of high-dimensional expanders or the proof of rapid mixing for the basis exchange walk on matroids and in the analysis of log-concave polynomials. We formulate a generalized trickle-down equation in the abstract context of linear-tilt localization schemes. Building on this generalization, we improve the best-known results for several Markov chain mixing or sampling problems -- for example, we improve the threshold up to which Glauber dynamics is known to mix rapidly in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass model. Other applications of our framework include improved mixing results for the Langevin dynamics in the $O(N)$ model, and near-linear time sampling algorithms for the antiferromagnetic and fixed-magnetization Ising models on expanders. For the latter application, we use a new dynamics inspired by polarization, a technique from the theory of stable polynomials.</description>

      <title>Cutoff for Contingency Table Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Diaconis-Gangolli random walk on $n \times n$ contingency tables and its analog on $1 \times n$ contingency tables, both over $\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z}$. In the $1 \times n$ case, we prove that the random walk exhibits cutoff at time $\dfrac{n q^2 \log(n)}{8 \pi^2}$ when $q \gg n$; in the $n \times n$ case, we establish cutoff for the random walk at time $\dfrac{n^2 q^2 \log(n)}{8 \pi^2}$ when $q \gg n^2$. We also show that a general class of random walks on $(\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z})^n$ with a marginal incremental variance $\dfrac{\sigma^2}{n}$ (when mapped to $( \mathbb{Z} \cap [-q/2, q/2))^n$) has cutoff at time $\dfrac{nq^2 \log(n)}{4\pi^2 \sigma^2}$.</description>

      <title>A martingale-type of characterisation of the Gaussian free field and fractional Gaussian free fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a martingale-type characterisations for the continuum Gaussian free field (GFF) and for fractional Gaussian free fields (FGFs), using their connection to the stochastic heat equation and to fractional stochastic heat equations. The main theorem on the GFF generalizes previous results of similar flavour and the characterisation theorems on the FGFs are new. The proof strategy is to link the resampling dynamics coming from a martingale-type of decomposition property to the stationary dynamics of the desired field, i.e. to the (fractional) stochastic heat equation.</description>

      <title>Random Connection Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel model for random hypergraphs based on weighted random connection models. In accordance with the standard theory for hypergraphs, this model is constructed from a bipartite graph. In our stochastic model, both vertex sets of this bipartite graph form marked Poisson point processes and the connection radius is inversely proportional to a product of suitable powers of the marks. Hence, our model is a common generalization of weighted random connection models and AB random geometric graphs. For this hypergraph model, we investigate the limit theory of a variety of graph-theoretic and topological characteristics such as higher-order degree distribution, Betti numbers of the associated Dowker complex as well as simplex counts. In particular, for the latter quantity we identify regimes of convergence to normal and to stable distribution depending on the heavy-tailedness of the weight distribution. We conclude our investigation by a simulation study and an application to the collaboration network extracted from the arXiv dataset.</description>

      <title>A new numerical scheme for It\^o stochastic differential equations based on Wick-type Wong-Zakai arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this note is to propose a novel numerical scheme for drift-less one dimensional stochastic differential equations of It\^o's type driven by standard Brownian motion. Our approximation method is equivalent to the well known Milstein scheme as long as the rate of convergence is concerned, i.e. it is strongly convergent with order one, but has the additional desirable property of being exact for linear diffusion coefficients. Our approach is inspired by Wick-type Wong-Zakai arguments in the sense that we only smooth the white noise through polygonal approximation of the Brownian motion while keep the equation in differential form. A first order Taylor expansion of the diffusion coefficient allows us to solve the resulting equation explicitly and hence to provide an implementable approximation scheme.</description>

      <title>Existence of stationary measures for partially damped SDEs with generic, Euler-type nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonlinear energy transfer and the existence of stationary measures in a class of degenerately forced SDEs on $\mathbb R^d$ with a quadratic, conservative nonlinearity $B(x,x)$ constrained to possess various properties common to finite-dimensional fluid models and a linear damping term $-Ax$ that acts only on a proper subset of phase space in the sense that $\mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{ker}A) \gg 1$. Existence of a stationary measure is straightforward if $\mathrm{ker}A = \{0\}$, but when the kernel of $A$ is nontrivial a stationary measure can exist only if the nonlinearity transfers enough energy from the undamped modes to the damped modes. We develop a set of sufficient dynamical conditions on $B$ that guarantees the existence of a stationary measure and prove that they hold ``generically'' within our constraint class of nonlinearities provided that $\mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{ker}A) &lt; 2d/3$ and the stochastic forcing acts directly on at least two degrees of freedom. We also show that the restriction $\mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{ker}A) &lt; 2d/3$ can be removed if one allows the nonlinearity to change by a small amount at discrete times. In particular, for a Markov chain obtained by evolving our SDE on approximately unit random time intervals and slightly perturbing the nonlinearity within our constraint class at each timestep, we prove that there exists a stationary measure whenever just a single mode is damped.</description>

      <title>Hardness of sampling solutions from the Symmetric Binary Perceptron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that two related classes of algorithms, stable algorithms and Boolean circuits with bounded depth, cannot produce an approximate sample from the uniform measure over the set of solutions to the symmetric binary perceptron model at any constraint-to-variable density. This result is in contrast to the question of finding \emph{a} solution to the same problem, where efficient (and stable) algorithms are known to succeed at sufficiently low density. This result suggests that the solutions found efficiently -- whenever this task is possible -- must be highly atypical, and therefore provides an example of a problem where search is efficiently possible but approximate sampling from the set of solutions is not, at least within these two classes of algorithms.</description>

      <title>Aggregation of expert advice, revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the classic problem of aggregating binary advice from conditionally independent experts, also known as the Naive Bayes setting. Our quantity of interest is the error probability of the optimal decision rule. In the symmetric case (sensitivity = specificity), reasonably tight bounds on the optimal error probability are known. In the general asymmetric case, we are not aware of any nontrivial estimates on this quantity. Our contribution consists of sharp upper and lower bounds on the optimal error probability in the general case, which recover and sharpen the best known results in the symmetric special case. Since this amounts to estimating the total variation distance between two product distributions, our results also have bearing on this important and challenging problem.</description>

      <title>Repeated Block Averages: entropic time and mixing profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider randomized dynamics over the $n$-simplex, where at each step a random set, or block, of coordinates is evenly averaged. When all blocks have size 2, this reduces to the repeated averages studied in [CDSZ22], a version of the averaging process on a graph [AL12]. We study the convergence to equilibrium of this process as a function of the distribution of the block size, and provide sharp conditions for the emergence of the cutoff phenomenon. Moreover, we characterize the size of the cutoff window and provide an explicit Gaussian cutoff profile. To complete the analysis, we study in detail the simplified case where the block size is not random. We show that the absence of a cutoff is equivalent to having blocks of size $n^{\Omega(1)}$, in which case we provide a convergence in distribution for the total variation distance at any given time, showing that, on the proper time scale, it remains constantly 1 up to an exponentially distributed random time, after which it decays following a Poissonian profile.</description>

Abstract: We consider the advection of a passive scalar by a divergence free random Gaussian field, white in time and H\"older regular in space (rough Kraichnan's model), a well established synthetic model of passive scalar turbulence. By studying the evolution of negative Sobolev norms, we show an anomalous regularization effect induced by the dynamics: distributional initial conditions immediately become functions of positive Sobolev regularity.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Multistage Distributionally Robust Linear Optimization with Nested Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study multistage distributionally robust linear optimization, where the uncertainty set is defined as a ball of distribution centered at a scenario tree using the nested distance. The resulting minimax problem is notoriously difficult to solve due to its inherent non-convexity. In this paper, we demonstrate that, under mild conditions, the robust risk evaluation of a given policy can be expressed in an equivalent recursive form. Furthermore, assuming stagewise independence, we derive equivalent dynamic programming reformulations to find an optimal robust policy that is time-consistent and well-defined on unseen sample paths. Our reformulations reconcile two modeling frameworks: the multistage-static formulation (with nested distance) and the multistage-dynamic formulation (with one-period Wasserstein distance). Moreover, we identify tractable cases when the value functions can be computed efficiently using convex optimization techniques.</description>

      <title>Large matchings and nearly spanning, nearly regular subgraphs of random subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and $p\in [0,1]$, the random subgraph $G_p$ is obtained by retaining each edge of $G$ independently with probability $p$. We show that for every $\epsilon&gt;0$, there exists a constant $C&gt;0$ such that the following holds. Let $d\ge C$ be an integer, let $G$ be a $d$-regular graph and let $p\ge \frac{C}{d}$. Then, with probability tending to one as $|V(G)|$ tends to infinity, there exists a matching in $G_p$ covering at least $(1-\epsilon)|V(G)|$ vertices.
  We further show that for a wide family of $d$-regular graphs $G$, which includes the $d$-dimensional hypercube, for any $p\ge \frac{\log^5d}{d}$ with probability tending to one as $d$ tends to infinity, $G_p$ contains an induced subgraph on at least $(1-o(1))|V(G)|$ vertices, whose degrees are tightly concentrated around the expected average degree $dp$.</description>

      <title>Matrix majorization in large samples with varying support restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We say that a matrix $P$ with non-negative entries majorizes another such matrix $Q$ if there is a stochastic matrix $T$ such that $Q=TP$. We study matrix majorization in large samples and in the catalytic regime in the case where the columns of the matrices need not have equal support, as has been assumed in earlier works. We focus on two cases: either there are no support restrictions (except for requiring a non-empty intersection for the supports) or the final column dominates the others. Using real-algebraic methods, we identify sufficient and almost necessary conditions for majorization in large samples or when using catalytic states under these support conditions. These conditions are given in terms of multi-partite divergences that generalize the R\'enyi divergences. We notice that varying support conditions dramatically affect the relevant set of divergences. Our results find an application in the theory of catalytic state transformation in quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Inference of rankings planted in random tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of inferring an unknown ranking of $n$ items from a random tournament on $n$ vertices whose edge directions are correlated with the ranking. We establish, in terms of the strength of these correlations, the computational and statistical thresholds for detection (deciding whether an observed tournament is purely random or drawn correlated with a hidden ranking) and recovery (estimating the hidden ranking with small error in Spearman's footrule or Kendall's tau metric on permutations). Notably, we find that this problem provides a new instance of a detection-recovery gap: solving the detection problem requires much weaker correlations than solving the recovery problem. In establishing these thresholds, we also identify simple algorithms for detection (thresholding a degree 2 polynomial) and recovery (outputting a ranking by the number of "wins" of a tournament vertex, i.e., the out-degree) that achieve optimal performance up to constants in the correlation strength. For detection, we find that the above low-degree polynomial algorithm is superior to a natural spectral algorithm. We also find that, whenever it is possible to achieve strong recovery (i.e., to estimate with vanishing error in the above metrics) of the hidden ranking, then the above "Ranking By Wins" algorithm not only does so, but also outputs a close approximation of the maximum likelihood estimator, a task that is NP-hard in the worst case.</description>

      <title>$2D$ vorticity Euler equations: Superposition solutions and nonlinear Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we contribute two results to the theory of the $2D$ Euler equations in vorticity form on the full plane. First, we establish a generalized Lagrangian representation of weak (in general measure-valued) solutions, which includes and extends classical results on the Lagrangianity of weak solutions. Second, we construct nonlinear Markov processes which are uniquely determined by a selection of weak solutions from initial data in $L^1\cap L^p$, $p \geq 2$, and related spaces such as the classical and uniformly localized Yudovich space. It is well-known that for $p &lt;\infty$ weak solutions are in general not unique, which renders a suitable selection nontrivial.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing dynamical systems as zero-noise limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dynamical system may be defined by a simple transition law - such as a map or a vector field. Most learning techniques primarily try to recreate the dynamic evolution law. This is a major shortcoming, as most dynamic properties of interest are asymptotic properties such as an attractor or invariant measure. One of the major theoretical challenges for numerical methods is that approximating the dynamical law may not be sufficient to approximate these asymptotic properties. This article presents a method of representing a discrete-time deterministic dynamical system as a Markov process. The procedure is completely data-driven. The technique is proved to be convergent -- the stationary density of the Markov process has a support that converges to the targeted invariant set. Thus invariant sets of arbitrary dynamical systems, even with complicated non-smooth topology, can be approximated by this technique. Under further assumptions of stochastic stability of the targeted system, the technique is also shown to provide a convergent statistical approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1908.00832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the first article in a series of two papers in which we study the Temperleyan dimer model on an arbitrary bounded Riemann surface of finite topolgical type. The end goal of both papers is to prove the convergence of height fluctuations to a universal and conformally invariant scaling limit. In this part we show that the dimer model on the Temperleyan superposition of a graph embedded on the surface and its dual is well posed, provided that we remove an appropriate number of punctures. We further show that the resulting dimer configuration is in bijection with an object which we call Temperleyan forest, whose law is characterised in terms of a certain topological condition. Finally we discuss the relation between height differences and Temperleyan forest, and give a criterion guaranteeing the convergence of the height fluctuations in terms of the Temperleyan forest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.04235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Drainage Network is a system of coalescing random walks, exhibiting long-range dependence before coalescence, introduced by Gangopadhyay, Roy, and Sarkar. Coletti, Fontes, and Dias proved its convergence to the Brownian Web under diffusive scaling. In this work, we introduce a perturbation of the system allowing branching of the random walks with low probabilities varying with the scaling parameter. When the branching probability is inversely proportional to the scaling parameter, we show that this drainage network with branching consists of a tight family such that any weak limit point contains a Brownian Net. We conjecture that the limit is indeed the Brownian Net.</description>

Abstract: Given a bounded Riemann surface $M$ of finite topological type, we show the existence of a universal and conformally invariant scaling limit for the Temperleyan cycle-rooted spanning forest on any sequence of graphs which approximate $M$ in a reasonable sense (essentially, the invariance principle holds and the walks satisfy a crossing assumption). In combination with the companion paper arxiv:1908.00832, this proves the existence of a universal, conformally invariant scaling limit for the height function of the Temperleyan dimer model on such graphs. Along the way, we describe the relationship between Temperleyan CRSFs and loop measures, and develop tools of independent interest to study the latter using only rough control on the random walk</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00719v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a finite-dimensional approximation for a class of partial differential equations on the space of probability measures. These equations are satisfied in the sense of viscosity solutions. The main result states the convergence of the viscosity solutions of the finite-dimensional PDE to the viscosity solutions of the PDE on Wasserstein space, provided that uniqueness holds for the latter, and heavily relies on an adaptation of the Barles &amp; Souganidis monotone scheme to our context, as well as on a key precompactness result for semimartingale measures. We illustrate this result with the example of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Bellman-Isaacs equations arising in stochastic control and differential games, and propose an extension to the case of path-dependent PDEs.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann Distribution on "Short" Integer Partitions with Power Parts: Limit Laws and Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with the asymptotic analysis of a family of Boltzmann (multiplicative) distributions over the set $\check{\varLambda}^{q}$ of strict integer partitions (i.e., with unequal parts) into perfect $q$-th powers. A combinatorial link is provided via a suitable conditioning by fixing the partition weight (the sum of parts) and length (the number of parts), leading to uniform distribution on the corresponding subspaces of partitions. The Boltzmann measure is calibrated through the hyper-parameters $\langle N\rangle$ and $\langle M\rangle$ controlling the expected weight and length, respectively. We study ``short'' partitions, where the parameter $\langle M\rangle$ is either fixed or grows slower than for typical plain (unconstrained) partitions. For this model, we obtain a variety of limit theorems including the asymptotics of the cumulative cardinality in the case of fixed $\langle M\rangle$ and a limit shape result in the case of slow growth of $\langle M\rangle$. In both cases, we also characterize the joint distribution of the weight and length, as well as the growth of the smallest and largest parts. Using these results we construct suitable sampling algorithms and analyse their performance.</description>

      <title>The Last Success Problem with Samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The last success problem is an optimal stopping problem that aims to maximize the probability of stopping on the last success in a sequence of independent $n$ Bernoulli trials. In the classical setting where complete information about the distributions is available, Bruss~\cite{B00} provided an optimal stopping policy that ensures a winning probability of $1/e$. However, assuming complete knowledge of the distributions is unrealistic in many practical applications. This paper investigates a variant of the last success problem where samples from each distribution are available instead of complete knowledge of them. When a single sample from each distribution is allowed, we provide a deterministic policy that guarantees a winning probability of $1/4$. This is best possible by the upper bound provided by Nuti and Vondr\'{a}k~\cite{NV23}. Furthermore, for any positive constant $\epsilon$, we show that a constant number of samples from each distribution is sufficient to guarantee a winning probability of $1/e-\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>The energy landscape of the Kuramoto model in random geometric graphs in a circle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the energy function of the Kuramoto model in random geometric graphs defined in the unit circle as the number of nodes diverges. We prove the existence of at least one local minimum for each winding number $q \in \mathbb{Z}$ with high probability. Hence providing a large family of graphs that support patterns that are generic. These states are in correspondence with the explicit twisted states found in WSG and other highly symmetric networks, but in our situation there is no explicit formula due to the lack of symmetry. The method of proof is simple and robust. It allows other types of graphs like $k-$nn graphs or the boolean model and holds also for graphs defined in any simple closed curve or even a small neighborhood of the curve and for weighted graphs. It seems plausible that the method can be extended also to higher dimensions, but a more careful analysis is required.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a multi-type Galton-Watson branching processes, where the largest in magnitude positive eigenvalue $\rho$ of the first moments matrix is close to unity. Specifically, we examine the random vector representing the number of individuals preceding the generation $n$, often referred to as the total progeny. By conditioning on non-extinction or extinction at current time, and properly normalizing it, we derive the asymptotic distribution for this vector. Similar theorem is derived for the processes with immigration. The behavior of this distribution is primarily influenced by the limit of $n(\rho-1)$ as $n$ tends to infinity and $\rho$ tends to 1.</description>

Abstract: We compute the large size limit of the moment formula derived in \cite{DHS} for the Hermitian Jacobi process at fixed time. Our computations rely on the polynomial division algorithm which allows to obtain cancellations similar to those obtained in Lemma 3 in \cite{Bia}. In particular, we identify the terms contributing to the limit and show they satisfy a double recurrence relation. We also determine explicitly some of them and revisit a special case relying on Carlitz summation identity for terminating $1$-balanced ${}_4F_3$ functions taken at unity.</description>

      <title>Joint calibration to SPX and VIX options with signature-based models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic volatility model where the dynamics of the volatility are described by a linear function of the (time extended) signature of a primary process which is supposed to be a polynomial diffusion. We obtain closed form expressions for the VIX squared, exploiting the fact that the truncated signature of a polynomial diffusion is again a polynomial diffusion. Adding to such a primary process the Brownian motion driving the stock price, allows then to express both the log-price and the VIX squared as linear functions of the signature of the corresponding augmented process. This feature can then be efficiently used for pricing and calibration purposes. Indeed, as the signature samples can be easily precomputed, the calibration task can be split into an offline sampling and a standard optimization. We also propose a Fourier pricing approach for both VIX and SPX options exploiting that the signature of the augmented primary process is an infinite dimensional affine process. For both the SPX and VIX options we obtain highly accurate calibration results, showing that this model class allows to solve the joint calibration problem without adding jumps or rough volatility.</description>

      <title>Worst-risk minimization in generalized structural equation models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03588v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider rather general structural equation models (SEMs) between a target and its covariates in several shifted environments. Given $k\in\N$ shifts we consider the set of shifts that are at most $\gamma$-times as strong as a given weighted linear combination of these $k$ shifts and the worst (quadratic) risk over this entire space. This worst risk has a nice decomposition which we refer to as the "worst risk decomposition". Then we find an explicit arg-min solution that minimizes the worst risk and consider its corresponding plug-in estimator which is the main object of this paper. This plug-in estimator is (almost surely) consistent and we first prove a concentration in measure result for it. The solution to the worst risk minimizer is rather reminiscent of the corresponding ordinary least squares solution in that it is product of a vector and an inverse of a Grammian matrix. Due to this, the central moments of the plug-in estimator is not well-defined in general, but we instead consider these moments conditioned on the Grammian inverse being bounded by some given constant. We also study conditional variance of the estimator with respect to a natural filtration for the incoming data. Similarly we consider the conditional covariance matrix with respect to this filtration and prove a bound for the determinant of this matrix. This SEM model generalizes the linear models that have been studied previously for instance in the setting of casual inference or anchor regression but the concentration in measure result and the moment bounds are new even in the linear setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11499v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In compact settings, the convergence rate of the empirical optimal transport cost to its population value is well understood for a wide class of spaces and cost functions. In unbounded settings, however, hitherto available results require strong assumptions on the ground costs and the concentration of the involved measures. In this work, we pursue a decomposition-based approach to generalize the convergence rates found in compact spaces to unbounded settings under generic moment assumptions that are sharp up to an arbitrarily small $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Hallmark properties of empirical optimal transport on compact spaces, like the recently established adaptation to lower complexity, are shown to carry over to the unbounded case.</description>

      <title>A Rank-Dependent Theory for Decision under Risk and Ambiguity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper axiomatizes, in a two-stage setup, a new theory for decision under risk and ambiguity. The axiomatized preference relation $\succeq$ on the space $\tilde{V}$ of random variables induces an ambiguity index $c$ on the space $\Delta$ of probabilities, a probability weighting function $\psi$, generating the measure $\nu_{\psi}$ by transforming an objective probability measure, and a utility function $\phi$, such that, for all $\tilde{v},\tilde{u}\in\tilde{V}$, \begin{align*} \tilde{v}\succeq\tilde{u} \Leftrightarrow \min_{Q \in \Delta} \left\{\mathbb{E}_Q\left[\int\phi\left(\tilde{v}^{\centerdot}\right)\,\mathrm{d}\nu_{\psi}\right]+c(Q)\right\} \geq \min_{Q \in \Delta} \left\{\mathbb{E}_Q\left[\int\phi\left(\tilde{u}^{\centerdot}\right)\,\mathrm{d}\nu_{\psi}\right]+c(Q)\right\}. \end{align*} Our theory extends the rank-dependent utility model of Quiggin (1982) for decision under risk to risk and ambiguity, reduces to the variational preferences model when $\psi$ is the identity, and is dual to variational preferences when $\phi$ is affine in the same way as the theory of Yaari (1987) is dual to expected utility. As a special case, we obtain a preference axiomatization of a decision theory that is a rank-dependent generalization of the popular maxmin expected utility theory. We characterize ambiguity aversion in our theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our Recent advancements in stochastic processes have illuminated a paradox associated with the Einstein model of Brownian motion. The model predicts an infinite propagation speed, conflicting with the second law of thermodynamics. The modified model successfully resolves the issue, establishing a finite propagation speed by introducing a concentration-dependent diffusion matrix. In this paper, we outline the necessary conditions for this property through a counter-example. The second part of the paper focuses on the stability analysis of the solution of the degenerate Einstein model. We introduce a functional dependence on the solution that satisfies a specific ordinary differential inequality. Our investigation explores the solution's dependence on the boundary and initial data of the original problem, demonstrating asymptotic stability under various conditions. These results have practical applications in understanding stochastic processes within bounded domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The convergence rate of a Markov chain to its stationary distribution is typically assessed using the concept of total variation mixing time. However, this worst-case measure often yields pessimistic estimates and is challenging to infer from observations. In this paper, we advocate for the use of the average-mixing time as a more optimistic and demonstrably easier-to-estimate alternative. We further illustrate its applicability across a range of settings, from two-point to countable spaces, and discuss some practical implications.</description>

      <title>The entropic doubling constant and robustness of Gaussian codebooks for additive-noise channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07209</link>

Abstract: Entropy comparison inequalities are obtained for the differential entropy $h(X+Y)$ of the sum of two independent random vectors $X,Y$, when one is replaced by a Gaussian. For identically distributed random vectors $X,Y$, these are closely related to bounds on the entropic doubling constant, which quantifies the entropy increase when adding an independent copy of a random vector to itself. Consequences of both large and small doubling are explored. For the former, lower bounds are deduced on the entropy increase when adding an independent Gaussian, while for the latter, a qualitative stability result for the entropy power inequality is obtained. In the more general case of non-identically distributed random vectors $X,Y$, a Gaussian comparison inequality with interesting implications for channel coding is established: For additive-noise channels with a power constraint, Gaussian codebooks come within a $\frac{{\sf snr}}{3{\sf snr}+2}$ factor of capacity. In the low-SNR regime this improves the half-a-bit additive bound of Zamir and Erez (2004). Analogous results are obtained for additive-noise multiple access channels, and for linear, additive-noise MIMO channels.</description>

      <title>Robust estimates for elliptic nonlocal operators on doubling spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study weak Harnack inequality and a priori H\"older regularity of harmonic functions for symmetric nonlocal Dirichlet forms on metric measure spaces with volume doubling condition. Our analysis relies on three main assumptions: the existence of a strongly local Dirichlet form with sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates, a tail estimate of the jump measure outside balls and a local energy comparability condition. We establish the robustness of our results, ensuring that the constants in our estimates remain bounded, provided that the order of the scale function appearing in the tail estimate and local energy comparability condition, maintains a certain distance from zero. Additionally, we establish a sufficient condition for the local energy comparability condition.</description>

      <title>Score matching for bridges without time-reversals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new algorithm for learning a bridged diffusion process using score-matching methods. Our method relies on reversing the dynamics of the forward process and using this to learn a score function, which, via Doob's $h$-transform, gives us a bridged diffusion process; that is, a process conditioned on an endpoint. In contrast to prior methods, ours learns the score term $\nabla_x \log p(t, x; T, y)$, for given $t, Y$ directly, completely avoiding the need for first learning a time reversal. We compare the performance of our algorithm with existing methods and see that it outperforms using the (learned) time-reversals to learn the score term. The code can be found at https://github.com/libbylbaker/forward_bridge.</description>
