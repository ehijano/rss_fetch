      <title>Dynamical Properties of Random Boolean Hypernetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boolean networks are a valuable class of discrete dynamical systems models, but they remain fundamentally limited by their inability to capture multi-way interactions in their components. To remedy this limitation, we propose a model of Boolean hypernetworks, which generalize standard Boolean networks. Utilizing the bijection between hypernetworks and bipartite networks, we show how Boolean hypernetworks generalize standard Boolean networks. We derive ensembles of Boolean hypernetworks from standard random Boolean networks and simulate the dynamics of each. Our results indicate that several properties of Boolean network dynamics are affected by the addition of multi-way interactions, and that these additions can have stabilizing or destabilizing effects.</description>

      <title>Sharp arithmetic delocalization for quasiperiodic operators with potentials of semi-bounded variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain the sharp arithmetic Gordon's theorem: that is, absence of eigenvalues on the set of energies with Lyapunov exponent bounded by the exponential rate of approximation of frequency by the rationals, for a large class of one-dimensional quasiperiodic Schr\"odinger operators, with no (modulus of) continuity required. The class includes all unbounded monotone potentials with finite Lyapunov exponents and all potentials of bounded variation. The main tool is a new uniform upper bound on iterates of cocycles of bounded variation.</description>

      <title>Max-semistable extreme value laws for autoregressive processes with Cantor-like marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a family of autoregressive processes with marginal distributions resembling the Cantor function. It is shown that the marginal distribution is in the domain of attraction of a max-semistable distribution. The main result is that the extreme value law for the autoregressive process is obtained by including an extremal index in the law for an i.i.d.\ process with the same marginal distribution. Connections with extremes in deterministic dynamical systems and the relevance of max-semistable distributions in that context are also pointed out.</description>

      <title>Existence and approximate controllability results for time-fractional stochastic Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with time-fractional stochastic Navier-Stokes equations, which are characterized by the coexistence of stochastic noise and a fractional power of the Laplacian. We establish sufficient conditions for the existence and approximate controllability of a unique mild solution to time-fractional stochastic Navier-Stokes equations. Using a fixed point technique, we first demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of a mild solution to the equation under consideration. We then establish approximate controllability results by using the concepts of fractional calculus, semigroup theory, functional analysis and stochastic analysis.</description>

      <title>The random periodic solutions for McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study well-posedness of random periodic solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) of McKean-Vlasov type driven by a two-sided Brownian motion, where the random periodic behaviour is characterised by the equations' long-time behaviour. Given the well-known connection between McKean-Vlasov SDEs and interacting particle systems, we show propagation of chaos and that the key properties of the interacting particle systems recover those of the McKean-Vlasov SDEs in the particle limit. All results in the present work are shown under two settings: fully and partially dissipative case. Each setting has its challenges and limitations. For instance, weakening full dissipativity to partial dissipativity demands stronger structural assumptions on the equations' dynamics and yields random periodic behaviour in the weak sense instead of pathwise sense (as in the full dissipativity case). The proof mechanisms are close but fundamentally different.</description>

      <title>Regular Pairings for Non-quadratic Lyapunov Functions and Contraction Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies on stability and contractivity have highlighted the importance of semi-inner products, which we refer to as ``pairings'', associated with general norms. A pairing is a binary operation that relates the derivative of a curve's norm to the radius-vector of the curve and its tangent. This relationship, known as the curve norm derivative formula, is crucial when using the norm as a Lyapunov function. Another important property of the pairing, used in stability and contraction criteria, is the so-called Lumer inequality, which relates the pairing to the induced logarithmic norm. We prove that the curve norm derivative formula and Lumer's inequality are, in fact, equivalent to each other and to several simpler properties. We then introduce and characterize regular pairings that satisfy all of these properties. Our results unify several independent theories of pairings (semi-inner products) developed in previous work on functional analysis and control theory. Additionally, we introduce the polyhedral max pairing and develop computational tools for polyhedral norms, advancing contraction theory in non-Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Hamiltonian displaceability and arbitrary symplectic squeezability for critically negligible sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We call a metric space $s$-negligible iff its $s$-dimensional Hausdorff measure vanishes. We show that every countably $m$-rectifiable subset of $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ can be displaced from every $(2n-m)$-negligible subset by a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism that is arbitrarily $C^\infty$-close to the identity. As a consequence, every countably $n$-rectifiable and $n$-negligible subset of $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ is arbitrarily symplectically squeezable. Both results are sharp w.r.t. the parameter $s$ in the $s$-negligibility assumption.
  The proof of our squeezing result uses folding. Potentially, our folding method can be modified to show that the Gromov width of $B^{2n}_1\setminus A$ equals $\pi$ for every countably $(n-1)$-rectifiable closed subset $A$ of the open unit ball $B^{2n}_1$. This means that $A$ is not a barrier.</description>

      <title>No Infinite Spin for Partial Collisions converging to isolated CC on the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The infinite spin problem is a problem concerning the rotational behavior of total collision orbits in the $n$-body problem. The question also makes sense for partial collision. When a~cluster of bodies tends to a (partial) collision, then its normalized shape curve tends to the set of normalized central configurations, which in the planar case has $SO(2)$ symmetry. This leaves a possibility that the normalized shape curve tends to the circle obtained by rotation of some central configuration instead of a particular point on it. This is the \emph{infinite spin problem}. We show that it is not possible if the limiting circle is isolated from other connected components of the set of normalized central configuration. Our approach extends the method from recent work for total collision by Moeckel and Montgomery, which was based on a combination of the center manifold theorem with {\L}ojasiewicz inequality. To that we add a shadowing result for pseudo-orbits near normally hyperbolic manifold and careful estimates on the influence of other bodies on the cluster of colliding bodies.</description>

      <title>A realisation result for moduli spaces of group actions on the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a finitely generated group $G$, the possible actions of $G$ on the real line (without global fixed points), considered up to semi-conjugacy, can be encoded by the space of orbits of a flow on a compact space $(Y, \Phi)$ naturally associated with $G$ and uniquely defined up to flow equivalence, that we call the \emph{Deroin space} of $G$. We show a realisation result: every expansive flow $(Y, \Phi)$ on a compact metrisable space of topological dimension 1, satisfying some mild additional assumptions, arises as the Deroin space of a finitely generated group. This is proven by identifying the Deroin space of an explicit family of groups acting on suspension flows of subshifts, which is a variant of a construction introduced by the second and fourth authors. This result provides a source of examples of finitely generated groups satisfying various new phenomena for actions on the line, related to their rigidity/flexibility properties and to the structure of (path-)connected components of the space of actions.</description>

      <title>T(w)o patch or not t(w)o patch: A novel additional food model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A number of top down bio-control models have been proposed where the introduced predators' efficacy is enhanced via the provision of additional food (AF). However, if the predator has a pest dependent monotone functional response, pest extinction is unattainable. In the current manuscript, we propose a model where a predator with pest dependent monotone functional response is introduced into a ``patch" such as a prairie strip with AF, and then disperses or drifts into a neighboring ``patch" such as a crop field, to target a pest. We show the pest extinction state is attainable in the crop field and can be globally attracting.
  The AF model with patch structure can eliminate predator explosion present therein and can keep pest densities lower than the classical top-down bio-control model. We provide the first proof of the global stability of the interior equilibrium for the classical AF model.
  We also observe ``patch-specific chaos" - the pest occupying the crop field can oscillate chaotically, while the pest in the prairie strip oscillates periodically. We discuss these results in light of bio-control strategies that utilize state-of-the-art farming practices such as prairie strips and drift and dispersal pressures driven by climate change.</description>

      <title>On sets of matrices having different spectrum maximizing products with unequal numbers of the same name factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, J. Bochi and P. Laskawiec constructed an example of a set of matrices $\{A,B\}$ having two different (up to cyclic permutations of factors) spectrum maximizing products, $AABABB$ and $BBABAA$. In this paper, we identify a class of matrix sets for which the existence of at least one spectrum maximizing product with an odd number of factors automatically entails the existence of another spectrum maximizing product. Moreover, in addition to Bochi--Laskawiec's example, the number of factors of the same name (factors of the form $A$ or $B$) in these matrix products turns out to be different. The efficiency of the proposed approach is confirmed by constructing an example of a set of $2\times2$ matrices $\{A,B\}$ that has spectrum maximizing products of the form $BAA$ and $BBA$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Ziherl, Dotera and Bekku [17],we generalize the notion of (geometric) substitution rule to obtain overlapping substitutions. For such a substitution, the substitution matrix may have non-integer entries. We give the meaning of such a matrix by showing that the right Perron--Frobenius eigenvector gives the patch frequency of the resulting tiling. We also show that the expansion constant is an algebraic integer under mild conditions. In general, overlapping substitutions may yield a patch with contradictory overlaps of tiles, even if it is locally consistent. We give a sufficient condition for an overlapping substitution to be consistent, that is, no such contradiction will emerge. We also give many one-dimensional examples of overlapping substitution. We finish by mentioning a construction of overlapping substitutions from Delone multi-sets with inflation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Spectral Clustering on Quantum and Analog Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08486v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel hybrid quantum-analog algorithm to perform graph clustering that exploits connections between the evolution of dynamical systems on graphs and the underlying graph spectra. This approach constitutes a new class of algorithms that combine emerging quantum and analog platforms to accelerate computations. Our hybrid algorithm is equivalent to spectral clustering and has a computational complexity of $O(N)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes in the graph, compared to $O(N^3)$ scaling on classical computing platforms. The proposed method employs the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) framework on the data generated by Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics that evolves on the manifold induced by the graph Laplacian. In particular, we prove and demonstrate that one can extract the eigenvalues and scaled eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian by evolving Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics on quantum computers followed by DMD computations on analog devices.</description>
