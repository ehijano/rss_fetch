      <title>Weak mixing in rational billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We completely characterize rational polygons whose billiard flow is weakly mixing in almost every direction as those which are not almost integrable, in the terminology of Gutkin, modulo some low complexity exceptions. This proves a longstanding conjecture of Gutkin. This result is derived from a complete characterization of translation surfaces that are weakly mixing in almost every direction: they are those that do not admit an affine factor map to the circle.</description>

      <title>How many points converge to a heteroclinic network in an aperiodic way?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homoclinic and heteroclinic connections can form cycles and networks in phase space, which organize the global phenomena in dynamical systems. On the one hand, stability notions for (omni)cycles give insight into how many initial conditions approach the network along a single given (omni)cycle. On the other hand, the term switching is used to describe situations where there are trajectories that follow any possible sequence of heteroclinic connections along the network. Here we give a notion of asymptotic stability for general sequences along a network of homoclinic and heteroclinic connections. We show that there cannot be uncountably many aperiodic sequences that attract a set with nontrivial measure. Finally, we discuss examples where one may or may not expect aperiodic convergence towards a network and conclude with some open questions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11787v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We answer the question of Frantzikinakis and Host about the convergence of ergodic $(n^2,n^3)$-averages and consider a more general case. Let sequences ${ p(n)},{ q(n)}$ satisfy the property $ p(n+1)- p(n), \ q(n+1)- q(n)\ \to\ +\infty.$ Then there exist automorphisms $S,T$ with simple singular spectrum and a set $C$ such that the sequence $ \sum_{n=1}^{N} \mu(S^{ p(n)}C\cap T^{ q(n)}C)/N$ diverges. We give also sketch-example of non-recurrence for a pair of automorphisms.</description>

      <title>Multidomain Model for Optic Nerve Potassium Clearance: Roles of Glial Cells and Perivascular Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accumulation of potassium in the extracellular space surrounding nerve cells is a fundamental aspect of biophysics that has garnered significant attention in recent research. This phenomenon holds implications for various neurological conditions, including spreading depression, migraine, certain types of epilepsy, and potentially, learning processes. A quantitative analysis is essential for understanding the dynamics of potassium clearance following a series of action potentials. This clearance process involves multiple structures along the nerve, including glia, the extracellular space, axons, and the perivascular space, necessitating a spatially distributed systems approach akin to the cable equations of nerve physiology. In this study, we propose a multi-domain model for the optic nerve to investigate potassium accumulation and clearance dynamics. The model accounts for the convection, diffusion, and electrical migration of fluid and ions, revealing the significant roles of glia and the perivascular space in potassium buffering. Specifically, our findings suggest that potassium clearance primarily occurs through convective flow within the syncytia of glia, driven by osmotic pressure differences. Additionally, the perivascular space serves as a crucial pathway for potassium buffering and fluid circulation, further contributing to the overall clearance process. Importantly, our model's adaptability allows for its application to diverse structures with distinct channel and transporter distributions across the six compartments, extending its utility beyond the optic nerve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the persistency of quasi-periodic solutions to multi-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations (NLS) involving Gevrey smooth nonlinearity with an arbitrary Gevrey index $\alpha&gt;1$.
  By applying the Craig-Wayne-Bourgain (CWB) method, we establish the existence of quasi-periodic solutions that are Gevrey smooth with the same Gevrey index as the nonlinearity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a model for describing advection dynamics on distance-weighted directed graphs. To this end we establish a set of key properties, or axioms, that a discrete advection operator should satisfy, and prove that there exists an essentially unique operator satisfying all such properties. Both infinite and finite networks are considered, as well as possible variants and extensions. We illustrate the proposed model through examples, both analytical and numerical, and we describe an application to the simulation of a traffic network.</description>

      <title>pycvxset: A Python package for convex set manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces pycvxset, a new Python package to manipulate and visualize convex sets. We support polytopes and ellipsoids, and provide user-friendly methods to perform a variety of set operations. For polytopes, pycvxset supports the standard halfspace/vertex representation as well as the constrained zonotope representation. The main advantage of constrained zonotope representations over standard halfspace/vertex representations is that constrained zonotopes admit closed-form expressions for several set operations. pycvxset uses CVXPY to solve various convex programs arising in set operations, and uses pycddlib to perform vertex-halfspace enumeration. We demonstrate the use of pycvxset in analyzing and controlling dynamical systems in Python. pycvxset is available at https://github.com/merlresearch/pycvxset under the AGPL-3.0-or-later license, along with documentation and examples.</description>

      <title>The orbit-fixing deformation spaces of an action of a Lie groupoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orbit-fixing deformation spaces of $C^\infty$ locally free actions of simply connected Lie groups on closed $C^\infty$ manifolds have been studied by several authors. In this paper we reformulate the deformation space by imitating the Teichm\"{u}ller space of a surface. The new formulation seems to be more appropriate for actions of Lie groups which are not simply connected. We also consider actions which may not be locally free, and generalize the deformation spaces for actions of Lie groupoids. Furthermore by using bornologies on Lie groupoids, we make the definition of the deformation space more suitable to deal with actions on noncompact manifolds. In this generality we prove that "cocycle rigidity" implies the deformation space is a point. We compute the deformation space of the action of $\mathop{\mathrm{PSL}}(2,\mathbb{R})$ on $\Gamma\backslash\mathop{\mathrm{PSL}}(2,\mathbb{R})$ by right multiplication for a torsion free cocompact lattice $\Gamma$ in $\mathop{\mathrm{PSL}}(2,\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>Operator algebraic characterization of the noncommutative Poisson boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain an operator algebraic characterization of the noncommutative Furstenberg-Poisson boundary $\operatorname{L}(\Gamma) \subset \operatorname{L}(\Gamma \curvearrowright B)$ associated with an admissible probability measure $\mu \in \operatorname{Prob}(\Gamma)$ for which the $(\Gamma, \mu)$-Furstenberg-Poisson boundary $(B, \nu_B)$ is uniquely $\mu$-stationary. This is a noncommutative generalization of Nevo-Sageev's structure theorem [NS11]. We apply this result in combination with previous works to provide further evidence towards Connes' rigidity conjecture for higher rank lattices.</description>

      <title>Measurable splittings and the measured group theoretic structure of wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a countable group that admits an essential measurable splitting (for instance, any group measure equivalent to a free product of nontrivial groups).
  We show that, for any two nontrivial measure equivalent groups $A$ and $B$, the wreath product groups $A\wr\Gamma$ and $B\wr\Gamma$ are orbit equivalent -- this is interesting even in the case when the groups $A$ and $B$ are finite.
  On the other hand, we show that certain wreath product actions are not even stably orbit equivalent if $\Gamma$ is instead assumed to be a sofic icc group that is Bernoulli superrigid, and $A$ and $B$ have different cardinalities.</description>

      <title>Prediction of dynamical systems from time-delayed measurements with self-intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of predicting the behaviour of chaotic systems, Schroer, Sauer, Ott and Yorke conjectured in 1998 that if a dynamical system defined by a smooth diffeomorphism $T$ of a Riemannian manifold $X$ admits an attractor with a natural measure $\mu$ of information dimension smaller than $k$, then $k$ time-delayed measurements of a one-dimensional observable $h$ are generically sufficient for $\mu$-almost sure prediction of future measurements of $h$. In a previous paper we established this conjecture in the setup of injective Lipschitz transformations $T$ of a compact set $X$ in Euclidean space with an ergodic $T$-invariant Borel probability measure $\mu$. In this paper we prove the conjecture for all (also non-invertible) Lipschitz systems on compact sets with an arbitrary Borel probability measure, and establish an upper bound for the decay rate of the measure of the set of points where the prediction is subpar. This partially confirms a second conjecture by Schroer, Sauer, Ott and Yorke related to empirical prediction algorithms as well as algorithms estimating the dimension and number of required delayed measurements (the so-called embedding dimension) of an observed system. We also prove general time-delay prediction theorems for locally Lipschitz or H\"older systems on Borel sets in Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>Rank-one systems, flexible classes and Shannon orbit equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build a Shannon orbit equivalence between the universal odometer and a variety of rank-one systems. This is done in a unified manner, using what we call flexible classes of rank-one transformations. Our main result is that every flexible class contains an element which is Shannon orbit equivalent to the universal odometer. Since a typical example of flexible class is $\{T\}$ when $T$ is an odometer, our work generalizes a recent result by Kerr and Li, stating that every odometer is Shannon orbit equivalent to the universal odometer. When the flexible class is a singleton, the rank-one transformation given by the main result is explicit. This applies to odometers and Chacon's map. We also prove that strongly mixing systems, systems with a given eigenvalue, or irrational rotations whose angle belongs to any fixed open subset of the real line form flexible classes. In particular, strong mixing, rationality or irrationality of the eigenvalues are not preserved under Shannon orbit equivalence.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks for aggregation kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel physics-informed approach for accurately modeling aggregation kinetics which provides a comprehensive solution in a single run by outputting all model parameters simultaneously, a clear advancement over traditional single-output networks that require multiple executions. This method effectively captures the density distributions of both large and small clusters, showcasing a notable improvement in predicting small particles, which have historically posed challenges in computational models. This approach yields significant advancements in computational efficiency and accuracy for solving the Smoluchowski equations by minimizing the interval over which the physics-informed loss function operates, allowing for efficient computation over extended time-frames with minimal increase in computational cost. Due to the the independence of predefined shapes for bias or weight outputs, it removes the dependency on prior assumptions about output structures. Furthermore, our physics-informed framework exhibits high compatibility with the generalized Brownian kernel, maintaining robust accuracy for this previously unaddressed kernel type. The framework's notable novelty also lies in addressing four different kernels with one neural network architecture. Therefore with high computational efficiency, combined with low error margins it indicates significant potential for long-term predictions and integration into broader computational systems.</description>

      <title>On Covering Radii in Function Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we shall discuss topics in geometry of numbers in the positive characteristic setting, such as covering radii. We find a closed form for covering radii with respect to convex bodies, which will lead to a proof of the positive characteristic analogue of Woods' conjecture in this setting. Then, we will prove a positive characteristic analogue of Minkowski's conjecture about the multiplicative covering radius. To do this, we shall prove a positive characteristic analogue of Solan's result that every diagonal orbit intersects the set of well rounded lattices. This implies that the Gruber-Mordell spectrum in positive characteristic is trivial in every dimension.</description>

      <title>Conjugating trivial automorphisms of $\mathcal P(\mathbb N)/\mathrm{Fin}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A trivial automorphism of the Boolean algebra $\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin}$ is an automorphism induced by the action of some function $\mathbb N \rightarrow \mathbb N$. In models of forcing axioms all automorphisms are trivial, and therefore two trivial automorphisms are conjugate if and only if they have the same (modulo finite) cycle structure. We show that the Continuum Hypothesis implies that two trivial automorphisms are conjugate if and only if there are neither first-order obstructions nor index obstructions for their conjugacy. This is equivalent to given trivial automorphisms being conugate in some forcing extension of the universe.
  To each automorphism $\alpha$ of $\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin}$ we associate the first-order structure $\mathfrak{A}_\alpha=(\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin},\alpha)$ and compute the existential theories of these structures.
  These results are applied to resolve a question of Braga, Farah, and Vignati and prove that there are coarse metric spaces $X$ and $Y$ such that the isomorphism between their uniform Roe coronas is independent from $\mathsf{ZFC}$.</description>
