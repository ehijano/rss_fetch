      <title>Role of nanoparticle shape on the critical size for quasi-uniform ordering: from spheres to cubes through superballs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equilibrium magnetic states of single-domain magnetite nanoparticles (NPs) result from a subtle interplay between size, geometry, and magnetocrystalline anisotropy. In this work, we present a micromagnetic study of shape-controlled magnetite NPs using the superball geometry, which provides a continuous interpolation between spheres and cubes. By isolating the influence of shape, we analyze the transition from quasi-uniform (single-domain) to vortex-like states as particle size increases, revealing critical sizes that depend on the superball exponent. Our simulations show that faceted geometries promote the stabilization of vortex states at larger sizes, with marked distortions in the vortex core structure. The inclusion of cubic magnetocrystalline anisotropy, representative of magnetite, further lowers the critical size and introduces preferential alignment along the [111] easy axes. In contrast, the presence of slight particle elongation increases the critical size and induces another preferential alignment direction. These results demonstrate that even small deviations from sphericity or aspect ratio significantly alter the magnetic ordering and stability of equilibrium magnetic states.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Inorganic Materials Discovery via Multi-Agent Physics-Aware Scientific Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional machine learning approaches accelerate inorganic materials design via accurate property prediction and targeted material generation, yet they operate as single-shot models limited by the latent knowledge baked into their training data. A central challenge lies in creating an intelligent system capable of autonomously executing the full inorganic materials discovery cycle, from ideation and planning to experimentation and iterative refinement. We introduce SparksMatter, a multi-agent AI model for automated inorganic materials design that addresses user queries by generating ideas, designing and executing experimental workflows, continuously evaluating and refining results, and ultimately proposing candidate materials that meet the target objectives. SparksMatter also critiques and improves its own responses, identifies research gaps and limitations, and suggests rigorous follow-up validation steps, including DFT calculations and experimental synthesis and characterization, embedded in a well-structured final report. The model's performance is evaluated across case studies in thermoelectrics, semiconductors, and perovskite oxides materials design. The results demonstrate the capacity of SparksMatter to generate novel stable inorganic structures that target the user's needs. Benchmarking against frontier models reveals that SparksMatter consistently achieves higher scores in relevance, novelty, and scientific rigor, with a significant improvement in novelty across multiple real-world design tasks as assessed by a blinded evaluator. These results demonstrate SparksMatter's unique capacity to generate chemically valid, physically meaningful, and creative inorganic materials hypotheses beyond existing materials knowledge.</description>

      <title>Observation of Anomalous Hall Effect in Bulk Single Crystals of n-type Cr-doped Sb$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ Magnetic Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of topological Dirac surface states is significant in the realms of condensed matter physics and future technological innovations. Among the materials garnering attention is Sb$_{2}$Te$_{3}$, a compound that theoretically exhibits topological insulating properties. However, its inherent p-type nature prevents the direct experimental verification of its Dirac surface state due to the Fermi level alignment with the valence band. In this study, by doping Cr atoms into Sb$_{2}$Te$_{3}$, n-type behavior is observed in the Hall resistance measurements. Remarkably, the Cr-doped Sb$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ not only shows ferromagnetism with a high transition temperature of approximately 170 K but also exhibits an anomalous Hall effect (AHE). The Cr doping also allows for a controlled method for Fermi level tuning into the band gap. These properties spotlight its potential as an n-type magnetic topological insulator (MTI) as well as a material candidate for the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), opening new avenues for applications in spintronics and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>The Open DAC 2025 Dataset for Sorbent Discovery in Direct Air Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying useful sorbent materials for direct air capture (DAC) from humid air remains a challenge. We present the Open DAC 2025 (ODAC25) dataset, a significant expansion and improvement upon ODAC23 (Sriram et al., ACS Central Science, 10 (2024) 923), comprising nearly 70 million DFT single-point calculations for CO$_2$, H$_2$O, N$_2$, and O$_2$ adsorption in 15,000 MOFs. ODAC25 introduces chemical and configurational diversity through functionalized MOFs, high-energy GCMC-derived placements, and synthetically generated frameworks. ODAC25 also significantly improves upon the accuracy of DFT calculations and the treatment of flexible MOFs in ODAC23. Along with the dataset, we release new state-of-the-art machine-learned interatomic potentials trained on ODAC25 and evaluate them on adsorption energy and Henry's law coefficient predictions.</description>

      <title>An Analytic Model to Determine the Interstitial-Solute Energetics and Underlying Mechanism in Refractory High-Entropy Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solution and diffusion of interstitial non-metallic solutes (INSs) like H, He, O, C, N, P, and S is common in refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) and essentially controls the RHEAs properties. However, the disorder local chemical environments of RHEAs hinder the quantitative prediction of the stability and diffusivity of INSs and the understanding of the underlying mechanism. Based on the tight-binding models, we propose an analytic model for determining the stability and diffusivity of INSs in RHEAs, by approximating the bonding length between INSs and their neighbors with the atomic radius of the neighbors in elemental states. This predictive model identifies that the energetics of INSs depends linearly on the d-band width of their neighbors, with the slope determined by the valence of INSs. Our scheme provides an electronic-level understanding of INSs in RHEAs and explains key experimental observations, which can serve as an effective tool for designing advanced RHEAs.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence and Generative Models for Materials Discovery -- A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High throughput experimentation tools, machine learning (ML) methods, and open material databases are radically changing the way new materials are discovered. From the experimentally driven approach in the past, we are moving quickly towards the artificial intelligence (AI) driven approach, realizing the 'inverse design' capabilities that allow the discovery of new materials given the desired properties. This review aims to discuss different principles of AI-driven generative models that are applicable for materials discovery, including different materials representations available for this purpose. We will also highlight specific applications of generative models in designing new catalysts, semiconductors, polymers, or crystals while addressing challenges such as data scarcity, computational cost, interpretability, synthesizability, and dataset biases. Emerging approaches to overcome limitations and integrate AI with experimental workflows will be discussed, including multimodal models, physics informed architectures, and closed-loop discovery systems. This review aims to provide insights for researchers aiming to harness AI's transformative potential in accelerating materials discovery for sustainability, healthcare, and energy innovation.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Coupled Polarization and BKT Transitions in Tow-Dimensional Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extended two-dimensional XY rotor model specifically designed to capture the polarization dynamics of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite monolayers. This framework integrates nearest and next-nearest neighbor couplings, crystalline anisotropy inherent to perovskite lattice symmetries, external bias fields, and long-range dipolar interactions that are prominent in layered perovskite architectures. Through a combination of analytical coarse-graining and large-scale Monte Carlo simulations on 64*64 lattices, we identify two distinct thermodynamic regimes: a low-temperature quasi-ferroelectric state characterized by finite polarization and domain wall formation, and a higher-temperature Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) crossover associated with vortex-antivortex unbinding and the suppression of long-range order. Our results reproduce key experimental signatures observed in quasi-two-dimensional perovskites, including dual peaks in dielectric susceptibility, enhanced vortex density near the transition, multistable polarization hysteresis under applied fields, and the scaling behavior of domain wall widths. This minimal yet realistic model provides a unifying perspective on how topological transitions and ferroelectric ordering coexist in layered perovskite systems, offering quantitative guidance for interpreting the emergent polar vortex lattices and complex phase behavior recently reported in hybrid perovskite thin films.</description>

      <title>Machine learning potential for predicting thermal conductivity of {\theta}-phase and amorphous Tantalum Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tantalum nitride (TaN) has attracted considerable attention due to its unique electronic and thermal properties, high thermal conductivity, and applications in electronic components. However, for the {\theta}-phase of TaN, significant discrepancies exist between previous experimental measurements and theoretical predictions. In this study, deep potential models for TaN in both the {\theta}-phase and amorphous phase were developed and employed in molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the thermal conductivities of bulk and nanofilms. The simulation results were compared with reported experimental and theoretical results, and the mechanism for differences were discussed. This study provides insights into the thermal transport mechanisms of TaN, offering guidance for its application in advanced electronic and thermal management devices.</description>

      <title>Thermal Metamaterials for Enhanced Non-Fourier Heat Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The untapped potential of thermal metamaterials requires the simultaneous observation of both diffusive and wave-like heat propagation across multiple length scales that can only be realised through theories beyond Fourier. Here, we demonstrate that tailored material patterning significantly modifies heat transport dynamics with enhanced non-Fourier behaviour. By bridging phonon scattering mechanisms with macroscopic heat flux via a novel perturbation-theory approach, we derive the hyperbolic Cattaneo model directly from particle dynamics, establishing a direct link between relaxation time and phonon lifetimes. Our micro-scale patterned systems exhibit extended non-Fourier characteristics, where internal interfaces mediate wave-like energy propagation, diverging sharply from diffusive Fourier predictions. These results provide a unified framework connecting micro-scale interactions to macroscopic transport, resolving long-standing limitations of the Cattaneo model. This work underscores the transformative potential of thermal metamaterials for ultra-fast thermal management and nanoscale energy applications, laying a theoretical foundation for next-generation thermal technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-scale plasticity and creep behavior of a Zr-based BMG were investigated using nanoindentation. Four load functions, differing only in hold times of 0, 10, 30, and 60 seconds at peak load, were applied. Results indicate spatially heterogeneous and time-sensitive plastic behavior. Machine learning clustering, based on hardness and creep displacement, suggested three clusters. Statistical analysis of plastic energy distributions enabled identification of potential deformation mechanisms within the clusters.</description>

      <title>Model Accuracy and Data Heterogeneity Shape Uncertainty Quantification in Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable accurate atomistic modelling, but reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains elusive. In this study, we investigate two UQ strategies, ensemble learning and D-optimality, within the atomic cluster expansion framework. It is revealed that higher model accuracy strengthens the correlation between predicted uncertainties and actual errors and improves novelty detection, with D-optimality yielding more conservative estimates. Both methods deliver well calibrated uncertainties on homogeneous training sets, yet they underpredict errors and exhibit reduced novelty sensitivity on heterogeneous datasets. To address this limitation, we introduce clustering-enhanced local D-optimality, which partitions configuration space into clusters during training and applies D-optimality within each cluster. This approach substantially improves the detection of novel atomic environments in heterogeneous datasets. Our findings clarify the roles of model fidelity and data heterogeneity in UQ performance and provide a practical route to robust active learning and adaptive sampling strategies for MLIP development.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-breaking-induced topology in FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FeSe has been one of the most intensively studied iron-based superconductors over the past two decades, exhibiting a wide range of phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, nematic order, magnetism, orbital-selective correlations, and structural phase transitions. While topologically non-trivial phases have been identified in certain cases - such as Te-doped FeSe and monolayer FeSe - topology in bulk FeSe has largely remained unexplored. In this work, we propose a new route to realize topological phases directly in bulk FeSe. We demonstrate that breaking the in-plane $C_4$ rotational symmetry, thereby lowering the crystal symmetry, can drive FeSe into a strong topological insulating phase. To support this, we perform density functional theory calculations and analyze the band structure using topological quantum chemistry and symmetry-based indicators. Our results show that both uniaxial strain and the structural transition to the orthorhombic low-temperature phase lead to non-trivial band topology. Moreover, incorporating electronic correlations through dynamical mean field theory reveals that the topological characteristics near the Fermi level remain robust, as the relevant bands experience only moderate renormalization. These findings highlight strain as a promising mechanism to induce topological phases in FeSe.</description>

      <title>Tentative demonstration of all-silicon photodetector: from near-infrared to mid-infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metastable silicon phases have attracted extensive attention these years, due to their fundamentally distinct photoelectric properties compared to the conventional diamond cubic (I) counterpart. Certain metastable phases, prepared via thermal heating method, can exhibit direct bandgap characteristics, significantly enhancing their light absorbance and quantum efficiency. Herein, we tentatively demonstrate an all-silicon photodetector working from near- to mid-infrared bands through precisely selective laser annealing strategy. We systematically investigated the optical properties and optoelectronic response of III/XII mixture, IV phase, and III/XII-I homojunctions. The obtained results reveal that III/XII composite and IV phase exhibit negative and positive photoconductivity, respectively. Furthermore, the established laser heating approach facilitates us to fabricate all-silicon homostructures with tunable photoconductive properties, such as III/XII-I and IV-I junctions. These findings can expand the potential applications of metastable semiconducting materials in optoelectronics and photodetectors.</description>

      <title>Revealing Polymorph-Specific Transduction in WO$_3$ during Acetone Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymorphs are distinct structural forms of the same compound and offer unique opportunities to tailor material properties without altering chemical composition. In particular, the polymorphs of WO$_3$ have been widely explored for their molecular sensing performance; yet, the mechanistic aspects behind their different chemoresistive properties have remained elusive or poorly understood. Here, we highlight the energetic allocation of transferred charge as a critical aspect for chemoresistive response generation, providing a new perspective beyond more conventional net-transfer metrics, which are usually deployed to investigate gas-solid interactions. To this, we combined operando work function, chemisorption analysis, and in situ spectroscopy with density functional theory calculations on the example of acetone. Both gamma- and $\varepsilon$-WO$_3$ exhibit comparable surface-level activation of acetone, mediated by electron-deficient, coordinatively unsaturated tungsten sites. However, only $\varepsilon$-WO$_3$ stabilizes analyte-induced electronic states derived from W(5d) orbitals lying just below the conduction band - an energetically favourable region for conductivity modulation under operating conditions. While being associated with marginal work function shifts, these states reflect deeper subsurface electronic rearrangements that may underlie the $\varepsilon$-WO$_3$'s superior transduction efficiency despite similar receptor chemistry. Our results offer a new framework for rational transducer development rooted in intrinsic electronic structure.</description>

      <title>High-temperature and high-pressure study on columbite structured ZnNb2O6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-temperature and high-pressure experiments were conducted on columbite-type ZnNb2O6, reaching temperatures up to 873 K at ambient pressure and pressures up to 30 GPa at ambient temperature, respectively. Through systematic analysis employing synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, we examined the crystal structure and phonon behavior. Within the specified temperature range, the orthorhombic phase of ZnNb2O6 (space group: Pbcn) demonstrated notable phase stability, with a thermal expansion coefficient similar to that of isomorphic compounds. Notably, a reversible phase transition was observed under compression at 10 GPa, with diffraction experiments indicating a shift to a monoclinic structure (space group P2/a), which remained stable up to 30 GPa. Changes in Raman modes, lattice parameters, and the unit-cell volume were monitored. A significant 2.5% discontinuity in the unit-cell volume at the phase transition pressure from orthorhombic to monoclinic suggests a first-order phase transition. The bulk moduli of the orthorhombic and monoclinic phases were estimated as 165(7) GPa and 230(9) GPa, respectively- We also found that both phases exhibit an anisotropic response to pressure. Furthermore, first-principles calculations support consistently with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Materials for Light Dark Matter Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the use of several unconventional materials as detectors for dark matter with mass beneath the MeV scale. These include the transition-metal dichalcogenide TiSe$_2$ hosting a low-energy plasmon in the charge-density-wave phase, Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ containing a low-energy acoustic demon mode, and hole-doped diamond with tunable optical and acoustic plasmon frequencies. We perform first-principles density functional theory computations of their loss functions at non-vanishing momenta and establish their reach into light dark matter parameter space. We show that due to intense low-energy plasmon modes -- of different microscopic origin in each -- the reach of detectors based on these materials could surpass existing proposals by several orders of magnitude for both dark matter scattering and absorption on electrons. The anisotropic response of these materials, which enables directional detection, renders them exceptionally strong detector candidates, motivating the design and fabrication of future devices.</description>

      <title>Mechanical characterization of pharmaceutical powders and correlation with their behavior during grinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the size of powder particles is pivotal in the design of many pharmaceutical forms and the related manufacturing processes and plants. One of the most common techniques for particle size reduction in process industry is powder milling, whose efficiency relates to the mechanical properties of powder particles themselves. In this work, we first characterize the elastic and plastic response of different pharmaceutical powders by measuring their Young modulus, the hardness and the brittleness index via nano-indentation. Subsequently, we analyze the behavior of those powder samples during comminution via jet-mill at different process conditions. Finally, the correlation between single particle mechanical properties and milling process results is illustrated; the possibility to build a predictive model for powder grindability, based on nano-indentation data, is critically discussed</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry of Altermagnetic Magnons Probed by Light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnons with momentum-dependent chirality are a key signature of altermagnets. We identify bicircular light as a smoking-gun optical probe for chiral altermagnetic magnons, selectively targeting their quantum geometry induced by an alteration of magnonic chirality. We show that in $d$-wave altermagnets, under a canting magnetic field, the altermagnetic magnons realize a nontrivial quantum geometry, resulting in an enhancement of the nonlinear second-order light-magnon interactions. We find that the scattering of bicircular pulses probes the present magnon quantum geometry, even if the magnonic topology is trivial. Hence, our findings establish bicircular Raman response as an optical effect of choice to identify altermagnetic magnons. As such, we propose a universal experimental protocol to distinguish altermagnets from antiferromagnets by detecting their magnon chirality patterns with light, independently of the underlying magnon topology.</description>

      <title>Electronic ordering driven by flat band nesting in a van der Waals magnet Fe5GeTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state systems with flat electronic bands have a theoretical propensity to form electronic orders such as superconductivity and charge-density waves. However, for many flat-band systems such as Kagome and Clover lattices, the flat bands do not naturally appear at the Fermi level, hence not driving the low-energy electronic ordering. Here we demonstrate the concurrent formation of flat bands at the Fermi level and a $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}\, R30^\circ$ charge order in a van der Waals magnet Fe5GeTe2 using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. This charge order is manifested by clear band structure folding below 100 K, yet the band folding is limited to 30 meV below the Fermi level where the flat bands reside. The nesting vector in the reciprocal space connects segments of Fermi surfaces where pronounced flat bands are discovered. Taken together with calculations of the Lindhard response function, our results establish Fe5GeTe2 as a model system where flat bands promote inter-band nesting and electronic ordering. The appearance of the flat band at the Fermi level is reminiscent of the Kondo lattice effect, yet we point out that the flat bands may originate from the abundance of vacancies in the Fe(1) sublattice, where the vacancies induce flat dispersions via destructive charge or spin interactions.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Light-Induced Coherent Phonons Mediated by Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-induced coherent phonons provide a powerful platform for ultrafast control of material properties. However, the microscopic theory and quantum geometric nature of this phenomenon remain underexplored. Here, we develop a fully quantum-mechanical framework based on Feynman diagrams to systematically describe the generation of coherent phonons by light. We identify a dominant second-order, double-resonant process in noncentrosymmetric semiconductors that efficiently couples light to both electronic and phononic excitations. Crucially, we uncover the quantum geometric origin, encoded in the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) shift vector and the EPC quantum geometric tensor. Applying our theory to ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ and SnSe, we demonstrate the potential for light-induced modulation of ferroelectric polarization driven by coherent phonons. This work provides fundamental insights for designing efficient optical control strategies for both coherent phonons and ferroelectric polarization.</description>

      <title>Magnon Spin Current Modulation through Site-Specific Doping in a Compensated Iron Garnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the impact of manganese doping at the iron sites in Gadolinium Iron Garnet (GdIG, Gd$_{3}$Fe$_{5}$O$_{12}$), employing temperature-dependent spin Seebeck effect and ferromagnetic resonance measurements. Our findings reveal a clear shift in the magnetic compensation temperature ($T_{comp}$) in Mn-doped GdIG, with minimal changes observed in the magnetic and damping properties. Notably, the spin Seebeck signal strength was enhanced significantly with the Mn doping. This enhancement is attributed to an increased spin mixing conductance and modifications in the magnon spectra that strengthen exchange interactions, highlighting the material's potential for room-temperature spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Interstitial oxygen order and its competition with superconductivity in La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has attracted significant interest in condensed matter physics. While early samples exhibited limited superconducting volume fractions, Pr substitution for La enabled bulk superconductivity in polycrystals under pressure and enhanced transition temperatures in thin films at ambient pressure. Beyond rare-earth doping, moderate oxygen or ozone annealing improves superconductivity by mitigating oxygen vacancies, whereas high-pressure oxygen annealing leads to a trivial, non-superconducting metallic state across all pressure regimes. These findings highlight the need to elucidate both the individual and combined effects of Pr doping and oxygen stoichiometry in modulating superconductivity in bilayer nickelates. Here, using multislice electron ptychography and electron energy-loss spectroscopy, we investigate the structural and electronic properties of as-grown La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ and high-pressure-oxygen-annealed La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$ polycrystals. We find that Pr dopants preferentially occupy outer La sites, effectively eliminating inner-apical oxygen vacancies and ensuring near-stoichiometry in as-grown La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ that is bulk-superconducting under pressure. In contrast, high-pressure oxygen annealing induces a striped interstitial oxygen order, introducing quasi-1D lattice potentials and excess hole carriers into p-d hybridized orbitals, ultimately suppressing superconductivity. This behavior starkly contrasts with cuprate superconductors, where similar interstitial oxygen ordering enhances superconductivity instead. Our findings reveal a competition between striped interstitial oxygen order and superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, offering key insights into their distinct pairing mechanisms and providing a roadmap for designing more robust superconducting phases.</description>

Abstract: Aside from recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models, specialized AI hardware is crucial to address large volumes of unstructured and dynamic data. Hardware-based AI, built on conventional complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor (CMOS)-technology, faces several critical challenges including scaling limitation of devices [1, 2], separation of computation and memory units [3] and most importantly, overall system energy efficiency [4]. While numerous materials with emergent functionalities have been proposed to overcome these limitations, scalability, reproducibility, and compatibility remain critical obstacles [5, 6]. Here, we demonstrate oxide-interface based polymorphic electronic devices with programmable transistor, memristor, and memcapacitor functionalities by manipulating the quasi-two-dimensional electron gas in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures [7, 8] using lateral gates. A circuit utilizing two polymorphic functionalities of transistor and memcapacitor exhibits nonlinearity and short-term memory, enabling implementation in physical reservoir computing. An integrated circuit incorporating transistor and memristor functionalities is utilized for the transition from short- to long-term synaptic plasticity and for logic operations, along with in-situ logic output storage. The same circuit with advanced reconfigurable synaptic logic operations presents high-level multi-input decision-making tasks, such as patient-monitoring in healthcare applications. Our findings pave the way for oxide-based monolithic integrated circuits in a scalable, silicon compatible, energy efficient single platform, advancing both the polymorphic and neuromorphic computings.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Hall Effect with Extended Topologically Protected Features in Altermangetic Multilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional topological classification theory dictates that time-reversal symmetry confines the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification, permitting only a single pair of gapless helical edge states. Here, we utilize the recently discovered altermagnetism to circumvent this fundamental constraint. We demonstrate the realization of a unique QSH phase possessing multiple pairs of gapless helical edge states in altermagnetic multilayers. This exotic QSH phase, characterized by a mirror-spin Chern number, emerges from the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and $d$-wave altermagnetic ordering. Moreover, using first-principles calculations, we identify altermagnetic Fe$_2$Se$_2$O multilayers as promising material candidates, in which the number of gapless helical edge states scales linearly with the number of layers, leading to a correspondingly large, exactly quantized, and experimentally accessible spin-Hall conductance. Our findings unveil a new mechanism for stabilizing multiple pairs of gapless helical edge states, significantly expanding the scope of QSH effects, and provide a blueprint for utilizing altermagnetism to engineer desired topological phases.</description>

      <title>$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$--Based Radiation Detector for Proton Therapy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) is an advanced cancer treatment modality that offers significant advantages over conventional X-ray therapies, particularly in its ability to minimize radiation dose beyond the tumor target. This reduction in unnecessary irradiation exposure significantly lowers the risk to surrounding healthy tissue and reduces side effects compared to conventional X-ray treatments. However, due to the high complexity of IMPT plans, each plan must be independently validated to ensure the safety and efficacy of the radiation exposure to the patient. While ion chambers are currently used for this purpose, their limitations-particularly in angled-beam measurements and multi-depth assessments-hinder their effectiveness. Silicon-based detectors, commonly used in X-ray therapy, are unsuitable for IMPT due to their rapid degradation under proton irradiation. In this study, a $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$-based metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) detector was evaluated and compared with a commercial ion chamber using a MEVION S250i proton accelerator. The $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ detector demonstrated reliable detection of single-pulse proton doses as low as 0.26 MU and exhibited a linear charge-to-dose relationship across a wide range of irradiation conditions. Furthermore, its measurement variability was comparable to that of the ion chamber, with improved sensitivity observed at higher bias voltages. These results highlight the strong potential of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ as a radiation-hard detector material for accurate dose verification in IMPT.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological model for the direct and inverse Edelstein effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:1901.03095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed a phenomenological model that connects the direct and the inverse Edelstein effects. Our model implies a trade-off relation between the conversion coefficients for the direct and inverse effects. Thus, a large conversion coefficient for the inverse effect does not necessarily bring a large conversion coefficient for the direct effect. Instead of these coefficients, we propose a figure of merit of Edelstein effects which consists of two factors; one of them represents the magnitude of the spin-orbit coupling, and the other represents the strength of the hybridization between bulk and interface states. Both of them are quit important for the efficient conversion through Edelstein effects. To test our model, we measured the inverse and direct Edelstein effects at the Bi2O3/Cu interface using spin absorption method with a non-local spin valve structure and calculated the conversion coefficients. The effective spin Hall angle reaches ~0.09 in this system. This relatively large value is attributable to not only the large spin-orbit coupling but also the strong hybridization between the interface and bulk states at the Bi2O3/Cu interface.</description>

Abstract: We present the framework of \textit{spin quantum geometry}, which is fundamentally linked to the spin degree of freedom of Bloch electrons and incorporates both the spin quantum geometric tensor (QGT) and the recently introduced Zeeman QGT, to elucidate the spin transport. We show that the spin and Zeeman QGTs, respectively, provide a unified framework for revealing known spin currents, such as the intrinsic spin Hall effect, and spin magnetization, such as the Edelstein effect, of Bloch electrons under an electric field. In addition, we predict the linear displacement spin Hall effect, wherein an AC electric field induces a transverse spin current in insulating systems. Furthermore, we propose two novel nonlinear spin responses: the nonlinear Drude spin current (NDSC) and the nonlinear Drude spin magnetization (NDSM), both of which exhibit a quadratic dependence on the relaxation time, like the nonlinear Drude charge current, and are governed by the \textit{spin quantum geometry}. Finally, we evaluate the NDSC and NDSM with Dirac models of topological insulators and find that, in the moderately dirty regime, the NDSC and NDSM can exceed their respective nonlinear intrinsic counterparts, which have recently garnered significant interest in spintronics.</description>

      <title>CrystalGRW: Generative Modeling of Crystal Structures with Targeted Properties via Geodesic Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining whether a candidate crystalline material is thermodynamically stable depends on identifying its true ground-state structure, a central challenge in computational materials science. We introduce CrystalGRW, a diffusion-based generative model on Riemannian manifolds that proposes novel crystal configurations and can predict stable phases validated by density functional theory. The crystal properties, such as fractional coordinates, atomic types, and lattice matrices, are represented on suitable Riemannian manifolds, ensuring that new predictions generated through the diffusion process preserve the periodicity of crystal structures. We incorporate an equivariant graph neural network to also account for rotational and translational symmetries during the generation process. CrystalGRW demonstrates the ability to generate realistic crystal structures that are close to their ground states with accuracy comparable to existing models, while also enabling conditional control, such as specifying a desired crystallographic point group. These features help accelerate materials discovery and inverse design by offering stable, symmetry-consistent crystal candidates for experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Energy profile and hopping barriers for small electron polarons at ferroelectric domain walls in bismuth ferrite from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evidence from first-principles calculations indicates that excess electrons in BiFeO$_3$ form small polarons with energy levels deep inside the electronic band gap. Hence, $n$-type electronic transport could occur by hopping of small electron polarons rather than by band-like transport. Here, by means of first-principles calculations, small electron polaron hopping in BiFeO$_3$ is investigated. Both bulk BiFeO$_3$ and a typical ferroelectric domain wall, the neutral 71{\deg} domain wall, are considered. The latter is included to account for experimental observations of electrical conductivity at domain walls in otherwise insulating ferroelectrics. The object of this study is to shed light on the intrinsic electron conduction in rhombohedral BiFeO$_3$ and the effect of pristine neutral ferroelectric domain walls. The computed energy barriers for small electron polaron hopping are near 0.2 eV, similar to other perovskite oxides, both in the bulk and within the neutral 71\deg\ domain wall. Trapping energies of small electron polarons at the three prevalent domain walls, the 71\deg, the 109\deg, and the 180\deg\ wall, were determined. The domain walls are found to act as two-dimensional traps for small electron polarons, with a trap depth of about two times the thermal energy at room temperature. Based on these findings, the intrinsic $n$-type mobility and the diffusion constant in BiFeO$_3$ at room temperature are estimated, and experimental conductivity data for BiFeO$_3$ are discussed.</description>

      <title>PET-MAD, a lightweight universal interatomic potential for advanced materials modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have greatly extended the reach of atomic-scale simulations, offering the accuracy of first-principles calculations at a fraction of the cost. Leveraging large quantum mechanical databases and expressive architectures, recent ''universal'' models deliver qualitative accuracy across the periodic table but are often biased toward low-energy configurations. We introduce PET-MAD, a generally applicable MLIP trained on a dataset combining stable inorganic and organic solids, systematically modified to enhance atomic diversity. Using a moderate but highly-consistent level of electronic-structure theory, we assess PET-MAD's accuracy on established benchmarks and advanced simulations of six materials. Despite the small training set and lightweight architecture, PET-MAD is competitive with state-of-the-art MLIPs for inorganic solids, while also being reliable for molecules, organic materials, and surfaces. It is stable and fast, enabling the near-quantitative study of thermal and quantum mechanical fluctuations, functional properties, and phase transitions out of the box. It can be efficiently fine-tuned to deliver full quantum mechanical accuracy with a minimal number of targeted calculations.</description>

      <title>Atomic scale structure and dynamical properties of (TeO$_2$)$_{1-x}$-(Na$_2$O)$_{x}$ glasses through first-principles modeling and XRD measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We resort to first-principles molecular dynamics, in synergy with experiments, to study structural evolution and Na$^+$ cation diffusion inside (TeO$_2$)$_{1-x}$-(Na$_2$O)$_{x}$ (x = 0.10-0.40) glasses. Experimental and modeling results show a fair quantitative agreement in terms of total X-ray structure factors and pair distribution functions, thereby setting the ground for a comprehensive analysis of the glassy matrix evolution. We find that the structure of (TeO$_2$)$_{1-x}$-(Na$_2$O)$_{x}$ glasses deviates drastically from that of pure TeO$_2$ glass. Specifically, increasing the Na$_2$O concentration leads to a reduction of the coordination number of Te atoms, reflecting the occurrence of a structural depolymerization upon introduction of the Na$_2$O modifier oxide. The depolymerization phenomenon is ascribed to the transformation of Te-O-Te bridges into terminal Te-O non bridging oxygen atoms (NBO). Consequently, the concentration of NBO increases in these systems as the concentration of the modifier increases, accompanied by a concomitant reduction in the coordination number of Na atoms. The structure factors results show a prominent peak at 1.4 A, that becomes more and more pronounced as the Na2O concentration increases. The occurrence of this first sharp diffraction peak is attributed to the growth of Na-rich channels inside the amorphous network, acting as preferential routes for alkali-ion conduction inside the relatively stable Te-O matrix. These channels enhance the ion mobility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review synthesizes recent advancements in the study of moir\'e magnetism. This emerging field, at the intersection of twistronics, topology, and strongly correlated systems, explores novel phenomena that arise when moir\'e potentials influence the magnetism of two-dimensional systems. The manuscript presents recent advances highlighting the interfacial incongruity as a novel mechanism for regulating the magnetism of two-dimensional materials and for the manifestation of various phenomena in twisted and mismatched magnetic two-dimensional interfaces. The manuscript addresses seminal and recent experimental and theoretical advances associated with both small- and large-period magnetic moir\'e lattices, including novel magnetic phases, low-energy and topological magnetic excitations, magnetic and electronic transport, optical properties, phase transitions, and prospective applications of these materials. Moir\'e magnetism signifies a promising frontier for manipulating complex quantum states in quantum matter. The ongoing advances in this field are poised to impact condensed matter physics, materials science, and quantum information science.</description>

Abstract: Radiation hardness of scintillating nanocomposites consisting of inorganic scintillating nanocrystalline powders dispersed in organic matrices was studied under electron, X-ray and {\gamma}-ray irradiation. Samples including pure press-compacted pellets of powder ZnO:Ga and YSO:Ce, and the nanocomposites of powder ZnO:Ga and YSO:Ce embedded in polystyrene matrix with different fillings were investigated. Effects of radiation on radioluminescence and other optical properties of studied materials were evaluated. Bright burn effect related to nanocrystalline powder scintillators was observed at lower doses. Radiation damage in nanocomposite materials is related to the formation of radicals in polystyrene matrix. Extent of radiation damage decreases with ZnO:Ga filling. Presented results show the importance of systematic and complex study of the radiation stability of composite scintillators.</description>

      <title>Magnetic and ferroelectric phase diagram of twisted CrI$_3$ layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisting layers provide a rich ore for exotic physics in low dimensions. Despite the abundant discoveries of twistronics from the aspect of electronic structures, ferroic moir\'e textures are more plain and thus less concerned. Rigid lattice models are straightforward which can give a rough but intuitional description in most cases. However, taking CrI$_3$ as a model system, here we will demonstrate that the interlayer stacking potential can spontaneously lead to structural relaxation, which plays a vital role to understand the ferroicity in the twisted superlattices. The magnetic ground state is sensitive to the stacking mode and twisting angles, which can be seriously affected by the structural relaxation. In particular, the expected magnetic bubbles are annihilated in its bilayer. In contrast, due to topological protection, the ferroelectric vortices are more robust to structural relaxation, as well as twisting angle and thickness.Due to the universal existence of spontaneous structural relaxation in twisted superlattices, our work may lead to a general revisitation of emerging physics of twistronics.</description>

      <title>Anomalous charge density wave in altermagnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploring the intricate interplay between magnetism and charge density waves has long been a fundamental pursuit at the forefront of condensed matter research. In this letter, based on symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we propose for the first time that anomalous charge density wave can be realized in two-dimensional altermagnetic WO. The anomalous charge density wave is characterized by three key features: (i) Unlike conventional charge density wave, whose stabilization is driven by the opening of a gap near the Fermi level, the anomalous charge density wave is stabilized by the occupied states with energies shifting lower far away from the Fermi level; (ii) the anomalous charge density wave increases the density of states near the Fermi level and then enhances-rather than diminishes-the metallicity of materials; (iii) altermagnetism plays a crucial role in stabilizing anomalous charge density wave. Thus, our work offers a pathway for exploring both the realization and the underlying mechanisms of anomalous charge density waves in magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative macroscopic theory of interfaces with discontinuous dielectric constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discontinuity of dielectric constants at the interface is a common feature of all nanostructures and semiconductor heterostructures. Near such interfaces, a charged particle creates a singular self-interaction potential which may be attributed to interaction with fictitious mirror charges. The singularity of this interaction at the interface presents an obstruction to a perturbative approach. In several limiting cases, this problem can be avoided by zeroing out the carrier wave function at the interface. In this paper, we developed a non-perturbative theory which gives a self-consistent description of carrier propagation through an interface with dielectric discontinuity. It is based on conservation of the current density propagating through the interface, and it is formulated in terms of general boundary conditions (GBC) for the wave function at the interface with a single phenomenological parameter W. For these GBC, we find exact solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation near the interface and the carrier energy spectrum including resonances. Using these results, we describe the photo effect at the semiconductor/vacuum interface and the electron energy spectrum in the interface quantum well, as well as the dependence of these two phenomena on the interface parameter W.</description>

      <title>Light-induced Odd-parity Magnetism in Conventional Collinear Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have drawn growing attention on non-relativistic odd-parity magnetism in the wake of altermagnets. Nevertheless, odd-parity spin splitting is often believed to appear in non-collinear magnetic configurations. Here, using symmetry arguments and effective model analysis, we show that Floquet engineering offers a universal strategy for achieving odd-parity magnetism in two-dimensional (2D) collinear antiferromagnets under irradiation of periodic driving light fields such as circularly polarized light, elliptically polarized light, and bicircular light. A comprehensive classification of potential candidates for collinear monolayer or bilayer antiferromagnets is established. Strikingly, the light-induced odd-parity spin splitting can be flexibly controlled by adjusting the crystalline symmetry or the polarization state of incident light, enabling the reversal or conversion of spin-splitting. By combining first-principles calculations and Floquet theorem, we present illustrative examples of 2D collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials to verify the light-induced odd-parity magnetism. Our work not only offers a powerful approach for uniquely achieving odd-parity spin-splitting with high tunability, but also expands the potential of Floquet engineering in designing unconventional compensated magnetism.</description>
