      <title>Post-collision interaction in the liquid phase: the role of electron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a detailed study of post-collision interaction (PCI) in a liquid medium. We investigate PCI for the Auger KLL electrons of solvated Cl$^-$, K$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$. All three isoelectronic ions exhibit a very similar PCI behavior, which is little affected by changing the solvent from water to methanol or ethanol. The two main factors modifying the PCI interaction in condensed media is the screening of Coulombic interactions, and scattering of the electrons. The experimental results are compared with the predictions of a previously reported semi-classical PCI theory modified to account for screening and scattering. We show that a better agreement with experiment can be obtained by instead modeling scattering using electron transport Monte-Carlo simulations. We suggest that, in turn, PCI experimental data could be used as another experimental constraint to refine the currently insufficiently well-known scattering parameters of low-energy electrons in water, which are crucial in many fields.</description>

      <title>Reducing the Cost of Energy Differences in Variational Monte Carlo with Spotlight Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an approximate sampling scheme that can significantly reduce the cost scaling of variational Monte Carlo when it is employed to predict the energy differences associated with local chemical changes. Inspired by side-chaining and embedding methods, this spotlight sampling approach adopts an approximate fragmented Hamiltonian and correlated sampling to reduce cost scaling to the point that it is essentially linear with system size, with the potential to go sub-linear if certain conditions are met. In tests on bond stretching energies in alcohols and hydrogen dimer chains, we observe the anticipated linear scaling as well as an explicit cost crossover with standard variational Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution femtosecond electron diffraction reveals electronic and nuclear dynamics at conical intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conical intersections play a pivotal role in excited-state quantum dynamics. Capturing transient molecular structures near conical intersections remains challenging due to the rapid timescales and subtle structural changes involved. We overcome this by combining the enhanced temporal resolution of mega-electron-volt ultrafast electron diffraction with a super-resolution real-space inversion algorithm, enabling visualization of nuclear and electronic motions at conical intersections with sub-angstrom resolution, surpassing the diffraction limit. We apply this technique to the textbook example of the ring-opening reaction of 1,3-cyclohexadiene, which proceeds through two conical intersections within 100 femtoseconds. The super-resolved transient structures near conical intersections reveal a C-C bond length difference of less than 0.4 angstrom and an approximately 30-femtosecond traversal time of the nuclear wave packet between them. These findings establish super-resolution ultrafast scattering as a transformative tool for uncovering quantum dynamics in molecules and open new avenues for studying light-matter interactions at the most fundamental level.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Photodissociation Dynamics of Energized H$_2$COO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The end-to-end dynamics of the smallest energized Criegee intermediate, H$_2$COO, was characterized for vibrational excitation close to and a few kcal/mol above the barrier for hydrogen transfer. From an aggregate of at least 5 $\mu$s of molecular dynamics simulations using a neural network-representation of CASPT2/aug-cc-pVTZ reference data, the branching ratios into molecular products HCO+OH, CO$_2$+H$_2$, or H$_2$O+CO was quantitatively determined. Consistent with earlier calculations and recent experiments, decay into HCO+OH was found to be rare $(\sim 2 \%)$ whereas the other two molecular product channels are accessed with fractions of $\sim 30 \%$ and $\sim 20 \%$, respectively. On the 1 ns time scale, which was the length of an individual MD simulation, more than 40 \% of the systems remain in the reactant state due to partial intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR). Formation of CO$_2$+H$_2$ occurs through a bifurcating pathway, one of which passes through formic acid whereas the more probable route connects the di-radical OCH$_2$O with the product through a low-lying transition state. Notably, none of the intermediates along the pathway accumulate and their maximum concentration always remains well below 5 \%. This work demonstrates that atomistic simulations with global reactive machine-learned energy functions provide a quantitative understanding of the chemistry and reaction dynamics for atmospheric reactions in the gas phase.</description>

      <title>Neural network ensemble for computing cross sections for rotational transitions in H$_{2}$O + H$_{2}$O collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water (H$_2$O) is one of the most abundant molecules in the universe and is found in a wide variety of astrophysical environments. Rotational transitions in H$_2$O + H$_2$O collisions are important in modeling environments rich in water molecules but they are computationally intractable using quantum mechanical methods. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) tool using an ensemble of neural networks (NNs) to predict cross sections to construct a database of rate coefficients for rotationally inelastic transitions in collisions of complex molecules such as water. The proposed methodology utilizes data computed with a mixed quantum-classical theory (MQCT). We illustrate that efficient ML models using NN can be built to accurately interpolate in the space of 12 quantum numbers for rotational transitions in two asymmetric top molecules, spanning both initial and final states. We examine various architectures of data corresponding to each collision energy, symmetry of water molecule, and excitation/de-excitation rotational transitions, and optimize the training/validation data sets. Using only about 10\% of the computed data for training, the NNs predict cross sections of state-to-state rotational transitions of H$_{2}$O + H$_{2}$O collision with average relative root mean square error of 0.409. Thermally averaged cross sections, computed using the predicted state-to-state cross sections ($\sim$90\%) and the data used for training and validation ($\sim$10\%) were compared against those obtained entirely from MQCT calculations. The agreement is found to be excellent with an average percent deviation of about $\sim$13.5\%. The methodology is robust, and thus, applicable to other complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Electrically driven first-order phase transition of a 2D ionic crystal at the electrode/electrolyte interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid electrolytes adsorbed at the surface of metallic electrodes display a multitude of structures that can largely differ from the parent bulk system, both in terms of composition and local organization. In particular, the existence of disorder-order or order-order transitions has been increasingly reported in experimental and simulation studies, and the electrode potential identified as the corresponding driving force. The microscopic mechanisms and the stages of the process are, however, poorly understood, and the free energy variation during the transition remain insufficiently characterized. To fill this gap, we investigate the crystallization of the adsorbed layer in a prototypical molten salt-metal interface. We demonstrate that the transition from the disordered to ordered structures proceeds in two stages. Pre-ordering effects are observed across a wide range of potentials, resulting in the formation of a poly-crystalline structure on the electrode surface, before an abrupt ordering transition finally occurs. The pre-ordering displays signature of a continuous transition. On the other hand, finite-size effects analysis proves the first-order character of the transition towards the mono-crystalline state. Upon increasing the system size, a shift in the onset applied voltage is observed, accompanied by a dramatic increase in the free energy barrier. The latter reflects in the interfacial capacitance, which displays a peak that sharpens with increasing system size.</description>

      <title>pH-Driven Fluorescence in Solid-State Lysine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is currently a growing interest in understanding the origins of intrinsic fluorescence as a way to design non-invasive probes for biophysical processes. In this regard, understanding how pH influences fluorescence in non-aromatic biomolecular assemblies is key to controlling their optical properties in realistic cellular conditions. Here, we combine experiments and theory to investigate the pH-dependent emission of solid-state L-Lysine (Lys). Lys aggregates prepared at different pH values using HCl and H$_2$SO$_4$ exhibit protonation- and counterion-dependent morphology and fluorescence, as shown by microscopy and steady-state measurements. We find an enhancement in the fluorescence moving from acidic to basic conditions. To uncover the molecular origin of these trends, we performed non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations on three Lys crystal models representing distinct protonation states. Our simulations indicate that enhanced protonation under acidic conditions facilitates non-radiative decay via proton transfer, whereas basic conditions favor radiative decay. These findings highlight pH as a key factor tuning fluorescence in Lys assemblies, offering insights for designing pH responsive optical materials based on non-aromatic amino acids.</description>

      <title>Unitary Coupled-Cluster theory for the treatment of molecules in strong magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Coupled-Cluster (CC) theory, unphysical complex energies may arise in the presence of strong magnetic fields, near conical intersections, or in systems exhibiting complex Abelian point group symmetries. This issue originates from the non-Hermitian nature of the CC energy expression. A promising solution is provided by unitary Coupled-Cluster (UCC) theory, which retains the advantages of an exponential parameterization while ensuring real-valued energy eigenvalues. In this work, we present an implementation of finite-field second-order (ff-UCC2) and third-order (ff-UCC3) UCC theory. We assess the performance of these truncation levels in comparison to conventional finite-field CC methods, using the methylidyne ion, water, and boric acid.</description>

      <title>Hybrid tensor network and neural network quantum states for quantum chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful and flexible framework for addressing quantum many-body problems. While successful for model Hamiltonians, their application to molecular systems remains challenging for several reasons. In this work, we introduce three innovations to overcome some of the key limitations. (1) We propose two novel ans\"atzet hat hybridize tensor network and neural network states for addressing initialization challenges and enhancing the expressivity of tensor networks. First, we develop a bounded-degree graph recurrent neural network (BDG-RNN) ansatz that leverages graph-based updates, enabling applications to molecular electronic structure problems. Second, we introduce restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) inspired correlators to further enhance expressivity and improve accuracy, without dramatically modifying the underlying variational Monte Carlo (VMC) optimization framework. (2) We introduce a semi-stochastic algorithm for local energy evaluation, which significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining high accuracy. Combining these advances, we demonstrate that our approaches can achieve chemical accuracy in challenging systems, including the one-dimensional hydrogen chain H50, the iron-sulfur cluster [Fe2S2(SCH3)4]^{2-}, and a three-dimensional $3 \times 3 \times 2$ hydrogen cluster H18. These methods are implemented in an open-source package - PyNQS (https://github.com/Quantum-Chemistry-Group-BNU/PyNQS) to advance NQS methodologies for quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Learning Long-Range Representations with Equivariant Messages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials trained on first-principles reference data are quickly becoming indispensable for computational physics, biology, and chemistry. Equivariant message-passing neural networks, including transformers, are considered state-of-the-art for this task. Since applications require efficient scaling with system size, such models cannot act on fully connected atomistic graphs and thus neglect interactions beyond a certain cutoff, consequently failing to model long-range effects like electrostatics, dispersion, or electron delocalization. While long-range correction schemes based on inverse power laws of interatomic distances have been proposed, they are unable to communicate higher-order geometric information and are thus limited in applicability. To address this shortcoming, we propose the use of equivariant, rather than scalar, charges for long-range interactions, and design a graph neural network architecture, LOREM, around this long-range message passing mechanism. Through tests on a number of long-range datasets, we confirm that equivariant charges enable the learning of orientation-dependent interactions, and that the proposed model is competitive with, or surpasses, other approaches. Moreover, LOREM does not require adapting interaction cutoffs or the number of message passing steps to model long-range interactions, which contributes to its robustness across different systems.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a standard approach for calculating optical excitations of molecules and solids, while ensemble DFT (EDFT) is a promising alternative under development. We introduce ensemble TDDFT (ETDDFT), a practical theory that combines the two, generalizing both; we ensemble-generalize the Gross-Kohn equation and the exchange-correlation kernel of TDDFT, and generalize EDFT to time-dependent problems. We relate coordinate scaling to the adiabatic connection. The new theory provides multiple avenues for constructing and using approximations. We illustrate these on the 2-site Hubbard model. We connect our results to the more general case of non-perturbative time-dependence.</description>

      <title>X-ray Emission Spectropolarimetry of Strongly Anisotropic Single Crystal Systems using a Rowland Circle Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization dependence has historically seen extensive use in x-ray spectroscopy to determine magnetic and local geometric properties, but more broadly as a way to gain extra sensitivity to electronic structure at the level of individual magnetic orbitals. This is often done in the context of x-ray absorption through techniques like x-ray magnetic circular dichroism or x-ray linear dichroism, but it has seen little application to x-ray emission. Here we explore the information contained in the polarized emission of two 3d transition metal systems across both core-to-core (CtC) and valence-to-core emission (VtC) lines. We demonstrate how the Rowland circle geometry can be used as a spectropolarimeter, and apply it to the x-ray emission spectroscopy of spin-1/2 Cu(II) and spin-0 Ni(II) ions in LiVCuO4 and DyNiC2, respectively. From this we explore how the polarized XES interrogates of the occupied density of states at the valence level, either as a second order effect through Coulomb exchange (CtC x-ray emission) or by direct transitions (VtC x-ray emission). We find that the polarized x-ray emission can provide insights into the valence electron orbital occupation, in much the same way that is achievable with polarized absorption or angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy techniques. Finally, we highlight how the individually polarized dipole emission spectra can be extracted from a linearly independent suite of directed emission spectra, allowing for polarized measurements at high Bragg angle with lower experimental broadening.</description>

      <title>Accuracy and Limitations of Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials for Magnetic Systems: A Case Study on Fe-Cr-C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become the gold standard for atomistic simulations, yet their extension to magnetic materials remains challenging because spin fluctuations must be captured either explicitly or implicitly. We address this problem for the technologically vital Fe-Cr-C system by constructing two deep machine learning potentials in DeePMD realization: one trained on non-magnetic DFT data (DP-NM) and one on spin-polarised DFT data (DP-M). Extensive validation against experiments reveals a striking dichotomy. The dynamic, collective properties, viscosity and melting temperatures are reproduced accurately by DP-NM but are incorrectly estimated by DP-M. Static, local properties, density, and lattice parameters are captured excellently by DP-M, especially in Fe-rich alloys, whereas DP-NM fails. This behaviour is explained by general properties of paramagnetic state: at high temperature, local magnetic moments self-average in space and time, so their explicit treatment is unnecessary for transport properties but essential for equilibrium volumes. Exploiting this insight, we show that a transfer-learning protocol, pre-training on non-magnetic DFT and fine-tuning on a small set of spin-polarised data, reduces the computational cost to develop magnetic MLIPs by more than an order of magnitude. Developing general-purpose potentials that capture static and dynamic behaviors throughout the whole composition space requires proper accounting for temperature-induced spin fluctuations in DFT calculations and correctly incorporating spin degrees of freedom into classical force fields.</description>

      <title>Shape-dependent direction reversal in anisotropic catalytic microswimmers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propulsion direction of active particles is a key feature in self-propelled systems and depends on the propulsion mechanism and environmental conditions. Here, using 3D micro-printed catalytically active particles, we experimentally show that the propulsion direction can change with increasing fuel concentration when the active particle possesses an anisotropic shape. We find that discs, tori, and bent rods reverse their direction of motion with increasing hydrogen peroxide concentration--moving with their inert side forward at low concentrations and with their catalytic side forward at high concentrations. In contrast, spheres and straight rods do not exhibit this reversal. We observe that direction reversal is independent of the base material composition of the swimmer and its size, and only occurs for anisotropic particles where, due to their elongated shape, the location of the solute concentration maximum is unstable and can be shifted by substrate-induced confinements. Our measurements suggest that in addition a change in the platinum-catalyzed reaction of hydrogen peroxide occurs, to which particles with elongated shapes that induce sufficient confinement are more sensitive.</description>

      <title>Is the Full Power of Gaussian Boson Sampling Required for Simulating Vibronic Spectra Using Photonics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating vibronic spectra is a central task in physical chemistry, offering insight into important properties of molecules. Recently, it has been experimentally demonstrated that photonic platforms based on Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) are capable of performing these simulations. However, whether an actual GBS approach is required depends on the molecule under investigation. To develop a better understanding on the requirements for simulating vibronic spectra, we explore connections between theoretical approximations in physical chemistry and their photonic counterparts. Mapping these approximations into photonics, we show that for certain molecules the GBS approach is unnecessary. We place special emphasis on the linear coupling approximation, which in photonics corresponds to sampling from multiple coherent states. By implementing this approach in experiments, we demonstrate improved similarities over previously reported GBS results for formic acid and identify the particular attributes that a molecule must exhibit for this, and other approximations, to be valid. These results highlight the importance in forming deeper connections between traditional methods and photonic approaches.</description>

      <title>Opportunities and Challenges in Unsupervised Learning: The Case of Aqueous Electrolyte Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in atomistic simulations, enabling the identification of complex patterns in molecular systems limiting human intervention and bias. However, the practical implementation of these methods presents significant technical challenges, particularly in the selection of hyperparameters and in the physical interpretability of machine-learned descriptors. In this work, we systematically investigate these challenges by applying an unsupervised learning protocol to a fundamental problem in physical chemistry namely, how ions perturb the local structure of water. Using the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions(SOAP) descriptors, we demonstrate how the intrinsic dimension (ID) serves as a guide for selecting hyperparameters and interpreting structural complexity. Furthermore, we construct a high-dimensional free energy landscape encompassing all water environments surrounding different ions. This analysis reveals how the physical properties of ions are intricately reflected in their hydration shells, shaping the landscape through specific connections between different minima. Our findings highlight the difficulty in balancing algorithmic automation with the need of employing both physical and chemical intuition, particularly for the construction of meaningful descriptors and for the interpretation of final results. By critically assessing the methodological hurdles associated with unsupervised learning, we provide a road map for researchers looking to harness these techniques for studying electrolyte and aqueous solutions in general.</description>

      <title>Fast and Accurate Charge Transfer Excitations via Nested Aufbau Suppressed Coupled Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling charge transfer well can require treating post-excitation orbital relaxations and handling medium to large molecules in realistic environments. By combining a state-specific correlation treatment with such orbital relaxations, Aufbau suppressed coupled cluster has proven accurate for charge transfer, but, like many coupled cluster methods, it struggles with large system sizes. We derive a low-cost Aufbau suppressed second order perturbation theory and show that, by nesting a small coupled cluster treatment inside of it, computational cost and scaling are reduced while accuracy is maintained. Formal asymptotic costs are dropped from iterative $N^6$ to non-iterative $N^5$ plus iterative $N^3$, and we test an initial implementation that can handle about 100 atoms and 800 orbitals on a single computational node. Charge transfer excitation energy errors are typically below 0.1 eV on average, with an average 0.25 eV improvement over $N^6$-cost equation of motion coupled cluster with singles and doubles.</description>

      <title>A deep learning model for chemical shieldings in molecular organic solids including anisotropy</title>

Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) chemical shifts are powerful probes of local atomic and electronic structure that can be used to resolve the structures of powdered or amorphous molecular solids. Chemical shift driven structure elucidation depends critically on accurate and fast predictions of chemical shieldings, and machine learning (ML) models for shielding predictions are increasingly used as scalable and efficient surrogates for demanding ab initio calculations. However, the prediction accuracies of current ML models still lag behind those of the DFT reference methods they approximate, especially for nuclei such as $^{13}$C and $^{15}$N. Here, we introduce ShiftML3.0, a deep-learning model that improves the accuracy of predictions of isotropic chemical shieldings in molecular solids, and does so while also predicting the full shielding tensor. On experimental benchmark sets, we find root-mean-squared errors with respect to experiment for ShiftML3.0 that approach those of DFT reference calculations, with RMSEs of 0.53 ppm for $^{1}$H, 2.4 ppm for $^{13}$C, and 7.2 ppm for $^{15}$N, compared to DFT values of 0.49 ppm, 2.3 ppm, and 5.8 ppm, respectively.</description>

      <title>Quantum Beatings in Optical Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cavity polaritons, quasiparticles formed by coherent light-matter coupling, are at the heart of fundamental concepts of quantum optics. The quintessential signature of this coherent coupling is the Rabi oscillation, which results from the neglect of the counter-rotating-wave (CRW) effect in the weak-coupling regime. The goal of this letter is to predict resonant beatings that envelop the Rabi oscillation on the second or higher excitation manifold. These polariton beatings arise from the CRW term in the Dicke or Pauli-Fierz model and are directly correlated with the asymmetry in polariton eigenenergies. Our findings highlight the relevance of the CRW effect even in the weak-coupling regime, offer novel perspectives about coherent polariton dynamics, and shed new light on experiments of coupled quantum systems.</description>
