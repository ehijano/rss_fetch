      <title>Diffusion and instabilities in large-N holographic Fermi liquids: the vector fluctuations of the electron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic response of the AdS electron star in the vector sector, and compute the correlation functions and the transverse conductivity of the dual field theory. The system exhibits hydrodynamic behavior at low temperatures and near the critical temperature where the electron star undergoes the phase transition to the RN black hole. However, at intermediate temperatures the hydrodynamics does not exist. Remarkably, the system has an instability, i.e. a pole on the positive imaginary frequency axis at finite temperature. This instability is found both from analytical arguments and from numerics. Its physical meaning is so far unclear but it might mean that the ideal fluid limit for the star is a false vacuum.</description>

      <title>A$_1$-A$_2$ splitting in pure $^3$He in nematic aerogel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we present the results of vibrating wire experiments in pure $^3$He (without $^4$He coverage) in nematic aerogel. We investigated the dependence of splitting of the superfluid transition temperature of $^3$He in aerogel on magnetic field. In addition to our previous work, we used a wider range of magnetic fields (up to 31 kOe) and managed to detect both the "upper" and "lower" superfluid transition temperatures. The solid paramagnetic $^3$He layer on the aerogel strands activates the magnetic scattering channel. According to theory, it should result in linear splitting at high ($\ge20$ kOe) fields, while at lower fields the splitting is expected to be nonlinear. We were able to observe this nonlinearity, but we have a discrepancy with theoretical predictions regarding the range of fields where nonlinearity occurs. Possible reasons for this are discussed.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian band topology in twisted bilayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the established Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG), we theoretically investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) topological properties of this in the presence of non-reciprocal (NR) hopping on both layers and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) induced mass term incorporated only on the top layer of the tBLG system. It is well known that the hBN mass term breaks the $C_{2}$ symmetry of tBLG and gaps out the Dirac cones inducing a valley Hall insulating phase. However, when NR hopping is introduced, this system transits into a NH valley Hall insulator (NH-VHI). Our analysis reveals that, in the chiral limit, the bandwidth of the system vanishes under NH effects for a wide range of twist angles. Such range can be visibly expanded as we enhance the degree of non-Hermiticity $(\beta)$. At the magic angle, we observe that enhancement of $\beta$ inflates the robustness of the gapless Dirac points, requiring a progressively larger mass term to induce a gap in the NH tBLG system. Additionally, for a fixed NH parameter, we identify a range of twist angles where gap formation is significantly obstructed. To explore the topological aspects of the NH tBLG, we analyze the direct band gap in the Moir\'e Brillouin zone (mBZ) and compute the Chern number for the NH system. We find that the corresponding topological phase transitions are associated with corresponding direct band gap closings in the mBZ.</description>

      <title>Constraining the origin of magnetic white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of magnetic white dwarfs (MWDs) has been a long-standing puzzle. Proposed origin mechanisms have included: fossil fields frozen in from the progenitor convective core; a dynamo in the progenitor envelope; crystallization dynamos in sufficiently cool white dwarfs; and accretion disk dynamos from white dwarf-white dwarf mergers or tidally shredded low-mass stellar or planetary companions. Here we show how observational constraints on white dwarf magnetic field strengths, ages, and masses can be used to narrow down the viability of proposed origin mechanisms. Using data from both the Montreal White Dwarf Database and a 20 pc volume-limited sample from Gaia DR2, we find that the fossil field mechanism overpredicts the number of magnetic white dwarfs, which suggests, as supported by theoretical arguments, that the field is not actually frozen into the progenitor cores but diffuses before the white dwarf forms. Crystallization dynamos, occur too late to explain the bulk of magnetic white dwarfs. And with the progenitor envelope dynamos impeded by the theoretical challenge of depositing a field from envelope to white dwarf core, the two disk dynamo mechanisms emerge as the field origin mechanisms most resilient to present constraints, with mergers best able to explain the high mass, strongly magnetized young MWDs. The methods herein also reveal observational data gaps, and motivate future acquisition of more complete data.</description>
