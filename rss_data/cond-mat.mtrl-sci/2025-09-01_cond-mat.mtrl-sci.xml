      <title>The crystalline properties of silica biomorphs vary within and between morphologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silica-carbonate biomorphs are a class of emergent materials, i.e. composite microstructures made of nanometric carbonate crystallites surrounded by amorphous silica. They form via a co-precipitation process in an interplay between alkaline earth metal carbonate and siliceous species, and self-organize into a multitude of shapes with a distinct long-range order of the carbonate nanocrystals. Biomorphs are frequently studied to understand the formation of life-like structures emerging from geochemical processes at extreme conditions. Further, due to their optical properties they lend themselves as a platform for optical, electronic or magnetic functionalization. A big hurdle in this task is our incomplete understanding of the underlying formation process and how the interplay between synthesis parameters affects important nanoscale properties such as crystalline structure and texture, as well as the shape on the microscale. Here, we use X-ray texture and diffraction tomography to unveil the local crystalline texture in 3D of silica-witherite biomorphs. We find surprisingly different growth motifs across different morphologies, but also that the crystalline properties vary significantly within a single structure. We distinguish different growth regimes and from that, infer how the co-precipitating silica shapes the crystalline particles. Thereby, we gain deeper insight into how biomorphs form these distinct complex morphologies.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Radiation Damage on [M(COD)Cl]$_2$ using Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical calculations of materials have in recent years shown promise in facilitating the analysis of convoluted experimental data. This is particularly invaluable in complex systems or for materials subject to certain environmental conditions, such as those exposed to X-ray radiation during routine characterisation. Despite the clear benefit in this use case to shed further light on intermolecular damage processes, the use of theory to study radiation damage of samples is still not commonplace, with very few studies in existing literature. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of density functional theory for modelling the electronic structure of two industrially important organometallic systems of the formula [M(COD)Cl]$_2$ where M=Ir/Rh and COD=1,5-cyclooctadiene, which are subject to X-ray irradiation via X-ray Diffraction and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. Our approach allows calculated spectra to be compared directly to experimental data, in this case, the X-ray photoelectron valence band spectra, enabling the valuable correlation of individual atomic states to the electronic structure.</description>

      <title>X-ray diffraction strains in laser-ablated aluminum, nickel, sodium and Invar: pressures to 475 GPa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamically compressed materials in longitudinal waves are described by two physical models: hydrostatic pressure, with equal, normal, principal stresses or material uniaxially strained in the wave propagation direction. These models are disparate, so experimental comparisons and evaluations are important. Polycrystalline material in a state of hydrostatic pressure, will have no eccentricity of X-ray diffracted Debye-Scherrer rings. A general three-dimensional solution of Bragg diffracted X-rays based on principal crystallographic strains in the compression wave was found. The distortion of X-ray diffraction beams has been used for strain measurements; the analysis developed incorporates a strained reciprocal lattice and the incident X-ray beam. Strain distorted Polanyi surfaces form an annulus of compression with an ellipsoid of revolution in reciprocal space which is intersected by Ewald sphere for Bragg diffraction. The in-situ measurements for strain describe nanosecond diffraction evaluated using two planes, and both in the same crystallographic phase. Diffraction from Al, Ni, Na, and Invar quantify the compression axial strains in these materials: the compression axial ratios are 0.65, 1.05, 0.88 and 1.58 at pressures of 291, 402, 409, and 367 GPa for the respective materials. Crystal structure transformations with homogeneous pressurized stresses, mandating equal normal strains, should not be anticipated to agree with heterogeneous, uniaxially strained and sheared crystalline phases. Measurements support in-plane strains increasing with pressure, p, in fcc and hcp aluminum as with p in GPa.</description>

      <title>Fracture of disordered and stochastic lattice materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The failure of mechanical metamaterials is a function of the interplay between the properties of the base material and the microstructural geometry. Stochastic failure properties of the base material and disordered microstructural geometries can contribute to variations in the global failure mechanics that are not captured in traditional analyses of ordered, deterministic architected materials. We present a probabilistic framework that couples stochastic material failure and geometric disorder to predict failure in lattice mechanical metamaterials. These predictions are verified through finite element analysis, which confirm that disorder and stochasticity affect both the mean and variance of the damage initiation load in a lattice, with average failure loads being generally reduced and variance increasing with higher levels of disorder and stochasticity. The fracto-cohesive length and representative volume element size are also predicted and constrain the minimum defect and lattice sizes, respectively, for failure to be considered a fracture process. The framework is extended to consider the fracture behavior of the lattice, the development of damage zones, and their impact on the steady-state fracture toughness.</description>

      <title>Correlation tuned Fermi-arc topology in a Weyl ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrons on Fermi arcs (FAs), a hallmark of Weyl semimetals, exhibit chiral transport harboring chiral anomaly, negative magnetoresistance, and Majorana zero modes. While FAs were observed in exemplary Weyl semimetal TaAs and Co3Sn2S2, the manipulation of FAs has been rarely explored. Here we take Co3Sn2S2 as an example and demonstrate that tuning the electronic correlation strength is an effective way to control the topology and connectivity of FAs. After achieving a good agreement with experimentally measured band structure by employing combined density functional theory and dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations, we show that the experimental charge dynamics are well reproduced by DFT+DMFT calculations but not DFT calculations. Electronic correlation renormalizes the bands around the Fermi level and modifies the energy and location of Weyl points, and the resulting FAs. In particular, on the Co-terminated surface, the FAs are formed by connecting Weyl points located in adjacent Brillouin zones in DFT+DMFT calculations and experiments, in strong contrast to the FAs connecting Weyl points within the same Brillouin zone in DFT calculations. We further show the evolution of FAs with correlation and reveal a topological change of the FAs on the Sn-terminated surface at stronger correlation strength. Our study sheds new light on experimental manipulation of FAs to improve the electronic properties of correlated Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Understanding the atomically precise evolution of the miscibility of newly prepared face-centered cubic W-Cu nanoalloys and its asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to classical Miedema theory, reducing crystals to the order of nanometer sizes might greatly modulate the mixing enthalpy of elements, thus enabling the invention of a lot of new bulk-immiscible alloys. Although numerous alloys with higher mixing enthalpies remain unexplored, this strategy is approaching its limit, as reflected by the critical diameter of recent alloys of 1.8 nm, which corresponds to ~150 atoms and hardly provides a crystalline order. Future development requires not only even smaller atomic-scale control but also a new surface energy-saving mechanism. Here, we report the formation of W-Cu nanoalloys with a very large miscibility gap in the bulk via the use of an atomically size-selected cluster beam source as an example. The face-centered cubic (FCC) structure was demonstrated through electron diffraction, which indicated a lattice constant of 3.88{\AA} for W0.85Cu0.15 nanoalloys (~2280 atoms). In this comprehensive study that covers a large parameter space of W/Cu compositions and numbers of atoms, an asymmetric miscibility nanophase diagram in which W-rich compositions favor mixing and the critical size is approximately 6000 atoms, which far exceeds the approximately tens of atoms predicted via classical theory, was obtained for the first time. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed a mutual strain-induced mechanism that simultaneously lowers the surface energies while reducing the size to the atomic scale. This approach paves the way for the development of new high-performance nonequilibrium phase alloys.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo Benchmarking of Molecular Adsorption on Graphene-Supported Single Pt Atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise understanding of adsorption energetics and molecular geometry at catalytic sites is fundamental for advancing catalysis, particularly under the constraints of resource efficiency and environmental sustainability. This study benchmarks the performance of density functional theory (DFT) calculations against diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations for adsorption properties of small gas molecules relevant to CO oxidation -- namely O$_2$, CO, CO$_2$, and atomic oxygen -- on a single Pt atom supported by pristine graphene. Our findings reveal that DMC calculations provide a significantly different landscape of adsorption energetics compared to DFT results. Notably, DFT predicts different lowest-energy configurations and spin states, particularly for O$_2$, which suggests potential discrepancies in predicting the catalytic behavior. Furthermore, this study identifies the critical issue of CO poisoning, highlighted by the large disparity between the DMC adsorption energies of O$_2$ ($-1.23(2)$ eV) and CO ($-3.37(1)$ eV), which can inhibit the catalytic process. These results emphasize the necessity for more sophisticated computational approaches in catalysis research, aiming to refine the prediction accuracy of reaction mechanisms and to enhance the design of more effective catalysts.</description>

      <title>Tunable Two-Dimensional Electron Gas at the Interfaces of Ferroelectric Potassium Tantalate Niobates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heterointerfaces at complex oxides have emerged as a promising platform for discovering novel physical phenomena and advancing integrated sensing, storage, and computing technologies. Nevertheless, achieving precise control over a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a ferroelectric oxide-based field-effect transistor (FET) configuration remains challenging. Here, we firstly demonstrate a tunable 2DEG system fabricated by depositing an amorphous LaAlO3(LAO) film onto a (001)-oriented ferroelectric potassium tantalate niobate substrate. Interfaces grown under high-temperature and high-oxygen-pressure conditions exhibit a good metallic conduction. Notably, well-defined metallic 2DEGs displaying pronounced hysteresis and persistent electric-field-modulated resistance are observed below 108 K, achieving a resistance modulation of 11.6% at 7 K. These results underscore the potential for extending such behavior to other oxide-based 2DEG systems and facilitate further exploration of ferroelectric metals in complex oxide heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Control of growth morphology of deposited fcc metals through tuning substrate-metal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise control over thin film morphology is critical for optimizing material properties across diverse technological applications, as the growth mode (whether 2D layer-by-layer or 3D island formation)determines key functional properties such as electrical conductivity in CMOS interconnect applications and catalytic activity, where island distribution and size dictate performance. To explore the role of the substrate on the morphology of deposited metals, we present extensive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations on six fcc metals growing in the (111) direction: Ag, Au, Cu, Ni, Pd and Pt. Our simulation framework enables screening and evaluation of their growth mode under homoepitaxial growth scenarios and proposes morphology control strategies by variation of substrate-metal interaction strengths, modeled by modifying the activation energies for upward and downward migration, combined with thermal vacuum annealing within typical back end of line (BEOL) integration thermal budget. Our simulation results demonstrate that modulation of the substrate interaction strength can be effectively employed to promote island formation or layer-by-layer growth modes overcoming limitations in achieving large flat surface areas. Au, Pd and Pt exhibit the highest sensitivity to substrate interaction strength variations, followed by Ag, showing that strongly interacting substrates decrease the root mean square (RMS) roughness, (uncovered) substrate exposure, island number and island aspect ratios, with moderate increases in flat surface areas and atomic coordination numbers. Additionally, interconnect relevant metrics are improved through thermal vacuum annealing particularly when sufficiently strong metal-substrate interactions are employed, reducing surface roughness, achieving larger flat surface areas, merging and smoothing islands, and decreasing defect density...</description>

      <title>Exploring the signature of two ferromagnetic states and goniopolarity in LaCrGe3 through Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LaCrGe3 has become a playground to understand quantum critical phenomena in ferromagnetic (FM) materials. It has also garnered attention due to its peculiar two FM phases. Here, we demonstrate the presence of these phases using the Hall effect. Continuous temperature-dependent Hall resistivity measurements at fixed magnetic fields clearly demonstrate the presence of these phases, regardless of the direction of the applied magnetic field. The remanent Hall resistivity and Hall coefficient undergo a maximum and a minimum, respectively, at the boundary between the two phases. We observe significantly large anomalous Hall conductivity of 1160 ohm-1cm-1 at 2 K when the magnetic field is applied along the magnetic easy axis, which is dominated by intrinsic effects, at least in the low-temperature FM phase. In the paramagnetic (PM) phase, hexagonal LaCrGe3 exhibits opposite charge carrier polarities along different crystallographic directions, attributed to the anisotropic Fermi surface geometry, a phenomenon known as "goniopolarity". The coexistence of goniopolar transport and unconventional magnetic phases may lead this material as a promising candidate for future electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Chemical Control of Mechanical Anisotropy and Band Alignment in Perylene-based Two-dimensional MoS$_2$-Organic Hybrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive investigation of hybrid interfaces formed by monolayer MoS$_2$ coupled with the organic molecules perylene (P), perylene diimide (PDI), and perylene orange (PO). Using density functional theory, we demonstrate the extent to which the mechanical and electronic properties of a hybrid system can be altered by the chemical modification of a given chromophore. The three systems exhibit distinct differences due to their chemical composition and van der Waals contact enabled by their geometry. All systems are structurally stable. The binding energies follow the order PD$&gt;$P$&gt;$PO due to the large $\pi$-system (PD) and strong structural distortion (PO). Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio exhibit pronounced anisotropy in all cases. PO exhibits the greatest anisotropy due to steric effects and a permanent dipole, which introduce directionality to the molecule-surface interaction. Physisorption is accompanied by net charge transfer in the same order as the binding energies. The associated interfacial polarization results in a change in the work function compared to pristine MoS$_2$ in the order P$&gt;$PO$&gt;$PD. Finally, the presence of organic molecules introduces states into the MoS$_2$ energy gap, with the band alignment being either type II (P, PO) or type I (PD).</description>

      <title>Molecular Beam Epitaxy of 2H-TaS$_2$ few-layers on GaN(0001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2H-TaS$_2$ few layers have been grown epitaxially onto GaN(0001). A high substrate growth temperature of 825$^{\circ}$C induces best structural properties of the overlayer, as revealed by in-situ electron diffraction (RHEED and LEED). The 2D-overlayer grows unstrained right after deposition of a monolayer. However, evidence of pits at the interface is provided by scanning transmission electron microscopy, most probably due to GaN thermal decomposition at the high growth temperature. In-situ x-ray photoemission spectroscopy shows core level shifts that are consistently related to electron transfer from the n-GaN(0001) to the 2H-TaS$_2$ epitaxial layer as well as the formation of a high concentration of nitrogen vacancies close to the interface. Further, no chemical reaction at the interface between the substrate and the grown TaS$_2$ overlayer is deduced from XPS, which corroborates the possibility of integration of 2D 2H-TaS$_2$ with an important 3D semiconducting material like GaN.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Excitonic Duality From Monolayer to Trilayer CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) layered magnetic materials (LMMs) are a newly emerging class of van der Waals materials, opening new opportunities to study magneto-excitonic coupling. The air-stable, structurally and optically anisotropic A-type antiferromagnetic chromium sulfur bromide (CrSBr) is one of the most prominent examples of such LMMs. We investigate photoluminescence (PL) and PL excitation of mono- to tri-layers CrSBr and find that it exhibits a unique duplexity, supporting both Frenkel- and Wannier-Mott-like excitons. Our magneto-optical experiments reveal a similar excitonic response from the mono- and trilayer systems and a completely different signature in the bilayer flake. This shows a different origin of the low-lying excitonic species (A, A', and B) in the band structure. We confirm the robustness of the magneto-excitonic coupling in few-layer CrSBr. Our work enables a more comprehensive exploration of the dual excitonic behavior in 2D materials.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that switching of ferroelectric thin-films sandwiched between metallic electrodes can be controlled by laser-assisted heating, reminiscent of heat-assisted magnetic recording. We employ electrical switching cycles that quantify the electrically switchable remanent polarization $P_\mathrm{r}$ and show that 300\,ns voltage pulses alone change the polarization by less than $\Delta P&lt;P_\mathrm{r}$. Transient heating of the metallic top electrode by synchronized ns laser-pulses induces a reversal $\Delta P^\mathrm{L}&gt;P_\mathrm{r}$ of the average polarization. The transient average temperature modeled by the heat equation can rationalize the polarization change observed for different relative timing $\Delta t$ of the laser pulse, if it arrives before the electrical pulse.</description>

      <title>Scaling of the Electrical Conductivity Spectra Reveals Distinct Transport Responses in A2SmTaO6 [A = Ba, Sr, Ca]</title>

Abstract: Disorder plays an important role in materials science, influencing material behavior across different length scales. Imperfections like vacancies, atomic substitutions, lattice distortions, and microstructural inhomogeneities, disrupt ideal periodicity thereby altering physical properties. Analogous to spin-glass systems, electrical 'glassiness' arises when charge carriers confront disordered energy landscapes, leading to a broad range of relaxation times, especially in polycrystalline materials where dipoles experience competing exchange interactions. Complex impedance, permittivity, and electric modulus distill out separate resistive and capacitive effects, offering insights into how microstructural inhomogeneities affects conduction mechanism. In polycrystalline double perovskites A2SmTaO6 (A = Ba, Ca), with a power law driven ac conductivity, the hopping and relaxation of carriers is affected by both grains and grain boundaries. Scaling of ac conductivity and impedance response reveals correlation between conduction and relaxation timescales. The inhomogeneities in local energy landscape of 'frustrated' dipoles restrict the 'universality' of conduction mechanism across the bulk length scale.</description>

      <title>Surface Stability Modeling with Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials: A Comprehensive Cleavage Energy Benchmarking Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized computational materials science by bridging the gap between quantum mechanical accuracy and classical simulation efficiency, enabling unprecedented exploration of materials properties across the periodic table. Despite their remarkable success in predicting bulk properties, no systematic evaluation has assessed how well these universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) can predict cleavage energies, a critical property governing fracture, catalysis, surface stability, and interfacial phenomena. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark of 19 state-of-the-art uMLIPs for cleavage energy prediction using our previously established density functional theory (DFT) database of 36,718 slab structures spanning elemental, binary, and ternary metallic compounds. We evaluate diverse architectural paradigms, analyzing their performance across chemical compositions, crystal systems, thickness, and surface orientations. Our results reveal that training data composition dominates architectural sophistication: models trained on the Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) dataset, which emphasizes non-equilibrium configurations, achieve mean absolute percentage errors below 6% and correctly identify the thermodynamically most stable surface terminations in 87% of cases, without any explicit surface energy training. In contrast, architecturally identical models trained on equilibrium-only datasets show five-fold higher errors, while models trained on surface-adsorbate data fail catastrophically with a 17-fold degradation. Remarkably, simpler architectures trained on appropriate data achieve comparable accuracy to complex transformers while offering 10-100x computational speedup. These findings show that the community should focus on strategic training data generation that captures the relevant physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Anomalous ultrafast heat transfer in single palladium nanocrystals seen with an X-ray free electron laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report transient highly strained structural states in individual palladium (Pd) nanocrystals, electronically heated using an optical laser, which precede their uniform thermal expansion. Using an X-ray free-electron laser probe, the evolution of individual 111 Bragg peaks is measured as a function of delay time at various laser fluences. Above a laser fluence threshold at a sufficient pump-probe delay, the Bragg peak splits into multiple peaks, indicating heterogeneous strain, before returning to a single peak, corresponding to even heat distribution throughout the lattice expanded crystal. Our findings are supported by a lattice displacement and strain model of a single nanocrystal at different delay times, which agrees with the experimental data. Our observations have implications for understanding femtosecond laser interactions with metals and the potential photo-catalytic performance of Pd.</description>

      <title>Investigation of structure and anisotropic electrical resistivity in single-crystalline CoSn kagome metal thin films for interconnect applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CoSn kagome metal is a pseudo-one-dimensional electronic conductor, exhibiting low resistivity (\r{ho}) along the [0001] direction (c-axis) and significantly higher \r{ho} along other crystallographic directions. Such anisotropic conduction is expected to mitigate resistivity increases in narrow interconnect wires at advanced semiconductor technology process nodes, making CoSn a promising candidate for future interconnect applications. In this study, CoSn thin films were fabricated by magnetron sputtering, and their resistivity anisotropy was investigated with respect to crystallographic orientation. Epitaxial growth of single-crystalline CoSn(10-10) films was achieved on a Ru(10-10) buffer layer at deposition temperatures above 350 {\deg}C. The CoSn films exhibited relatively low \r{ho} along [0001], reaching 13 micro{\Omega} cm, and an approximately tenfold anisotropy of \r{ho} between [0001] and [2-1-10] (a-axis), consistent with previous reports on bulk CoSn single crystals. However, the CoSn(10-10) surface exhibited pronounced roughness, attributed to three-dimensional crystal growth during sputtering, which hinders accurate evaluation of the thickness dependence of resistivity. Scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed the growth of a CoSn(10-10) single-crystal with (11-20) and (01-10) side wall facets, as well as domain boundaries within the films. These results highlight both the potential and challenges of employing CoSn kagome metal in future interconnect technologies.</description>

      <title>Computational study of interactions between ionized glyphosate and carbon nanotube: An alternative for mitigating environmental contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extensive use of glyphosate in agriculture has raised environmental concerns due to its adverse effects on plants, animals, microorganisms, and humans. This study investigates the interactions between ionized glyphosate and single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) using computational simulations through semi-empirical tight-binding methods (GFN2-xTB) implemented in the xTB software. The analysis focused on different glyphosate ionization states corresponding to various pH levels: G1 (pH &lt; 2), G2 (pH ~ 2-3), G3 (pH ~ 4-6), G4 (pH ~ 7-10), and G5 (pH &gt; 10.6). Results revealed that glyphosate in G1, G3, G4, and G5 forms exhibited stronger interactions with CNT, demonstrating higher adsorption energies and greater electronic coupling. The neutral state (G2) showed lower affinity, indicating that molecular protonation significantly influences adsorption. Topological analysis and molecular dynamics confirmed the presence of covalent, non-covalent, and partially covalent interactions, while the CNT+G5 system demonstrated moderate interactions suitable for material recycling. These findings suggest that carbon nanotubes, with their extraordinary properties such as nanocapillarity, porosity, and extensive surface area, show promise for environmental monitoring and remediation of glyphosate contamination.</description>

      <title>Magnetism Enhanced Surface Bonding of O$_{2}$ on CoPt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For large-scale deployment and use of polymer electrolyte fuel cells, high-performance electrocatalysts with low platinum consumption are desirable. One promising strategy to meet this demand is to explore alternative materials that retain catalytic efficiency while introducing new mechanisms for performance enhacement. In this study, we investigate a ferromagnetic CoPt as a candidate material to accelerate oxygen reduction reactions. By using density functional theory calculations, we find the spin-polarized Co-$d$ states to enhance O$_2$ surface bonding due to local exchange splitting of Co-$d$ carriers at the Fermi level. Furthermore, O and O$_2$ adsorption and dissociation energies are found to be tuned by varying the thickness of the Pt layers. Our study gives insight into the role magnetism plays in the oxygen reduction reaction process and how magnetic ions may aid in the design of new advanced catalysts.</description>

      <title>Phonon-scattering-induced quantum linear magnetoresistance up to room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization of quantum transport effects at elevated temperatures has long intrigued researchers due to the implications for unveiling novel physics and developing quantum devices. In this work, we report remarkable quantum linear magnetoresistance (LMR) in the Weyl semiconductor tellurium at high temperatures of 40-300 K under strong magnetic fields up to 60 T. At high fields, the Weyl band features a large energy gap between the lowest and first Landau levels, which suppresses thermal excitation and preserves Landau quantization at high temperatures. The LMR is observed as long as majority carriers remain in the lowest Landau level without requiring monochromaticity, allowing it to persist up to room temperature. The inverse relationship between the LMR slope and temperature provides clear evidence that quantum LMR originates from high-temperature phonon scattering in the quantum limit, firstly demonstrating a theoretical prediction made nearly fifty years ago. This study highlights the key role of electron-phonon interaction and reveals an innovative quantum mechanism for achieving high-temperature LMR, fundamentally distinct from previous findings. Our results bridge a gap in the understanding of phonon-mediated quantum-limit physics and establish strong magnetic fields at high temperatures as a promising platform for exploring novel quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Charge density wave induced gapped nodal line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and topological nodal-line states in square-net materials. Our Ginzburg-Landau theory predicts a CDW instability that generically opens a gap at the Fermi energy while preserving the nodal line crossing. However, as the Fermi level approaches the nodal line, the density of states at the nodal line decreases, eventually disappearing as the CDW vector $\mathbf{Q}$ goes to zero. Exactly at $\mathbf{Q} = 0$, the order parameter explicitly breaks the glide symmetry protecting the nodal line, which allows a gap to open. Yet, for small but finite $\mathbf{Q}$, the nodal line may vanish within experimental resolution even when the glide symmetry is preserved. Our results provide a consistent explanation for recent experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Jetting with gels: Soft microgel networks stabilize and extend nozzle-free water jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of high-speed liquid jets is crucial for applications ranging from precision printing to needle-free drug delivery, yet it is fundamentally limited by capillary-driven breakup. A common strategy to stabilize jets is to use surfactants to lower surface tension. However, in nozzle-free jetting driven by surface acoustic waves (SAWs), extreme deformation rates cause conventional surfactants to desorb, calling for alternative strategies to stabilize jets. In particular, we find that tuning the nanoscale softness of PNIPAM microgels provides a robust, biocompatible strategy to overcome this limitation. Soft, low-cross-linker-density microgels form elastic interfacial networks at the air-water interface that suppress surface tension recovery, delay Rayleigh-Plateau instabilities, and extend SAW-driven jet lengths by up to 44%. In contrast, stiffer microgels lose network cohesion under strain, leading to rapid jet breakup. To gain molecular-level insights, we perform dissipative particle dynamics simulations, which reveal that polymer bridges in soft microgels remain entangled during elongation, maintaining a reduced effective surface tension. Finally, a simple scaling analysis, balancing the SAW-driven kinetic energy imparted to the droplet against the surface energy required to form a jet, quantitatively predicts the observed length enhancement. This surfactant-free, biocompatible approach lays the foundation for long-lived jets, enabling precision needle-free drug delivery, high-speed printing, and other high-strain interfacial flow applications.</description>

      <title>LREI: A fast numerical solver for quantum Landau-Lifshitz equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop LREI (Low-Rank Eigenmode Integration), a memory- and time-efficient scheme for solving quantum Landau-Lifshitz (q-LL) and quantum Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (q-LLG) equations, which govern spin dynamics in open quantum systems. Although system size grows exponentially with the number of spins, our approach exploits the low-rank structure of the density matrix and the sparsity of Hamiltonians to avoid full matrix computations. By representing density matrices via low-rank factors and applying Krylov subspace methods for partial eigendecompositions, we reduce the per-step complexity of Runge-Kutta and Adams-Bashforth schemes from $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(r^2N)$, where $N = 2^n$ is the Hilbert space dimension for $n$ spins and $r \ll N$ the effective rank. Similarly, memory costs shrink from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(rN)$, since no full $N\times N$ matrices are formed. A key advance is handling the invariant subspace of zero eigenvalues. By using Householder reflectors built for the dominant eigenspace, we perform the solution entirely without large matrices. For example, a time step of a twenty-spin system, with density matrix size over one million, now takes only seconds on a standard laptop. Both Runge-Kutta and Adams-Bashforth methods are reformulated to preserve physical properties of the density matrix throughout evolution. This low-rank algorithm enables simulations of much larger spin systems, which were previously infeasible, providing a powerful tool for comparing q-LL and q-LLG dynamics, testing each model validity, and probing how quantum features such as correlations and entanglement evolve across different regimes of system size and damping.</description>

      <title>Experimental realization of dice-lattice flat band at the Fermi level in layered electride YCl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat electronic bands, where interactions among electrons overwhelm their kinetic energies, hold the promise for exotic correlation physics. The dice lattice has long been theorized as a host of flat bands with intriguing band topology. However, to date, no material has ever been found to host the characteristic flat bands of a dice lattice. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we discover a dice-lattice flat band at $E_F$ in the van der Waals (vdW) electride [YCl]$^{2+}$: 2e-. In this system, excess valence electrons from Y deconfine from the cation framework to form an interstitial anionic electron lattice that constitutes the dice lattice. Our ARPES measurements unambiguously identify two sets of dice-lattice bands in YCl, including a nearly dispersionless band at the Fermi level. The flat bands and other dispersive bands observed in ARPES find excellent agreement with first-principles calculations, and theoretical analysis reveals that the near-$E_F$ electronic structure is well captured by a simple dice-lattice model. Our findings thus end the long quest of a real dice flat band material and establish vdW electride YCl as a prototype of dice metals. Our results further demonstrate the anionic electron lattice as a novel scheme for realizing lattice geometries and electronic structures rare to find in conventional crystalline systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The depletion of energy sources, worsening environmental issues, and the quantum limitations of integrated circuits for information storage in the post-Moore era, are pressing global concerns. Fortunately, two-dimensional (2D) Janus materials, possessing broken spatial symmetry, with emerging pressure-dependent and non-linear optical response, piezoelectricity, valley polarization, Rashba spin splitting and more, have established a substantial platform for exploring and applying modifiable physical, chemical and biological properties in material science and offered a promising solution for these energy and information issues. To furnish researchers with a comprehensive repository of 2D Janus family, this review systematically summarizes their theoretical predictions, experimental preparations, and modulation strategies. It also retrospectively outlines the recent advances in modifiable properties, applications, and inherent mechanisms in optics, catalysis, piezoelectricity, electrochemistry, thermoelectricity, magnetism, and electronics, with a focus on experimentally realized hexagonal and trigonal Janus structures. Additionally, their current research state is summarized, and potential opportunities and challenges that may arise are highlighted. Overall, this review aims to serve as a valuable resource for designing, fabricating, regulating, and applying 2D Janus systems, both theoretically and experimentally. This review will strongly promote the advanced academic investigations and industrial applications of 2D Janus materials in energy and information fields.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast nonlinear dynamics of indium tin oxide nanocrystals probed via fieldoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalable, high-speed, small-footprint photonic switching platforms are essential for advancing optical communication. An effective optical switch must operate at high duty cycles with fast recovery times, while maintaining substantial modulation depth and full reversibility. Colloidal nanocrystals, such as indium tin oxide (ITO), offer a scalable platform to meet these requirements. In this work, the transmission of ITO nanocrystals near their epsilon-near-zero wavelength is modulated by two-cycle optical pulses at a repetition rate of one megahertz. The modulator exhibits a broad bandwidth spanning from 2 um to 2.5 um. Sensitive fieldoscopy measurements resolve the transient electric-field response of the ITO for the first time, showing that the modulation remains reversible for excitation fluences up to 1.2 mJ/cm2 with a modulation depth of 10%, and becomes fully irreversible beyond 3.3 mJ/cm2, while reaching modulation depth of up to 20%. Field sampling further indicates that at higher excitation fluences, the relative contribution from the first cycle of the optical pulses is reduced. These findings are crucial for the development of all-optical switching, telecommunications, and sensing technologies capable of operating at terahertz switching frequencies.</description>

      <title>Maybe you don't need a U-Net: convolutional feature upsampling for materials micrograph segmentation</title>

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive) segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.</description>

      <title>Universal relation between residual resistivity and A coefficient in correlated metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of strong electronic correlations and disorder are crucial for emergent phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, metal-insulator transitions, and quantum criticality. While both are omnipresent in real materials, their individual impacts on charge transport remain elusive. To disentangle their respective roles, we have independently varied the degree of randomness and the strength of electronic correlations -- by chemical substitution and physical pressure, respectively -- within the metallic phase nearby a Mott-insulating state. We find a distinct correlation dependence of the disorder-dependent residual resistivity $\rho_0$ in the Fermi-liquid regime $\rho(T)=\rho_0 + A T^2$, where $A\propto (m^{\star}/m)^2$ quantifies the electronic mass enhancement. Contrary to conventional expectations, we observe that at fixed disorder level $\rho_0$ grows linearly with $A$. This scaling can be understood in terms of chemical-potential fluctuations with variance $\sigma_\mu^2$, yielding $\rho_0 \propto A\,\sigma_\mu^2$. By comparing our findings to transport data on other organic Mott systems, oxides, heavy-fermion compounds, and moir\'e materials, we demonstrate that this new relation between residual resistivity and mass enhancement is a universal feature of correlated metals.</description>

      <title>Native defects, hydrogen impurities, and metal dopants in CeO$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ceria (CeO$_2$) is a material of significant technological importance. A detailed understanding of the material's defect physics and chemistry is key to understanding and optimizing its properties. Here, we report a hybrid density-functional study of native point defects, hydrogen impurities, and metal dopants in CeO$_2$. We find that electron polarons ($\eta_{\rm Ce}^-$) and oxygen vacancies ($V_{\rm O}^{2+}$) are the dominant native defects under conditions ranging from extreme oxidizing to highly reducing. Hydrogen is stable either in the hydroxyl (H$_i^+$) or hydride (H$_{\rm O}^+$) structure but the substitutional H$_{\rm O}^+$ is energetically more favorable than H$_i^+$ only under highly reducing conditions. The interstitial H$_i^+$ is highly mobile in the bulk. Yttrium (Y) is energetically most favorable at the substitutional Ce site. Copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) can be incorporated at the substitutional site and/or an interstitial site, depending on actual conditions during preparation, and the dopants can exist in different charge and spin states. In light of the results, we discuss electronic and ionic conduction and the effects of metal doping on the formation of electron polarons and oxygen vacancies.</description>

      <title>Hybrid d/p-wave altermagnetism in Ca$_{3}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and strain-controlled spin splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay of strong electronic correlations, sizable octahedral distortions, and pronounced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) makes perovskite oxides promising candidates for realizing altermagnetic phases. We study altermagnetic phases in Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$, a non-centrosymmetric layered perovskite whose ground state is a Kramers-degenerate antiferromagnet. We show that an alternative N\'eel-type spin arrangement hosts a P-2 d-wave altermagnetic state with orbital selectivity similar to Ca$_2$RuO$_4$. Including SOC generates a symmetry-allowed p-wave component and yields a hybrid d/p-wave altermagnetic order. We further demonstrate that biaxial strain tunes both magnetic stability and band splitting: compressive strain beyond 2 % favors the altermagnetic phase over the antiferromagnetic ground state, while tensile strain increases altermagnetic splittings by up to 9 %. To quantify these trends, we define an altermagnetic figure of merit and trace its strain dependence to changes in electronic localization and octahedral geometry in this polar metal.</description>

      <title>Generalized Neumann's Principle as a Unified Framework for Fractional Quantum and Conventional Ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monolayer In$_2$Se$3$ exhibits unexpected in-plane polarization, despite having $C_{3v}$ symmetry, a feature that was traditionally considered forbidden by symmetry. To explain this remarkable behavior, Ji et al. proposed the concept of fractional quantum ferroelectricity (FQFE), in which polarization occurs in fractional multiples of a quantum, and argued that this phenomenon violates {\it conventional} Neumann's principle. In this Letter, we introduce a generalized form of Neumann's principle and demonstrate that both FQFE and conventional ferroelectricity can be consistently described within this unified theoretical framework. We propose a method, based on the generalized Neumann's principle, for the systematic identification of FQFE materials. This approach is straightforward to apply and offers a clear conceptual understanding and deep physical insight for FQFE. Using this method, we determine all symmetry-allowed FQFE cases across the 32 crystallographic point groups. Since practical applications rely on the ability to control polarization, we further show that FQFE can be effectively switched via coupling with conventional polarization. Using HfZnN$_2$ as an illustrative example, we reveal the underlying mechanism of this coupling and outline a strategy to identify other materials with similar switching behavior.</description>

      <title>Periodic implementation of the random phase approximation with numerical atomic orbitals and dual reciprocal space grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The random phase approximation (RPA) has emerged as a prominent first-principles method in material science, particularly to study the adsorption and chemisorption of small molecules on surfaces. However, its widespread application is hampered by its relatively high computational cost. Here, we present a well-parallelised implementation of the RPA with localised atomic orbitals and pair-atomic density fitting, which is especially suitable for studying two-dimensional systems. Through a dual $\textbf{k}$-grid scheme, we achieve fast and reliable convergence of RPA correlation energies to the thermodynamic limit. We demonstrate the efficacy of our implementation through an application to the adsorption of CO on MgO(001) using PBE input orbitals (RPA@PBE) Our calculated adsorption energy is in good agreement with previously published RPA@PBE studies, but, as expected, overestimates the experimentally available adsorption energies as well as recent CCSD(T) results.</description>

      <title>Origins of chalcogenide perovskite instability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chalcogenide perovskites, particularly II-IV ABS3 compounds, are a promising class of materials for optoelectronic applications. However, these materials frequently exhibit instability in two respects: 1) a preference for structures containing one-dimensional edge- or face-sharing octahedral networks instead of the three-dimensional corner-sharing perovskite framework (polymorphic instability), and (2) a tendency to decompose into competing compositions (hull instability). We evaluate the stability of 81 ABS3 compounds using Density Functional Theory, finding that only BaZrS3 and BaHfS3 are both polymorphically and hull stable, with the NH4CdCl3-type structure being the preferred polymorph for 77% of these compounds. Comparison with existing tolerance factor models demonstrates that these approaches work well for known perovskites but overpredict stability for compositions without published experimental results. Polymorphic stability analysis reveals that perovskite structures are stabilized by strong B-S bonding interactions, while needle structures exhibit minimal B-S covalency, suggesting that electrostatic rather than covalent interactions drive the preference for edge-sharing motifs. Hull stability analysis comparing ABS3 to ABO3 analogues reveals a weaker inductive effect in sulfides as a possible explanation for the scarcity of sulfides compared with oxides. The relative instability of ABS3 compounds is further supported by experimental synthesis attempts. These findings provide fundamental insights into the origins of instability in chalcogenide perovskites and highlight the challenges in expanding this promising materials class beyond the few materials that have been reported to date.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Josephson Junction Barrier Variation -- a Combined Electron Microscopy, Breakdown and Monte-Carlo Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions manufactured to tight tolerances are necessary components for superconducting quantum computing. Developing precise manufacturing techniques for Josephson junctions requires an understanding of their make-up and robust feedback metrics against which to optimise. Here we consider complementary techniques assessing what conclusions they allow us to draw about the barriers in junctions. Monte-Carlo simulations of barriers show that standard deviations of 15-20% of the total barrier thickness are compatible with our experimental data. Electrical breakdown allows us to probe the weakest points in barriers. Narrowing the distribution of this breakdown provides a promising feedback mechanism for barrier optimisation. Grouping junctions by breakdown voltage allows us to identify sub-ensembles of junctions with different median resistance. Transmission electron microscopy can be used to find average barrier thickness, although we highlight challenges forming robust conclusions on the distribution of thicknesses in a barrier from these experiments.</description>

      <title>Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18236v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a growing list of insulators, experiments find that magnetic field induces a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. The experimentally-measured thermal Hall angle in various insulators does not exceed a bound and becomes maximal at the temperature of peak longitudinal thermal conductivity. The present paper aims to propose a scenario providing and explanation for these two experimental facts. It begins by noticing that at this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions become most frequent in comparison with Umklapp and boundary scattering events. Furthermore, the Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a phase in the presence of a magnetic field. In an anharmonic crystal, in which tensile and compressive strain do not cancel out, this field-induced atomic phase gives rise to a phonon Berry phase and generates phonon-phonon interference. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the phonon wavelength, $\lambda_{ph}$, and the crest atomic displacement, $\delta u_m$ at $T_{max}$. The derived expression is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.</description>

      <title>Polarization-controlled strong light-matter interaction with templated molecular aggregates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate strong light-matter interaction for a layer of templated merocyanine molecules in a planar microcavity. Using a single layer of graphene nanoribbons as a templating layer, we obtain an aligned layer of aggregated molecules. The molecular layer displays anisotropic optical properties resembling those of a biaxial crystal. The anisotropic excitonic component in the cavity results in strongly polarization-dependent light-matter interaction and in increased Rabi-energies. The increased light-matter interaction is possibly due to reduced molecular disorder in the templated molecular layer. This conclusion is supported by an analysis based on a multi-oscillator model. We further use photoluminescence microspectroscopy to demonstrate that the light-matter coupling is spatially homogeneous. Our study introduces molecular templating to strong light-matter studies. The reduced disorder of the system as a consequence of templating is highly beneficial for engineering light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Negative and positive anisotropic thermal expansion in 2D fullerene networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find a design principle for tailoring thermal expansion properties in nearly-spherical molecular networks. Using 2D fullerene networks as a representative system, we realize positive thermal expansion along intermolecular [2\,+\,2] cycloaddition bonds and negative thermal expansion along intermolecular C$-$C single bonds by varying the structural frameworks of molecules. The microscopic mechanism originates from a combination of the framework's geometric flexibility and its transverse vibrational characteristics. Based on this insight, we find molecular networks beyond C$_{60}$ with tunable thermal expansion. These findings shed light on the fundamental mechanisms governing thermal expansion in molecular networks towards rational materials design.</description>

      <title>Model for the Thermodynamics of Iron at High Pressures Near Melting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fe pressure-temperature phase diagram and its melting line have a wide range of applications, including providing constraints for iron-core planetary models. We propose an equation of state (EOS) model based on the interstitial theory of simple condensed matter (ITCM), as suggested by A.V. Granato. When applied to Fe, this model enables the extrapolation of measured melting lines to the conditions of the Earth's inner core boundary (ICB). The ITCM describes the solid-liquid phase transition in metals as resulting from a strong structural perturbation due to a high concentration of interstitial-like defects. The strong nonlinearity of their self-interaction causes the stabilization of this interstitial-rich phase. The original model is expanded to describe melting over a wide range of pressures and temperatures rather than focusing on a specific isobaric transition. Using this model, we fit the measured melting data, extrapolate it to cover ICB conditions, and develop a multiphase equation of state that encompasses this regime. The model is used to explain contradictory data regarding the location of the melting line, resulting from a novel phase transition between two separate liquid phases, specifically between FCC-based and HCP-based liquids. This additional liquid phase offers a new interpretation of the previously suggested near-melting high-pressure phase and may also provide a solution to the inner core nucleation paradox.</description>

      <title>Orientation dependent anomalous Hall and spin Hall currents at the junctions of altermagnets with $p$-wave magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study charge and spin transport across a junction between an altermagnet (AM) and a $p$-wave magnet (PM) using a continuum model with boundary conditions tailored to the spin-split band structures of the two materials. Remarkably, although neither AM nor PM is spin-polarized, we find that the junction supports finite spin currents both longitudinally and transversely. We compute the longitudinal and transverse charge and spin conductivities as functions of the crystallographic orientations and the relative angle between the Neel vectors of AM and PM. Our results reveal that transverse charge and spin conductivities can be finite even when the longitudinal charge conductivity vanishes. For suitable parameter choices and orientation angles, the transverse conductivities are more prominent than the longitudinal ones. The origin of these effects lies in the matching and mismatching of transverse momentum modes ($k_y$) across the junction combined with the spin-dependent band splitting in AM and PM. Furthermore, while the transverse charge conductivity may cancel for certain orientations, the transverse spin conductivity remains finite due to unequal contributions of opposite $k_y$ channels. These findings highlight altermagnet-$p$-wave magnet junctions as a promising platform for tunable generation and control of transverse charge and spin currents driven purely by crystallographic orientation and spin structure.</description>
