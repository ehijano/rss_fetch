      <title>Fresnel's Mechanical Legacy Recovered: How Bubble Acoustics Unifies Partial Drag, Velocity Addition, and Atomic Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound waves in bubbly water and light in special relativity obey identical first-order transport laws. This equivalence is not approximate or analogical but mathematically identical to first order in $U/v$, sharing the same form discovered by Fresnel in 1818 for light in moving transparent media. We demonstrate that all three systems-bubble acoustics, optical drag, and relativistic velocity addition-are described by a universal partial entrainment equation where wave coupling to compliant components determines the drag coefficient. In bubbly liquids this physics is directly observable: waves couple to compressible bubbles rather than rigid liquid. Since bubble dynamics reproduces the relativistic result, velocity addition itself admits mechanical interpretation. Von Laue's 1907 derivation abstracted mechanics into kinematics; we reverse this, showing relativistic effects preserve mechanical content in abstract form. Beyond first-order equivalence, we show Fresnel's dispersive term encodes group velocity (energy transport) versus phase velocity (wave-crest motion)-a distinction mechanical models naturally capture but pure kinematic velocity addition cannot address. The rigidity-based interpretation of dispersion, established in acoustic metamaterials, provides cross-domain insights for materials design and suggests testable predictions linking acoustic compliance to optical drag. This three-way equivalence reduces independent phenomena to a single principle: waves riding compliant inclusions. Fresnel drag, Lorentz contraction, and atomic polarization all emerge as aspects of this one mechanism, traced through the historical density-versus-rigidity fork that shaped aether theory's trajectory. The compliant-inclusion principle shows striking quantitative agreement with isotope mass-dependence and resonance structure in existing spectroscopic data.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of $\bf3.5\times10^{-13}$ laser frequency stability at 1000 s using an iodine-filled hollow-core fiber photonic microcell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a laser frequency stabilization system based on an iodine-filled hollow-core photonic microcell (PMC), which is a sealed version of a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber (HC-PCF). A 532 nm laser is locked to the a1 component of the R(56) 32-0 transition of molecular iodine in the fiber cell, and its frequency stability is compared to that of the same component in a free-space iodine cell. Noise analysis reveals that the system is limited by parasitic beams that interfere with the beam of interest and degrade the error signal. We have identified and characterized three types of parasitic interference and designed suppression methods for each. After applying these suppression methods, the frequency stability improved by more than an order of magnitude. The system achieves fractional frequency stability of $3.5\times10^{-13}$ for integration times around 1000 s. To our knowledge, this represents the best frequency stability achieved using a gas-filled hollow-core photonic crystal fiber frequency reference.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optics of dichroic chiral photonic crystals: resonant diffraction transmission and higher-order reflections at grazing angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-optical effects in structured anisotropic media have attracted significant attention due to their potential in tunable photonic devices. In particular, dichroic cholesteric liquid crystals (i.e., cholesterics in which the real parts of the local dielectric permeability tensor are equal each other, and the imaginary parts differ) provide a unique system in which absorption anisotropy rather than anisotropy of real pars of the local dielectric permeability controls the optical response. In this work, we investigated the magneto-optical properties of dichroic cholesteric liquid crystals under oblique light incidence. To analyze the optical characteristics, we used the Berreman method, which is a matrix approach to solving Maxwell's equations. The unique properties of such structures were revealed, namely, resonant Bragg diffraction transmission instead of diffraction reflection and higher orders of diffraction reflection under oblique light incidence at grazing angles. It was shown that at light oblique incidence in the presence of an external magnetic field, new Dirac points appear in the spectra of such structures at each order of diffraction reflection. Furthermore, it is shown that an external magnetic field suppresses the shift of the polarization of eigenmodes from circular to linear polarization as the angle of incidence increases. This system can be used as a narrowband filter with a widely tunable wavelength.</description>

      <title>Machine learning identification of fractional-order vortex beam diffraction process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional-order vortex beams possess fractional orbital angular momentum (FOAM) modes, which theoretically have the potential to increase transmission capacity infinitely. Therefore, they have significant application prospects in the fields of measurement, optical communication and micro-particle manipulation. However, when fractional-order vortex beams propagate in free space, the discontinuity of the helical phase makes them susceptible to diffraction in practical applications, thereby affecting the accuracy of OAM mode recognition and severely limiting the use of FOAM-based optical communication. Achieving machine learning recognition of fractional-order vortex beams under diffraction conditions is currently an urgent and unreported issue. Based on ResNet, a deep learning (DL) method of accurately recognizing the propagation distance and topological charge of fractional-order vortex beam diffraction process is proposed in this work. Utilizing both experimentally measured and numerically simulated intensity distributions, a dataset of vortex beam diffraction intensity patterns in atmospheric turbulence environments is created. An improved 101-layer ResNet structure based on transfer learning is employed to achieve accurate and efficient recognition of the FOAM model at different propagation distances. Experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately recognize FOAM modes with a propagation distance of 100 cm, a spacing of 5 cm, and a mode spacing of 0.1 under turbulent conditions, with an accuracy of 99.69%. This method considers the effect of atmospheric turbulence during spatial transmission, allowing the recognition scheme to achieve high accuracy even in special environments. It has the ability to distinguish ultra-fine FOAM modes and propagation distances, which cannot be achieved by traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Vortex Propagation in Orbital Angular Momentum Beams and the Effects of a Limited Aperture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When generating light with orbital angular momentum by imprinting orbital phase onto a standard Gaussian beam, it is often assumed that the propagation of the generated spatial mode is a Laguerre-Gaussian. However, the true propagation of this beam in a realistic, aperture-limited optical system is non-trivial and has not been thoroughly explored in existing literature. We explore a numerical model that shows the development of an optical vortex mode, propagating from the plane of phase modulation, and the relation of these dynamics to the orbital phase factor $\ell$ and the spatial bandwidth of the optical system. The results of this model are compared to experimental data for beams with $\ell$ values 1, 2, 5, and 10 propagating through a range of spatial filters, with the described model showing agreement in the near field regime.</description>

      <title>Casimir effect in twisted photonic gratings with in-plane chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Casimir effect in a system of two twisted photonic gratings made of uniaxially anisotropic materials. Two distinct configuretions are explored: a stack of symmetric gratings and a stack of in-plane chiral gratings, with the latter realized by choosing specific orientaton of anisotropy axis relative to stripes. We apply the reflection-matrix-based Casimir Lifshitzformalism to explore hoe twiat angle, material anisotropy, and the separation between gratings influence Casimir energy, force and torque. Our calculations reveal that the equilibrium orientation of the gratings is governed by the anisotropy rotation angles, leading to a chiral configuration where the anisotropy axes of the upper and lower gratings are mutually parallel. These findings demonstrate that material anisotropy provids a pwerful mechanism for controlling rotational alignment forces in nanophotonic system.</description>

      <title>From diffusion optics to photocatalytic rates in multiply scattering porous slabs: finite-slab Green's function, optical-to-kinetic mapping, and application to core-shell aerogels with embedded anatase nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an end-to-end framework connecting steady-state photon transport in highly scattering porous slabs to surface-bound photocatalytic rates. Starting from the diffusion approximation (DA) with extrapolated (partial-current) boundary conditions, we solve the finite-slab Green's function with an isotropic internal plane source that rigorously maps external illumination to internal fluence. Using photon units for the fluence rate, Phi(z,lambda) [photons m-2 s-1], the local absorption is qa = mu_a * Phi and the primary carrier/radical generation is G = phi_int * qa. Site-limited and Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics are driven by G and closed via an accessible surface per macroscopic volume, S_accessible, yielding intrinsic volumetric (per-volume) and areal (per-area) rate constants. We then specialize to air-core/silica-shell monoliths whose shells host anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs): shell refractive indices are calculated by Maxwell-Garnett/Bruggeman mixing; scattering is obtained from Mie theory (PyMieScatt); absorption follows mu_a = n_NP * sigma_abs with n_NP set by NP packing fraction in the shell. The exact slab solution reduces to a compact, design-useful predictor - our Eq. (14) - in a controlled asymptotic that clarifies when the rate scales as l*l/L (strongly diffusive, l &lt;&lt; L) versus proportional to l (optically thin, l &gt;&gt; L). We detail measurement and validation protocols (diffuse R/T inversion of mu_s' and mu_a on the same slab, boundary extrapolation accuracy, lateral-loss control) drawing on prior art, and provide a turnkey recipe to compute rates for NP packing-fraction series. The result is a reproducible workflow that preserves design simplicity while resting on a rigorous finite-slab solution.</description>

      <title>Elliptical-rod geometries enhance photonic band gaps in disordered stealthy hyperuniform photonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional photonic crystals composed of elliptical dielectric rods arranged according to stealthy hyperuniform point patterns. These patterns are characterized by the structure factor, which vanishes for 0 &lt; |k| &lt;= K, where k is the wave number and K denotes the cutoff wave number specifying the stealthiness of the pattern. The optical properties of the photonic crystals are analyzed by applying the plane-wave expansion method to Maxwell's equations. We demonstrate that photonic crystals composed of elliptical dielectric rods can exhibit larger photonic band gaps than those with cylindrical rods when both the rod orientation and aspect ratio are properly optimized. This behavior contrasts with that of periodic lattices such as triangular or square arrays. These findings shed light on the crucial role of structural anisotropy and aperiodic structure in enhancing photonic band-gap formation.</description>

      <title>Active control the peak value of Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect with classical light by holographic projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Manipulation of g^(2)(0) peak value of Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) effect is discussed with a holographic projection scheme. By the aid of target pattern artificially designed in the projection imaging system, the statistical distribution of projection pattern will be highly controllable. In this work, we theoretically point out key factors influencing the g^(2)(0) peak value of HBT effect in a single-lens incoherent imaging system. We find the peak value is not only decided by statistical property and coherence length of target pattern but also depends on the intrinsic characteristics of projection system, such as numerical aperture and projection quality. Then, we experimentally measured the g^(2)(0) peak value of HBT effect with a phase-only holographic projection scheme and demonstrate the applicability of our theoretical analysis on the holographic scheme. Here, the super-bunching effect in the projection plane has been observed, when target patterns originated from chaotic speckle or it's function transformation patterns. Moreover, we design some sparse target patterns, whose holographic reconstruction patterns show the super-bunching effect achieving g^(2)(0)=39.77. Finally, we discussed the positive influence of holographic noise on increasing the g^(2)(0) peak value. The presented work predicting the peak value of HBT effect not only is applicable for the lens imaging system but also in other projection systems, such as the holographic projection.</description>

      <title>Suspension-Free Integrated Cavity Brillouin Optomechanics on a Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity optomechanical systems enable coherent photon-phonon interactions essential for quantum technologies, yet high-performance devices have been limited to suspended structures. Here, we overcome this limitation by demonstrating cavity Brillouin optomechanics in a suspension-free racetrack microring resonator on a lithium-niobate-on-sapphire chip, a platform that merits high stability and scalability. We demonstrate coherent coupling between telecom-band optical modes and a 9.6-GHz phonon mode, achieving a maximum cooperativity of $0.41$ and a phonon quality-factor-frequency product of $10^{13}\,\mathrm{Hz}$. The momentum-matching condition inherent to traveling-wave Brillouin interactions establishes a one-to-one mapping between optical wavelength and phonon frequency, enabling multi-channel parallel operations across nearly $300\,\mathrm{MHz}$ in phonon frequency and $40\,\mathrm{nm}$ in optical wavelength. Our suspension-free architecture provides a coherent photon-phonon interface compatible with wafer-scale integration, opening pathways toward hybrid quantum circuits that unite photonic, phononic, and superconducting components on a single chip.</description>

      <title>Soliton interaction and bound state formation in coupled Kerr resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soliton dynamics in coupled Kerr microcavities is an important aspect of frequency comb technologies, with applications in optical communication and precision metrology. We investigate a minimal system consisting of two nearly identical coupled Kerr microresonators, each operating in the soliton regime and driven by a separate coherent beam, and analyze the mechanisms that govern their soliton interactions. In the weak-coupling regime, the system supports multiple soliton clusters characterized by distinct soliton separations and stability. Numerical simulations indicate that asymmetric perturbations can alter soliton separations or destroy these states, while the imposed pump phase difference plays a key role in cluster selection. Together, these findings highlight previously unexplored regimes of dissipative soliton organization and suggest new strategies for controlling soliton ensembles in integrated photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Super-robust telecommunications enabled by topological half-supermodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological photonics offers transformative potential for robust integrated waveguide devices due to their backscattering-immune properties. However, their integration faces two fundamental challenges: mode symmetry mismatch with conventional waveguides and prohibitive dimensions. We successfully overcome these two critical challenges by introducing a novel valley-ridge gap waveguide based on topological half-supermode engineering. By strategically hybridizing ridge waveguide modes and valley kink states, we create an exotic odd-symmetric supermode enabling robust propagation and ultra-compact operation. The further implementation of a perfect electric conductor boundary halves lateral dimensions while eliminating radiation loss. Crucially, our proposed valley-ridge interface achieves direct transverse electric mode matching with standard waveguides without transition structures, enabling seamless integration. Experimental results demonstrate reflection losses lower than -15 dB in realistic telecommunication scenarios with super-robust signal propagation through sharp bends. This work innovatively conceptualizes topological half-supermodes and pioneers their practical applications for integrated waveguide devices, establishing a completely new waveguide class that uniquely combines robust backscattering immunity with deep subwavelength compactness.</description>

      <title>Color Routing and Beam Steering of Single-Molecule Emission with a Spherical Silicon Nanoantenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon emitters radiate as electric dipoles, which limits light collection efficiency and complicates integration into flat photonic devices. Developing nanophotonic structures capable of directing photon emission with tunable angular distributions in the visible spectrum has been pursued for applications ranging from integrated optical systems to discrimination of molecular species. To date, such directional control has been achieved using components whose overall footprint is larger than the emission wavelength and often rely on lossy plasmonic components. Here, we employ the DNA origami technique for deterministic nanoscale assembly, positioning single fluorophores in nanometric proximity to a single silicon spherical nanoparticle and demonstrate unidirectional emission with forward-to-backward intensity ratios up to ~7 dB. Furthermore, we show that a single silicon nanosphere antenna can function as a color router or a beam steerer depending on its size, emitter spectral range and emitter-nanoparticle distance.</description>

      <title>Phonon Polaritons and Epsilon Near Zero Modes in Sapphire Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) are promising candidates for enhanced light--matter interactions due to their efficient and low-loss light confinement features. In this work, we present unique light-matter interactions in saphhire within its Reststrahlen bands (RBs) across the long-wave infrared (LWIR) spectrum ($\omega = 385$-$1050~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$). Particularly, we investigated the nanocone-patterned sapphire resonator array, with specific attention to its in-plane and out-of-plane permittivity components. Through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurement and full-wave photonic simulations, we identified a range of optical excitations in the RBs, including three SPhPs, two hyperbolic volume phonon polaritons (HVPhPs), and one epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) mode. The depth-resolved confocal Raman spectroscopy revealed strongly enhanced Raman signals on the nanostructured surface, suggesting the mode coupling between phonons and phonon-polaritons, which was further confirmed by the finite element modeling of polarizability. This exploratory study provides in-depth insights into the dynamics of LWIR phonon polaritons and ENZ modes in the nanostructured sapphire, indicating its great potential for innovative nanophotonic applications.</description>

      <title>Multipolar Decomposition of Magnetic Circular Dichroism in Arbitrarily Shaped Magneto-Dielectric Scatterers</title>

Abstract: Multipole expansion methods have been primarily used for analyzing the electromagnetic scattering from non-magnetic isotropic dielectric scatterers, and studies about the scattering from magnetic objects seem to be lacking. In this work, we used the multipolar expansion framework for decomposing the electromagnetic scattering by dielectric particles with magnetic properties. Magnetization current contributions were explicitly accounted for by using the vector spherical harmonics to compute the electric and magnetic multipole contributions of arbitrary order. The exact analytical expressions for the corresponding spherical multipole coefficients were employed, with the scattering efficiencies being used to distinguish the dielectric and magnetic contributions of each multipole. This enables the analysis of scattering from arbitrarily shaped, anisotropic, and inhomogeneous magnetic scatterers. It also provides a tool for studying non-reciprocal devices that exploit magnetic resonances in magnetic-dielectric materials. Calculations were made for an experimentally feasible system, namely for ferrite-based scatterers operating in the microwave regime. These materials are of interest in radio frequency (RF) applications due to their magnetic activity. We demonstrated analytically that the magnetic circular dichroism in a magnetic-dielectric scatterer in the Faraday geometry can be decomposed into individual multipole contributions. The analytical results indicate that multipole resonances associated with magnetization currents can be even stronger than multipole contributions from conventional dielectric currents. It is worth noting that these analytical results were verified through comparison with numerical results from finite element method (FEM) simulations in COMSOL Multiphysics.</description>

      <title>On-sky Demonstration of Subdiffraction-limited Astronomical Measurement Using a Photonic Lantern</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resolving fine details of astronomical objects provides critical insights into their underlying physical processes. This drives in part the desire to construct ever-larger telescopes and interferometer arrays and to observe at shorter wavelength to lower the diffraction limit of angular resolution. Alternatively, one can aim to overcome the diffraction limit by extracting more information from a single telescope's aperture. A promising way to do this is spatial mode-based imaging, which projects focal-plane field onto a set of spatial modes before detection, retaining focal-plane phase information crucial at small angular scales but typically lost in intensity imaging. However, the practical implementation of mode-based imaging in astronomy from the ground has been challenged by atmospheric turbulence. Here, we present the first on-sky demonstration of a subdiffraction-limited, mode-based measurement using a photonic lantern (PL)-fed spectrometer installed on the SCExAO instrument at the Subaru Telescope. We introduce a novel calibration strategy that mitigates time-varying wavefront error and misalignment effects, leveraging simultaneously recorded focal-plane images and using a spectral-differential technique that self-calibrates the data. Observing the classical Be star $\beta$ CMi, we detected spectral-differential spatial signals and reconstructed images of its H$\alpha$-emitting disk. We achieved an unprecedented H$\alpha$ photocenter precision of 50$\mu$as in about 10-minute observation with a single telescope, measuring the disk's near-far side asymmetry for the first time. This work demonstrates the high precision, efficiency, and practicality of photonic mode-based imaging techniques to recover subdiffraction-limited information, opening new avenues for high angular resolution spectroscopic studies in astronomy.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Thermal Models for Test Masses in Next-Generation Gravitational Wave Interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate thermal modeling of Terminal Test Masses (TTMs) is crucial for optimizing the sensitivity of gravitational wave interferometers like Virgo. In fact, in such gravitational wave detectors even minimal laser power absorption can induce performance-limiting thermal effects. This paper presents a detailed investigation into the steady-state thermal behavior of TTMs. In particular, future scenarios of increased intracavity laser beam power and optical coating absorption are considered. We develop and compare two numerical models: a comprehensive model incorporating volumetric heat absorption in both the multilayer coating and the bulk substrate, and a simplified reduced model where the coating's thermal impact is represented as an effective surface boundary condition on the substrate. Our simulations were focused on a ternary coating design, which is a candidate for use in next-generation detectors. Results reveal that higher coating absorption localizes peak temperatures near the coating--vacuum interface. Importantly, the comparative analysis demonstrates that temperature predictions from the reduced model differ from the detailed model by only milli-Kelvins, a discrepancy often within the experimental uncertainties of the system's thermo-physical parameters. This finding suggests that computationally efficient reduced models can provide sufficiently accurate results for thermal management and first-order distortion analyses. Moreover, the critical role of accurately characterizing the total power absorbed by the coating is emphasized.</description>

      <title>Nonergodic extended phase for waves in three dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave transport in complex media is determined by the nature of quasimodes at the microscopic level. In three dimensional disordered media, waves generally undergo a phase transition from diffusion to Anderson localization, characterized by exponentially localized modes. A remarkable exception are electromagnetic waves, whose vector-like nature prevents Anderson localization to occur. Here we demonstrate that both scalar and vector (electromagnetic) waves exhibit a non-ergodic extended phase characterized by fractal quasimodes, for a broad range of disorder strengths. While electromagnetic waves remain in the non-ergodic extended phase at high disorder strength, scalar waves eventually enter a localized regime. These results pave the way for the engineering of anomalous wave transport phenomena in disordered media without spatial correlations.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of entanglement-based QKD protocols with SPDC and QD sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the feasibility of entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols considering widely used spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) and novel quantum dot (QD) sources. We account for multiphoton emission in SPDC sources and fine-structure splitting (FSS) in QD. In addition, we incorporate imperfect detection, including dark counts and limited efficiency. For SPDC sources, we confirm that the presence of vacuum and multiphoton pairs renders them unsuitable for secure device-independent (DI) QKD implementations under standard detection strategies. Conversely, in the case of QD sources, accounting for the effects of FSS, results in reduced performance of protocols. Our findings are crucial for the practical implementation of entanglement-based QKD protocols using realistic sources and detectors.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions and Virtual Exceptional Points in Quantum Emitters Coupled to Dissipative Baths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling atom-photon interactions in engineered environments is central to quantum optics and emerging quantum technologies. Non-Hermitian (NH) photonic baths, where dissipation fundamentally reshapes spectral and dynamical properties, provide versatile platforms for such control. Here we investigate the relaxation dynamics of a single two-level quantum emitter coupled to the edge of a semi-infinite dissipative bosonic lattice with uniform loss. Despite the simplicity of this bath, we uncover rich dynamical phase transitions, i.e. qualitative changes in spontaneous emission decay as system parameters are varied. In particular, we establish the existence of an optimal dissipative environment for accelerated spontaneous emission. The phase transitions are traced to spectral restructuring of the resolvent, in some cases governed by the coalescence of resonance states on the second Riemann sheet. We identify these coalescences as virtual exceptional points (EPs) of resonance origin, providing a conceptual bridge with EP physics while highlighting distinctive features of infinite-dimensional NH systems. More broadly, our results illustrate how the specific nature of dissipation -- whether uniform losses, staggered losses, or dephasing -- can profoundly impact emitter relaxation, pointing to dissipation engineering as a versatile tool for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity microsecond-scale cellular imaging using two-axis compressed streak imaging fluorescence microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compressed streak imaging (CSI) is a computational imaging strategy that can acquire video at over 150 trillion frames per second. Despite this achievement, CSI faces challenges in detecting subtle intensity fluctuations in slow-moving, continuously illuminated objects. This limitation, largely attributable to high streak compression and motion blur, has curtailed the broader adoption of CSI in cellular fluorescence microscopy. To address these issues and expand the utility of CSI, we developed a two-axis compressed streak imaging (TACSI) method that results in significant improvements to the reconstructed video fidelity. TACSI introduces a second scanning axis which shuttles a conjugate image of the object with respect to the coded aperture. The moving image decreases the streak compression ratio and produces a "flash and shutter" phenomenon that reduces coded aperture motion blur, overcoming the limitations of current CSI technologies. This approach is supported with an analytical model describing the TACSI compression ratio, along with simulated and empirical measurements. We demonstrate TACSI's ability to measure rapid variations in cell membrane potentials, previously unattainable with conventional CSI. This method has broad implications for high-speed photography, including visualization of action potentials, muscle contractions, and enzymatic reactions that occur on microsecond and faster timescales using fluorescence microscopy.</description>

      <title>Accurate Angle-Resolved Raman Spectroscopy Methodology: Quantifying the Dichroic Edge Filter Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Angle-resolved Raman spectroscopy (ARRS) is an effective method to analyze the symmetry of phonons and other excitations in molecules and solid-state crystals. While there are several configurations of ARRS instruments, the measurement system detailed here utilizes two pairs of linear polarizers and superachromatic half-wave plates. After the orientations of the linear polarizers are set to fixed angles, the two half-wave plates rotate independently, through motorized control, enabling 2D linear polarization mapping. Described within is a protocol to achieve high quality ARRS measurements leveraging phonons from easily accessible test materials [molybdenum disulfide (MoS_2), sapphire (Al_2O_3) and silicon] to validate the system and operation. Quantitative polarized Raman data strongly depends on the quality of sample surface and the optics: the order of placement, alignment, and any distortion caused by their coatings. This study identifies the impact of commonly used edge filters on the polarization response of materials with an anisotropic response as emulated by the T_2g phonon in the Si(100). We detect and model the significant distortion of the T_2g phonon polarization response originating from our dichroic edge filters, the results of which are broadly applicable to optics in any Raman instrument. This ARRS setup also enables helicity-resolved Raman measurements by replacing the first half-wave plate with a superachromatic quarter-wave plate; this configuration is also validated using the Raman response of the aforementioned test materials. This paper aims to increase the quality and reproducibility of polarized Raman measurements through both instrumental considerations and methodology.</description>

Abstract: Terahertz radiation finds an increasing number of applications, yet efficient generation and detection remain a challenge and an active area of research. In particular, the precise detection of weak and narrowband terahertz signals is notoriously difficult. Here, we employ a novel type of single-photon detector based on Rydberg atoms to both detect and calibrate a terahertz frequency comb over an octave-spanning range, yet with a MHz-level selectivity. We calibrate the intensity of the electric field of the comb against the fundamental atomic properties, while achieving the intensity (power) sensitivity down to 45.2 $\mathrm{fW\ cm^{-2}\ Hz^{-0.5}}$ (1.84 $\mathrm{fW\ Hz^{-0.5}}$) within a single mode of the frequency comb, all in a room-temperature operated setup. Our results elucidate the transition of terahertz frequency combs into the quantum regime, enabling high-precision and high-sensitivity spectroscopy. This breakthrough allows terahertz science to better leverage revolutionary techniques developed for optical frequency combs.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast All-Optical Measurement of Squeezed Vacuum in a Lithium Niobate Nanophotonic Circuit</title>

Abstract: Squeezed vacuum, a fundamental resource for continuous-variable quantum information processing, has been used to demonstrate quantum advantages in sensing, communication, and computation. While most experiments use homodyne detection to characterize squeezing and are therefore limited to electronic bandwidths, recent experiments have shown optical parametric amplification (OPA) to be a viable measurement strategy. Here, we realize OPA-based quantum state tomography in integrated photonics and demonstrate the generation and all-optical Wigner tomography of squeezed vacuum in a nanophotonic circuit. We employ dispersion-engineering to enable the distortion-free propagation of femtosecond pulses and achieve ultrabroad operation bandwidths, effectively lifting the speed restrictions imposed by traditional electronics on quantum measurements with a theoretical maximum clock speed of 6.5 THz. We implement our circuit on thin-film lithium niobate, a platform compatible with a wide variety of active and passive photonic components. Our results chart a course for realizing all-optical ultrafast quantum information processing in an integrated room-temperature platform.</description>

      <title>Tracking electron capture processes in classical molecular dynamics simulations for spectral line broadening in plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasma spectroscopy is a fundamental tool for diagnosing laboratory and astrophysical plasmas. Accurate interpretation of spectra depends upon precise modeling and comprehension of Stark broadening and other mechanisms affecting spectral lines. In this context, computer simulations have emerged as valuable tools, offering idealized experiments with well-defined conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations, in particular, excel at replicating the particle interactions within the plasma and their impact on the state of a radiating atom or ion. However, these simulations present challenges in tracking electron capture processes, since setting an unambiguous criterion to distinguish between bound and free electrons is not trivial. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm that, within a classical framework, precisely identifies the scenario in which an electron is captured by an ion and then follows a stable orbit around it. The algorithm's applicability extends to emitters with charges Z &gt;= 1. The procedure enables the correct identification of valid time-histories of the electric microfield perturbing the emitting ion, which will be used for subsequent line shape calculations. The ionization balance results obtained from the application of this algorithm are compared with an additional method based on the potential energy of the particles in the simulations, finding good agreement, therefore validating the use of this approach.</description>
