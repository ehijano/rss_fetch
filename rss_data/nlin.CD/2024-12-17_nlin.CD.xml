      <title>Robust methods to detect coupling among nonlinear time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two numerical methods are proposed for detection of coupling between multiple time series generated by deterministic nonlinear systems. The first detects interdependence or the existence of coupling between time series. The second ascertains directionality of coupling, or alternatively, latent coupling, the case when multiple series are driven by another, unobserved system. In either case, the driver and the recipients of the coupling may be periodic or aperiodic, and in particular may be chaotic. The only inputs to the method are two or more simultaneously recorded time series. The methods rely solely on ranking distances between states in time-delay reconstructions of the data, and for that reason tend to be robust to observational noise.</description>

      <title>Three forms of dimension reduction for border-collision bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For dynamical systems that switch between different modes of operation, parameter variation can cause periodic solutions to lose or acquire new switching events. When this causes the eigenvalues (stability multipliers) associated with the solution to change discontinuously, we show that if one eigenvalue remains continuous then all local invariant sets of the leading-order approximation to the system occur on a lower dimensional manifold. This allows us to analyse the dynamics with fewer variables, which is particularly helpful when the dynamics is chaotic. We compare this to two other codimension-two scenarios for which dimension reduction can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Defining classical and quantum chaos through adiabatic transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a formalism which defines chaos in both quantum and classical systems in an equivalent manner by means of \textit{adiabatic transformations}. The complexity of adiabatic transformations which preserve classical time-averaged trajectories (quantum eigenstates) in response to Hamiltonian deformations serves as a measure of chaos. This complexity is quantified by the (properly regularized) fidelity susceptibility. Physically this measure quantifies long time instabilities of physical observables due to small changes in the Hamiltonian of the system. Our exposition clearly showcases the common structures underlying quantum and classical chaos and allows us to distinguish integrable, chaotic but non-thermalizing, and ergodic/mixing regimes. We apply the fidelity susceptibility to a model of two coupled spins and demonstrate that it successfully predicts the universal onset of chaos, both for finite spin $S$ and in the classical limit $S\to\infty$. Interestingly, we find that finite $S$ effects are anomalously large close to integrability.</description>

      <title>Near-horizon chaos beyond Einstein gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09945v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate chaos in the dynamics of massless particles near the horizon of static spherically symmetric black holes in two well-motivated models of $f(R)$ gravity. In both these models, we probe chaos in the particle trajectories (under suitable harmonic confinement) in the vicinity of the black hole horizons, for a set of initial conditions. The particle trajectories, associated Poincar\'e sections, and Lyapunov exponents clearly illustrate the role played by the black hole horizon in the growth of chaos. We find that with increasing energy, the particle trajectories explore regions closer to the black hole horizon, with reduced overlap between two initially close trajectories. We demonstrate how this energy range is controlled by the parameters of the modified gravity theory under consideration. The growth of chaos in such a classical setting is known to respect a surface gravity bound arising from universal aspects of particle dynamics close to the black hole horizon [K. Hashimoto and N. Tanahashi, Phys. Rev. D 95, 024007 (2017)], analogous to the quantum Maldacena, Shenker, and Stanford bound [J. Maldacena et al., J. High Energy Phys. 08 (2016) 106]. Interestingly, both models studied in our work respect the bound, in contrast to some of the other models of $f(R)$ gravity in the existing literature. The work serves as a motivation to use chaos as an additional tool to probe Einstein gravity in the strong gravity regime in the vicinity of black hole horizons.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Predicting Chaotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting chaotic dynamical systems is critical in many scientific fields, such as weather forecasting, but challenging due to the characteristic sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Traditional modeling approaches require extensive domain knowledge, often leading to a shift towards data-driven methods using machine learning. However, existing research provides inconclusive results on which machine learning methods are best suited for predicting chaotic systems. In this paper, we compare different lightweight and heavyweight machine learning architectures using extensive existing benchmark databases, as well as a newly introduced database that allows for uncertainty quantification in the benchmark results. In addition to state-of-the-art methods from the literature, we also present new advantageous variants of established methods. Hyperparameter tuning is adjusted based on computational cost, with more tuning allocated to less costly methods. Furthermore, we introduce the cumulative maximum error, a novel metric that combines desirable properties of traditional metrics and is tailored for chaotic systems. Our results show that well-tuned simple methods, as well as untuned baseline methods, often outperform state-of-the-art deep learning models, but their performance can vary significantly with different experimental setups. These findings highlight the importance of aligning prediction methods with data characteristics and caution against the indiscriminate use of overly complex models.</description>
