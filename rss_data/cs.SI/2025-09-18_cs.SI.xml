      <title>Higher-order Network phenomena of cascading failures in resilient cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern urban resilience is threatened by cascading failures in multimodal transport networks, where localized shocks trigger widespread paralysis. Existing models, limited by their focus on pairwise interactions, often underestimate this systemic risk. To address this, we introduce a framework that confronts higher-order network theory with empirical evidence from a large-scale, real-world multimodal transport network. Our findings confirm a fundamental duality: network integration enhances static robustness metrics but simultaneously creates the structural pathways for catastrophic cascades. Crucially, we uncover the source of this paradox: a profound disconnect between static network structure and dynamic functional failure. We provide strong evidence that metrics derived from the network's static blueprint-encompassing both conventional low-order centrality and novel higher-order structural analyses-are fundamentally disconnected from and thus poor predictors of a system's dynamic functional resilience. This result highlights the inherent limitations of static analysis and underscores the need for a paradigm shift towards dynamic models to design and manage truly resilient urban systems.</description>

      <title>Outperforming Dijkstra on Sparse Graphs: The Lightning Network Use Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient routing is critical for payment channel networks (PCNs) such as the Lightning Network (LN), where most clients currently rely on Dijkstra-based algorithms for payment pathfinding. While Dijkstra's algorithm has long been regarded as optimal on sparse graphs, recent theoretical work challenges this view. The new Bounded Multi-Source Shortest Path (BMSSP) algorithm by Duan et al. theoretically achieves $O(m~log^{2/3}~n)$ runtime, which is asymptotically faster than Dijkstra's $O(m + n~log~n)$ on sparse directed graphs. In this paper, we implement BMSSP on Rust and compare its performance against Dijkstra's using real LN topology data. Our evaluation, based on multiple randomized trials and statistical tests, shows that current implementations of BMSSP do not significantly outperform Dijkstra's in practice, and speedups are smaller than what theory predicts, possibly due to implementation and constant factor overheads. These results provide the first empirical evidence of BMSSP's potential to accelerate LN routing and inform future optimizations of PCN pathfinding algorithms.</description>

      <title>Applicability of the Minimal Dominating Set for Influence Maximization in Multilayer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15236v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The minimal dominating set (MDS) is a well-established concept in network controllability and has been successfully applied in various domains, including sensor placement, network resilience, and epidemic containment. In this study, we adapt the local-improvement MDS routine and explore its potential for enhancing seed selection for influence maximization in multilayer networks (MLN). We employ the Linear Threshold Model (LTM), which offers an intuitive representation of influence spread or opinion dynamics by accounting for peer influence accumulation. To ensure interpretability, we utilize rank-refining seed selection methods, with the results further filtered with MDS. Our findings reveal that incorporating MDS into the seed selection process improves spread only within a specific range of situations. Notably, the improvement is observed for larger seed set budgets, lower activation thresholds, and when an "AND" strategy is used to aggregate influence across network layers. This scenario reflects situations where an individual does not require the majority of their acquaintances to hold a target opinion, but must be influenced across all social circles.</description>

      <title>MindVote: When AI Meets the Wild West of Social Media Opinion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14422v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as scalable tools for pilot testing, predicting public opinion distributions before deploying costly surveys. To serve as effective pilot testing tools, the performance of these LLMs is typically benchmarked against their ability to reproduce the outcomes of past structured surveys. This evaluation paradigm, however, is misaligned with the dynamic, context-rich social media environments where public opinion is increasingly formed and expressed. By design, surveys strip away the social, cultural, and temporal context that shapes public opinion, and LLM benchmarks built on this paradigm inherit these critical limitations. To bridge this gap, we introduce MindVote, the first benchmark for public opinion distribution prediction grounded in authentic social media discourse. MindVote is constructed from 3,918 naturalistic polls sourced from Reddit and Weibo, spanning 23 topics and enriched with detailed annotations for platform, topical, and temporal context. Using this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 15 LLMs. MindVote provides a robust, ecologically valid framework to move beyond survey-based evaluations and advance the development of more socially intelligent AI systems.</description>

      <title>Structural Dynamics of Harmful Content Dissemination on WhatsApp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: WhatsApp, a platform with more than two billion global users, plays a crucial role in digital communication, but also serves as a vector for harmful content such as misinformation, hate speech, and political propaganda. This study examines the dynamics of harmful message dissemination in WhatsApp groups, with a focus on their structural characteristics. Using a comprehensive data set of more than 5.1 million messages, including text, images, and videos, collected from approximately 6,000 groups in India, we reconstruct message propagation cascades to analyze dissemination patterns. Our findings reveal that harmful messages consistently achieve greater depth and breadth of dissemination compared to messages without harmful annotations, with videos and images emerging as the primary modes of dissemination. These results suggest a distinctive pattern of dissemination of harmful content. However, our analysis indicates that modality alone cannot fully account for the structural differences in propagation.The findings highlight the critical role of structural characteristics in the spread of these harmful messages, suggesting that strategies targeting structural characteristics of re-sharing could be crucial in managing the dissemination of such content on private messaging platforms.</description>

      <title>Extending the BEND Framework to Webgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attempts to manipulate webgraphs can have many downstream impacts, but analysts lack shared quantitative metrics to characterize actions taken to manipulate information environments at this level. We demonstrate how the BEND framework can be used to characterize attempts to manipulate webgraph information environments, and propose quantitative metrics for BEND community maneuvers. We demonstrate the face validity of our proposed Webgraph BEND metrics by using them to characterize two small web-graphs containing SEO-boosted Kremlin-aligned websites. We demonstrate how our proposed metrics improve BEND scores in webgraph settings and demonstrate the usefulness of our metrics in characterizing webgraph information environments. These metrics offer analysts a systematic and standardized way to characterize attempts to manipulate webgraphs using common Search Engine Optimization tactics.</description>

      <title>Fast Unbiased Sampling of Networks with Given Expected Degrees and Strengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The configuration model is a cornerstone of statistical assessment of network structure. While the Chung-Lu model is among the most widely used configuration models, it systematically oversamples edges between large-degree nodes, leading to inaccurate statistical conclusions. Although the maximum entropy principle offers unbiased configuration models, its high computational cost has hindered widespread adoption, making the Chung-Lu model an inaccurate yet persistently practical choice. Here, we propose fast and efficient sampling algorithms for the max-entropy-based models by adapting the Miller-Hagberg algorithm. Evaluation on 103 empirical networks demonstrates 10-1000 times speedup, making theoretically rigorous configuration models practical and contributing to a more accurate understanding of network structure.</description>
