      <title>Extremal distance spectral radius of graphs with fixed size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $m$ be a positive integer. Brualdi and Hoffman proposed the problem to determine the (connected) graphs with maximum spectral radius in a given graph class and they posed a conjecture for the class of graphs with given size $m$. After partial results due to Friedland and Stanley, Rowlinson completely confirmed the conjecture. The distance spectral radius of a connected graph is the largest eigenvalue of its distance matrix. We investigate the problem to determine the connected graphs with minimum distance spectral radius in the class of graphs with size $m$. Given $m$, there is exactly one positive integer $n$ such that ${n-1\choose 2} &lt;m\leq {n\choose 2}$. We establish some structural properties of the extremal graphs for all $m$ and solve the problem for ${n-1\choose 2}+\max\{\frac{n-6}{2},1\}\le m\leq {n\choose 2}$. We give a conjecture for the remaining case. To prove the main results, we also determine the the complements of forests of fixed order with large and small distance spectral radius.</description>

      <title>On the $q$-factorization of power series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any power series with unit constant term can be factored into an infinite product of the form $\prod_{n\geq 1} (1-q^n)^{-a_n}$. We give direct formulas for the exponents $a_n$ in terms of the coefficients of the power series, and vice versa, as sums over partitions. As examples, we prove identities for certain partition enumeration functions. Finally, we note $q$-analogues of our enumeration formulas.</description>

      <title>Strongly Regular Graphs with Generalized Denniston and Dual Generalized Denniston Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct two families of strongly regular Cayley graphs, or equivalently, partial difference sets, based on elementary abelian groups. The parameters of these two families are generalizations of the Denniston and the dual Denniston parameters, in contrast to the well known Latin square type and negative Latin square type parameters. The two families unify and subsume a number of existing constructions which have been presented in various contexts such as strongly regular graphs, partial difference sets, projective sets, and projective two-weight codes, notably including Denniston's seminal construction concerning maximal arcs in classical projective planes with even order. Our construction generates further momentum in this area, which recently saw exciting progress on the construction of the analogue of the famous Denniston partial difference sets in odd characteristic.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the Critical Multiplicity of Ramsey Numbers with Many Colors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ramsey number $R(s,t)$ is the least integer $n$ such that any coloring of the edges of $K_n$ with two colors produces either a monochromatic $K_s$ in one color or a monochromatic $K_t$ in the other. If $s=t$, we say that the Ramsey number $R(s,s)$ is diagonal. The critical multiplicity of a diagonal Ramsey number $R(s,s)$, denoted $m_2(s)$, is the smallest number of copies of a monochromatic $K_s$ that can be found in any coloring of the edges of $K_{R(s,s)}$. For instance, $m_2(2)=1$, $m_2(3)=2$, and $m_2(4)=9$. In this short note, we produce some upper bounds for the general non-diagonal case of $m(s_1,..., s_k)$. These bounds are an improvement on those known for the two-color diagonal case of $m_2(s)$ for $s &lt; 9$ and are new for the off-diagonal case.</description>

      <title>Simple games with minimum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every simple game is a monotone Boolean function. For the other direction we just have to exclude the two constant functions. The enumeration of monotone Boolean functions with distinguishable variables is also known as the Dedekind's problem. The corresponding number for nine variables was determined just recently by two disjoint research groups. Considering permutations of the variables as symmetries we can also speak about non-equivalent monotone Boolean functions (or simple games). Here we consider simple games with minimum, i.e., simple games with a unique minimal winning vector. A closed formula for the number of such games is found as well as its dimension in terms of the number of players and equivalence classes of players.</description>

      <title>Explosive appearance of cores and bootstrap percolation on lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the process where the $n$ vertices of a square $2$-dimensional torus appear consecutively in a random order. We show that typically the size of the $3$-core of the corresponding induced unit-distance graph transitions from $0$ to $n-o(n)$ within a single step. Equivalently, by infecting the vertices of the torus in a random order under $2$-bootstrap percolation, the size of the infected set transitions instantaneously from $o(n)$ to $n$. This hitting time result answers a question of Benjamini.
  We also study the much more challenging and general setting of bootstrap percolation on two-dimensional lattices for a variety of finite-range infection rules. In this case, powerful but fragile bootstrap percolation tools such as the rectangles process and the Aizenman--Lebowitz lemma become unavailable. We develop a new method complementing and replacing these standard techniques, thus allowing us to prove the above hitting time result for a wide family of threshold bootstrap percolation rules on the $2$-dimensional square lattice, including neighbourhoods given by large $\ell^p$ balls for $p\in[1,\infty]$.</description>

      <title>Matchings in Hypercubes Extend to Long Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $n$-dimensional hypercube graph $Q_n$ has as vertices all subsets of $\{1, \ldots, n\}$, and an edge between any two sets that differ in a single element. The Ruskey-Savage conjecture states that every matching of the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ can be extended into a Hamilton cycle. We prove that matchings of $Q_n$ containing edges spanning at most $d = 5$ directions can be extended into a Hamilton cycle. We also characterize when these matchings of most $d = 5$ directions can be extended into a Hamilton path between two prescribed vertices. Our proofs work for arbitrary $d$ and $n$ where $d \le n$ assuming some extension properties hold in $Q_d$ which we verified by a computer for $d=5$.</description>

      <title>When a forest, narrowed to an atom of subset algebra, turns out to be a tree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is proved that the restriction of a $k$ and $(k-1)$-component directed spanning forest of minimal weight to an atom of the subset algebra generated by the sets of vertices of trees of $k$-component minimal spanning forests is a tree. For spanning minimal forests consisting of fewer components, this property, generally speaking, does not exist.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing hypergraph matching polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By utilizing the recently developed hypergraph analogue of Godsil's identity by the second author, we prove that for all $n \geq k \geq 2$, one can reconstruct the matching polynomial of an $n$-vertex $k$-uniform hypergraph from the multiset of all induced sub-hypergraphs on $\lfloor \frac{k-1}{k}n \rfloor + 1$ vertices. This generalizes the well-known result of Godsil on graphs in 1981 to every uniform hypergraph. As a corollary, we show that for every graph $F$, one can reconstruct the number of $F$-factors in a graph under analogous conditions. We also constructed examples that imply the number $\lfloor \frac{k-1}{k}n \rfloor + 1$ is the best possible for all $n\geq k \geq 2$ with $n$ divisible by $k$.</description>

      <title>On the convex hull of integer points above the hyperbola</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the polyhedron defined as the convex hull of the lattice points above the hyperbola $\left\{xy = n\right\}$ has between $\Omega(n^{1/3})$ and $O(n^{1/3} \log n)$ vertices. The same bounds apply to any hyperbola with rational slopes except that instead of $n$ we have $n/\Delta$ in the lower bound and by $\max\left\{\Delta, n/\Delta\right\}$ in the upper bound, where $\Delta \in \mathbb{Z}_{&gt;0}$ is the discriminant.
  We also give an algorithm that enumerates the vertices of these convex hulls in logarithmic time per vertex. One motivation for such an algorithm is the deterministic factorization of integers.</description>

      <title>On a hypergraph Mantel theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $r$-graph is a triangle if there exists a positive integer $i \le \lceil r/2 \rceil$ such that it is isomorphic to the following $r$-graph with three edges: \begin{align*}
  \left\{\{1, \ldots, r\},~\{1, \ldots, i, r+1, \ldots, 2r-i\},~\{i+1, \ldots, r, r+1, 2r-i+1, \ldots,2r-1\}\right\}. \end{align*} We prove an Andr{\'a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s-type stability theorem for triangle-free $r$-graphs. In particular, it implies that for large $n$, the unique extremal triangle-free construction on $n$ vertices is the balanced complete $r$-partite $r$-graph. The latter result answers a question by Mubayi and Pikhurko~{\cite[Problem~20]{MPS11}} on weakly triangle-free $r$-graphs for large $n$ in a stronger form. The proof combines the recently introduced entropic technique of Chao--Yu~\cite{CY24} with the framework developed in~\cite{LMR23unif,HLZ24}.</description>

      <title>A MacMahon Analysis View of Cylindric Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cylindric partitions with two-element profiles using MacMahon's partition analysis. We find explicit formulas for the generating functions of the number of cylindric partitions by first finding the recurrences using partition analysis and then solving them. We also note some q-series identities related to these objects that show the manifestly positive nature of some alternating series. We generalize the proven identities and conjecture new polynomial refinements of Andrews-Gordon and Bressoud identities, which are companions to Foda-Quano's refinements. Finally, using a variant of the Bailey lemma, we present many new infinite hierarchies of polynomial identities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we begin the study of well-failed graphs, that is, graphs in which every maximal failed zero forcing set is a maximum failed zero forcing set, or equivalently, in which every minimal fort is a minimum fort. We characterize trees that are well-failed. Along the way, we prove that the set of vertices in a graph that are not in any minimal fort is identical to the set of vertices that are in no minimal zero forcing set, which allows us to characterize vertices in a tree that are in no minimal fort.</description>

      <title>The General Position Problem: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by a chessboard puzzle of Dudeney, the general position problem in graph theory asks for the largest sets $S$ of vertices in a graph such that no three elements of $S$ lie on a common shortest path. The number of vertices in such a largest set is the general position number of the graph. This paper provides a survey of this rapidly growing problem, which now has an extensive literature. We cover exact results for various graph classes and the behaviour of the general position number under various graph products and operations. We also discuss interesting variations of the general position problem, for example variants corresponding to different graph convexities, as well as dynamic, fractional, colouring and game versions of the problem.</description>

      <title>Emergence of network communities driven by local rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural systems are modeled by networks where nodes represent the system units and links their interactions. The networks nodes are often segregated into communities with different connectivity patterns. Node heterogeneity such as political affiliation in social networks or biological function in gene networks are highlighted as key factors driving the segregation of nodes into communities. Here I demonstrate that node heterogeneity is not a necessary requirement. Network communities are bound to emerge as a consequence of the local nature of the network evolution. To this end I introduce the Ramsey community number, $r_C$, the minimum graph size that warranties the emergence of network communities with almost certainty. I show that the Watts-Strogatz, local search and duplication-split network models all have finite $r_C$ values. In contrast, random graphs do not have emergent communities property and the Barab\'asi-Albert model does not reach certainty for the emergence of communities. I conclude that network communities are an emergent property rooted on the local nature of the network evolution.</description>

      <title>Periodicity and absolute zeta functions of multi-state Grover walks on cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum walks, the quantum counterpart of classical random walks, are extensively studied for their applications in mathematics, quantum physics, and quantum information science. This study explores the periods and absolute zeta functions of Grover walks on cycle graphs. Specifically, we investigate Grover walks with an odd number of states and determine their periods for cycles with any number of vertices greater than or equal to two. In addition, we compute the absolute zeta functions of M-type Grover walks with finite periods. These results advance the understanding of the properties of Grover walks and their connection to absolute zeta functions.</description>

      <title>The finite basis problem for additively idempotent semirings that relate to S_7</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $3$-element additively idempotent semiring $S_7$ is a nonnitely based algebra of the smallest possible order. In this paper we study the nite basis problem for some additively idempotent semirings that relate to $S_7$. We present a su cient condition under which an additively idempotent semiring variety is nonnitely based and as applications, show that some additively idempotent semiring varieties that contain $S_7$ are also nonnitely based. We then consider the subdirectly irreducible members of the variety $\mathsf{V}(S_7)$ generated by $S_7$. We show that $\mathsf{V}(S_7)$ contains exactly $6$ finitely based subvarieties, all of which sit at the base of the subvariety lattice, then invoke results from the homomorphism theory of Kneser graphs to verify that $\mathsf{V}(S_7)$ contains a continuum of subvarieties.</description>

      <title>Toric ideal of matching polytopes and edge colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we investigate the maximal degree of minimal generators of the toric ideal of the matching polytope of a graph. It is known that the toric ideal associated to a bipartite graph is generated by binomials of degree at most $3$. We show that this fact is equivalent to a result in the theory of edge colorings of bipartite multigraphs. Moreover, a characterization of bipartite graphs whose toric ideals are generated by quadratic binomials is given. Finally, we discuss the maximal degree of minimal generators of the toric ideal associated to a general graph and give a conjecture.</description>

      <title>Fast exact recovery of noisy matrix from few entries: the infinity norm approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The matrix recovery (completion) problem, a central problem in data science and theoretical computer science, is to recover a matrix $A$ from a relatively small sample of entries.
  While such a task is impossible in general, it has been shown that one can recover $A$ exactly in polynomial time, with high probability, from a random subset of entries, under three (basic and necessary) assumptions: (1) the rank of $A$ is very small compared to its dimensions (low rank), (2) $A$ has delocalized singular vectors (incoherence), and (3) the sample size is sufficiently large.
  There are many different algorithms for the task, including convex optimization by Candes, Tao and Recht (2009), alternating projection by Hardt and Wooters (2014) and low rank approximation with gradient descent by Keshavan, Montanari and Oh (2009, 2010).
  In applications, it is more realistic to assume that data is noisy. In this case, these approaches provide an approximate recovery with small root mean square error. However, it is hard to transform such approximate recovery to an exact one.
  Recently, results by Abbe et al. (2017) and Bhardwaj et al. (2023) concerning approximation in the infinity norm showed that we can achieve exact recovery even in the noisy case, given that the ground matrix has bounded precision. Beyond the three basic assumptions above, they required either the condition number of $A$ is small (Abbe et al.) or the gap between consecutive singular values is large (Bhardwaj et al.).
  In this paper, we remove these extra spectral assumptions. As a result, we obtain a simple algorithm for exact recovery in the noisy case, under only three basic assumptions. This is the first such algorithm. To analyse the algorithm, we introduce a contour integration argument which is totally different from all previous methods and may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: In graph theory, a graceful labeling of a graph with m edges is a labeling of its vertices with a subset of the integers ranging from 0 to m inclusive, such that no two vertices share a label, and each edge is uniquely identified by the absolute difference of labels assigned to its endpoints. The Kotzig-Ringel-Rosa conjecture asserts that every tree admits a graceful labeling. We provide a proof of this long standing conjecture via a functional reformulation of the conjecture and a composition lemma.</description>

      <title>Isomorphisms between dense random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two variants of the induced subgraph isomorphism problem for two independent binomial random graphs with constant edge-probabilities p_1,p_2. In particular, (i) we prove a sharp threshold result for the appearance of G_{n,p_1} as an induced subgraph of G_{N,p_2}, (ii) we show two-point concentration of the size of the maximum common induced subgraph of G_{N, p_1} and G_{N,p_2}, and (iii) we show that the number of induced copies of G_{n,p_1} in G_{N,p_2} has an unusual limiting distribution.
  These results confirm simulation-based predictions of McCreesh, Prosser, Solnon and Trimble, and resolve several open problems of Chatterjee and Diaconis. The proofs are based on careful refinements of the first and second moment method, using extra twists to (a) take some non-standard behaviors into account, and (b) work around the large variance issues that prevent standard applications of these methods.</description>

      <title>Towards combinatorial characterization of the smoothness of Hessenberg Schubert varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A \emph{Hessenberg Schubert variety} is an irreducible component of the intersection of a Schubert variety and a Hessenberg variety, defined as the closure of a Schubert cell inside the Hessenberg variety. We consider the smoothness of Hessenberg Schubert varieties of regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties of type $A$ in this paper.
  We consider the smoothness of the intersection of a Schubert variety and a Hessenberg variety to ensure the smoothness of the corresponding Hessenberg Schubert variety. Specifically, we analyze the structure of the GKM graphs of the intersection of a Schubert variety indexed by some special permutations and a Hessenberg variety. The regularity of the GKM graph is completely characterized in terms of pattern avoidance, which is a necessary (and also sufficient conjecturally) condition for the intersection to be smooth. We then extend the pattern avoidance result to all permutations, which is believed to be a sufficient condition for the corresponding Hessenberg Schubert variety to be smooth.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional expanders from Kac--Moody--Steinberg groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional expanders are a generalization of the notion of expander graphs to simplicial complexes and give rise to a variety of applications in computer science and other fields. We provide a general tool to construct families of bounded degree high-dimensional spectral expanders. Inspired by the work of Kaufman and Oppenheim, we use coset complexes over quotients of Kac-Moody-Steinberg groups of rank $d+1$, $d$-spherical and purely $d$-spherical. We prove that infinite families of such quotients exist provided that the underlying field is of size at least 4 and the Kac-Moody-Steinberg group is 2-spherical, giving rise to new families of bounded degree high-dimensional expanders. In the case the generalized Cartan matrix we consider is affine, we recover the construction of O'Donnell and Pratt from 2022, (and thus also the one of Kaufman and Oppenheim) by considering Chevalley groups as quotients of affine Kac-Moody-Steinberg groups. Moreover, our construction applies to the case where the root system is of type $\tilde{G}_2$, a case that was not covered in earlier works.</description>

      <title>Domino tilings of three-dimensional cylinders: regularity of hamiltonian disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider three-dimensional domino tilings of cylinders $\mathcal{D} \times [0,N] \subset \mathbb{R}^3$, where $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is a balanced quadriculated disk and $N \in \mathbb{N}$. A flip is a local move in the space of tilings: two adjacent and parallel dominoes are removed and then placed in a different position. The twist is a flip invariant that associates an integer number to a domino tiling. A disk $\mathcal{D}$ is called regular if any two tilings of $\mathcal{D} \times [0,N]$ sharing the same twist can be connected through a sequence of flips once extra vertical space is added to the cylinder. We prove that hamiltonian disks with narrow and small bottlenecks are regular. In particular, we show that the absence of a bottleneck in a hamiltonian disk implies regularity.</description>

Abstract: We prove specific biases in the number of occurrences of parts belonging to two different residue classes $a$ and $b$, modulo a fixed non-negative integer $m$, for the sets of unrestricted partitions, partitions into distinct parts, and overpartitions. These biases follow from inequalities for residue-weighted partition functions for the respective sets of partitions. We also establish asymptotic formulas for the numbers of partitions of size $n$ that belong to these sets of partitions and have a symmetric residue class bias (i.e., for $1\le a&lt;m/2$ and $b=m-a$), as $n$ tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>On Geometry and Combinatorics of Finite Classical Polar Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polar spaces over finite fields are fundamental in combinatorial geometry. The concept of polar space was firstly introduced by F. Veldkamp who gave a system of 10 axioms in the spirit of Universal Algebra. Later the axioms were simplified by J. Tits, who introduced the concept of subspaces. Later on, from the point of view of incidence geometry, axioms of polar spaces were also given by F. Buekenhout and E. Shult in 1974. The reader can find the three systems of axioms of polar spaces in Appendix A. Examples of polar spaces are the so called Finite classical polar spaces, i.e. incidence structures arising from quadrics, symplectic spaces and Hermitian varieties, which are in correspondance with reflexive sesquilinear forms. It is still an open problem to show whether or not classical polar spaces are the only example of finite polar spaces.
  Nowadays, some research problems related to finite classical polar space are: existence of spreads and ovoids; existence of regular systems and $m$-ovoids; upper or lower bounds on partial spreads and partial ovoids. Moreover, polar spaces are in relation with combinatorial objects as regular graphs, block designs and association schemes.
  In this Ph.D. Thesis we investigate the geometry of finite classical polar spaces, giving contributions to the above problems. The thesis is organized as follows. Part I is more focused on the geometric aspects of polar spaces, while in Part II some combinatorial objects are introduced such as regular graphs, association schemes and combinatorial designs. Finally Appendix B, C and D are dedicated to give more details on, respectively, maximal curves, linear codes and combinatorial designs, giving useful results and definitions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we define a degree for ends of infinite digraphs. The well-definedness of our definition in particular resolves a problem by Zuther. Furthermore, we extend our notion of end degree to also respect, among others, the vertices dominating the end, which we denote as combined end degree. Our main result is a characterisation of the combined end degree in terms of certain sequences of vertices, which we call end-exhausting sequences. This establishes a similar, although more complex relationship as known for the combined end degree and end-defining sequences in undirected graphs.</description>

      <title>The phase transition in bounded-size Achlioptas processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:1704.08714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perhaps the best understood phase transition is that in the component structure of the uniform random graph process introduced by Erd\H{o}s and R\'enyi around 1960. Since the model is so fundamental, it is very interesting to know which features of this phase transition are specific to the model, and which are `universal', at least within some larger class of processes (a `universality class'). Achlioptas process, a class of variants of the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi process that are easy to define but difficult to analyze, have been extensively studied from this point of view. Here, settling a number of conjectures and open problems, we show that all `bounded-size' Achlioptas processes share (in a strong sense) all the key features of the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi phase transition. We do not expect this to hold for Achlioptas processes in general.</description>

We show that the mixing time of this random walk is $O(m^2n \log n+ n^2 m^{o(1)})$. This answers a question of Stong and of Arias-Castro, Diaconis, and Stanley.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new invariant for blocks of Ariki-Koike algebras, called block moving vector, which is a vector of non-negative integers summing up to the weight of the block. In this paper, we use moving vectors to classify representation-finite blocks of Ariki-Koike algebras. As applications, we obtain examples of blocks with the same weight associated with the same multicharge that are not derived equivalent and examples of derived equivalent blocks being in different orbits under the adjoint action of the affine Weyl group. We also determine the representation type for blocks of cyclotomic $q$-Schur algebras.</description>

      <title>Metallic mean Wang tiles I: self-similarity, aperiodicity and minimality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03652v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every positive integer $n$, we introduce a set $\mathcal{T}_n$ made of $(n+3)^2$ Wang tiles (unit squares with labeled edges). We represent a tiling by translates of these tiles as a configuration $\mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathcal{T}_n$. A configuration is valid if the common edge of adjacent tiles has the same label. For every $n\geq1$, we show that the Wang shift $\Omega_n$, defined as the set of valid configurations over the tiles $\mathcal{T}_n$, is self-similar, aperiodic and minimal for the shift action. We say that $\{\Omega_n\}_{n\geq1}$ is a family of metallic mean Wang shifts, since the inflation factor of the self-similarity of $\Omega_n$ is the positive root of the polynomial $x^2-nx-1$. This root is sometimes called the $n$-th metallic mean, and in particular, the golden mean when $n=1$, and the silver mean when $n=2$. When $n=1$, the set of Wang tiles $\mathcal{T}_1$ is equivalent to the Ammann aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles.</description>

A separating system of a set $X$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ such that for any pair of distinct elements in $X$, there exists a set in the separating system that contains exactly one of the two elements. A separating system of the vertex set of a graph $G$ is called a vertex-separating path (tree) system of $G$ if the elements of the separating system are paths (trees) in the graph $G$. In this paper, we focus on the size of the smallest vertex-separating path (tree) system for different types of graphs, including trees, grids, and maximal outerplanar graphs.</description>

      <title>Equivariant geometry of symmetric quiver orbit closures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We unify problems about the equivariant geometry of symmetric quiver representation varieties, in the finite type setting, with the corresponding problems for symmetric varieties $GL(n)/K$ where $K$ is an orthogonal or symplectic group. In particular, we translate results about singularities of orbit closures; combinatorics of orbit closure containment; and torus equivariant cohomology and K-theory between these classes of varieties. We obtain these results by constructing explicit embeddings with nice properties of homogeneous fiber bundles over type $A$ symmetric quiver representation varieties into symmetric varieties.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional permutons: theory and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Permutons, which are probability measures on the unit square $[0, 1]^2$ with uniform marginals, are the natural scaling limits for sequences of (random) permutations.
  We introduce a $d$-dimensional generalization of these measures for all $d \ge 2$, which we call $d$-dimensional permutons, and extend -- from the two-dimensional setting -- the theory to prove convergence of sequences of (random) $d$-dimensional permutations to (random) $d$-dimensional permutons.
  Building on this new theory, we determine the random high-dimensional permuton limits for two natural families of high-dimensional permutations. First, we determine the $3$-dimensional permuton limit for Schnyder wood permutations, which bijectively encode planar triangulations decorated by triples of spanning trees known as Schnyder woods. Second, we identify the $d$-dimensional permuton limit for $d$-separable permutations, a pattern-avoiding class of $d$-dimensional permutations generalizing ordinary separable permutations.
  Both high-dimensional permuton limits are random and connected to previously studied universal 2-dimensional permutons, such as the Brownian separable permutons and the skew Brownian permutons, and share interesting connections with objects arising from random geometry, including the continuum random tree, Schramm--Loewner evolutions, and Liouville quantum gravity surfaces.</description>

      <title>On the jump of the cover time in random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the cover time of the simple random walk on the giant component of supercritical $d$-dimensional random geometric graphs on $\mathrm{Poi}(n)$ vertices. We show that the cover time undergoes a jump at the connectivity threshold radius $r_c$: with $r_g$ denoting the threshold for having a giant component, we show that if the radius $r$ satisfies $(1+\varepsilon)r_g \le r \le (1-\varepsilon)r_c$ for $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ arbitrarily small, the cover time of the giant component is asymptotically almost surely $\Theta(n \log^2 n$). On the other hand, we show that for $r \ge (1+\varepsilon)r_c$, the cover time of the graph is asymptotically almost surely $\Theta(n \log n)$ (which was known for $d=2$ only for a radius larger by a constant factor). Our proofs also shed some light onto the behavior around $r_c$.</description>
