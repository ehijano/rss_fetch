      <title>TESS Investigation -- Demographics of Young Exoplanets (TI-DYE) III: an inner super-Earth in TOI-2076</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young (&lt;500 Myr) multi-planet transiting systems are valuable environments for understanding planet evolution by offering an opportunity to make direct comparisons between planets from the same formation conditions. TOI-2076 is known to harbor three, 2.5-4 $R_\oplus$ planets on 10-35 day orbits. All three are JWST cycle 3 targets (for transmission spectroscopy). Here, we present the detection of TOI-2076 e; a smaller (1.35 $R_\oplus$), inner (3.02 day) planet in the system. We update the age of the system by analyzing the rotation periods, Lithium equivalent widths, color-magnitude diagram, and variability of likely co-moving stars, finding that TOI-2076 and co-moving planetary system TOI-1807 are 210 $\pm$ 20 Myr. The discovery of TOI-2076 e is motivation to revisit known transiting systems in search of additional planets that are now detectable with new TESS data and updated search methods.</description>

      <title>Origin of moderately volatile elements in Earth inferred from mass-dependent Ge isotope variations among chondrites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk silicate Earth (BSE) is depleted in moderately volatile elements, indicating Earth formed from a mixture of volatile-rich and -poor materials. To better constrain the origin and nature of Earth's volatile-rich building blocks, we determined the mass-dependent isotope compositions of Ge in carbonaceous (CC) and enstatite chondrites. We find that, similar to other moderately volatile elements, the Ge isotope variations among the chondrites reflect mixing between volatile-rich, isotopically heavy matrix and volatile-poor, isotopically light chondrules. The Ge isotope composition of the BSE is within the chondritic range and can be accounted for as a ~2:1 mixture of CI and enstatite chondrite-derived Ge. This mixing ratio appears to be distinct from the ~1:2 ratio inferred for Zn, reflecting the different geochemical behavior of Ge (siderophile) and Zn (lithophile), and suggesting the late-stage addition of volatile-rich CC materials to Earth. On dynamical grounds it has been argued that Earth accreted CC material through a few Moon-sized embryos, in which case the Ge isotope results imply that these objects were volatile-rich, presumably because they were either undifferentiated or accreted volatile-rich objects themselves before being accreted by Earth.</description>

      <title>N-body simulations of the Self-Confinement of Viscous Self-Gravitating Narrow Eccentric Planetary Ringlets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narrow eccentric planetary ringlets have sharp edges, sizable eccentricity gradients, and a confinement mechanism that prevents radial spreading due to ring viscosity. Most proposed ringlet confinement mechanisms presume that there are one or more shepherd satellites whose gravitational perturbations keeps the ringlet confined radially, but the absence of such shepherds in Cassini observations of Saturn's rings casts doubt upon those ringlet confinement mechanisms. The following uses a suite of N-body simulations to explore an alternate scenario, whereby ringlet self-gravity drives a narrow eccentric ringlet into a self-confining state. These simulations show that, under a wide variety of initial conditions, an eccentric ringlet's secular perturbations of itself causes the eccentricity of its outer edge to grow at the expense of its inner edge. This causes the ringlet's nonlinearity parameter $q$ to grow over time until it exceeds the $q\simeq\sqrt{3}/2$ threshold where the ringlet's orbit-averaged angular momentum flux due to viscosity + self-gravity is zero. The absence of any net radial angular momentum transfer through the ringlet means that the ringlet has settled into a self-confining state, i.e. it does not spread radially due to its viscosity, and simulations also show that such ringlets have sharp edges. Nonetheless, viscosity still circularizes the ringlet in time $\tau_e\sim10^6$ orbits $\sim1000$ years, which will cause the ringlet's nonlinearity parameter to shrink below the $q\simeq\sqrt{3}/2$ threshold and allows radial spreading to resume. Either sharp-edged narrow eccentric ringlets are transient phenomena, or exterior perturbations are also sustaining the ringlet's eccentricity. We then speculate about how such ringlets might come to be.</description>

      <title>Photometric analysis of asteroids in the Phocaea region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Phocaea asteroid family, one of the large ancient families located in the inner main belt, may be the sources of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) due to the nearby 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter, the v6 secular resonance, and the Yarkovsky and YORP effects. Thus, understanding the influence of the Yarkovsky and YORP effects on the Phocaea family is one of the keys to figuring out the source of NEAs. However, the physical properties of most of the Phocaea family members are unknown at present. We perform a photometric analysis for 44 asteroids in the Phocaea region using photometric data obtained by ground-based and space-based telescopes (i.e., TESS and Gaia). Based on the derived physical properties, we find significant footprints of the Yarkovsky and YORP effects on the Phocaea family members. Selecting five asteroids nearby the inside boundary of the V-shape in the absolute-magnitude semimajor-axis (H, a) space, we estimate their densities considering their migration in semimajor-axis arises from the Yarkovsky effect. The bulk density of (852) Wladilena ({3.54 g/cm3) suggests a link to the H chondrite meteorites. Incorporating the grain density of the H chondrites, we estimate the macroporosities of the asteroids (290) Bruna, (1164) Kobolda, and (587) Hypsipyle, respectively 41%, 47%, and 65%, implying rubble pile structures. Considering the H chondrites link to asteroid (25) Phocaea, we suggest the parent body of the Phocaea family has been composed of H chondrite like material and the Phocaea family may be one of the sources of H chondrite meteorites.</description>

      <title>The HOSTS Survey: Suspected variable dust emission and constraints on companions around $\theta$ Boo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the HOSTS survey by the LBTI, an excess emission from the main sequence star $\theta$ Boo (F7V spectral type, 14.5pc distance) was observed. This excess indicates the presence of exozodiacal dust near the habitable zone (HZ) of the star. Previous observations from Spitzer and Herschel showed no sign of outer cold dust within their respective detection limits. Additional nulling and high-contrast AO observations were taken to spatially constrain the dust distribution, search for variability, and directly image potential companions in the system. This study presents the results of these observations and provides an interpretation of the inner system's architecture. The star was observed using the LBTI's N'-band nulling mode during three epochs in 2017, 2018, and 2023. The dust distribution is modeled and constrained for each epoch using the standard LBTI nulling pipeline, assuming a vertically thin disk with a face-on inclination. In addition, high-contrast AO observations are performed in the L'-band and H-band to constrain the presence of substellar companions around the star. Several solutions are found for the dust distribution, and for each epoch. However, the LBTI nulling observations are not able to discriminate between them. Using the upper limits from previous observations, we constrain the representative size of the dust grains around 3-5$\mu$m. A tentative increase in dust brightness is also measured at the Earth-equivalent insolation distance between 2017 and 2023. Several options are considered to explain the origin of the observed dust and its variability, but no clear sources could be identified from the current observations. Partly because our high-contrast AO observations could only constrain the presence of companions down to $11M_\text{Jup}$ at 1.3" separation.</description>

      <title>WISE 12 micron search for exozodi candidates within 10 parsecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of extra-terrestrial life is one of the ultimate goals for future exoplanet-seeking missions, with one major challenge being the presence of 'exozodiacal' dust near target stars or within their habitable zone. Therefore, it is critical to identify which stars possess exozodiacal dust and quantify their emission levels. In this study, we conducted a search for exozodi candidates within 10 parsecs using the Reyl'e sample. We performed proper motion calculations and cross-matched the sample with the WISE and 2MASS database, resulting in 339 preliminary target samples. We further analysed the infrared radiation characteristics of these targets, using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to predict photometric flux levels in the infrared and searching for 3sigma excesses in the WISE W3 band. During further selection processes, we applied various analysis methods to perform rigorous validation. We identified five exozodi candidates all of which are brown dwarfs (BDs). Given the clustering in candidate spectral types, we expect that these are not true exozodi candidates, rather the apparent excess arises from the inability of the BD photosphere models to accurately represent the SEDs of objects at the L-T transition. Indeed, for the object DENIS J025503.3-470049, excess is likely due to silicate clouds in the BD atmosphere. We suggest that a more stringent 5sigma excess is required to infer excess for this spectral type. The detection rate (0/339) in our sample shows that less than 1% M stars have exozodi above 21% excess levels. This is consistent with the rate of exozodi at similar level towards FGK stars in the Kennedy &amp; Wyatt sample (25/24,174). We provide upper limits on the 12 micron exozodi emission for the sample, which is typically at 21% relative to the star. For most stars, in particular the low mass M stars, this is the first such upper limit in the literature.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Luminosity Outbursts on the Abundance of Pebbles and Their Ice Mantles in Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centimeter-sized dust grains-pebbles-are necessary for planetesimal formation via the streaming instability, they play an important role in forming protoplanetary cores and giant planets, as well as enriching their atmospheres with chemical elements. This work investigates the effect of luminosity outbursts on the abundance of pebbles and their ice mantles in protoplanetary disks. We perform global simulations of formation and evolution of a self-gravitating viscous protoplanetary disk using the 2D hydrodynamic thin-disk FEOSAD code, which self-consistently reproduces luminosity outbursts. The model includes thermal balance, dust evolution and its interaction with gas, development of magnetorotational instability, adsorption and desorption of four volatile compounds (H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$ and CO), and the feedback of ice mantles on dust fragmentation properties. We show that luminosity outbursts have a stronger effect on the positions of CO$_2$, CH$_4$ and CO snowlines compared to the water snowline. This is because the H$_2$O snowline falls within the viscous heating dominated region during early disk evolution stages, while snowlines of other molecules are located in regions dominated by stellar irradiation heating and are thus more sensitive to temperature changes during outbursts. Nevertheless, luminosity outbursts reduce the total amount of pebbles in the disk by half due to destruction of dust aggregates into monomers following the loss of water ice that binds the aggregates together. Pebble recovery occurs over several thousand years after the outburst ends due to collisional coagulation, with recovery timescales significantly exceeding water freeze-out times. Ice mantle desorption occurs in a complex non-axisymmetric 2D region of the disk, associated with spiral substructure formation during early evolution of gravitationally unstable disks.</description>

      <title>The observable impact of runaway OB stars on protoplanetary discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UV radiation from OB stars can drive ``external'' photoevaporative winds from discs in clusters, that have been shown to be important for disc evolution and planet formation. However, cluster dynamics can complicate the interpretation of this process. A significant fraction of OB stars are runaways, propagating at high velocity which might dominate over the wider cluster dynamics in setting the time variation of the UV field in part of the cluster. We explore the impact of a runaway OB star on discs and the observational impact that may have. We find that discs exposed to even short periods of strong irradiation are significantly truncated, and only rebound slightly following the ``flyby'' of the UV source. This is predicted to leave an observable imprint on a disc population, with those downstream of the OB star vector being more massive and extended than those upstream. Because external photoevaporation acts quickly, this imprint is less susceptible to being washed out by cluster dynamics for faster runaway OB stars. The Gaia proper motion vector of the B star 42 Ori in NGC 1977 is transverse to the low mass stellar population and so may make a good region to search for this signature in resolved disc observations.</description>

      <title>Clouds can enhance direct imaging detection of O2 and O3 on terrestrial exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clouds are often considered a highly uncertain barrier for detecting biosignatures on exoplanets, especially given intuition gained from transit surveys. However, for direct imaging reflected light observations, clouds could increase the observational signal by increasing reflected light. Here we constrain the impact of clouds on the detection of O2 and O3 by a direct imaging telescope such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) using observations simulated with the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG). We first perform sensitivity tests to show that low clouds enhance O2 and O3 detectability while high clouds diminish it, and the effect is greater when cloud particles are smaller. We next apply clouds produced by the cloud microphysics model CARMA with varied planetary parameters and clouds drawn from observations of different types of clouds on Earth to PSG. We find that clouds are likely to increase the SNR of O2 and O3 for terrestrial exoplanets under a wide range of scenarios. This work provides important constraints on the impact of clouds on observations by telescopes including HWO.</description>

      <title>Conditions for accretion favoring an unmelted Callisto and a differentiated Ganymede</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of Callisto's moments of inertia, derived from Galileo's gravity data, suggests that its structure is not fully differentiated. This possibly undifferentiated state contrasts sharply with the globally molten state inferred in its counterpart, Ganymede, and poses unique challenges to theories of the formation and evolution of the Galilean moons. During their formation, both moons experienced multiple heating mechanisms, including tidal heating, radiogenic heating from short-lived radionuclides, accretional heating from impacts, and heat from the surrounding circumplanetary disk. Our study investigates the optimal conditions required to account for Callisto's partially differentiated state in contrast to Ganymede's complete differentiation. We investigate crucial accretion parameters, such as the timing of accretion onset, the duration of accretion, and the impactor size distribution. We find that the observed dichotomy between Ganymede and Callisto can be attributed to similar formation conditions, assuming an identical impactor size distribution and composition in the Jovian circumplanetary disk. The key differences in the formation of Ganymede and Callisto are the disk temperature at their respective formation locations and their final radii. Our results indicate that both moons accreted gradually over more than 2 Myr, concluding at least 5.5 Myr after the formation of calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions in the protosolar nebula. Our model demonstrates that Callisto can remain undifferentiated despite accreting a substantial influx of kilometer-sized impactors, potentially contributing up to 30% of the total mass inflow, while still allowing for the complete differentiation of Ganymede.</description>

      <title>Accessing the dipole-multipole transition in rapidly rotating spherical shell dynamos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarity reversals are a key feature of Earth's magnetic field, yet the processes governing them are still poorly understood. Dipole reversals have been found in many numerical dynamo simulations and often occur close to the transition between dipolar and multipolar regimes. Simulated conditions are far from those in Earth's liquid iron core because of the long runtimes needed to capture polarity transitions. We develop a unidimensional path theory in an attempt to simplify the search for the dipole-multipole transition at increasingly realistic physical conditions. We build 3 paths, all based on a constant magnetic Reynolds number $Rm$; one aiming for Magnetic, Coriolis, and Archimedean (MAC), and 2 aiming for inertia-MAC force balance. We add inertia due to its role in simulated reversals. Results show reasonable agreement with predictions within the accessible parameter space, but deviate from predicted behaviour for certain quantities, e.g. magnetic field strength and magnetic/kinetic energy ratio. Further, simulations move into the dipolar non-reversing regime as they are advanced along the path. By increasing the buoyancy driving (via higher Rayleigh number) above the values predicted by the path theory, we are able to access the dipole-multipole transition down to an Ekman number $E\sim 10^{-6}$, comparable to the most extreme conditions reported to date. Results demonstrate that our approach is an efficient method for seeking the dipole-multipole transition at low $E$. However, the conditions under which we access the dipole-multipole transition become increasingly hard to access numerically and also increasingly unrealistic because $Rm$ rises beyond plausible bounds inferred from geophysical observations. Future work combining path theory with variations in the core buoyancy distribution, appears a promising approach to accessing the transition at extreme physical conditions.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen-rich hydrate at high pressures up to 104 GPa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gas hydrates are considered fundamental building blocks of giant icy planets like Neptune and similar exoplanets. The existence of these materials in the interiors of giant icy planets, which are subject to high pressures and temperatures, depends on their stability relative to their constituent components. In this study, we reexamine the structural stability and hydrogen content of hydrogen hydrates, (H2O)(H2)n, up to 104 GPa, focusing on hydrogen-rich materials. Using synchrotron single-crystal X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and first-principles theoretical calculations, we find that the C2-filled ice phase undergoes a transformation to C3-filled ice phase over a broad pressure range of 47 - 104 GPa at room temperature. The C3 phase contains twice as much molecular H2 as the C2 phase. Heating the C2-filled ice above approximately 1500 K induces the transition to the C3 phase at pressures as low as 47 GPa. Upon decompression, this phase remains metastable down to 40 GPa. These findings establish new stability limits for hydrates, with implications for hydrogen storage and the interiors of planetary bodies.</description>

      <title>Understanding the IBEX ribbon using the kinetic model of pickup proton transport in a scatter-free limit</title>

Abstract: One of the most remarkable discoveries by the IBEX is the ribbon - a narrow band of enhanced ENA fluxes observed in the sky. The prevailing explanation attributes the IBEX ribbon to the secondary ENA mechanism. In this process, primary H ENAs, produced via charge exchange between solar wind (SW) protons and interstellar H atoms within the heliosphere, travel beyond the heliopause (HP) and undergo further charge exchange with protons of the LISM, generating pickup protons. Some of these pickup protons subsequently experience charge exchange with interstellar H atoms, forming secondary ENAs, some of which travel back toward the Sun and are detected by the IBEX. This paper presents a kinetic model developed to simulate secondary ENA fluxes. Ribbon simulations are performed using global distributions of plasma and H atoms in the heliosphere derived from a kinetic-MHD model of the SW/LISM interaction. The model accounts for all relevant primary ENA populations, including neutralized thermal SW protons, neutralized pickup protons, and ENAs originating in the inner heliosheath (IHS). The transport of pickup protons beyond the HP is described by the focused transport equation for a gyrotropic velocity distribution in the scatter-free limit, assuming no pitch-angle scattering or energy diffusion. Our simulations qualitatively reproduce IBEX-Hi ribbon observations and exhibit good quantitative agreement at low heliolatitudes. However, the model underestimates fluxes at high heliolatitudes, likely due to the omission of non-stationary SW behavior in the stationary framework used in this work. The study highlights the importance of ENAs from the IHS, a population considered for the ribbon production in the frame of the kinetic model of pickup proton transport in the heliosphere for the first time, for accurately reproducing ribbon fluxes observed by IBEX-Hi at the highest energy steps.</description>

      <title>The JDISC Survey: Linking the Physics and Chemistry of Inner and Outer Protoplanetary Disk Zones</title>

Abstract: Mid-infrared spectroscopy of protoplanetary disks provides a chemical inventory of gas within a few au, where planets are readily detected around older stars. With the JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS), we explore demographic trends among 31 disks observed with MIRI (MRS) and with previous ALMA millimeter continuum imaging at high angular resolution (5-10 au). With these S/N $\sim$200-450 spectra, we report emission from H$_2$O, OH, CO, C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, CO$_2$, [Ne II], [Ne III], and [Ar II]. Emission from H$_2$O, OH and CO is nearly ubiquitous for low-mass stars, and detection rates of all molecules are higher than for similar disks observed with Spitzer-IRS. Slab model fits to the molecular emission lines demonstrate that emission from C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, and possibly CO$_2$ is optically thin; thus since column densities and emitting radii are degenerate, observations are actually sensitive to the total molecular mass. C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN emission also typically originate in a hotter region ($920^{+70}_{-130}$, $820^{+70}_{-130}$ K, respectively) than CO$_2$ ($600^{+200}_{-160}$ K). The HCN to cold H$_2$O luminosity ratios are generally smaller in smooth disks, consistent with more efficient water delivery via icy pebbles in the absence of large dust substructures. The molecular emission line luminosities are also correlated with mass accretion rates and infrared spectral indices, similar to trends reported from Spitzer-IRS surveys. This work demonstrates the power of combining multi-wavelength observations to explore inner disk chemistry as a function of outer disk and stellar properties, which will continue to grow as the sample of observed Class II systems expands in the coming JWST observation cycles.</description>

      <title>Short- and long-term variations of the high mass accretion rate classical T Tauri star DR Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical T Tauri stars are newly formed, low mass stars which may display both periodic and random variations in their brightness. The interaction between the star and its circumstellar disk is time-dependent, leading to short or long-term changes in the environment, and hence variability of the system. By compiling a large dataset with high-cadence photometric (Kepler, TESS), and high-resolution spectroscopic observations (CFHT/ESPaDOnS) of the highly variable T Tauri star DR Tau, we aim to examine the short- and long-term variability of the system, and identify the underlying physical mechanisms. Our results reveal that DR Tau exhibits stochastic photometric variability not only on daily, but also on hourly timescale with peak-to-peak amplitude of 1.4 mag probably originating from accretion related variations. Our ground-based multifilter photometry shows that the amplitude of the variability decreases with increasing wavelength. This trend towards the infrared wavelengths suggests that part of the disk may be optically thick and invariable. The spectroscopic analysis showed that the H$\alpha$ line presents the most complex line profile with several components but the significance of the components changes over time. This suggests the presence and variation of both accretion flow and wind. Broad and narrow components can be clearly distinguished in the He I and the Ca II lines, suggesting contribution from both the accretion flow and the post-shock region. DR Tau exhibits high level of photometric and spectroscopic variability on both short- and long-timescales, which is caused by the combination of accretion, wind, stellar activity, and obscuration by circumstellar matter; and the significance of the physical mechanisms causing the observed variability changes over time.</description>

      <title>Systematic Search for FFPs in KMTNet Full-Frame Images. I. Photometry Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To exhume the buried signatures of free-floating planets (FFPs) with small angular Einstein radius $\theta_{\rm E}$, we build a new full-frame difference image pipeline for the Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) survey based on the newly optimized pySIS package. We introduce the detailed processes of the new pipeline, including frame registration, difference image analysis, and light curve extraction. To test this pipeline, we extract 1-year light curves for 483,068 stars with $I \lesssim 17$ and conduct a model-independent search for microlensing events. The search finds 36 microlensing events, including five new events and six events discovered by other collaborations but missed by previous KMTNet searches. We find that the light curves from the new pipeline are precise enough to be sensitive to FFPs with $\theta_{\rm E} \sim 1~\mu$as. Using the new pipeline, a complete FFP search on the eight-year KMTNet images can be finished within six months and then yield the FFP mass function. The new pipeline can be used for a new KMTNet AlertFinder system, with significantly reduced false positives.</description>

      <title>The Sonora Substellar Atmosphere Models. V: A Correction to the Disequilibrium Abundance of CO$_2$ for Sonora Elf Owl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To aid the interpretation of observations of substellar atmospheres, Mukherjee et al. (2024) created the Sonora Elf Owl grid of model atmospheres, simulations that accounted for disequilibrium quench chemistry. However, Sonora Elf Owl did not accurately estimate CO$_2$ quenching because the models quenched the gas with respect to the full atmosphere equilibrium, but CO$_2$ should have instead been quenched with respect to the disequilibrium (i.e., quenched) abundance of CO. As a result, Sonora Elf Owl under-predicted the CO$_2$ abundance by several order of magnitude in some instances, an amount that JWST is sensitive to. Here, we release version two of the Sonora Elf Owl grid which has corrected CO$_2$ concentrations. Additionally, in version two we remove PH$_3$ as a spectral contributor since our spectra consistently contained too much PH$_3$ absorption. The new spectra can be found as an update to the original Zenodo postings.</description>

      <title>KMT-2022-BLG-1818Lb,c: A Cold Super-Jupiter with a Saturn Sibling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the discovery and analysis of the sixth microlensing two-planet system, KMT-2022-BLG-1818Lb,c, detected by a follow-up program targeting high-magnification events. Both planets are subject to the well-known ''Close/Wide'' degeneracy, although for the first planet, which has a super-Jovian mass ratio of $q_2 \simeq 5\times 10^{-3}$ in both solutions, the Close topology, with a normalized separation of $s\simeq 0.70$, is clearly preferred by $\Delta\chi^2=26$. However, contrary to all previous two-planet microlensing systems, the mass ratio for the second planet, $q_3$, is substantially (factor of $\sim 10$) different for the Close and Wide topologies of the first planet. While this degeneracy is resolved in the present case due to high-cadence follow-up observations, the appearance of this new degeneracy indicates the need for caution in the analysis of future two-planet systems. A Bayesian analysis suggests that the host is likely a K-dwarf star in the Galactic disk. The first planet is probably a super-Jupiter on a Jupiter-like orbit, while the second planet is a Saturn-class planet on either a Mercury-like or Saturn-like orbit.</description>

      <title>Shadow-Based Framework for Estimating Transition Disk Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some transition disks host misaligned inner disks with radii of several au. Understanding the geometric and physical properties of these misaligned disks is essential for advancing terrestrial planet formation models. This study introduces a novel method to infer the three-dimensional structures of both inner and outer disks by analyzing non-axisymmetric shadows and the horizon in optical and infrared scattered light images of the outer disk. This method was applied to the HD 100453 system, in which infrared scattered light images from the Very Large Telescope revealed disk shadows. These results indicate that the inner disk is misaligned by $\sim$70$^{\circ}$ relative to the outer disk, which is consistent with the results of previous studies. The aspect ratio of the inner disk surface was estimated to be 0.17, which may reflect the surface height of the optically thick dusty component due to vertical lofting by MHD winds or turbulence. In addition, the surface height distribution of the outer disk was characterized, providing novel insights into its vertical structure.</description>

      <title>Run-away transition to turbulent strong-field dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planets and stars are able to generate coherent large-scale magnetic fields by helical convective motions in their interiors. This process, known as hydromagnetic dynamo, involves nonlinear interaction between the flow and magnetic field. Nonlinearity facilitates existence of bi-stable dynamo branches: a weak field branch where the magnetic field is not strong enough to enter into the leading order force balance in the momentum equation at large flow scales, and a strong field branch where the field enters into this balance. The transition between the two with enhancement of convection can be either subcritical or supercritical, depending on the strength of magnetic induction. In both cases, it is accompanied by topological changes in velocity field across the system; however, it is yet unclear how these changes are produced. In this work, we analyse transitions between the weak and strong dynamo regimes using a data-driven approach, separating different physical effects induced by dynamically active flow scales. Using Dynamic Mode Decomposition, we decompose the dynamo data from direct numerical simulations into different components (modes), identify the ones relevant for transition, and estimate relative magnitudes of their contributions Lorentz force and induction term. Our results suggest that subcritical transition to a strong dynamo is facilitated by a subharmonic instability, allowing for a more efficient mode of convection, and provide a modal basis for reduced-order models of this transition.</description>
