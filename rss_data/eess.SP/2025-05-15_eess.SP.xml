      <title>Efficient Near-Field Beam Focusing Merging Orthogonal Matching Pursuit and CVX for Large Intelligent Surface Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an efficient near-field beamforming method is proposed to support the large intelligent surfaces (LIS) that are expected to be widely deployed in 6G networks. This approach avoids directly applying convex (CVX) optimization for sparse selection in large-size array matrices, as such methods often lead to excessive computational time due to blind searching to satisfy a series of objective functions. First, based on the objective function, we prioritize a key component and employ the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) method to pre-select potential sparse target positions. To ensure focal symmetry, a coordinate mirror symmetry approach is adopted, meaning that selection is performed only in the first quadrant, while the remaining quadrants are determined through mirror symmetry relative to the first quadrant. This significantly reduces computational complexity at an early stage. Next, CVX is applied based on the pre-selected sparse array. Once a predefined threshold is met, a solution is obtained that satisfies the constraints of the beamfocusing. The results demonstrate that, compared with conventional methods, this approach improves efficiency by 15.12 times with 121 elements and 96.73 times with 441 elements. The proposed method demonstrates not only satisfactory performance but also considerable potential as a beam focusing technique for large-scale near-field array systems.</description>

      <title>FAS-LLM: Large Language Model-Based Channel Prediction for OTFS-Enabled Satellite-FAS Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes FAS-LLM, a novel large language model (LLM)-based architecture for predicting future channel states in Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS)-enabled satellite downlinks equipped with fluid antenna systems (FAS). The proposed method introduces a two-stage channel compression strategy combining reference-port selection and separable principal component analysis (PCA) to extract compact, delay-Doppler-aware representations from high-dimensional OTFS channels. These representations are then embedded into a LoRA-adapted LLM, enabling efficient time-series forecasting of channel coefficients. Performance evaluations demonstrate that FAS-LLM outperforms classical baselines including GRU, LSTM, and Transformer models, achieving up to 10 dB normalized mean squared error (NMSE) improvement and threefold root mean squared error (RMSE) reduction across prediction horizons. Furthermore, the predicted channels preserve key physical-layer characteristics, enabling near-optimal performance in ergodic capacity, spectral efficiency, and outage probability across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). These results highlight the potential of LLM-based forecasting for delay-sensitive and energy-efficient link adaptation in future satellite IoT networks.</description>

      <title>THz-Band Near-Field RIS Channel Modeling for Linear Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided terahertz (THz)-band communications are promising enablers for future wireless networks. However, array densification at high frequencies introduces significant challenges in accurate channel modeling and estimation, particularly with THz-specific fading, mutual coupling (MC), spatial correlation, and near-field effects. In this work, we model THz outdoor small-scale fading channels using the mixture gamma (MG) distribution, considering absorption losses, spherical wave propagation, MC, and spatial correlation across large base stations and RISs. We derive the distribution of the cascaded RIS-aided channel and investigate linear channel estimation techniques, analyzing the impact of various channel parameters. Numerical results based on precise THz parameters reveal that accounting for spatial correlation, MC, and near-field modeling substantially enhances estimation accuracy, especially in ultra-massive arrays and short-range scenarios. These results underscore the importance of incorporating these effects for precise, physically consistent channel modeling.</description>

      <title>Implicit Neural Representation of Waveform Measurements in Power Systems Waveform Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is currently a paradigm shift in several power system monitoring applications, such as incipient fault detection and monitoring inverter-based resources, to transition from traditional phasor analytics to more informative waveform analytics. This paper contributes to this transition by developing a novel approach to modeling voltage and current waveform measurements using implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs are continuous function approximators that are recently used in vision and signal processing. The proposed INR models are specifically designed to meet the requirements of waveform analytics in power systems, such as by using sinusoidal activation functions that capture the periodic nature of voltage and current waveforms. We also propose extended models that can efficiently represent correlated waveforms, such as three-phase waveforms and synchro-waveforms. Real-world case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed INR models in terms of accuracy (&lt;1-2% MSE) and model size (4-6x compression). We also investigate the application of INR models in oscillation monitoring, for single mode oscillations and dual mode modulated oscillations.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Beam-Stabilized, Additive-Printed Flexible Antenna Arrays with On-Chip Rapid Insight Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal phased arrays promise shape-changing properties, multiple degrees of freedom to the scan angle, and novel applications in wearables, aerospace, defense, vehicles, and ships. However, they have suffered from two critical limitations. (1) Although most applications require on-the-move communication and sensing, prior conformal arrays have suffered from dynamic deformation-induced beam pointing errors. We introduce a Dynamic Beam-Stabilized (DBS) processor capable of beam adaptation through on-chip real-time control of fundamental gain, phase, and delay for each element. (2) Prior conformal arrays have leveraged additive printing to enhance flexibility, but conventional printable inks based on silver are expensive, and those based on copper suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance and degrades beamforming performance. We instead leverage a low-cost Copper Molecular Decomposition (CuMOD) ink with &lt; 0.1% variation per degree C with temperature and strain and correct any residual deformity in real-time using the DBS processor. Demonstrating unified material and physical deformation correction, our CMOS DBS processor is low power, low-area, and easily scalable due to a tile architecture, thereby ideal for on-device implementations.</description>

      <title>Enriched K-Tier Heterogeneous Satellite Networks Model with User Association Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapid evolution of the non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), satellite communication has emerged as a focal area of research due to its critical role in enabling seamless global connectivity. In this paper, we investigate two representative user association policies (UAPs) for multi-tier heterogeneous satellite networks (HetSatNets), namely the nearest satellite UAP and the maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (max-SINR) satellite UAP, where each tier is characterized by a distinct constellation configuration and transmission pattern. Employing stochastic geometric, we analyze various intermediate system aspects, including the probability of a typical user accessing each satellite tier, the aggregated interference power, and their corresponding Laplace transforms (LTs) under both UAPs. Subsequently, we derive explicit expressions for coverage probability (CP), non-handover probability (NHP), and time delay outage probability (DOP) of the typical user. Furthermore, we propose a novel weighted metric (WM) that integrates CP, NHP, and DOP to explore their trade-offs in the system design. The robustness of the theoretical framework is verified is verified through Monte Carlo simulations calibrated with the actual Starlink constellation, affirming the precision of our analytical approach. The empirical findings underscore an optimal UAP in various HetSatNet scenarios regarding CP, NHP, and DOP..</description>

      <title>Constrained Multimodal Sensing-Aided Communications: A Dynamic Beamforming Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using multimodal sensory data can enhance communications systems by reducing the overhead and latency in beam training. However, processing such data incurs high computational complexity, and continuous sensing results in significant power and bandwidth consumption. This gives rise to a tradeoff between the (multimodal) sensing data acquisition rate and communications performance. In this work, we develop a constrained multimodal sensing-aided communications framework where dynamic sensing and beamforming are performed under a sensing budget. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the average received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of user equipment, subject to constraints on the average number of sensing actions and power budget. Using the Saleh-Valenzuela mmWave channel model, we construct the channel primarily based on position information obtained via multimodal sensing. Stricter sensing constraints reduce the availability of position data, leading to degraded channel estimation and thus lower performance. We apply Lyapunov optimization to solve the problem and derive a dynamic sensing and beamforming algorithm. Numerical evaluations on the DeepSense and Raymobtime datasets show that halving sensing times leads to only up to 7.7% loss in average SNR.</description>

      <title>Range Resolution of Near-field MIMO Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiative near-field and integration of sensing capabilities are seen as two key components of the next generation of wireless communication systems. In this paper, the sensing performance of a narrowband near-field system is investigated for several practical antenna array geometries and configurations, namely SIMO/MISO and MIMO. In the SIMO/MISO configuration, the antenna aperture is exploited only a single time for either transmit or receive signal processing, while the MIMO configuration exploits both TX and RX processing. Analytical derivations, supported by simulations, show that the MIMO processing improves the maximum near-field range and sensing resolution by approximately a factor of 1.4 as compared to single-aperture systems. The value of the improvement factor is consistent for all considered array geometries. Finally, using a quadratic approximation of the array factor, an analytical improvement factor of $\sqrt{2}$ is derived, clarifying the observed improvements and validating the numerical results.</description>

      <title>Angle diversity receiver as a key enabler for reliable ORIS-based Visible Light Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visible Light Communication (VLC) offers a promising solution to satisfy the increasing demand for wireless data. However, link blockages remain a significant challenge. This paper addresses this issue by investigating the combined use of angle diversity receivers (ADRs) and optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) in multiuser VLC systems. We consider ORIS elements as small movable mirrors. We demonstrate the complementarity of ADR and ORIS in mitigating link blockages, as well as the advantages of using a larger number of ORIS elements due to the increased field-of-view (FoV) at the receiver enabled by the ADR. An optimization algorithm is proposed to maximize the minimum signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) to deploy a fair communication network. Numerical results show that integrating ADR and ORIS significantly enhances VLC communication performance, achieving an SNR gain of up to 30 dB compared to a system without ORIS, and mitigating communication outages produced by link blockages or out-of-FoV received signals. We also prove that an ADR with a single tier of photodiodes is sufficient to complement ORIS-assisted VLC.</description>

      <title>Large Wireless Localization Model (LWLM): A Foundation Model for Positioning in 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and robust localization is a critical enabler for emerging 5G and 6G applications, including autonomous driving, extended reality (XR), and smart manufacturing. While data-driven approaches have shown promise, most existing models require large amounts of labeled data and struggle to generalize across deployment scenarios and wireless configurations. To address these limitations, we propose a foundation-model-based solution tailored for wireless localization. We first analyze how different self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks acquire general-purpose and task-specific semantic features based on information bottleneck (IB) theory. Building on this foundation, we design a pretraining methodology for the proposed Large Wireless Localization Model (LWLM). Specifically, we propose an SSL framework that jointly optimizes three complementary objectives: (i) spatial-frequency masked channel modeling (SF-MCM), (ii) domain-transformation invariance (DTI), and (iii) position-invariant contrastive learning (PICL). These objectives jointly capture the underlying semantics of wireless channel from multiple perspectives. We further design lightweight decoders for key downstream tasks, including time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation, angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation, single base station (BS) localization, and multiple BS localization. Comprehensive experimental results confirm that LWLM consistently surpasses both model-based and supervised learning baselines across all localization tasks. In particular, LWLM achieves 26.0%--87.5% improvement over transformer models without pretraining, and exhibits strong generalization under label-limited fine-tuning and unseen BS configurations, confirming its potential as a foundation model for wireless localization.</description>

      <title>CFARNet: Learning-Based High-Resolution Multi-Target Detection for Rainbow Beam Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) OFDM radar equipped with rainbow beamforming, enabled by joint phase-time arrays (JPTAs), provides wide-angle coverage and is well-suited for fast real-time target detection and tracking. However, accurate detection of multiple closely spaced targets remains a key challenge for conventional signal processing pipelines, particularly those relying on constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detectors. This paper presents CFARNet, a learning-based processing framework that replaces CFAR with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for peak detection in the angle-Doppler domain. The network predicts target subcarrier indices, which guide angle estimation via a known frequency-angle mapping and enable high-resolution range and velocity estimation using the MUSIC algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate that CFARNet significantly outperforms a CFAR+MUSIC baseline, especially under low transmit power and dense multi-target conditions. The proposed method offers superior angular resolution, enhanced robustness in low-SNR scenarios, and improved computational efficiency, highlighting the potential of data-driven approaches for high-resolution mmWave radar sensing.</description>

      <title>Subspace-Based Super-Resolution Sensing for Bi-Static ISAC with Clock Asynchronism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bi-static sensing is an attractive configuration for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems; however, clock asynchronism between widely separated transmitters and receivers introduces time-varying time offsets (TO) and phase offsets (PO), posing significant challenges. This paper introduces a signal-subspace-based framework that estimates decoupled angles, delays, and complex gain sequences (CGS)-- the target-reflected signals -- for multiple dynamic target paths. The proposed framework begins with a novel TO alignment algorithm, leveraging signal subspace or covariance, to mitigate TO variations across temporal snapshots, enabling coherent delay-domain analysis. Subsequently, subspace-based methods are developed to compensate for TO residuals and to perform joint angle-delay estimation. Finally, leveraging the high resolution in the joint angle-delay domain, the framework compensates for the PO and estimates the CGS for each target. The framework can be applied to both single-antenna and multi-antenna systems. Extensive simulations and experiments using commercial Wi-Fi devices demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly surpasses existing solutions in parameter estimation accuracy and delay resolution. Notably, it uniquely achieves a super-resolution in the delay domain, with a probability-of-resolution curve tightly approaching that in synchronized systems.</description>

      <title>Rate Region of ISAC for Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pinching-Antenna SyStem (PASS) reconstructs wireless channels through \emph{pinching beamforming}, wherein the activated positions of pinching antennas along dielectric waveguides are optimized to shape the radiation pattern. The aim of this article is to analyze the performance limits of employing PASS in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). Specifically, a PASS-assisted ISAC system is considered, where a pinched waveguide is utilized to simultaneously communicate with a user and sense a target. Closed-form expressions for the achievable communication rate (CR) and sensing rate (SR) are derived to characterize the information-theoretic limits of this dual-functional operation. \romannumeral1) For the single-pinch case, closed-form solutions for the optimal pinching antenna location are derived under \emph{sensing-centric (S-C)}, \emph{communications-centric (C-C)}, and \emph{Pareto-optimal} designs. On this basis, the CR-SR trade-off is characterized by deriving the full CR-SR rate region, which is shown to encompass that of conventional fixed-antenna systems. \romannumeral2) For the multiple-pinch case, an antenna location refinement method is applied to obtain the optimal C-C and S-C pinching beamformers. As a further advance, inner and outer bounds on the achievable CR-SR region are derived using an element-wise alternating optimization technique and by invoking Cauchy-Schwarz and Karamata's inequalities, respectively. Numerical results demonstrate that: \romannumeral1) the derived bounds closely approximate the true CR-SR region; and \romannumeral2) PASS can achieve a significantly larger rate region than conventional-antenna systems.</description>

      <title>Passive Channel Charting: Locating Passive Targets using a UWB Mesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fingerprint-based passive localization enables high localization accuracy using low-cost UWB IoT radio sensors. However, fingerprinting demands extensive effort for data acquisition. The concept of channel charting reduces this effort by modeling and projecting the manifold of \ac{csi} onto a 2D coordinate space. So far, researchers only applied this concept to active radio localization, where a mobile device intentionally and actively emits a specific signal. In this paper, we apply channel charting to passive localization. We use a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) system to estimate a target's velocity and derive a distance matrix from it. We then use this matrix to learn a distance-preserving embedding in 2D space, which serves as a fingerprinting model. In our experiments, we deploy six nodes in a fully connected ultra-wideband (UWB) mesh network to show that our method achieves high localization accuracy, with an average error of just 0.24\,m, even when we train and test on different targets.</description>

      <title>UAV-Enabled Passive 6DMA for ISAC: Joint Location, Orientation, and Reflection Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the fundamental performance trade-off in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems has been deemed as one of the most significant challenges. To address it, we propose in this letter a novel ISAC system that leverages an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and the UAV's maneuverability in six-dimensional (6D) space, i.e., three-dimensional (3D) location and 3D rotation, thus referred to as passive 6D movable antenna (6DMA). We aim to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for sensing a single target while ensuring a minimum SNR at a communication user equipment (UE), by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming at the ISAC base station (BS), the 3D location and orientation as well as the reflection coefficients of the IRS. To solve this challenging non-convex optimization problem, we propose a two-stage approach. In the first stage, we aim to optimize the IRS's 3D location, 3D orientation, and reflection coefficients to enhance both the channel correlations and power gains for sensing and communication. Given their optimized parameters, the optimal transmit beamforming at the ISAC BS is derived in closed form. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed passive 6DMA-enabled ISAC system significantly improves the sensing and communication trade-off by simultaneously enhancing channel correlations and power gains, and outperforms other baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>ISAC Channel Modelling -- Perspectives from ETSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) is defined as one of six usage scenarios in the ITU-R International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) 2030 framework for 6G. ISAC is envisioned to introduce the sensing capability into the cellular network, where sensing may be obtained using the cellular radio frequency (RF) signals with or without additional auxiliary sensors. To enable ISAC, specification bodies such as European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) have already started to look into detailed ISAC use cases, their requirements, and the channel models and evaluation methodologies that are necessary to design and evaluate ISAC performance. With focus on the channel model, the current communication-centric channel models like those specified in 3GPP technical report (TR) 38.901 do not cover the RF signals interactions between the transmitter, target object, receiver and their surrounding environment. To bridge this gap, 3GPP has been looking into the basic changes that are necessary to make to their TR38.901 channel model with focus on selected use cases from the 3GPP SA1 5G-Advanced feasibility study. In parallel, ETSI ISAC Industry Specification Group (ISG) has been studying the more advanced ISAC channel modelling features that are needed to support the variety of ISAC use cases envisioned in 6G. In this paper, we present the baseline and advanced features developed thus far in 3GPP and ETSI ISAC ISG, respectively, towards a comprehensive view of the ISAC channel model in 6G.</description>

      <title>Ray Antenna Array Achieves Uniform Angular Resolution Cost-Effectively for Low-Altitude UAV Swarm ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ray antenna array (RAA) is a novel multi-antenna architecture comprising massive low-cost antenna elements and a few radio-frequency (RF) chains. The antenna elements are arranged in a novel ray-like structure, where each ray corresponds to a simple uniform linear array (sULA) with deliberately designed orientation and all its antenna elements are directly connected. By further designing a ray selection network (RSN), appropriate sULAs are selected to connect to the RF chains for further baseband processing. RAA has three appealing advantages: (i) dramatically reduced hardware cost since no phase shifters are needed; (ii) enhanced beamforming gain as antenna elements with higher directivity can be used; (iii) uniform angular resolution across all signal directions. Such benefits make RAA especially appealing for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), particularly for low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm ISAC, where high-mobility aerial targets may easily move away from the boresight of conventional antenna arrays, causing severe communication and sensing performance degradation. Therefore, this paper studies RAA-based ISAC for low-altitude UAV swarm systems. First, we establish an input-output mathematical model for RAA-based UAV ISAC and rigorously show that RAA achieves uniform angular resolution for all directions. Besides, we design the RAA orientation and RSN. Furthermore, RAA-based ISAC with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for UAV swarm is studied, and efficient algorithm is proposed for sensing target parameter estimation. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the significant performance improvement by RAA system over the conventional antenna arrays, in terms of sensing angular resolution and communication spectral efficiency, highlighting the great potential of the novel RAA system to meet the growing demands of low-altitude UAV ISAC.</description>

      <title>Analog Self-Interference Cancellation in Full-Duplex Radios: A Fundamental Limit Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog self-interference cancellation (A-SIC) plays a crucial role in the implementation of in-band full-duplex (IBFD) radios, due to the fact that the inherent transmit (Tx) noise can only be addressed in the analog domain. It is thus natural to ask what the performance limit of A-SIC is in practical systems, which is still quite underexplored so far. In this paper, we aim to close this gap by characterizing the fundamental performance of A-SIC which employs the common multi-tap delay (MTD) architecture, by accounting for the following practical issues: 1) Nonstationarity of the Tx signal; 2) Nonlinear distortions on the Tx signal; 3) Multipath channel corresponding to the self-interference (SI); 4) Maximum amplitude constraint on the MTD tap weights. Our findings include: 1) The average approximation error for the cyclostationary Tx signals is equal to that for the stationary white Gaussian process, thus greatly simplifying the performance analysis and the optimization procedure. 2) The approximation error for the multipath SI channel can be decomposed as the sum of the approximation error for the single-path scenario. By leveraging these structural results, the optimization framework and algorithms which characterize the fundamental limit of A-SIC, by taking into account all the aforementioned practical factors, are provided.</description>

      <title>Learning Multi-Attribute Differential Graphs with Non-Convex Penalties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating differences in two multi-attribute Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) which are known to have similar structure, using a penalized D-trace loss function with non-convex penalties. The GGM structure is encoded in its precision (inverse covariance) matrix. Existing methods for multi-attribute differential graph estimation are based on a group lasso penalized loss function. In this paper, we consider a penalized D-trace loss function with non-convex (log-sum and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD)) penalties. Two proximal gradient descent methods are presented to optimize the objective function. Theoretical analysis establishing sufficient conditions for consistency in support recovery, convexity and estimation in high-dimensional settings is provided. We illustrate our approaches with numerical examples based on synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>Learning Kronecker-Structured Graphs from Smooth Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph learning, or network inference, is a prominent problem in graph signal processing (GSP). GSP generalizes the Fourier transform to non-Euclidean domains, and graph learning is pivotal to applying GSP when these domains are unknown. With the recent prevalence of multi-way data, there has been growing interest in product graphs that naturally factorize dependencies across different ways. However, the types of graph products that can be learned are still limited for modeling diverse dependency structures. In this paper, we study the problem of learning a Kronecker-structured product graph from smooth signals. Unlike the more commonly used Cartesian product, the Kronecker product models dependencies in a more intricate, non-separable way, but posits harder constraints on the graph learning problem. To tackle this non-convex problem, we propose an alternating scheme to optimize each factor graph and provide theoretical guarantees for its asymptotic convergence. The proposed algorithm is also modified to learn factor graphs of the strong product. We conduct experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs and demonstrate our approach's efficacy and superior performance compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Hybrid Beamforming for Multi-Cell mmWave Massive MIMO: A Primitive Kronecker Decomposition Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To circumvent the high path loss of mmWave propagation and reduce the hardware cost of massive multiple-input multiple-output antenna systems, full-dimensional hybrid beamforming is critical in 5G and beyond wireless communications. Concerning an uplink multi-cell system with a large-scale uniform planar antenna array, this paper designs an efficient hybrid beamformer using primitive Kronecker decomposition and dynamic factor allocation, where the analog beamformer applies to null the inter-cell interference and simultaneously enhances the desired signals. In contrast, the digital beamformer mitigates the intra-cell interference using the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. Then, due to the low accuracy of phase shifters inherent in the analog beamformer, a low-complexity hybrid beamformer is developed to slow its adjustment speed. Next, an optimality analysis from a subspace perspective is performed, and a sufficient condition for optimal antenna configuration is established. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the achievable sum rate of the proposed beamformer approaches that of the optimal pure digital MMSE scheme, yet with much lower computational complexity and hardware cost.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Decoding for Low-Rate Block Codes of Short Length Based on Concatenated Coding Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To decode a short linear block code, ordered statics decoding (OSD) and/or the $A^*$ decoding are usually considered. Either OSD or the $A^*$ decoding utilizes the magnitudes of the received symbols to establish the most reliable and independent positions (MRIP) frame. A restricted searched space can be employed to achieve near-optimum decoding with reduced decoding complexity. For a low-rate code with large minimum distance, the restricted search space is still very huge.
  We propose to use concatenated coding to further restrict the search space by proposing an improved MRIP frame. The improved MRIP frame is founded according to magnitudes of log likelihood ratios (LLRs) obtained by the soft-in soft-out (SISO) decoder for the inner code.
  We focus on the construction and decoding of several $(n,k)$ = (128,36) binary linear block codes based on concatenated coding. We use the (128,36) extended BCH (eBCH) code as a benchmark for comparison. Simulation shows that there exist constructed concatenated codes which are much more efficient than the (128,36) eBCH code. Some other codes of length 128 or close to 128 are also constructed to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing a 6G-oriented universal model capable of processing multi-modal data and executing diverse air interface tasks has emerged as a common goal in future wireless systems. Building on our prior work in communication multi-modal alignment and telecom large language model (LLM), we propose a scalable, task-aware artificial intelligence-air interface multi-modal universal model (AI2MMUM), which flexibility and effectively perform various physical layer tasks according to subtle task instructions. The LLM backbone provides robust contextual comprehension and generalization capabilities, while a fine-tuning approach is adopted to incorporate domain-specific knowledge. To enhance task adaptability, task instructions consist of fixed task keywords and learnable, implicit prefix prompts. Frozen radio modality encoders extract universal representations and adapter layers subsequently bridge radio and language modalities. Moreover, lightweight task-specific heads are designed to directly output task objectives. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that AI2MMUM achieves SOTA performance across five representative physical environment/wireless channel-based downstream tasks using the WAIR-D and DeepMIMO datasets.</description>

      <title>Topology-driven identification of repetitions in multi-variate time series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many multi-variate time series obtained in the natural sciences and engineering possess a repetitive behavior, as for instance state-space trajectories of industrial machines in discrete automation. Recovering the times of recurrence from such a multi-variate time series is of a fundamental importance for many monitoring and control tasks. For a periodic time series this is equivalent to determining its period length. In this work we present a persistent homology framework to estimate recurrence times in multi-variate time series with different generalizations of cyclic behavior (periodic, repetitive, and recurring). To this end, we provide three specialized methods within our framework that are provably stable and validate them using real-world data, including a new benchmark dataset from an injection molding machine.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient and Reliable Data Collection in Receiver-Initiated Wake-up Radio Enabled IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wake-up radio (WuR)-enabled internet of things (IoT) networks, UAVs can instantly activate the main radios (MRs) of the sensor nodes (SNs) with a wake-up call (WuC) for efficient data collection in mission-driven data collection scenarios. However, the spontaneous response of numerous SNs to the UAV's WuC can lead to significant packet loss and collisions, as WuR does not exhibit its superiority for high-traffic loads. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative receiver-initiated WuR UAV-assisted clustering (RI-WuR-UAC) medium access control (MAC) protocol to achieve low latency and high reliability in ultra-low power consumption applications. We model the proposed protocol using the $M/G/1/2$ queuing framework and derive expressions for key performance metrics, i.e., channel busyness probability, probability of successful clustering, average SN energy consumption, and average transmission delay. The RI-WuR-UAC protocol employs three distinct data flow models, tailored to different network traffic conditions, which perform three MAC mechanisms: channel assessment (CCA) clustering for light traffic loads, backoff plus CCA clustering for dense and heavy traffic, and adaptive clustering for variable traffic loads. Simulation results demonstrate that the RI-WuR-UAC protocol significantly outperforms the benchmark sub-carrier modulation clustering protocol. By varying the network load, we capture the trade-offs among the performance metrics, showcasing the superior efficiency and reliability of the RI-WuR-UAC protocol.</description>

      <title>Whitened Score Diffusion: A Structured Prior for Imaging Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional score-based diffusion models (DMs) may struggle with anisotropic Gaussian diffusion processes due to the required inversion of covariance matrices in the denoising score matching training objective \cite{vincent_connection_2011}. We propose Whitened Score (WS) diffusion models, a novel SDE-based framework that learns the Whitened Score function instead of the standard score. This approach circumvents covariance inversion, extending score-based DMs by enabling stable training of DMs on arbitrary Gaussian forward noising processes. WS DMs establish equivalence with FM for arbitrary Gaussian noise, allow for tailored spectral inductive biases, and provide strong Bayesian priors for imaging inverse problems with structured noise. We experiment with a variety of computational imaging tasks using the CIFAR and CelebA ($64\times64$) datasets and demonstrate that WS diffusion priors trained on anisotropic Gaussian noising processes consistently outperform conventional diffusion priors based on isotropic Gaussian noise.</description>

      <title>Spatially Selective Active Noise Control for Open-fitting Hearables with Acausal Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in active noise control have enabled the development of hearables with spatial selectivity, which actively suppress undesired noise while preserving desired sound from specific directions. In this work, we propose an improved approach to spatially selective active noise control that incorporates acausal relative impulse responses into the optimization process, resulting in significantly improved performance over the causal design. We evaluate the system through simulations using a pair of open-fitting hearables with spatially localized speech and noise sources in an anechoic environment. Performance is evaluated in terms of speech distortion, noise reduction, and signal-to-noise ratio improvement across different delays and degrees of acausality. Results show that the proposed acausal optimization consistently outperforms the causal approach across all metrics and scenarios, as acausal filters more effectively characterize the response of the desired source.</description>

      <title>AutoCam: Hierarchical Path Planning for an Autonomous Auxiliary Camera in Surgical Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating an autonomous auxiliary camera into robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) enhances spatial awareness and eliminates manual viewpoint control. Existing path planning methods for auxiliary cameras track two-dimensional surgical features but do not simultaneously account for camera orientation, workspace constraints, and robot joint limits. This study presents AutoCam: an automatic auxiliary camera placement method to improve visualization in RAMIS. Implemented on the da Vinci Research Kit, the system uses a priority-based, workspace-constrained control algorithm that combines heuristic geometric placement with nonlinear optimization to ensure robust camera tracking. A user study (N=6) demonstrated that the system maintained 99.84% visibility of a salient feature and achieved a pose error of 4.36 $\pm$ 2.11 degrees and 1.95 $\pm$ 5.66 mm. The controller was computationally efficient, with a loop time of 6.8 $\pm$ 12.8 ms. An additional pilot study (N=6), where novices completed a Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery training task, suggests that users can teleoperate just as effectively from AutoCam's viewpoint as from the endoscope's while still benefiting from AutoCam's improved visual coverage of the scene. These results indicate that an auxiliary camera can be autonomously controlled using the da Vinci patient-side manipulators to track a salient feature, laying the groundwork for new multi-camera visualization methods in RAMIS.</description>

      <title>Exploring Best Practices for ECG Pre-Processing in Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: In this work we search for best practices in pre-processing of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals in order to train better classifiers for the diagnosis of heart conditions. State of the art machine learning algorithms have achieved remarkable results in classification of some heart conditions using ECG data, yet there appears to be no consensus on pre-processing best practices. Is this lack of consensus due to different conditions and architectures requiring different processing steps for optimal performance? Is it possible that state of the art deep-learning models have rendered pre-processing unnecessary? In this work we apply down-sampling, normalization, and filtering functions to 3 different multi-label ECG datasets and measure their effects on 3 different high-performing time-series classifiers. We find that sampling rates as low as 50Hz can yield comparable results to the commonly used 500Hz. This is significant as smaller sampling rates will result in smaller datasets and models, which require less time and resources to train. Additionally, despite their common usage, we found min-max normalization to be slightly detrimental overall, and band-passing to make no measurable difference. We found the blind approach to pre-processing of ECGs for multi-label classification to be ineffective, with the exception of sample rate reduction which reliably reduces computational resources, but does not increase accuracy.</description>

      <title>Resource allocation exploiting reflective surfaces to minimize the outage probability in VLC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visible light communication (VLC) is a technology that complements radio frequency (RF) to fulfill the ever-increasing demand for wireless data traffic. The ubiquity of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), exploited as transmitters, increases the VLC market penetration and positions it as one of the most promising technologies to alleviate the spectrum scarcity of RF. However, VLC deployment is hindered by blockage causing connectivity outages in the presence of obstacles. Recently, optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) have been considered to mitigate this problem. While prior works exploit ORISs for data or secrecy rate maximization, this paper studies the optimal placement of mirrors and ORISs, and the LED power allocation, for jointly minimizing the outage probability while keeping the lighting standards. We describe an optimal outage minimization framework and present solvable heuristics. We provide extensive numerical results and show that the use of ORISs may reduce the outage probability by up to 67% with respect to a no-mirror scenario and provide a gain of hundreds of kbit/J in optical energy efficiency with respect to the presented benchmark.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Movable Antennas in Multicast Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates the integration of movable antennas (MAs) into multicast communication systems. By discretizing the motion of the MAs, a novel MA-assisted multicast transmission architecture is formulated. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm based on successive convex approximation is proposed to optimize the transmit beamforming and antenna positions. To gain further insights, the two-user case is examined, and a closed-form expression for the optimal beamformer is derived. On this basis, a low-complexity greedy search algorithm is developed to optimize the placement of the MAs. Furthermore, under the assumption of a line-of-sight propagation environment, a branch-and-bound algorithm is designed to determine the globally optimal antenna configuration with reduced complexity compared to exhaustive search. Numerical simulations confirm that the proposed methods effectively enhance the achievable multicast rate.</description>

      <title>ORIS allocation to minimize the outage probability in a multi-user VLC scenario</title>

Abstract: Visible Light Communication (VLC) is a promising solution to address the growing demand for wireless data, leveraging the widespread use of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as transmitters. However, its deployment is challenged by link blockages that cause connectivity outages. Optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) have recently emerged as a solution to mitigate these disruptions. This work considers a multi-user VLC system and investigates the optimal association of ORISs to LEDs and users to minimize the outage probability while limiting the number of ORISs used. Numerical results from our proposed optimization algorithm demonstrate that using ORISs can reduce the outage probability by up to 85% compared to a no-ORIS scenario.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)-enabled Secure Wireless Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel pinching-antenna systems (PASS)-enabled secure wireless communication framework is proposed. By dynamically adjusting the positions of dielectric particles, namely pinching antennas (PAs), along the waveguides, PASS introduces a novel concept of pinching beamforming to enhance the performance of physical layer security. A fundamental PASS-enabled secure communication system is considered with one legitimate user and one eavesdropper. Both single-waveguide and multiple-waveguide scenarios are studied. 1) For the single-waveguide scenario, the secrecy rate (SR) maximization is formulated to optimize the pinching beamforming. A PA-wise successive tuning (PAST) algorithm is proposed, which ensures constructive signal superposition at the legitimate user while inducing a destructive legitimate signal at the eavesdropper. 2) For the multiple-waveguide scenario, artificial noise (AN) is employed to further improve secrecy performance. A pair of practical transmission architectures are developed: waveguide division (WD) and waveguide multiplexing (WM). The key difference lies in whether each waveguide carries a single type of signal or a mixture of signals with baseband beamforming. For the SR maximization problem under the WD case, a two-stage algorithm is developed, where the pinching beamforming is designed with the PAST algorithm and the baseband power allocation among AN and legitimate signals is solved using successive convex approximation (SCA). For the WM case, an alternating optimization algorithm is developed, where the baseband beamforming is optimized with SCA and the pinching beamforming is designed employing particle swarm optimization.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Learning and Computing over Space-Ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Space-ground integrated networks hold great promise for providing global connectivity, particularly in remote areas where large amounts of valuable data are generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, but lacking terrestrial communication infrastructure. The massive data is conventionally transferred to the cloud server for centralized artificial intelligence (AI) models training, raising huge communication overhead and privacy concerns. To address this, we propose a hierarchical learning and computing framework, which leverages the lowlatency characteristic of low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellites and the global coverage of geostationary-earth-orbit (GEO) satellites, to provide global aggregation services for locally trained models on ground IoT devices. Due to the time-varying nature of satellite network topology and the energy constraints of LEO satellites, efficiently aggregating the received local models from ground devices on LEO satellites is highly challenging. By leveraging the predictability of inter-satellite connectivity, modeling the space network as a directed graph, we formulate a network energy minimization problem for model aggregation, which turns out to be a Directed Steiner Tree (DST) problem. We propose a topologyaware energy-efficient routing (TAEER) algorithm to solve the DST problem by finding a minimum spanning arborescence on a substitute directed graph. Extensive simulations under realworld space-ground integrated network settings demonstrate that the proposed TAEER algorithm significantly reduces energy consumption and outperforms benchmarks.</description>

      <title>An unsupervised method for MRI recovery: Deep image prior with structured sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: To propose and validate an unsupervised MRI reconstruction method that does not require fully sampled k-space data. Materials and Methods: The proposed method, deep image prior with structured sparsity (DISCUS), extends the deep image prior (DIP) by introducing group sparsity to frame-specific code vectors, enabling the discovery of a low-dimensional manifold for capturing temporal variations. \discus was validated using four studies: (I) simulation of a dynamic Shepp-Logan phantom to demonstrate its manifold discovery capabilities, (II) comparison with compressed sensing and DIP-based methods using simulated single-shot late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) image series from six distinct digital cardiac phantoms in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM), (III) evaluation on retrospectively undersampled single-shot LGE data from eight patients, and (IV) evaluation on prospectively undersampled single-shot LGE data from eight patients, assessed via blind scoring from two expert readers. Results: DISCUS outperformed competing methods, demonstrating superior reconstruction quality in terms of NMSE and SSIM (Studies I--III) and expert reader scoring (Study IV). Discussion: An unsupervised image reconstruction method is presented and validated on simulated and measured data. These developments can benefit applications where acquiring fully sampled data is challenging.</description>

      <title>Efficient Transformed Gaussian Process State-Space Models for Non-Stationary High-Dimensional Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18309v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) offer a principled framework for learning and inference in nonlinear dynamical systems with uncertainty quantification. However, existing GPSSMs are limited by the use of multiple independent stationary Gaussian processes (GPs), leading to prohibitive computational and parametric complexity in high-dimensional settings and restricted modeling capacity for non-stationary dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient transformed Gaussian process state-space model (ETGPSSM) for scalable and flexible modeling of high-dimensional, non-stationary dynamical systems. Specifically, our ETGPSSM integrates a single shared GP with input-dependent normalizing flows, yielding an expressive implicit process prior that captures complex, non-stationary transition dynamics while significantly reducing model complexity. For the inference of the implicit process, we develop a variational inference algorithm that jointly approximates the posterior over the underlying GP and the neural network parameters defining the normalizing flows. To avoid explicit variational parameterization of the latent states, we further incorporate the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) into the variational framework, enabling accurate and efficient state estimation. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our ETGPSSM in system dynamics learning, high-dimensional state estimation, and time-series forecasting, outperforming existing GPSSMs and neural network-based SSMs in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.</description>
