      <title>Looking for the quantum aspects of gravity in the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of quantum aspects of gravity remains one of the most elusive challenges in modern physics. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect, extending previous classical models to a fully quantum description. By quantizing the gravitational field and modeling its interaction with atomic states, we derive a formulation for the gravitational AB phase mediated by gravitons. This framework uncovers key insights into the entanglement dynamics and coherence properties of quantum systems in weak gravitational fields. Our analysis suggests that the derived gravitational AB phase is consistent with classical predictions but reveals subtle quantum features, providing a robust basis for exploring the quantum nature of perturbative gravity. These findings offer a conceptual pathway for indirect detection of gravitons, enriching our understanding of gravity's quantum underpinnings.</description>

      <title>Minkowski vacuum entanglement and accelerated oscillator chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minkowski vacuum is empty from the perspective of Unruh-Minkowski photons, however, in the Rindler picture, it is filled with entangled pairs of Rindler photons. A ground-state atom uniformly accelerated through Minkowski vacuum can become excited by absorbing a Rindler photon (Unruh effect) or, in the alternative description, by emitting an Unruh-Minkowski photon (Unruh-Wald effect). We find an exact solution for the quantum evolution of a long chain of harmonic oscillators accelerated through Minkowski vacuum and for two chains accelerated in the opposite directions. We show how entanglement of Rindler photons present in Minkowski vacuum is transferred to the oscillators moving in causally disconnected regions. We also show that in the Unruh-Minkowski photon picture the process can be interpreted as if initial correlations between collective oscillator modes are transferred to the generated Unruh-Minkowski photons.</description>

      <title>Quantum evolution of mixed states and performance of quantum heat engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a technique for calculation the density operator time evolution along the lines of Heisenberg representation of quantum mechanics. Using this technique, we find the exact solution for the evolution of two and three coupled harmonic oscillators initially prepared in thermal states at different temperatures. We show that such systems exhibit interesting quantum dynamics in which oscillators swap their thermal states due to entanglement induced in the process of energy exchange and yield noise induced coherence. A photonic quantum heat engine (QHE) composed of two optical cavities can be modeled as coupled harmonic oscillators with time-dependent frequencies. Photons in the cavities become entangled during the engine operation. We show that the work done by such an engine is maximum if at the end of the cycle the oscillators swap numbers of excitations which can be achieved when the engine operates under the condition of parametric resonance. We also show that Carnot formula yields limiting efficiency for QHEs under general assumptions. Our results deepen understanding of quantum evolution of mixed states which could be useful to design quantum machines with a better performance.</description>

      <title>Entanglement, separability and correlation topology of interacting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work investigates the possible correlation topologies of two interacting qubits in the parameter space of their interacting potential. It has been shown that the evolved combined state of such qubits may be either a separable or an entangled state depending on the nature and parameters of the potential, although it is impossible to travel from one maximally entangled state to another in the topological space by continuously varying such parameters without crossing an intermediate separable state, and vice-versa. The possible theoretical constructs of such interaction potentials required for rotating a qubit state through the two angular directions on its Bloch sphere are illustrated, and consequently a novel method of qubit phase measurement by copying it to other qubits is explored. Furthermore, the possibility of entanglement generation between two qubits by initially violating energy conservation while conserving energy at the end is described, and the non-local manipulation of the degree of entanglement is illustrated. Such investigations on the separability/entanglement between interacting qubits suggest that further extensive study on the fundamental quantum paradoxes as well as the basic decoherence models are also necessary for advancing the field of quantum technology in general.</description>

      <title>Floquet-Thermalization via Instantons near Dynamical Freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodically driven Floquet quantum many-body systems have revealed new insights into the rich interplay of thermalization, and growth of entanglement. The phenomenology of dynamical freezing, whereby a translationally invariant many-body system exhibits emergent conservation laws and a slow growth of entanglement entropy at certain fixed ratios of a drive amplitude and frequency, presents a novel paradigm for retaining memory of an initial state upto late times. Previous studies of dynamical freezing have largely been restricted to a high-frequency Floquet-Magnus expansion, and numerical exact diagonalization, which are unable to capture the slow approach to thermalization (or lack thereof) in a systematic fashion. By employing Floquet flow-renormalization, where the time-dependent part of the Hamiltonian is gradually decoupled from the effective Hamiltonian using a sequence of unitary transformations, we unveil the universal approach to dynamical freezing and beyond, at asymptotically late times. We analyze the fixed-point behavior associated with the flow-renormalization at and near freezing using both exact-diagonalization and tensor-network based methods, and contrast the results with conventional prethermal phenomenon. For a generic non-integrable spin Hamiltonian with a periodic cosine wave drive, the flow approaches an unstable fixed point with an approximate emergent symmetry. We observe that at freezing the thermalization timescales are delayed compared to away from freezing, and the flow trajectory undergoes a series of instanton events. Our numerical results are supported by analytical solutions to the flow equations.</description>

      <title>Nonlocality of Quantum States can be Transitive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a Bell test involving three parties, one may find a curious situation where the nonlocality in two bipartite subsystems forces the remaining bipartite subsystem to exhibit nonlocality. Post-quantum examples for this phenomenon, dubbed nonlocality transitivity, have been found in 2011. However, the question of whether nonlocality transitivity occurs within quantum theory has remained unresolved -- until now. Here, we provide the first affirmative answer to this question at the level of quantum states. Leveraging the possibility of Bell-inequality violation by tensoring, we analytically construct a pair of nonlocal bipartite states such that simultaneously realizing them in a tripartite system forces the remaining bipartite state to be nonlocal. En route to showing this, we prove that multiple copies of the $W$-state marginals uniquely determine the global compatible state. Furthermore, in contrast to Bell-nonlocality, we show that quantum steering already exhibits transitivity in a three-qubit setting, thus revealing another significant distinction between Bell-nonlocality and steering. We also discuss connections between the problem of nonlocality transitivity and the largely overlooked polygamous nature of nonlocality.</description>

      <title>The role of nuclear spin diffusion in dynamic nuclear polarization of crystalline nanoscale silicon particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperpolarized nanoparticles (NPs) offer high polarization levels with room temperature relaxation times exceeding half an hour. In this work, we demonstrate that the achievable hyperpolarization enhancement and relaxation (decay) time at room temperature are largely independent of the particle size contrary to previous assumptions. This is explained through first-principles spin-diffusion coefficient calculations and finite-element polarization simulations. The simulated zero-quantum (flip-flop) line width governing the spin diffusion is found to agree with the experimentally accessible single-quantum (single spin flip, e.g. radio-frequency pulse) line width. The transport of hyperpolarization from strongly hyperfine-coupled spins towards the bulk is most likelybelieved to be responsible for the slow polarization dynamics including long room temperature decay time. The line width and spin-diffusion simulations are extended to other cubic crystal structures and analytical expressions, which only require insertion of the gyromagnetic ratio, lattice constant, isotope abundance and measured spectral density distribution (nuclear line width), are fitted. The presented simulations can be adjusted to study spin diffusion in other materials.</description>

      <title>Large collective power enhancement in dissipative charging of a quantum battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model for a quantum battery consisting of a collection of $N$ two-level atoms driven by a classical field and decaying to a common reservoir. In the extensive regime, where the energy $E$ scales as $N$ and the fluctuations $\Delta E/E \to 0$, our dissipative charging protocol yields a power proportional to $N^2$, a scaling that cannot be achieved in this regime by Hamiltonian protocols. The tradeoff for this enhanced charging power is a relative inefficiency, since a large fraction of the incoming energy is lost through spontaneous emission to the environment. Nevertheless, we find the system can store a large amount of coherence, and also release the stored energy coherently through spontaneous emission, again with a power scaling as $N^2$.</description>

      <title>Separation of measurement uncertainty into quantum and classical parts based on Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability and generalized entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement in quantum mechanics is notoriously unpredictable. The uncertainty in quantum measurement can arise from the noncommutativity between the state and the measurement basis which is intrinsically quantum, but it may also be of classical origin due to the agent's ignorance. It is of fundamental as well as practical importance to cleanly separate the two contributions which can be directly accessed using laboratory operations. Here, we propose two ways of decomposition of the total measurement uncertainty additively into quantum and classical parts. In the two decompositions, the total uncertainty of a measurement described by a POVM (positive-operator-valued measure) over a quantum state is quantified respectively by two generalized nonadditive entropies of the measurement outcomes; the quantum parts are identified, respectively, by the nonreality and the nonclassicality | which captures simultaneously both the nonreality and negativity | of the associated generalized Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability relative to the POVM of interest and a PVM (projection-valued measure) and maximized over all possible choices of the latter; and, the remaining uncertainties are identified as the classical parts. Both decompositions are shown to satisfy a few plausible requirements. The minimum of the total measurement uncertainties in the two decompositions over all POVM measurements are given by the impurity of the quantum state quantified by certain generalized quantum entropies, and are entirely classical. We argue that nonvanishing genuine quantum uncertainty in the two decompositions are sufficient and necessary to prove quantum contextuality via weak measurement with postselection. Finally, we suggest that the genuine quantum uncertainty is a manifestation of a specific measurement disturbance.</description>

Abstract: The main goal of present paper is to analyze the adiabatic definition of scattering matrix in the formalism of L-functionals.
  This definition leads to the notion of inclusive scattering matrix closely related to inclusive cross sections. We discuss this notion and the relation of our techniques to adiabatic quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation is a foundational application for quantum computers, projected to offer insights into complex quantum systems that are beyond the reach of classical computation. However, with the exception of Trotter-based methods which suffer from suboptimal scaling with respect to simulation precision, existing simulation techniques are for the most part too intricate to implement on early fault-tolerant quantum hardware. We propose a quantum Hamiltonian dynamics simulation algorithm that aims to be both straightforward to implement and at the same time have near-optimal scaling in simulation precision.</description>

      <title>Tripartite entanglement of qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an in-depth study of tripartite entanglement of qudits. We start with a short review of tripartite entanglement invariants, prove a theorem about the complete list of all allowed values of three (out of the total of four) such invariants, and give several bounds on the allowed values of the fourth invariant. After introducing several operations on entangled states (that allow us to build new states from old states) and deriving general properties pertaining to their invariants, we arrive at the decomposition theorem as one of our main results. The theorem relates the algebraic invariants of any entanglement class with the invariants of its corresponding components in each of its direct sum decompositions. This naturally leads to the definition of reducible and irreducible entanglement classes. We explicitly compute algebraic invariants for several families of irreducible classes and show how the decomposition theorem allows computations of invariants for compounded classes to be carried out efficiently. This theorem also allows us to compute the invariants for the infinite number of entanglement classes constructed from irreducible components. We proceed with the complete list of the entanglement classes for three tribits with decompositions of each class into irreducible components, and provide a visual guide to interrelations of these decompositions. We conclude with numerous examples of building classes for higher-spin qudits.</description>

      <title>Chip-to-chip photonic quantum teleportation over optical fibers of 12.3km</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation is a crucial function in quantum networks. The implementation of photonic quantum teleportation could be highly simplified by quantum photonic circuits. To extend chip-to-chip teleportation distance, more effort is needed on both chip design and system implementation. In this work, we demonstrate a chip-to-chip photonic quantum teleportation over optical fibers under the scenario of star-topology quantum network. Time-bin encoded quantum states are used to achieve a long teleportation distance. Three photonic quantum circuits are designed and fabricated on a single chip, each serving specific functions: heralded single-photon generation at the user node, entangled photon pair generation and Bell state measurement at the relay node, and projective measurement of the teleported photons at the central node. The unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometers (UMZI) for time-bin encoding in these quantum photonic circuits are optimized to reduce insertion losses and suppress noise photons generated on the chip. Besides, an active feedback system is employed to suppress the impact of fiber length fluctuation between the circuits, achieving a stable quantum interference for the Bell state measurement in the relay node. As the result, a photonic quantum teleportation over optical fibers of 12.3km is achieved based on these quantum photonic circuits, showing the potential of chip integration on the development of quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Qubit Optimized Quantum Implementation of SLIM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of quantum computing has profound implications for current technologies, offering advancements in optimization while posing significant threats to cryptographic algorithms. Public-key cryptosystems relying on prime factorization or discrete logarithms are particularly vulnerable, whereas block ciphers (BCs) remain secure through increased key lengths. In this study, we introduce a novel quantum implementation of SLIM, a lightweight block cipher optimized for 32-bit plaintext and an 80-bit key, based on a Feistel structure. This implementation distinguishes itself from other BC quantum implementations in its class (64-128-bit) by utilizing a minimal number of qubits while maintaining robust cryptographic strength and efficiency. By employing an innovative design that minimizes qubit usage, this work highlights SLIM's potential as a resource-efficient and secure candidate for quantum-resistant encryption protocols.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Support Vector Machine is a kernel-based approach to classification problems. We study the applicability of quantum kernels to financial data, specifically our self-curated Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSEx) Broad Index dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first systematic research work on this dataset on the application of quantum kernel. We report empirical quantum advantage in our work, using several quantum kernels and proposing the best one for this dataset while verifying the Phase Space Terrain Ruggedness Index metric. We estimate the resources needed to carry out these investigations on a larger scale for future practitioners.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped ions are among the leading platforms for quantum technologies, particularly in the field of quantum computing. Detecting states of trapped ions is essential for ensuring high-fidelity readouts of quantum states. In this work, we develop and benchmark a set of methods for ion quantum state detection using images obtained by a highly sensitive camera. By transforming the images from the camera and applying conventional and quantum machine learning methods, including convolution, support vector machine (classical and quantum), and quantum annealing, we demonstrate a possibility to detect the positions and quantum states of ytterbium ions in a Paul trap. Quantum state detection is performed with an electron shelving technique: depending on the quantum state of the ion its fluorescence under the influence of a 369.5 nm laser beam is either suppressed or not. We estimate fidelities for conventional and quantum detection techniques. In particular, conventional algorithms for detecting $^{171}$Yb$^{+}$, such as the support vector machine and photon statistics-based method,as well as our quantum annealing-based approach, have achieved perfect fidelity, which is beneficial compared to standard techniques. This result may pave the way for ultrahigh-fidelity detection of trapped ions via conventional and quantum machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Structured position-momentum entangled two-photon fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured optical fields have led to several ground-breaking techniques in classical imaging and microscopy. At the same time, in the quantum domain, position-momentum entangled photon fields have been shown to have several unique features that can lead to beyond-classical imaging and microscopy capabilities. Therefore, it is natural to expect that position-momentum entangled two-photon fields that are structured can push the boundaries of quantum imaging and microscopy even further beyond. Nonetheless, the existing experimental schemes are able to produce either structured two-photon fields without position-momentum entanglement, or position-momentum entangled two-photon fields without structures. In this article, by manipulating the phase-matching condition of the spontaneous parametric down-conversion process, we report experimental generation of two-photon fields with various structures in their spatial correlations. We experimentally measure the minimum bound on the entanglement of formation and thereby verify the position-momentum entanglement of the structured two-photon field. We expect this work to have important implications for quantum technologies related to imaging and sensing.</description>

      <title>The geometry of simplicial distributions on suspension scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum measurements often exhibit non-classical features, such as contextuality, which generalizes Bell's non-locality and serves as a resource in various quantum computation models. Existing frameworks have rigorously captured these phenomena, and recently, simplicial distributions have been introduced to deepen this understanding. The geometrical structure of simplicial distributions can be seen as a resource for applications in quantum information theory. In this work, we use topological foundations to study this geometrical structure, leveraging the fact that, in this simplicial framework, measurements and outcomes are represented as spaces. This allows us to depict contextuality as a topological phenomenon. We show that applying the cone construction to the measurement space makes the corresponding non-signaling polytope equal to the join of $m$ copies of the original polytope, where $m$ is the number of possible outcomes per measurement. Then we glue two copies of cone measurement spaces to obtain a suspension measurement space. The decomposition done for simplicial distributions on a cone measurement space provides deeper insights into the geometry of simplicial distributions on a suspension measurement space and aids in characterizing the contextuality there. Additionally, we apply these results to derive a new type of Bell inequalities (inequalities that determine the set of local joint probabilities/non-contextual simplicial distributions) and to offer a mathematical explanation for certain contextual vertices from the literature.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of heralded Gaussification of phase-randomized coherent states of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic heralded Gaussification of quantum states of light is an important ingredient of protocols for distillation of continuous variable entanglement and squeezing. An elementary step of heralded Gaussification protocol consists of interference of two copies of the state at a balanced beam splitter, followed by conditioning on outcome of a suitable Gaussian quantum measurement on one output mode. When iterated, the protocol either converges to a Gaussian state, or diverges. Here we report on experimental investigation of the convergence properties of iterative heralded Gaussification. We experimentally implement two iterations of the protocol, which requires simultaneous processing of four copies of the input state. We utilize the phase-randomized coherent states as the input states, which greatly facilitates the experiment, because these states can be generated deterministically and their mean photon number can easily be tuned. We comprehensively characterize the input and partially Gaussified states by balanced homodyne detection and quantum state tomography. Our experimental results are in good agreement with theoretical predictions and they provide new insights into the convergence properties of heralded quantum Gaussification.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of enhanced quantum tomography via quantum reservoir processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is a rapidly advancing discipline that leverages the features of quantum mechanics to enhance the performance of computational tasks. Quantum reservoir processing, which allows efficient optimization of a single output layer without precise control over the quantum system, stands out as one of the most versatile and practical quantum machine learning techniques. Here we experimentally demonstrate a quantum reservoir processing approach for continuous-variable state reconstruction on a bosonic circuit quantum electrodynamics platform. The scheme learns the true dynamical process through a minimum set of measurement outcomes of a known set of initial states. We show that the map learnt this way achieves high reconstruction fidelity for several test states, offering significantly enhanced performance over using map calculated based on an idealised model of the system. This is due to a key feature of reservoir processing which accurately accounts for physical non-idealities such as decoherence, spurious dynamics, and systematic errors. Our results present a valuable tool for robust bosonic state and process reconstruction, concretely demonstrating the power of quantum reservoir processing in enhancing real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Topology and Spectrum in Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Competition among repetitive measurements of noncommuting observables and unitary dynamics can give rise to a rich variety of entanglement phases. We here characterize topological phases in monitored quantum systems by their spectrum and many-body topological invariants. We analyze (1+1)-dimensional monitored circuits for Majorana fermions, which have topological and trivial area-law entangled phases and a critical phase with sub-volume-law entanglement, through the Lyapunov spectrum. We uncover the presence (absence) of edge-localized zero modes inside the bulk gap in the topological (trivial) area-law phase and a bulk gapless spectrum in the critical phase. Furthermore, by suitably exploiting the fermion parity with twisted measurement outcomes at the boundary, we construct a topological invariant that sharply distinguishes the two area-law phases and dynamically characterizes the critical phase. Our work thus paves the way to extend the bulk-edge correspondence for topological phases from equilibrium to monitored quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the Ehrenfest theorem and centroids of relativistic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider relativistic versions of the Ehrenfest relation between the expectation values of the coordinate and momentum of a quantum particle in free space: $d\langle {\bf r} \rangle /dt = \langle {\bf p} \rangle/m$. We find that the simple proportionality between the mean velocity and momentum holds true only for the simplest quadratic dispersion (i.e., dependence of the energy on the momentum). For relativistic dispersion, the mean velocity is generally not collinear with the mean momentum, but velocity of the {\it energy centroid} is directed along the mean momentum. This is related to the conservation of the Lorentz-boost momentum and has implications in possible decomposition of the mean orbital angular momentum into intrinsic and extrinsic parts. Neglecting spin/polarization effects, these properties depend solely on the dispersion relation, and can be applied to any waves, including classical electromagnetic or acoustic fields.</description>

      <title>Closed dynamical recursion equations for correlation functions and the application on the construction of Liouvillian spectrum in Lindbladian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an open quantum system described by the Lindblad equation, full characterization of its dynamics typically needs the knowledge of the Liouvillian spectrum and correlation functions. Solving the Liouvillian spectrum and correlation functions are usually formidable tasks, and most previous studies are constrained to simple models and lower-order correlations. In this work, we derive a closed form of dynamical recursion equations for all even-order correlation functions associated with the quadratic Liouvillian superoperator, thus extending the Wick's theorem and enabling the reconstruction of the corresponding Liouvillian spectrum. Furthermore, we study the quartic Liouvillian superoperator, establishing the necessary and sufficient conditions for the closure of second-order correlation functions. Building on this, the dynamical expressions for even-order correlation functions under quadratic dissipation are derived, culminating in a method for constructing the Liouvillian spectrum in this extended framework.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Noise Suppression Simplified through Channel Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Markovian noise, arising from the memory effect in the environment, poses substantial challenges to conventional quantum noise suppression protocols, including quantum error correction and mitigation. We introduce a channel representation for arbitrary non-Markovian quantum dynamics, termed the Choi channel, as it operates on the Choi states of the ideal gate layers. This representation translates the complex dynamics of non-Markovian noise into the familiar picture of noise channels acting on ideal states, allowing us to directly apply many existing error suppression protocols originally designed for Markovian noise. These protocols can then be translated from the Choi channel picture back to the circuit picture, yielding non-Markovian noise suppression protocols. With this framework, we have devised new protocols using Pauli twirling, probabilistic error cancellation and virtual channel purification. In particular, Pauli twirling can transform any non-Markovian noise into noise that exhibits only classical temporal correlations, thereby extending the proven noise resilience of single-shot quantum error correction to arbitrary non-Markovian noise. Through these examples, the Choi channel demonstrates significant potential as a foundational bridge for connecting existing techniques and inspiring the development of novel non-Markovian noise suppression protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technologies offer ways to solve certain tasks more quickly, efficiently, and with greater sensitivity than their classical counterparts. Yet substantial challenges remain in the construction of sufficiently error-free and scaleable quantum platforms that are needed to unlock any real benefits to society. Acknowledging that this hardware can take vastly different forms, our review here focuses on so-called spintronic (\textit{i.e.}~spin-electronic) materials that use electronic or nuclear spins to embody qubits. Towards helping the reader to spot trends and pick winners, we have surveyed the various families of optically addressable spin qubits and attempted to benchmark and identify the most promising ones in each group. We reveal further trends that demonstrate how qubit lifetimes depend on the material's synthesis, the concentration/distribution of its embedded qubits, and the experimental conditions.</description>

Abstract: Spectral properties of fluorescent radiation from a two-level quantum system with broken inversion spatial symmetry, which can be described by a model of an one-electron two-level atom whose electric dipole moment operator has permanent unequal diagonal matrix elements, were studied. The case of the excitation of this system by a polychromatic laser field, comprised of $N-1$ high-frequency components with the frequencies close to or being in resonance with the atomic transition frequency, and a low-frequency component whose frequency coincides with the Rabi frequency of the high-frequency components, was considered. Special attention was given to the resonant bichromatic and nearly resonant trichromatic excitation. In the former case it was shown that by changing the intensity of the low-frequency component, one can efficiently alter spectral properties of the fluorescent radiation of the system in the high-frequency range, while in the latter case it was found that the fluorescent behavior of the system in question reveals a kind of an optoelectronic transistor effect. Options for the experimental detection and practical usage of the effects under study were discussed.</description>

Abstract: We studied time-dependent features of high-frequency fluorescent radiation from a two-level quantum system with broken inversion spatial symmetry. The system in question was modelled after a one-electron two-level asymmetric polar semiconductor quantum dot whose electric dipole moment operator has permanent unequal diagonal matrix elements. The dot was permanently excited by incoherent pumping of some sort. Our attention was focused on the evolution of the fluorescence spectrum following abrupt switching on of an additional driving monochromatic field, which frequency is much lower than the optical transition frequency of the quantum dot. An analytical expression for the fluorescence spectrum as a function of the amplitude, initial phase and frequency of the monochromatic driving field, as well as of the pumping intensity and the elapsed time, was derived.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting circuits incorporating Josephson elements represent a promising hardware platform for quantum technologies. Potential applications include scalable quantum computing, microwave quantum networks, and quantum-limited amplifiers. However, progress in Josephson junction-based quantum technologies is facing the ongoing challenge of minimizing loss channels. This is also true for parametric superconducting devices based on nonlinear Josephson resonators. In this work, we report on the fabrication and characterization of low-loss Josephson parametric devices operated in the GHz frequency range, showing record internal quality factors. Specifically, we achieve internal quality factors significantly above $10^5$ for both Josephson parametric converters and the Josephson parametric amplifiers at low microwave power ranging in the single-photon regime. These low-loss devices mark a significant step forward in realizing high-performance quantum circuits, enabling further advancements in superconducting quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>A hybrid classical-quantum approach to highly constrained Unit Commitment problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unit commitment (UC) problem stands as a critical optimization challenge in the electrical power industry. It is classified as NP-hard, placing it among the most intractable problems to solve. This paper introduces a novel hybrid quantum-classical algorithm designed to efficiently (approximately) solve the UC problem in polynomial time. In this approach, the UC problem is decomposed into two subproblems: a QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) problem and a quadratic optimization problem. The algorithm employs the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to identify the optimal unit combination and classical methods to determine individual unit powers. The proposed hybrid algorithm is the first to include both the spinning reserve constraint (thus improving its applicability to real-world scenarios) and to explore QAOA warm-start optimization in this context. The effectiveness of this optimization was illustrated for specific instances of the UC problem, not only in terms of solution accuracy but also by reducing the number of iterations required for QAOA convergence. Hybrid solutions achieved using a single-layer warm-start QAOA (p=1) are within a 5.1 % margin of the reference (approximate) classical solution, while guaranteeing polynomial time complexity on the number of power generation units and time intervals.</description>

      <title>The Stabilizer Bootstrap of Quantum Machine Learning with up to 10000 qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is considered one of the flagship applications of quantum computers, where variational quantum circuits could be the leading paradigm both in the near-term quantum devices and the early fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, it is not clear how to identify the regime of quantum advantages from these circuits, and there is no explicit theory to guide the practical design of variational ansatze to achieve better performance. We address these challenges with the stabilizer bootstrap, a method that uses stabilizer-based techniques to optimize quantum neural networks before their quantum execution, together with theoretical proofs and high-performance computing with 10000 qubits or random datasets up to 1000 data. We find that, in a general setup of variational ansatze, the possibility of improvements from the stabilizer bootstrap depends on the structure of the observables and the size of the datasets. The results reveal that configurations exhibit two distinct behaviors: some maintain a constant probability of circuit improvement, while others show an exponential decay in improvement probability as qubit numbers increase. These patterns are termed strong stabilizer enhancement and weak stabilizer enhancement, respectively, with most situations falling in between. Our work seamlessly bridges techniques from fault-tolerant quantum computing with applications of variational quantum algorithms. Not only does it offer practical insights for designing variational circuits tailored to large-scale machine learning challenges, but it also maps out a clear trajectory for defining the boundaries of feasible and practical quantum advantages.</description>

In this work, we propose a scheme to realize magnon blockade effects in a hybrid system consisting of a YIG\thinspace micromagnet and a skyrmion. Through numerical simulations, we explore the behavior of the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ under various parameter regimes and examine the influence of the ambient thermal noise on the magnon blockade effects. The results indicate that the behavior of the second-order correlation function for the magnon mode critically depends on the skyrmion qubit-magnon coupling strength and the drive detuning. By tuning the drive field, the system effectively suppresses multi-magnon state and yields a high-purity single-magnon state, exhibiting pronounced antibunching and magnon blockade effects. This scheme provides a feasible and versatile new all-magnetic platform for achieving high-purity single-magnon sources.</description>

      <title>Experimental Acceleration of Spin Transition in Nitrogen-Vacancy Center</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shortcuts to adiabaticity~(STA) enables fast and robust coherent control of quantum system, which has been well placed in quantum technologies. In particular, inverse engineering STA provides much more freedom for the optimization of shortcut, which alleviates the complexity for experimental realization. Here, we implement a STA technique, known as invariant-based inverse engineering, to speed up the adiabatic control of the electron triplet ground state of a single nitrogen-vacancy~(NV) center. The microwave pulses to drive inversely engineered STA are obtained with space curve quantum control, where the evolution of spin transition is mapped to a three-dimensional closed space curve and the design of shortcut is obtained by optimization over the space curve. We demonstrate the fast and high-fidelity drive of dipole-forbidden transition between two spin sublevels of the ground state. Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness of the spin transition by introducing the detuning of driving microwave field. The acceleration and robustness is further confirmed by the comparison with two traditional Raman control schemes. Our results suggest invariant-based inverse engineering is powerful for fast and robust manipulation of NV system, and thus benefits quantum sensing and quantum computation based on the NV platform.</description>

      <title>Wavelength-Tunable and High-Heralding-Efficiency Quantum Photon Source in Birefringent Phase-Matched Lithium Niobate Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium niobate~(LN) is a birefringent material, where the strong birefringence thermo-optic effect is promising for the generation of quantum photon source with widely tunable wavelength. Here, we demonstrate birefringent phase-matching in a 20-mm-long waveguide fabricated on 5~$\mu$m-thick x-cut lithium niobate on insulator. The waveguide is deviated from the optical axis of LN by an angle of 53.5$^\circ$, enabling the phase matching between telecom and visible wavelengths. The phase-matching wavelength of this device can be thermally tuned with rate of 0.617~nm/K. We demonstrate the type-1 spontaneous parametric down-conversion to generate photon pairs with brightness of 2.2~MHz/mW and coincidence-to-accidental ratio up to $2.8\times10^5$. Furthermore, the heralded single photon is obtained from the photon pair with efficiency of 13.8\% and count rate up to 37.8~kHz.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency On-chip Quantum Photon Source in Modal Phase-matched Lithium Niobate Nanowaveguide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-film lithium niobate on insulator~(LNOI) emerges as a promising platform for integrated quantum photon source, enabling scalable on-chip quantum information processing. The most popular technique to overcome the phase mismatching between interacting waves in waveguide is periodic poling, which is intrinsically sensitive to poling uniformity. Here, we report an alternative strategy to offset the phase mismatching of spontaneous parametric down-conversion~(SPDC) process, so-called modal phase matching, in a straight waveguide fabricated on a dual-layer LNOI. The dual-layer LNOI consists of two 300~nm lithium niobates with opposite directions, which significantly enhances the spatial overlap between fundamental and high-order modes and thus enables efficient SPDC. This dual-layer waveguide generates photon pairs with pair generation rate of 41.77~GHz/mW, which exhibits excellent signal-to-noise performance with coincidence-to-accidental ratio up to 58298$\pm$1297. Moreover, we observe a heralded single-photon source with second-order autocorrelation $g_{H}^{(2)}(0)&lt;0.2$ and heralded rate exceeding 100~kHz. Our results provide an experiment-friendly approach for efficient generation of quantum photon sources and benefit the on-chip quantum information processing based on LNOI.</description>

      <title>Quantum search in a dictionary based on fingerprinting-hashing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a quantum query algorithm for searching a word of length $m$ in an unsorted dictionary of size $n$. The algorithm uses $O(\sqrt{n})$ queries (Grover operators), like previously known algorithms.
  What is new is that the algorithm is based on the quantum fingerprinting-hashing technique, which (a) provides a first level of amplitude amplification before applying the sequence of Grover amplitude amplification operators and (b) makes the algorithm more efficient in terms of memory use -- it requires $O(\log n + \log m)$ qubits.
  Note that previously developed algorithms by other researchers without hashing require $O(\log n + m)$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Snakes and Ladders: Adapting the surface code to defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the critical challenges solid-state quantum processors face is the presence of fabrication imperfections and two-level systems, which render certain qubits and gates either inoperable or much noisier than tolerable by quantum error correction protocols. To address this challenge, we develop a suite of novel and highly performant methods for adapting surface code patches in the presence of defective qubits and gates, which we call \emph{Snakes and Ladders}. We explain how our algorithm generates and compares several strategies in order to find the optimal one for any given configuration of defective components, as well as introduce heuristics to improve runtime and minimize computing resources required by our algorithm. In addition to memory storage we also show how to apply our methods to lattice surgery protocols. Compared to prior works, our methods significantly improve the code distance of the adapted surface code patches for realistic defect rates, resulting in a logical performance similar to that of the defect-free patches.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Locality from Electromagnetism to Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetism is the paradigm case of a theory that satisfies relativistic locality. This can be proven by demonstrating that, once the theory's laws are imposed, what is happening within a region fixes what will happen in the contracting light-cone with that region as its base. The Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations meet the same standard. We show that this standard can also be applied to quantum field theory (without collapse), examining two different ways of assigning reduced density matrix states to regions of space. Our preferred method begins from field wave functionals and judges quantum field theory to be local. Another method begins from particle wave functions (states in Fock space) and leads to either non-locality or an inability to assign states to regions, depending on the choice of creation operators. We take this analysis of quantum field theory (without collapse) to show that the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics is local at the fundamental level. We argue that this fundamental locality is compatible with either local or global accounts of the non-fundamental branching of worlds, countering an objection that has been raised to the Sebens-Carroll derivation of the Born Rule from self-locating uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Purcell-Enhanced Generation of Photonic Bell States via the Inelastic Scattering of Single Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single atoms trapped in optical cavities exhibit immense potential as key nodes in future quantum information processing. They have already demonstrated significant advancement in various quantum technologies, particularly regarding the generation of nonclassical light. Here, we efficiently produce genuine photonic Bell states through the inelastic scattering process of single two-level intracavity atoms. An experimental violation of the Bell inequality, arising from the interference between the probability amplitudes of two photons, validates the intrinsic nature of energy-time entanglement. Coupling atoms with an optical cavity in the Purcell regime substantially enhances the two-photon scattering. This Bell state generation process does not require atomic spin control, thereby rendering it inherently immune to decoherence effects. This work advances the comprehension of resonance fluorescence and has the potential to broaden the landscape of quantum technologies and facilitate the application of photonic Bell states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a quantum Otto-type heat engine constructed in an optomechanical system with which the cavity is chosen as the working substance. The cavity can effectively be coupled with hot thermal baths in nonequilibrium steady-states via optomechanical interaction. The mechanical mode with parametric drive fuels the cavity, and the utilization efficiency of energy is discussed. To obtain higher efficiency in finite time evolution, we use the shortcuts-to-adiabaticity method in work generation processes. The modified thermal efficiencies are obtained by numerical simulation. Such a system provides potential applications in quantum heat transfer and energy utilization in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Monotones in Resource Theories for Dynamical Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arXiv:2110.02613, we presented a generalised dynamical resource theory framework that enabled noise reduction techniques including dynamical decoupling (DD) to be studied. While this fundamental contribution remains correct, it has been found that the main resource quantifiers we employed to study these resource theories -- based on the relative entropies between Choi states of multitime processes -- are not monotonic under the allowed transformations. In this letter we detail modified relative entropy-based resource quantifiers, prove that they are indeed monotonic in our resource theories. We re-interpret our numerical results in terms of these new relative entropy monotones, arriving at the same empirical conclusions: DD can be understood as temporal resource distillation, and improvements to noise reduction via our multitimescale optimal dynamical decoupling (MODD) method coincide with a decrease in the corresponding non-Markovianity monotone.</description>

      <title>Geometric monotones of violations of quantum realism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum realism, as introduced by Bilobran and Angelo [EPL 112, 40005 (2015)], states that projective measurements in quantum systems establish the reality of physical properties, even in the absence of a revealed outcome. This framework provides a nuanced perspective on the distinction between classical and quantum notions of realism, emphasizing the contextuality and complementarity inherent to quantum systems. While prior works have quantified violations of quantum realism (VQR) using measures based on entropic distances, here we extend the theoretical framework to geometric distances. Building on an informational approach, we derive geometric monotones of VQR using trace distance, Hilbert-Schmidt distance, Schatten $p$-distances, Bures, and Hellinger distances. We identify Bures and Hellinger distances as uniquely satisfying all minimal criteria for a bona fide VQR monotone. Remarkably, these distances can be expressed in terms of symmetric R\'enyi and Sandwiched R\'enyi divergences, aligning geometric and entropic approaches. Our findings suggest that the realism-information relation implies a deep connection between geometric and entropic frameworks, with only those geometric distances expressible as entropic quantities qualifying as valid monotones of VQR. This work highlights the theoretical and practical advantages of geometric distances, particularly in contexts where computational simplicity or symmetry is important.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of quantum observables over time (QOOT), an operator that jointly describes two observables at two distinct time points, as a dual of the quantum state over time formalism. We provide a full characterization of the conditions under which a QOOT can be properly defined, via a no-go theorem. We use QOOTs to establish a notion of time-reversal for generic quantum channels with respect to a reference observable, enabling the systematic construction of recovery maps that preserve the latter. These recovery maps, although generally non-physical, can be decomposed into realizable channels, enabling their application in noiseless expectation value estimation tasks. We provide explicit examples and compare our protocol with other error mitigation methods. We show that our protocol retrieves the noiseless expectation value of the reference observable and can achieve optimal sampling overhead, outperforming probabilistic error cancellation.</description>

      <title>Security and Fairness in Multi-Party Quantum Secret Sharing Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum secret sharing (QSS) is a cryptographic protocol that leverages quantum mechanics to distribute a secret among multiple parties. With respect to the classical counterpart, in QSS the secret is encoded into quantum states and shared by a dealer such that only an authorized subsets of participants, i.e., the players, can reconstruct it. Several state-of-the-art studies aim to transpose classical Secret Sharing into the quantum realm, while maintaining their reliance on traditional network topologies (e.g., star, ring, fully-connected) and require that all the n players calculate the secret. These studies exploit the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, which is a type of maximally entangled quantum state involving three or more qubits. However, none of these works account for redundancy, enhanced security/privacy features or authentication mechanisms able to fingerprint players. To address these gaps, in this paper we introduce a new concept of QSS which leans on a generic distributed quantum-network, based on a threshold scheme, where all the players collaborate also to the routing of quantum information among them. The dealer, by exploiting a custom flexible weighting system, takes advantage of a newly defined quantum Dijkstra algorithm to select the most suitable subset of t players, out of the entire set on n players, to involve in the computation. To fingerprint and authenticate users, CRYSTAL-Kyber primitives are adopted, while also protecting each player's privacy by hiding their identities. We show the effectiveness and performance of the proposed protocol by testing it against the main classical and quantum attacks, thereby improving the state-of-the-art security measures.</description>

      <title>Self-Testing Positive Operator-Valued Measurements and Certifying Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the device-independent scenario, positive operator-valued measurements (POVMs) can certify more randomness than projective measurements. This paper self-tests a three-outcome extremal qubit POVM in the X-Z plane of the Bloch sphere by achieving the maximal quantum violation of a newly constructed Bell expression C'3, adapted from the chained inequality C3. Using this POVM, approximately 1.58 bits of local randomness can be certified, which is the maximum amount of local randomness achievable by an extremal qubit POVM in this plane. Further modifications of C'3 produce C''3, enabling the self-testing of another three-outcome extremal qubit POVM. Together, these POVMs certify about 2.27 bits of global randomness. Both local and global randomness surpass the limitations certified from projective measurements. Additionally, the Navascu\'es-Pironio-Ac\'in hierarchy is employed to compare the lower bounds on global randomness certified by C3 and several other inequalities. As the extent of violation increases, C3 demonstrates superior performance in randomness certification.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Neural Galerkin Method for Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a classical computational method for quantum dynamics that relies on a global-in-time variational principle. Unlike conventional time-stepping approaches, our scheme computes the entire state trajectory over a finite time window by minimizing a physically motivated loss function that enforces the Schr\"odinger's equation. The variational state is parametrized with a Galerkin-inspired ansatz based on a time-dependent linear combination of time-independent Neural Quantum States. This structure effectively captures the relevant dynamical frequencies in the time evolution and is particularly well-suited for exploring long-time dynamics. We showcase the method's effectiveness by simulating global quantum quenches in the paradigmatic Transverse-Field Ising model in both 1D and 2D. By extracting the asymptotic long-time evolution, we uncover signatures of ergodicity breaking and absence of thermalization in two dimensions. Overall, the method presented here shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art time-dependent variational approaches and highlight the potential to explore previously inaccessible dynamical regimes of strongly interacting quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: The processing unit of a solid-state quantum computer consists in an array of coupled qubits, each locally driven with on-chip microwave lines that route carefully-engineered control signals to the qubits in order to perform logical operations. This approach to quantum computing comes with two major problems. On the one hand, it greatly hampers scalability towards fault-tolerant quantum computers, which are estimated to need a number of qubits -- and, therefore driving lines -- on the order of $10^6$. On the other hand, these lines are a source of electromagnetic noise, exacerbating frequency crowding and crosstalk, while also contributing to power dissipation inside the dilution fridge. We here tackle these two overwhelming challenges by presenting a novel quantum processing unit (QPU) for a universal quantum computer which is globally (rather than locally) driven. Our QPU relies on a string of superconducting qubits with always-on ZZ interactions, enclosed into a closed geometry, which we dub ``conveyor belt''. Strikingly, this architecture requires only $\mathcal{O}(N)$ physical qubits to run a computation on $N$ computational qubits, in contrast to previous $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ proposals for global quantum computation. Additionally, universality is achieved via the implementation of single-qubit gates and a one-shot Toffoli gate. The ability to perform multi-qubit operations in a single step could vastly improve the fidelity and execution time of many algorithms.</description>

      <title>Fast single-qubit gates for continuous dynamically decoupled systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental noise that couples longitudinally to a quantum system dephases that system and can limit its coherence lifetime. Performance using quantum superposition in clocks, information processors, communication networks, and sensors depends on careful state and external field selection to lower sensitivity to longitudinal noise. In many cases time varying external control fields--such as the Hahn echo sequence originally developed for nuclear magnetic resonance applications--can passively correct for longitudinal errors. There also exist continuous versions of passive correction called continuous dynamical decoupling (CDD), or spin-locking depending on context. However, treating quantum systems under CDD as qubits has not been well explored. Here, we develop universal single-qubit gates that are ``fast'' relative to perturbative Rabi gates and applicable to any CDD qubit architecture. We demonstrate single-qubit gates with fidelity $\mathcal{F}=0.9947(1)$ on a frequency tunable CDD transmon superconducting circuit operated where it is strongly sensitive to longitudinal noise, thus establishing this technique as a potentially useful tool for operating qubits in applications requiring high fidelity under non-ideal conditions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum network for sensing in the acoustic frequency range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultimate limits for sensing of fields and forces are set by the quantum noise of a sensor. Entanglement allows for suppression of such noise and for achieving sensitivity beyond standard quantum limits. Applicability of quantum optical sensing is often restricted by fixed wavelengths of available photonic quantum sources. Another ubiquitous limitation is associated with challenges of achieving quantum-noise-limited sensitivity in the acoustic noise frequency range relevant for a number of applications. Here we demonstrate a novel tool for broadband quantum sensing by quantum state processing that can be applied to a wide range of the optical spectrum, and by suppressing quantum noise over an octave in the acoustic frequency range. An atomic spin ensemble in the quantum regime is strongly coupled to one of the tunable frequency modes of an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) source of light. The other EPR mode of light, entangled with the first one, is tuned to a disparate wavelength. Engineering the spin ensemble to act as a negative- or positive-mass oscillator we demonstrate frequency-dependent, entanglement-enabled quantum noise reduction for measurements at the disparate wavelength. The tunability of the spin ensemble allows to target quantum noise in a variety of systems with dynamics ranging from kHz to MHz. As an example of the broadband quantum noise reduction in the acoustic frequency range, we analyse the applicability of our approach to state-of-the-art gravitational wave detectors. Other possible applications include continuous-variable quantum repeaters and distributed quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Many-body dynamics with explicitly time-dependent neural quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of many-body quantum systems is a significant challenge, especially in higher dimensions where entanglement grows rapidly. Neural quantum states (NQS) offer a promising tool for representing quantum wavefunctions, but their application to time evolution faces scaling challenges. We introduce the time-dependent neural quantum state (t-NQS), a novel approach incorporating explicit time dependence into the neural network ansatz. This framework optimizes a single, time-independent set of parameters to solve the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation across an entire time interval. We detail an autoregressive, attention-based transformer architecture and techniques for extending the model's applicability. To benchmark and demonstrate our method, we simulate quench dynamics in the 2D transverse field Ising model and the time-dependent preparation of the 2D antiferromagnetic state in a Heisenberg model, demonstrating state of the art performance, scalability, and extrapolation to unseen intervals. These results establish t-NQS as a powerful framework for exploring quantum dynamics in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnons can endow quantum devices with new functionalities. Assessing their potential requires precise characterization of magnon properties. Here, we use a superconducting qubit to probe magnons in a ferrimagnet over a range of about 2000 excitations. Using qubit control and parametrically induced qubit-magnon interactions we demonstrate few-excitation sensitive detection of magnons and are able to accurately resolve their decay. These results introduce quantum circuits as high-dynamic range probes for magnons and provide an avenue toward sensitive detection of nontrivial magnon dynamics.</description>

      <title>Learning Equivariant Maps with Variational Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric quantum machine learning uses the symmetries inherent in data to design tailored machine learning tasks with reduced search space dimension. The field has been well-studied recently in an effort to avoid barren plateau issues while improving the accuracy of quantum machine learning models. This work explores the related problem of learning an equivariant map given two unitary representations of a finite group, which in turn allows the symmetric encoding of the data to be learned rather than simply required. Moreover, this procedure allows the learning of covariant quantum channels, which are an essential tool in quantum information theory. We demonstrate the feasibility of this task and give examples to illustrate the procedure.</description>

      <title>Harvesting stabilizer entropy and non-locality from a quantum field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The harvesting of quantum resources from the vacuum state of a quantum field is a central topic in relativistic quantum information. While several proposals for the harvesting of entanglement from the quantum vacuum exist, less attention has been paid to other quantum resources, such as non-stabilizerness, commonly dubbed magic and quantified by the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE). In this work, we show how to harvest SRE from the vacuum state of a massless field, using accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detectors in Minkowski spacetime. In particular, one can harvest a particular non-local form of SRE that cannot be erased by local operations. We conclude our work with an analysis of the CHSH inequalities: one cannot extract a violation from the quantum field unless these resources are already there.</description>

      <title>Establishing a New Benchmark in Quantum Computational Advantage with 105-qubit Zuchongzhi 3.0 Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the relentless pursuit of quantum computational advantage, we present a significant advancement with the development of Zuchongzhi 3.0. This superconducting quantum computer prototype, comprising 105 qubits, achieves high operational fidelities, with single-qubit gates, two-qubit gates, and readout fidelity at 99.90%, 99.62% and 99.18%, respectively. Our experiments with an 83-qubit, 32-cycle random circuit sampling on Zuchongzhi 3.0 highlight its superior performance, achieving one million samples in just a few hundred seconds. This task is estimated to be infeasible on the most powerful classical supercomputers, Frontier, which would require approximately $6.4\times 10^9$ years to replicate the task. This leap in processing power places the classical simulation cost six orders of magnitude beyond Google's SYC-67 and SYC-70 experiments [Nature 634, 328(2024)], firmly establishing a new benchmark in quantum computational advantage. Our work not only advances the frontiers of quantum computing but also lays the groundwork for a new era where quantum processors play an essential role in tackling sophisticated real-world challenges.</description>

      <title>Uniform response theory of non-Hermitian systems: Non-Hermitian physics beyond the exceptional point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems display remarkable response effects that reflect a variety of distinct spectral scenarios, such as exceptional points where the eigensystem becomes defective. However, present frameworks treat the different scenarios as separate cases, following the singular mathematical change between the spectral decompositions from one scenario to another. This not only complicates the coherent description near the spectral singularities where the response qualitatively changes, but also impedes the application to practical systems. Here we develop a general response theory of non-Hermitian systems that uniformly applies across all spectral scenarios. We unravel this response by formulating uniform expansions of the spectral quantization condition and Green's function, where both expansions exclusively involve directly calculable data from the Hamiltonian. This data smoothly varies with external parameters as spectral singularities are approached, and nevertheless captures the qualitative differences of the response in these scenarios. We furthermore present two direct applications of this framework. Firstly, we determine the precise conditions for spectral degeneracies of geometric multiplicity greater than unity, as well as the perturbative behavior around these cases. Secondly, we formulate a hierarchy of spectral response strengths that varies continuously across all parameter space, and thereby also reliably determines the response strength of exceptional points. Finally, we demonstrate both generally and in concrete examples that the previously inaccessible scenarios of higher geometric multiplicity result in unique variants of super-Lorentzian response. Our approach widens the scope of non-Hermitian response theory to capture all spectral scenarios on an equal and uniform footing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computation requires high-fidelity qubit readout, preserving the quantum state. In the case of superconducting (SC) qubits, readout is typically performed using a complex analog experimental setup operated at room temperature, which poses significant technological and economic barriers to large system scalability. An alternative approach is to perform a cryogenic on-chip qubit readout based on a Josephson Digital Phase Detector (JDPD): a flux switchable device capable of digitizing the phase sign of a coherent input. The readout operation includes the flux excitation of the JDPD to evolve from a single to a double-minima potential. In this work, the effect of the flux bias characteristics on the JDPD performances is studied numerically. To meet the identified requirements that maximize detection fidelity and tackle the engineering challenges, a cryogenic on-chip Single Flux Quantum based flux bias driver is proposed and discussed.</description>

      <title>The isoholonomic inequality and tight implementations of holonomic quantum gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In holonomic quantum computation, quantum logic gates are realized by cyclic parallel transport of the computational space. The resulting quantum gate corresponds to the holonomy associated with the closed path traced by the computational space. The isoholonomic inequality for gates establishes a fundamental lower bound on the path length of such cyclic transports, which depends only on the spectrum of the holonomy, that is, the eigenvalues of the implemented quantum gate. The isoholonomic inequality also gives rise to an estimate of the minimum time required to execute a holonomic quantum gate, underscoring the central role of the inequality in quantum computation. In this paper, we show that when the codimension of the computational space is sufficiently large, any quantum gate can be implemented using a parallel transporting Hamiltonian in a way that saturates the isoholonomic inequality and the corresponding time estimate. We call such implementations tight. The treatment presented here is constructive and lays the foundation for the development of efficient and optimal implementation strategies in holonomic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Learning interactions between Rydberg atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulators have the potential to solve quantum many-body problems that are beyond the reach of classical computers, especially when they feature long-range entanglement. To fulfill their prospects, quantum simulators must be fully controllable, allowing for precise tuning of the microscopic physical parameters that define their implementation. We consider Rydberg-atom arrays, a promising platform for quantum simulations. Experimental control of such arrays is limited by the imprecision on the optical tweezers positions when assembling the array, hence introducing uncertainties in the simulated Hamiltonian. In this work, we introduce a scalable approach to Hamiltonian learning using graph neural networks (GNNs). We employ the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) to generate ground-state snapshots of the transverse field Ising model realized by the array, for many realizations of the Hamiltonian parameters. Correlation functions reconstructed from these snapshots serve as input data to carry out the training. We demonstrate that our GNN model has a remarkable capacity to extrapolate beyond its training domain, both regarding the size and the shape of the system, yielding an accurate determination of the Hamiltonian parameters with a minimal set of measurements. We prove a theorem establishing a bijective correspondence between the correlation functions and the interaction parameters in the Hamiltonian, which provides a theoretical foundation to our learning algorithm. Our work could open the road to feedback control of the positions of the optical tweezers, hence providing a decisive improvement of analog quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>The State Preparation of Multivariate Normal Distributions using Tree Tensor Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum state preparation of probability distributions is an important subroutine for many quantum algorithms. When embedding $D$-dimensional multivariate probability distributions by discretizing each dimension into $2^n$ points, we need a state preparation circuit comprising a total of $nD$ qubits, which is often difficult to compile. In this study, we propose a scalable method to generate state preparation circuits for $D$-dimensional multivariate normal distributions, utilizing tree tensor networks (TTN). We establish theoretical guarantees that multivariate normal distributions with 1D correlation structures can be efficiently represented using TTN. Based on these analyses, we propose a compilation method that uses automatic structural optimization to find the most efficient network structure and compact circuit. We apply our method to state preparation circuits for various high-dimensional random multivariate normal distributions. The numerical results suggest that our method can dramatically reduce the circuit depth and CNOT count while maintaining fidelity compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Noisy initial-state qubit-channel metrology with additional undesirable noisy evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider protocols for estimating the parameter in a single-parameter unital qubit channel, assuming that the available initial states are highly mixed with very low purity. We compare two protocols: one uses $n$ qubits prepared in a particular correlated input state and subsequently invokes the channel on one qubit. The other uses a single qubit and invokes the channel once. We compare the accuracy of the protocols using the quantum Fisher information for each. We extend the results of Collins [1] by allowing for additional noisy evolution on the spectator qubits in the $n$-qubit protocol. We provide simple algebraic expressions that will determine when the $n$-qubit protocol is superior and provide techniques that can alleviate certain types of noise. We show that for certain types of noisy evolution the $n$-qubit protocol will be inferior but for others it will be superior.</description>

      <title>Fitness landscape for quantum state tomography from neutron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a direct connection between static structure factors and quantum ground states for two-spin interaction Hamiltonians was proven. This suggests the possibility of quantum state tomography from neutron scattering. Here, we investigate the associated fitness landscape numerically. We find a linear relationship between the mean square distances of the structure factors and the associated state overlaps, implying a well-behaved fitness landscape. Furthermore, we find evidence suggesting that the approach can be generalized to thermal equilibrium states. We also extend the arguments to the cases of applied magnetic fields and finite clusters.</description>

      <title>Topological nature of edge states for one-dimensional systems without symmetry protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically verify and analytically prove a winding number invariant that correctly predicts the number of edge states in one-dimensional, nearest-neighbour (between unit cells), two-band models with any complex couplings and open boundaries. Our winding number uses analytical continuation of the wave-vector into the complex plane and involves two special points on the full Riemann surface band structure that correspond to bulk eigenvector degeneracies. Our invariant is invariant under unitary and similarity transforms. We emphasize that the topological criteria we propose here differ from what is traditionally defined as a topological or trivial phase in symmetryprotected classification studies. It is a broader invariant for our toy model that applies to non-zero energy edge states and its transition does not coincide with the gap closing condition. When the relevant symmetries are applied, our invariant reduces to well-known Hermitian and non-Hermitian symmetry-protected topological invariants.</description>

      <title>Bright and Purcell-enhanced single photon emission from a silicon G center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon G centers show significant promise as single photon sources in a scalable silicon platform. But these color centers have large non-radiative decay and a low Debye-Waller factor, limiting their usability in quantum applications. In this work, we demonstrate bright Purcell-enhanced emission from a silicon G center by coupling it to a nanophotonic cavity. The nanobeam cavity enhances the spontaneous emission rate of a single G center by a factor of 6, corresponding to a Purcell factor greater than 31 when accounting for decay into the phonon sideband. We obtain a spontaneous emission rate of 0.97 ns, which is the fastest single photon emission rate reported in silicon. With this radiative enhancement, we achieve an order of magnitude improvement in emitter brightness compared to previously reported values. These results pave the way for scalable quantum light sources on a silicon photonic chip.</description>

      <title>Fermi Velocity Dependent Critical Current in Ballistic Bilayer Graphene Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform transport measurements on proximitized, ballistic, bilayer graphene Josephson junctions (BGJJs) in the intermediate-to-long junction regime ($L&gt;\xi$). We measure the device's differential resistance as a function of bias current and gate voltage for a range of different temperatures. The extracted critical current $I_{C}$ follows an exponential trend with temperature: $ \exp(-k_{B} T/ \delta E)$. Here $\delta E = \hbar \nu_F /2\pi L $: an expected trend for intermediate-to-long junctions. From $\delta E$, we determine the Fermi velocity of the bilayer graphene, which is found to increase with gate voltage. Simultaneously, we show the carrier density dependence of $\delta E$, which is attributed to the quadratic dispersion of bilayer graphene. This is in contrast to single layer graphene Josephson junctions, where $\delta E$ and the Fermi velocity are independent of the carrier density. The carrier density dependence in BGJJs allows for additional tuning parameters in graphene-based Josephson Junction devices.</description>

      <title>Entanglement induced by Heisenberg exchange between an electron in a nested quantum dot and a qubit with relative motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a nested quantum dot structure for improved control of entanglement induced by the Heisenberg exchange between an electron and a qubit with relative motion. The entanglement is quantified by the mutual information (MI). The electron, initially prepared in the ground state, generally produces greater entanglement when excited to the scattering state compared to remaining in the bound state. In the bound state, the final entanglement oscillates as a function of the qubit speed and can be tuned accordingly. In the case of long-range interaction, the normalized exchange distribution leads to substantial final entanglement, independent of the qubit moving direction, indicating that even very weak but prolonged exchange can still generate significant entanglement. In the case of short-range interaction, different moving directions lead to varying MI values. We also consider the scenario without the nested dot and find that the same maximum (among all times) MI is pre-determined solely by the initial angle between the spins. In this case, the entanglement exhibits different growth characteristics during different phases. The saturation of the MI mimics that of a strict zero-dimensional quantum dot, where exchange and time are combined into a single parameter, the amount of interaction.</description>

Abstract: Lieb and Solovej proved that, for the symmetric $SU(N)$ representations, the corresponding Wehrl-type entropy is minimized by symmetric coherent states. However, the uniqueness of the minimizers remained an open problem when $N\geq 3$. In this note we complete the proof of the Wehrl entropy conjecture for such representations, by showing that symmetric coherent states are, in fact, the only minimizers. We also provide an application to the maximum concentration of holomorphic polynomials.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Magnon-Magnon Coupling and Its Dynamic Control in Nanomagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid magnonics, exploring the coupling between magnons and quantum systems, is an exciting field for developing next-generation information technologies. Achieving a strong and tunable magnon-magnon coupling (MMC) in confined nanomagnets is crucial for the on-chip integration of these hybrid systems and advancing the field. In this work, we numerically investigate the interactions between different magnon modes excited within an elliptical magnonic nano-disc (EMND), demonstrating an anti-crossing effect in the dispersion spectra. A comprehensive theoretical framework was presented that explains this anti-crossing phenomenon as a result of MMC and provide estimates for the strength of the coupling (g). Furthermore, we show that this intermodal coupling can be tuned from a strong coupling regime (g = 300 MHz) to a weak coupling regime by varying the direction of the external magnetic field and the intrinsic properties of the EMND. Our combined numerical and theoretical findings offer new insights into MMC, significantly advancing the field of quantum magnonics and magnon-based quantum information technology.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of Rydberg atoms in a two-leg rectangular ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the density matrix renormalization group algorithm, we map the ground-state phase diagram of a two-leg Rydberg ladder array with lattice spacings $a_x=2a_y$. We identify various density wave phases that spontaneously break the translational symmetry or the top-bottom reflection symmetry within the ladder. By increasing the laser detuning from zero, where the system is in a disordered phase that preserves all symmetries, we observe density wave orders with spontaneous breaking of the translational $\mathbb{Z}_p$ symmetries at intermediate detuning values, while the reflection symmetry is preserved. These orders exhibit nonzero bond orders with positive expectation values on every $p$th rung, thus labeled as $\mathbb{Z}_p^+$ phases. At larger detuning values, another spontaneous breaking of the reflection symmetry, which disrupted the bond orders on the rungs, occurs via an Ising phase transition. In these phases, either the top or the bottom site is occupied in a staggered way on every $p$th rung, breaking the translational $\mathbb{Z}_{2p}$ symmetry, thus labeled by $\mathbb{Z}_{2p}$ phases. We locate and characterize the 3-state Potts point and Ashkin-Teller point along the commensurate lines, as well as the direct chiral phase transitions between the disordered phase and the $\mathbb{Z}_p^+$ ($p = 3, 4$) phases. Critical exponents $\nu$ and $z$ are calculated for both conformal and chiral phase transition points. We finally identify two types of floating phases in the phase diagram: one characterized by a quasi-long-range incommensurate bond-order wave, and the other by a quasi-long-range incommensurate wave of density differences in the rungs. Our work motivates further applications of Rydberg atom arrays in quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic forces from reactive molecular orbitals driving chemical reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study offers a physics-based framework for understanding chemical reactions, unveiling the pivotal role of the occupied reactive orbital (ORO), the most stabilized occupied molecular orbital during a reaction, in driving atomic nuclei along the reaction pathway via electrostatic forces. We show that these electrostatic forces are governed by the negative gradient of orbital energy, establishing a direct link between molecular orbital energy variations and nuclear motion. The forces generated by OROs, termed reactive-orbital-based electrostatic forces (ROEFs), were systematically analyzed across 48 representative reactions. Our findings reveal that reactions can be classified into four distinct types, with two dominant types emerging: those that maintain reaction-direction ROEFs either from the early stages or immediately preceding the transition state. These ROEFs carve distinct grooves along the intrinsic reaction coordinates on the potential energy surface, shaping the reaction pathway. Notably, ORO variations align directly with the curly arrow diagrams widely employed in organic chemistry, bridging the curly arrow-like representation of electron transfer with the rigorous potential energy surface framework. This connection highlights the integration of electronic and nuclear motion theories, offering a unified perspective on the forces that drive chemical transformations. By linking orbital energy variations to nuclear motions, this study establishes a robust framework for understanding the interplay between electronic structure and reaction mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Computing (QC) offers outstanding potential for molecular characterization and drug discovery, particularly in solving complex properties like the Ground State Energy (GSE) of biomolecules. However, QC faces challenges due to computational noise, scalability, and system complexity. This work presents a hybrid framework combining Machine Learning (ML) techniques with quantum algorithms$-$Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), Hartree-Fock (HF), and Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)$-$to improve GSE predictions for large molecules. Three datasets (chemical descriptors, Coulomb matrices, and a hybrid combination) were prepared using molecular features from PubChem. These datasets trained XGBoost (XGB), Random Forest (RF), and LightGBM (LGBM) models. XGB achieved the lowest Relative Error (RE) of $4.41 \pm 11.18\%$ on chemical descriptors, outperforming RF ($5.56 \pm 11.66\%$) and LGBM ($5.32 \pm 12.87\%$). HF delivered exceptional precision for small molecules ($0.44 \pm 0.66\% RE$), while a near-linear correlation between GSE and molecular electron count provided predictive shortcuts. This study demonstrates that integrating QC and ML enhances scalability for molecular energy predictions and lays the foundation for scaling QC molecular simulations to larger systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11444v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the trans-series structure of a quantum mechanical system originating from a Lie-algebraic K\"ahler sigma model with multiple right-handed chiral fermions, extending previous results for the standard onecomplex projective ($\mathbb{CP}^1$) model [1],[2] to its deformed counterpart. We identify and analyze saddle point solutions and examine their contributions within the perturbative expansions of the ground state energy, revealing that the ambiguity structure observed in the $\mathbb{CP}^1$ model persists in the deformed model as well. Additionally, we explore the role of the elongation parameter and its potential impact on higher-loop corrections, and propose that it becomes relevant in shaping the system's quantum behavior from the three-loop level. This verifies that the trans-series framework provides a comprehensive approach to capturing the structure of quantum fluctuations and ambiguities in these deformed sigma models.</description>

      <title>Grating magneto-optical trap of cesium atoms with an additional retroreflected laser beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A magneto-optical trap of cesium atoms was generated by applying a circularly polarized cooling laser beam onto a reflective two-dimensional diffraction grating with an aperture and by retroreflecting the incident beam passing through the aperture while reversing the circular polarization. The cooling laser beams comprised the incident, retroreflected, and four diagonally diffracted beams at an angle of 50{\deg}. The intensity of the retroreflected beam was carefully adjusted to balance the radiation forces acting on the atoms. Despite the challenges posed by cesium atoms with high nuclear spin, a significant number of cold atoms ($7.0 {\times} 10^6$) were captured when the detuning and power of the incident beam were -10 MHz and 131 mW, respectively, with the intensity of the retroreflected beam set to 69 % of that of the incident beam. The importance of the retroreflected beam in the trapping process was highlighted when the intensity ratio was reduced to 24 %, resulting in the absence of trapped atoms. This underscores the significance of the retroreflected beam in the trapping process. Notably, the distribution of the cold atom cloud differed from other magneto-optical traps, as it was not centered in the region where the cooling beams overlapped. Instead, numerous cold atoms were observed when the cloud was positioned near the apex closer to the grating side and an edge line of the overlapping region. Therefore, trapping can be achieved with the assistance of attractive dipole forces exerted by the diffracted beams, which exhibits high intensities at these positions.</description>

      <title>SFFT-based Homogenization: Using Tensor Trains to Enhance FFT-Based Homogenization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homogenization is a key technique for approximating the macroscopic properties of materials with microscale heterogeneity. The FFT-based Homogenization method has gained widespread usage due to its computational efficiency and accuracy in handling complex microstructures. However, despite its advantages, the method is limited by speed and memory constraints, particularly when applied to high-resolution discretizations. These limitations affect its scalability and efficiency, especially in large-scale simulations or when dealing with highly detailed microstructures. These challenges arise from the fundamental reliance on the Fast Fourier Transform, which imposes inherent restrictions on further advancements. In this paper, we propose a novel SFFT-based Homogenization algorithm that utilizes a Quantized Tensor Train variant of the Quantum Fourier Transform. This method is tailored to the geometry under consideration and offers significant improvements in time complexity and memory efficiency compared to the traditional FFT-based approach while remaining executable on classical hardware. The method is applicable only if a suitable Quantized Tensor Train representation exists for the stiffness operator associated with the underlying geometry.</description>

The gate-tunable superconducting transmon qubit (gatemon) is the paradigmatic example of such a superconducting circuit. However, gatemons typically suffer from unstable and hysteretic qubit frequencies with respect to the applied gate voltage and reduced coherence times. Here we develop methods for characterizing these challenges in gatemons and deploy these methods to compare the impact of shunt capacitor designs on gatemon performance. Our results indicate a strong frequency- and design-dependent behavior of the qubit stability, hysteresis, and dephasing times. Moreover, we achieve highly reliable tuning of the qubit frequency with 1 MHz precision over a range of several GHz, along with improved stability in grounded gatemons compared to gatemons with a floating capacitor design.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced phase transitions and critical phases in nonreciprocal non-Hermitian quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian phenomena, such as exceptional points, non-Hermitian skin effects, and topologically nontrivial phases, have attracted continued attention. In this work, we reveal how interactions and nonreciprocal hopping could collectively influence the behavior of two interacting bosons on quasiperiodic lattices. Focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model with Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper quasiperiodic modulations and hopping asymmetry, we discover that the interaction could enlarge the localization transition point of the noninteracting system into a critical phase, in which localized doublons formed by bosonic pairs can coexist with delocalized states. Under the open boundary condition, the bosonic doublons could further show non-Hermitian skin effects, realizing doublon condensation at the edges, and their direction of skin-localization can be flexibly tuned by the hopping parameters. A framework is developed to characterize the spectral, localization, and topological transitions accompanying these phenomena. Our work advances the understanding of localization and topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly in relation to multiparticle interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum sampling on a quantum annealer for large volumes in the strong coupling limit for gauge group U(3)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous studies [1, 2], we confirmed that a quantum annealer can be used for importance sampling of gauge theories. In this paper, we extend the previous results to larger 2-dimensional and 4-dimensional lattices to generate ensembles for U(3) gauge theory in the strong coupling limit. We make use of the D-Wave quantum annealer to generate histograms for sub-lattices, and use the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to determine thermodynamic observables and their dependence on the physical parameters on large volumes. We benchmark our results to those obtained from classical Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Emptiness Instanton in Quantum Polytropic Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emptiness formation problem is addressed for a one-dimensional quantum polytropic gas characterized by an arbitrary polytropic index $\gamma$, which defines the equation of state $P \sim \rho^\gamma$, where $P$ is the pressure and $\rho$ is the density. The problem involves determining the probability of the spontaneous formation of an empty interval in the ground state of the gas. In the limit of a macroscopically large interval, this probability is dominated by an instanton configuration. By solving the hydrodynamic equations in imaginary time, we derive the analytic form of the emptiness instanton. This solution is expressed as an integral representation analogous to those used for correlation functions in Conformal Field Theory. Prominent features of the spatiotemporal profile of the instanton are obtained directly from this representation.</description>

      <title>The fate of Wannier-Stark localization and skin effect in periodically driven non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eigenstates of one-dimensional Hermitian and non-Hermitian tight-binding systems (in the presence/absence of quasiperiodic potential) and an external electric field undergo complete localization with equally spaced eigenenergies, known as the Wannier-Stark (WS) localization. In this work, we demonstrate that when the electric field is slowly modulated with time, new non-trivial phases with multiple mobility edges emerge in place of WS localized phase, which persists up to a certain strength of the non-Hermiticity. On the other hand, for a large driving frequency, we retrieve the usual sharp delocalization-localization transition to the usual (no WS) localized phase, similar to the static non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper type without any electric field. This vanishing of WS localization can be attributed solely to the time-periodic drive and occurs irrespective of the non-Hermiticity. Interestingly, under the open boundary condition (OBC), we find that contrary to the undriven systems where an external electric field destroys the SE completely, the SE appears in certain regime of the parameter space when the electric field is temporally driven. This appearance of SE is closely related to the absence of extended unitarity. In addition, in the presence of the drive, the skin states are found to be multifractal, contrary to its usual nature in such non-Hermitian systems. An in-depth understanding about the behavior of the states in the driven system is established from the long-time dynamics of an initial excitation.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Neutrino Lasers from Radioactive Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superradiance emerges from collective spontaneous emission in optically pumped gases, and is characterized by photon emission enhancements of up to $\frac{1}{4}N^{2}$ in an $N$ atom system. The gain mechanism derives from correlations developed within the decay medium rather than from stimulated emission as in lasing, so analog of this process should be possible for fermionic final states. We introduce here the concept of superradiant neutrino emission from a radioactive Bose Einstein condensate, which can form the basis for a superradiant neutrino laser. A plausible experimental realization based on a condensate of electron-capture isotope $^{83}$Rb could exhibit effective radioactive decay rates accelerated from 82 days to minutes in viably sized rubidium condensates of $10^{6}$ atoms.</description>

      <title>Quark and gluon entanglement in the proton based on a light-front Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given that the wave function of a proton can be derived relativistically and nonperturbatively from a light-front quantized Hamiltonian, investigating the quantum correlation between quarks and gluons offers a novel perspective on the internal structure of partons within a proton. In this work, we address this topic by computing the spin and longitudinal momentum entanglement of each parton inside the proton. The utilized wave functions are generated using Basis Light-front Quantization (BLFQ), incorporating both the valence quarks and one dynamical gluon Fock sectors, $\left|qqq\right\rangle$ and $\left|qqq\right\rangle +\left|qqqg\right\rangle$. Our calculations indicate that the dynamical gluon significantly enhances entanglement among the proton's partons. Additionally, we examine the spin entanglement of quarks and gluons at fixed values of longitudinal momentum fraction, revealing that the presence of a gluon may amplify the informational exchanges between quarks. Finally, these findings suggest the potential for experimental verification of the entanglement between partons by measuring parton helicity distributions in the proton.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider two dimensional quantum system with an infinite waveguide of the width $d$ and a transversally invariant profile. Furthermore, we assume that at a distant $\rho$ there is a perturbation defined by the Kato measure. We show that, under certain conditions, the resolvent of the Hamiltonian has the second sheet pole which reproduces the resonance at $z(\rho)$ with the asymptotics $z(\rho)=\mathcal E_{\beta ; n}+\mathcal O \Big(\frac{ \exp(-\sqrt{2 |\mathcal E_{\beta ;n}| } \rho )}{\rho }\Big)$ for $\rho$ large and with the resonant energy $\mathcal E_{\beta ;n}$. Moreover, we show that the imaginary component of $z(\rho)$ satisfies Fermi's golden rule which we explicitly derive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement Hamiltonian for free-fermion chains with a particular form of inhomogeneity. The hopping amplitudes and chemical potentials are chosen such that the single-particle eigenstates are related to discrete orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme. Due to the bispectral properties of these functions, one can construct an operator which commutes exactly with the entanglement Hamiltonian and corresponds to a linear or parabolic deformation of the physical one. We show that this deformation is interpreted as a local inverse temperature and can be obtained in the continuum limit via methods of conformal field theory. Using this prediction, the properly rescaled eigenvalues of the commuting operator are found to provide a very good approximation of the entanglement spectrum and entropy.</description>

      <title>QG from SymQRG: AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ Correspondence as Topological Symmetry-Preserving Quantum RG Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By analyzing the non-perturbative RG flows that explicitly preserve given symmetries, we demonstrate that they can be expressed as quantum path integrals of the $\textit{SymTFT}$ in one higher dimension. When the symmetries involved include Virasoro defect lines, such as in the case of $T\bar{T}$ deformations, the RG flow corresponds to the 3D quantum gravitational path integral. For each 2D CFT, we identify a corresponding ground state of the SymTFT, from which the Wheeler-DeWitt equation naturally emerges as a non-perturbative constraint. These observations are summarized in the slogan: $\textbf{SymQRG = QG}$. The recently proposed exact discrete formulation of Liouville theory in [1] allows us to identify a universal SymQRG kernel, constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols associated with $U_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$, which manifests itself as an exact and analytical 3D background-independent MERA-type holographic tensor network. Many aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence, including the factorization puzzle, admit a natural interpretation within this framework. This provides the first evidence suggesting that there is a universal holographic principle encompassing AdS/CFT and topological holography. We propose that the non-perturbative AdS/CFT correspondence is a $\textit{maximal}$ form of topological holography.</description>

Abstract: The von Neumann entropy of a $k$-body reduced density matrix $\gamma_k$ quantifies the entanglement between $k$ quantum particles and the remaining ones. In this short paper, we rigorously prove general properties of this entanglement entropy as a function of $k$: it is concave for all $1\leq k\leq N$ and non-decreasing until the midpoint $k\leq \lfloor N/2\rfloor$. The results hold for indistinguishable quantum particles and are independent of the statistics.</description>

      <title>Quantum open system identification via global optimization: Optimally accurate Markovian models of open systems from time-series data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.17164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate models of the dynamics of quantum circuits are essential for optimizing and advancing quantum devices. Since first-principles models of environmental noise and dissipation in real quantum systems are often unavailable, deriving accurate models from measured time-series data is critical. However, identifying open quantum systems poses significant challenges: powerful methods from systems engineering can perform poorly beyond weak damping (as we show) because they fail to incorporate essential constraints required for quantum evolution (e.g., positivity). Common methods that can include these constraints are typically multi-step, fitting linear models to physically grounded master equations, often resulting in non-convex functions in which local optimization algorithms get stuck in local extrema (as we show). In this work, we solve these problems by formulating quantum system identification directly from data as a polynomial optimization problem, enabling the use of recently developed global optimization methods. These methods are essentially guaranteed to reach global optima, allowing us for the first time to efficiently obtain the most accurate Markovian model for a given system. In addition to its practical importance, this allows us to take the error of these Markovian models as an alternative (operational) measure of the non-Markovianity of a system. We test our method with the spin-boson model -- a two-level system coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators -- for which we obtain the exact evolution using matrix-product-state techniques. We show that polynomial optimization using moment/sum-of-squares approaches significantly outperforms traditional optimization algorithms, and we show that even for strong damping Lindblad-form master equations can provide accurate models of the spin-boson system.</description>

      <title>Fully and partially distributed Quantum Generalized Benders Decomposition for Unit Commitment Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A series of hybrid quantum-classical generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) algorithms are proposed to address unit commitment (UC) problems under centralized, distributed, and partially distributed frameworks. In the centralized approach, the quantum GBD transforms the master problem (MP) into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization form suitable for quantum computing. For distributed systems, the distributed consensus quantum GBD employs an average consensus strategy to reformulate subproblems into local subproblems. By leveraging the dual information, local cutting planes are constructed to decompose the MP into local master problems (LMPs). This approach reduces the qubit overhead and addresses the partitioning requirements. The consensus-inspired quantum GBD (CIQGBD) and its partially distributed variant, D-CIQGBD are proposed based on optimizing the allocation of relaxation variables directly, the algorithms construct more rational cutting planes, thereby enhancing the minimum eigenenergy gap of the system Hamiltonian during quantum annealing and improving the computational efficiency. Extensive experiments under various UC scenarios validate the performance of the above-mentioned hybrid algorithms. Compared to the classical solver Gurobi, D-CIQGBD demonstrates a speed advantage in solving the security-constrained UC problem on the IEEE-RTS 24-bus system. These results provide new perspectives on leveraging quantum computing for the distributed optimization of power systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an innovative, platform-independent concept for multiparameter sensing where the measurable parameters are in series, or cascaded, enabling measurements as a function of position. With temporally resolved detection, we show that squeezing can give a quantum enhancement in sensitivity over that of classical states by a factor of $e^{2r}$, where $r \approx 1$ is the squeezing parameter. As an example, we have modeled an interferometer that senses multiple phase shifts along the same path, demonstrating a maximal quantum advantage by combining a coherent state with squeezed vacuum. Further classical modeling with up to 100 phases shows linear scaling potential for adding nodes to the sensor. The approach represents a new paradigm in multiparameter quantum metrology, and can be applied to remote sensing, geophysical surveying, and infrastructure monitoring.</description>

Abstract: Semidefinite programs are convex optimisation problems involving a linear objective function and a domain of positive semidefinite matrices. Over the last two decades, they have become an indispensable tool in quantum information science. Many otherwise intractable fundamental and applied problems can be successfully approached by means of relaxation to a semidefinite program. Here, we review such methodology in the context of quantum correlations. We discuss how the core idea of semidefinite relaxations can be adapted for a variety of research topics in quantum correlations, including nonlocality, quantum communication, quantum networks, entanglement, and quantum cryptography.</description>

Abstract: Quantum correlations between measurements of separated observers are crucial for applications like randomness generation and key distribution. Although device-independent security can be certified with minimal assumptions, current protocols have limited performances. Here, we exploit sequential measurements, defined with a precise temporal order, to enhance performances by reusing quantum states. We provide a geometric perspective and a general mathematical framework, analytically proving a Tsirelson-like boundary for sequential quantum correlations, which represents a trade-off in nonlocality shared by sequential users. This boundary is advantageous for secure quantum randomness generation, certifying maximum bits per state with one remote and two sequential parties, even if one sequential user shares no nonlocality. Our simple qubit protocol reaches this boundary, and numerical analysis shows improved robustness under realistic noise. A photonic implementation confirms feasibility and robustness. This study advances understanding of sequential quantum correlations and offers insights for efficient device-independent protocols.</description>

      <title>Parallel variational quantum algorithms with gradient-informed restart to speed up optimisation in the presence of barren plateaus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the Fleming-Viot stochastic process, we propose a parallel implementation of variational quantum algorithms with the aim of reducing the time spent by the algorithm in barren plateaus, where optimization direction is unclear. In the Fleming-Viot tradition, parallel searches are called particles. In the proposed approach, the search by a Fleming-Viot particle is stopped when it encounters a region where the gradient is too small or noisy, suggesting a barren plateau area. The stopped particle continues the search after being regenerated at another location of the parameter space, potentially taking the exploration away from barren plateaus. We first analyze the behavior of the Fleming-Viot particles from a theoretical standpoint. We show that, when simulated annealing optimizers are used as particles, the Fleming-Viot system is expected to find the global optimum faster than a single simulated annealing optimizer, with a relative efficiency that increases proportionally to the percentage of barren plateaus in the domain. This result is corroborated by numerical experiments carried out on synthetic problems as well as on instances of the Max-Cut problem, which show that our method performs better than plain simulated annealing when large barren plateaus are present in the domain.</description>

      <title>Purely quantum algorithms for calculating determinant and inverse of matrix and solving linear algebraic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16619v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose quantum algorithms that are fundamentally quantum in nature for the computation of the determinant and inverse of an $(N-1) \times (N-1)$ matrix, with a computational depth of $O(N^2 \log N)$. This approach is a straightforward modification of the existing algorithm for determining the determinant of an $N \times N$ matrix, which operates with a depth of $O(N \log^2 N)$. The core concept involves encoding each row of the matrix into a pure state of a quantum system. In addition, we use the representation of the elements of the inverse matrix in terms of algebraic complements. This algorithm, in conjunction with the matrix multiplication algorithm discussed in the appendix, facilitates solving systems of linear algebraic equations with a depth of $O(N \log^2 N)$. The measurement of the ancilla state yielding an output of 1 occurs with a probability of approximately $2^{-O(N \log N)}$, and eliminates the extraneous data generated during the computation. We provide suitable circuit designs for all three algorithms, each estimated to require $O(N \log N)$ in terms of space, specifically the number of qubits utilized in the circuit.</description>

Abstract: Multimode squeezed light is an increasingly popular tool in photonic quantum technologies, including sensing, imaging, and computation. Meanwhile, the existing methods of its characterization are technically complicated, and in the best case, deal with a single mode at a time. Here, we demonstrate experimentally how the squeezing can be measured in multiple spatial modes simultaneously, using optical parametric amplification and direct detection followed by modal decomposition based on spatial intensity correlations. We apply this method to a multimode squeezed vacuum generated via high-gain parametric down-conversion. We measure the degrees of squeezing and anti-squeezing for eight strongest spatial modes, obtaining highest squeezing and anti-squeezing values of $-5.2 \pm 0.2$ dB and $8.6 \pm 0.3$ dB, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We design and implement quantum circuits for the simulation of the one-dimensional wave equation on the Quantinuum H1-1 quantum computer. The circuit depth of our approach scales as $O(n^{2})$ for $n$ qubits representing the solution on $2^{n}$ grid points, and leads to infidelities of $O(2^{-4n} t^{2})$ for simulation time $t$ assuming smooth initial conditions. By varying the qubit count we study the interplay between the algorithmic and physical gate errors to identify the optimal working point of minimum total error. Our approach to simulating the wave equation can be used with appropriate state preparation algorithms across different quantum processors and serve as an application-oriented benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01516v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear-optics gates, the enabling tool of photonic quantum information processing, depend on indistinguishable photons, as they harness quantum interference to achieve nonlinear operations. Traditionally, meeting this criterion involves generating pure identical photons, a task that remains a significant challenge in the field. Yet, the required indistinguishability is linked to the spatial exchange symmetry of the multiphoton wavefunction and does not strictly necessitate identical photons. Here, we show that the ideal operation of two-photon gates, particularly fusion gates, can be recovered from distinguishable photons by ensuring the exchange symmetry of the input photonic state. To this end, we introduce a temporal quantum eraser between a pair of modally-impure single-photon sources, which heralds the symmetry of the generated two-photon state. We demonstrate this mechanism in two relevant platforms: parametric photon pair generation and single-photon extraction by a single quantum emitter. The ability to lift the requirement for identical photons bears considerable potential in linear-optics quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Quantum optimization with linear Ising penalty functions for customer data science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constrained combinatorial optimization problems, which are ubiquitous in industry, can be solved by quantum algorithms such as quantum annealing (QA) and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). In these quantum algorithms, constraints are typically implemented with quadratic penalty functions. This penalty method can introduce large energy scales and make interaction graphs much more dense. These effects can result in worse performance of quantum optimization, particularly on near-term devices that have sparse hardware graphs and other physical limitations. In this work, we consider linear Ising penalty functions, which are applied with local fields in the Ising model, as an alternative method for implementing constraints that makes more efficient use of physical resources. We study the behaviour of the penalty method in the context of quantum optimization for customer data science problems. Our theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of QA and the QAOA indicate that this penalty method can lead to better performance in quantum optimization than the quadratic method. However, the linear Ising penalty method is not suitable for all problems as it cannot always exactly implement the desired constraint. In cases where the linear method is not successful in implementing all constraints, we propose that schemes involving both quadratic and linear Ising penalties can be effective.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of improved quantum optimization with linear Ising penalties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard approach to encoding constraints in quantum optimization is the quadratic penalty method. Quadratic penalties introduce additional couplings and energy scales, which can be detrimental to the performance of a quantum optimizer. In quantum annealing experiments performed on a D-Wave Advantage, we explore an alternative penalty method that only involves linear Ising terms and apply it to a customer data science problem. Our findings support our hypothesis that the linear Ising penalty method should improve the performance of quantum optimization compared to using the quadratic penalty method due to its more efficient use of physical resources. Although the linear Ising penalty method is not guaranteed to exactly implement the desired constraint in all cases, it is able to do so for the majority of problem instances we consider. For problems with many constraints, where making all penalties linear is unlikely to be feasible, we investigate strategies for combining linear Ising penalties with quadratic penalties to satisfy constraints for which the linear method is not well-suited. We find that this strategy is most effective when the penalties that contribute most to limiting the dynamic range are removed.</description>

Abstract: This is the second in a series of "graphical grokking" papers in which we study how stabiliser codes can be understood using the ZX-calculus. In this paper we show that certain complex rules involving ZX-diagrams, called spider nest identities, can be captured succinctly using the scalable ZX-calculus, and all such identities can be proved inductively from a single new rule using the Clifford ZX-calculus. This can be combined with the ZX picture of CSS codes, developed in the first "grokking" paper, to give a simple characterisation of the set of all transversal diagonal gates at the third level of the Clifford hierarchy implementable in an arbitrary CSS code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Converting quantum information from stationary qubits to traveling photons enables both fast qubit initialization and efficient generation of flying qubits for redistribution of quantum information. This conversion can be performed using cavity-sideband transitions. In the fluxonium, however, direct cavity-sideband transitions are forbidden due to parity symmetry. Here we circumvent this parity selection rule by using a three-wave mixing element to couple the fluxonium to a resonator. We experimentally demonstrate a scheme for interfacing the fluxonium with traveling photons through microwave-induced parametric conversion. We perform fast reset on the fluxonium qubit, initializing it with &gt;95% ground-state population. We then implement controlled release and temporal shaping of a flying photon, useful for quantum state transfer and remote entanglement. The simplicity and flexibility of our demonstrated scheme enables fluxonium-based remote entanglement architectures.</description>

      <title>Level attraction from interference in two-tone driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent and dissipative couplings, respectively characterised by energy level repulsion and attraction, each have different applications for quantum information processing. Thus, a system in which both coherent and dissipative couplings are tunable on-demand and in-situ is tantalising. A first step towards this goal is the two-tone driving of two bosonic modes, whose experimental signature was shown to exhibit controllable level repulsion and attraction by changing the phase and amplitude of one drive. However, whether the underlying physics is that of coherent and dissipative couplings has not been clarified, and cannot be concluded solely from the measured resonances (or anti-resonances) of the system. Here, we show how the physics at play can be analysed theoretically. Combining this theory with realistic finite-element simulations, we deduce that the observation of level attraction originates from interferences due to the measurement setup, and not dissipative coupling. Beyond the clarification of a novel origin for level attraction attributed to interference, our work demonstrate how effective Hamiltonians can be derived to appropriately describe the physics.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a change of perspective on tensor network states that is defined by the computational graph of the contraction of an amplitude. The resulting class of states, which we refer to as tensor network functions, inherit the conceptual advantages of tensor network states while removing computational restrictions arising from the need to converge approximate contractions. We use tensor network functions to compute strict variational estimates of the energy on loopy graphs, analyze their expressive power for ground-states, show that we can capture aspects of volume law time evolution, and provide a mapping of general feed-forward neural nets onto efficient tensor network functions. Our work expands the realm of computable tensor networks to ones where accurate contraction methods are not available, and opens up new avenues to use tensor networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leakage out of the computational subspace is a major limitation of current state-of-the-art neutral-atom quantum computers and a significant challenge for scalable systems. In a quantum processor with cesium atoms, we demonstrate proof-of-principle circuit-based conversion of leakage errors to erasure errors via Leakage Detection Units (LDUs), which non-destructively map information about the presence or absence of the qubit onto the state of an ancilla. With a standard LDU circuit, we successfully convert leakage errors to erasure errors for all major leakage pathways while preserving the quantum information in the case that no leakage occurred. We benchmark the performance of the LDU using a three-outcome low-loss state detection method and also explore the advantages of three-outcome measurements for LDUs. We find that the LDU detects atom-loss errors with ~93.4% accuracy, limited by technical imperfections of our apparatus. We further compile and execute a SWAP LDU, wherein the roles of the original data atom and ancilla atom are exchanged under the action of the LDU, providing 'free refilling' of atoms in the case of leakage errors. This circuit-based leakage-to-erasure error conversion is a critical component of a neutral-atom quantum processor where the quantum information may significantly outlive the lifetime of any individual atom in the quantum register.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum-inspired algorithm for graph coloring problems (GCPs) that utilizes qudits in a product state, with each qudit representing a node in the graph and parameterized by d-dimensional spherical coordinates. We propose and benchmark two optimization strategies: qudit gradient descent, initiating qudits in random states and employing gradient descent to minimize a cost function, and qudit local quantum annealing, which adapts the local quantum annealing method to optimize an adiabatic transition from a tractable initial function to a problem-specific cost function. Our approaches are benchmarked against established solutions for standard GCPs, showing that our methods not only rival but frequently surpass the performance of recent state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency. The adaptability of our algorithm and its high-quality solutions, achieved with minimal computational resources, point to an advancement in the field of quantum-inspired optimization, with potential applications extending to a broad spectrum of optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Atom-mediated deterministic generation and stitching of photonic graph states</title>

Abstract: Highly-entangled multi-photon graph states are a crucial resource in photonic quantum computation and communication. Yet, the lack of photon-photon interactions makes the construction of such graph states especially challenging. Typically, these states are produced through probabilistic single-photon sources and linear-optics entangling operations that require indistinguishable photons. The resulting inefficiency of these methods necessitates a large overhead in the number of sources and operations, creating a major bottleneck in the photonic approach. Here, we show how harnessing single-atom-based photonic operations can enable deterministic generation of photonic graph states, while also lifting the requirement for photon indistinguishability. To this end, we introduce a multi-gate quantum node comprised of a single atom in a W-type level scheme coupled to an optical resonator. This configuration provides a versatile toolbox for generating graph states, allowing the operation of both the controlled-Z and SWAP photon-atom gates, as well as the deterministic generation of single photons. Furthermore, the ability to deterministically entangle photonic qubits enables expanding the generated state by stitching graphs from different devices. We investigate the implementation of this gate-based approach using $^{87}$Rb atoms and evaluate its performance through numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design Snowflake, a quantum error correction decoder that, for the surface code under circuit-level noise, is roughly 25% more accurate than the Union-Find decoder, with a better mean runtime scaling: subquadratic as opposed to cubic in the code distance. Our decoder runs in a streaming fashion and has a local implementation. In designing Snowflake, we propose a new method for general stream decoding that eliminates the processing overhead due to window overlap in existing windowing methods.</description>

      <title>Boosting the Validity of Multi-Class Quantum Outputs: Living on the Edge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) aims to use quantum computers to enhance machine learning, but it is often limited by the required number of samples due to quantum noise and statistical limits on expectation value estimates. While efforts are made to reduce quantum noise, less attention is given to boosting the quality of the discrete outputs from Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQCs) to reduce the number of samples needed to make confident predictions.
  This paper focuses on output representations in multi-class classification, introducing a new mapping of qubit measurements to edges of an n-dimensional simplex, representing independent binary decisions between each pair of classes. We describe this mapping and demonstrate how it offers a direct improvement to the number of valid circuit output samples as well as the accuracy of those outputs over one-hot encoding while advocating for few-sample accuracy as a primary goal for effective VQCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate quench dynamics of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain on the IBM quantum computers, calculating the R\'enyi entanglement entropy, the twist order parameter and the Berry phase. The latter two quantities can be deduced from a slow-twist operator defined in the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem. The R\'enyi entropy is obtained using a recently developed randomized measurement scheme. The twist order parameter and the Berry phase are measured without the need for additional gates or ancilla qubits. We consider quench protocols in which a trivial initial state evolves dynamically in time under the topological SSH Hamiltonian in the fully dimerized limit (the flat-band limit). During these quenches, there are persistent and periodic oscillations in the time evolution of both entanglement entropy and twist order parameter. Through the implementation of error mitigation techniques using a global depolarizing ansatz and postselection, our simulations on the IBM devices yield results that closely match exact solutions.</description>

      <title>Constrained Measurement Incompatibility from Generalised Contextuality of Steered Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a bipartite Bell scenario involving two local measurements per party and two outcome per measurement, the measurement incompatibility in one wing is both necessary and sufficient to reveal the nonlocality. However, such a one-to-one correspondence fails when one of the observers performs more than two measurements. In such a scenario, the measurement incompatibility is necessary but not sufficient to reveal the nonlocality. In this work, within the formalism of general probabilistic theory (GPT), we demonstrate that unlike the nonlocality, the incompatibility of N arbitrary measurements in one wing is both necessary and sufficient for revealing the generalised contextuality for the sub-system in the other wing. Further, we formulate a novel form of inequality for any GPT that are necessary for N-wise compatibility of N arbitrary observables. Moreover, we argue that any theory that violates the proposed inequality possess a degree of incompatibility that can be quantified through the amount of violation. Finally, we claim that it is the generalised contextuality that provides a restriction to the allowed degree of measurement incompatibility of any viable theory of nature and thereby super-select the the quantum theory.</description>

Abstract: We propose a platform for implementing a universal, globally driven quantum computer based on a 2D ladder hosting three different species of superconducting qubits. In stark contrast with the existing literature, our scheme exploits the always-on longitudinal ZZ coupling. The latter, combined with specific driving frequencies, enables the reach of a blockade regime, which plays a pivotal role in the computing scheme.</description>

      <title>The binarisation loophole in high-dimensional quantum correlation experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many experiments with high-dimensional quantum systems aim at observing physical properties without having to assume that all measurement devices are perfectly characterised. To implement high-dimensional measurements, it is a common practice to separately project the system onto each of the possible eigenstates followed by post-processing. Here, we argue that such measurement binarisation procedures are flawed and open a loophole in black-box correlation experiments. We point out how binarised measurements can lead to meaningless results unless artificial assumptions are introduced. We then propose a method to faithfully analyse correlations from binarised measurements. We apply this approach to well-known examples of quantum correlations in Bell, prepare-and-measure and steering experiments. For the former two, we find that binarisation permits reduced-but-yet-significant quantum advantage, while for the latter we find that binarisation can sometimes lead to undiminished quantum correlations. Our discussion emphasises the importance of both more careful data analysis and for developing genuine multi-outcome quantum measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00635v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An open fully connected system of qubits at nonzero temperature is driven within a finite time interval along various paths in the space of its control parameters. The driving leads across finite-size precursors of first- and second-order quantum phase transition from factorized to entangled ground-state phases, aiming at the preparation of the complex ground state of the system at the final parameter point with maximal fidelity. During the drive, the system is coupled to a heat bath at a constant temperature, the dynamics being determined in a nonperturbative way by the method of Hierarchical Equations of Motion. It is shown that the presence of the heat bath in combination with specific patterns of avoided crossings affecting the ground and excited states in the parameter region around the quantum phase transition may considerably improve the fidelity of preparation of the target ground state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an innovative method to enhance the detection and protection of quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics with applications in computing, communication, and beyond. While entanglement can be represented through nonlocal correlations detectable by the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality, this method does not fully capture all entangled states. To address this limitation, we introduce a variational entanglement witness (VEW) that optimizes the probabilities of detection and improves the efficiency of distinguishing between separable and entangled states. Additionally, we propose a novel nonlocal measurement framework that enables the assessment of both CHSH inequalities and the VEW while preserving the entanglement. Our approach enhances the reliability of entanglement detection while maintaining the entanglement of quantum states, offering significant advancements for quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a QUBO formulation designed to solve a series of generalisations of the LinkedIn queens game, a version of the N-queens problem, for the Takuzu game (or Binairo), for the most recent LinkedIn game, Tango, and for its generalizations. We adapt this formulation for several particular cases of the problem, as Tents &amp; Trees, by trying to optimise the number of variables and interactions, improving the possibility of applying it on quantum hardware by means of Quantum Annealing or the Quantum Approximated Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). We also present two new types of problems, the Coloured Chess Piece Problem and the Max Chess Pieces Problem, with their corresponding QUBO formulations.</description>

Abstract: Scalable, reliable quantum light sources are essential for increasing quantum channel capacity and advancing quantum protocols based on photonic qubits. Although recent developments in solid-state quantum emitters have enabled the generation of single photons with high performance, the scalable integration of multiple quantum light sources onto practical optical platforms remains a challenging task. Here, we present a breakthrough in achieving a multiple, tunable array of quantum photonic devices. The selective integration of multiple quantum dot devices onto a V-groove fiber platform features scalability, tunability, high yield, and high single-photon coupling efficiency. Therefore, our fiber-integrated quantum platform realizes a scalable and reliable single-photon array within a compact fiber chip at telecom wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Floquetifying stabiliser codes with distance-preserving rewrites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stabiliser codes with large weight measurements can be challenging to implement fault-tolerantly. To overcome this, we propose a Floquetification procedure which, given a stabiliser code, synthesises a novel Floquet code that only uses single- and two-qubit operations. Moreover, this procedure preserves the distance and number of logicals of the original code. The new Floquet code requires additional physical qubits. This overhead is linear in the weight of the largest measurement of the original code. Our method is based on the ZX calculus, a graphical language for representing and rewriting quantum circuits. However, a problem arises with the use of ZX in the context of rewriting error-correcting codes: ZX rewrites generally do not preserve code distance. Tackling this issue, we define the notion of distance-preserving rewrite that enables the transformation of error-correcting codes without changing their distance. These distance-preserving rewrites are used to decompose arbitrary weight stabiliser measurements into quantum circuits with single- and two-qubit operations. As we only use distance-preserving rewrites, we are guaranteed that a single error in the resulting circuit creates at most a single error on the data qubits. These decompositions enable us to generalise the Floquetification procedure of [arXiv:2307.11136] to arbitrary stabiliser codes, provably preserving the distance and number of logicals of the original code.</description>

Abstract: This paper extends the decomposition from the group theory based methods of Sasao and Saraivanov to design binary input multivalued output quantum cascades realized with optical NOT, SWAP, and Fredkin Gates. We present this method for 3, 5, and 7 valued outputs, but in general it can be used for odd prime valued outputs. The method can be extended to realize hybrid functions with different valued outputs. A class of local transformations is presented that can simplify the final cascade circuits. Using these simplifying transformations, we present an upper bound on the maximum number of gates in an arbitrary $n$-variable input and $k$-valued output function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum information processing with superconducting qubits have fueled a growing demand for scaling and miniaturizing circuit layouts. Despite significant progress, predicting the Hamiltonian of complex circuits remains a challenging task. Here, we propose an improved method for quantizing superconducting circuits that incorporates material- and geometry-dependent kinetic inductance. Our approach models superconducting films as reactive boundary elements, seamlessly integrating into the conventional circuit quantization framework without adding computational complexity. We experimentally validate our method using superconducting devices fabricated with 35 nm-thick disordered niobium films, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy in predicting the Hamiltonian based solely on the device layout and material properties of superconducting films and Josephson junctions. Specifically, conventional methods exhibit an average error of 5.4% in mode frequencies, while our method reduces it to 1.1%. Our method enables systematic studies of superconducting devices with disordered films or compact elements, facilitating precise engineering of superconducting circuits at scale.</description>

By means of a toy model we show that the RRM eigenvalues approach to those of the projected Hamiltonian from below in most cases but a few ones. We also discuss the effect of an energy shift and the projection of the identity operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous-variable (CV) quantum computing is a promising candidate for quantum computation because it can, even with one mode, utilize infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and can efficiently handle continuous values. Although photonic platforms have been considered as a leading platform for CV computation, hybrid systems that use both qubits and bosonic modes, e.g., superconducting hardware, have shown significant advances because they can prepare non-Gaussian states by utilizing the nonlinear interaction between the qubits and the bosonic modes. However, the size of hybrid hardware is currently restricted. Moreover, the fidelity of the non-Gaussian state is also restricted. This work extends the projective squeezing method to establish a formalism for projecting quantum states onto the states that are unitary-transformed from the squeezed vacuum at the expense of the sampling cost. Based on this formalism, we propose methods for simulating larger quantum devices and projecting states onto the cubic phase state, a typical non-Gaussian state, with a higher squeezing level and higher nonlinearity. To make implementation practical, we can, by leveraging the interactions in hybrid systems of qubits and bosonic modes, apply the smeared projector by using either the linear-combination-of-unitaries or virtual quantum error detection algorithms. We numerically verify the performance of our methods and show that projection can suppress the effect of photon-loss errors.</description>

      <title>Fractal decompositions and tensor network representations of Bethe wavefunctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement structure of a generic $M$-particle Bethe wavefunction (not necessarily an eigenstate of an integrable model) on a 1d lattice by dividing the lattice into L parts and decomposing the wavefunction into a sum of products of $L$ local wavefunctions. We show that a Bethe wavefunction accepts a fractal multipartite decomposition: it can always be written as a linear combination of $L^M$ products of $L$ local wavefunctions, where each local wavefunction is in turn also a Bethe wavefunction. Building upon this result, we then build exact, analytical tensor network representations with finite bond dimension $\chi=2^M$, for a generic planar tree tensor network (TTN), which includes a matrix product states (MPS) and a regular binary TTN as prominent particular cases. For a regular binary tree, the network has depth $\log_{2}(N/M)$ and can be transformed into an adaptive quantum circuit of the same depth, composed of unitary gates acting on $2^M$-dimensional qudits and mid-circuit measurements, that deterministically prepares the Bethe wavefunction. Finally, we put forward a much larger class of generalized Bethe wavefunctions, for which the above decompositions, tensor network and quantum circuit representations are also possible.</description>

      <title>Theory of the monochromatic advanced-wave picture and applications in biphoton optics</title>

Abstract: Klyshko's advanced-wave picture (AWP) is mainly interpreted by replacing the nonlinear crystal producing biphotons via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) by a mirror in quantum imaging protocols with thin crystals, where the biphotons are perfectly correlated in position at the crystal. To better explain the biphoton spatial states produced by arbitrary crystals and pump beams, we develop a formal theory of AWP with monochromatic lights that the conditional wave function of one photon is calculated by propagation, multiplication, and another propagation. The case of more general photon postselection or no detection and the inclusion of polarization are studied. Then, we explain the form of the biphoton state from SPDC with a bulk crystal and its free-space propagation. By treating the biphoton wave function as an impulse response function of a classical optical setup, we analyze quantum imaging with undetected photons and quantum holography with polarization entanglement, where properties like the spatial resolution can be concisely deduced. This method can be employed to design nonlinear materials or novel quantum imaging techniques. Finally, we discuss Klyshko's original proposal beyond monochromatic lights with the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect as an example.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensitivity of parametric oscillators</title>

Abstract: Many quantum systems exhibit high sensitivity to their initial conditions, where microscopic quantum fluctuations can significantly influence macroscopic observables. Understanding how quantum states may influence the behavior of nonlinear dynamic systems may open new avenues in controlling light-matter interactions. To explore this issue, we analyze the sensitivity of a fundamental quantum optical process - parametric oscillation - to quantum initializations. Focusing on optical parametric oscillators (OPOs), we demonstrate that the quantum statistics of arbitrary initial states are imprinted in the early-stage dynamics and can persist in the steady-state probabilities. We derive the "quantum sensitivity" of parametric oscillators, linking the initial quantum state to the system's steady-state outcomes, highlighting how losses and parametric gain govern the system's quantum sensitivity. Moreover, we show that these findings extend beyond OPOs to a broader class of nonlinear systems, including Josephson junction based superconducting circuits. Our work opens the way to a new class of experiments that can test the sensitivity of macroscopic systems to quantum initial conditions and offers a pathway for controlling systems with quantum degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Propulsion force and heat transfer for nonreciprocal nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze heat transfer and Casimir forces involving a nonreciprocal nanoparticle. By dissecting the resulting expressions into reciprocal and nonreciprocal contributions, we find that the particle's self emission contains $++$ and $--$ terms, i.e., the particle's reciprocal ($+$) and nonreciprocal ($-$) parts couple to the respective parts of its surrounding. In contrast, the heat transfer to the nanoparticle from the surrounding contains $-+$ and $+-$ contributions, which we find to persist at equal temperatures. For two nanoparticles, such persistent transfer is found to require one particle to be nonreciprocal and the other to be anisotropic. The propulsion force for the nanoparticle, for which our results agree with previous work, is dominated by $\pm\mp$ terms, making it distinct from forces found for reciprocal particles. The amplitude of the propulsion force can be orders of magnitude larger than gravitational forces. Despite being distinct, we find the $\pm\mp$ terms to be bound by $\pm\pm$ terms, a consequence of passivity of the objects. For the force, this bound limits the efficiency in a heat engine setup, as observed for parallel plates before.</description>

      <title>Computational Advantage in Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks: Myth or Reality?</title>

Abstract: Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs) have gained attention for their potential to enhance computational performance by incorporating quantum layers into classical neural network (NN) architectures. However, a key question remains: Do quantum layers offer computational advantages over purely classical models? This paper explores how classical and hybrid models adapt their architectural complexity to increasing problem complexity. Using a multiclass classification problem, we benchmark classical models to identify optimal configurations for accuracy and efficiency, establishing a baseline for comparison. HQNNs, simulated on classical hardware (as common in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era), are evaluated for their scaling of floating-point operations (FLOPs) and parameter growth. Our findings reveal that as problem complexity increases, HQNNs exhibit more efficient scaling of architectural complexity and computational resources. For example, from 10 to 110 features, HQNNs show an 53.1% increase in FLOPs compared to 88.1% for classical models, despite simulation overheads. Additionally, the parameter growth rate is slower in HQNNs (81.4%) than in classical models (88.5%). These results highlight HQNNs' scalability and resource efficiency, positioning them as a promising alternative for solving complex computational problems.</description>

      <title>Local fermion-to-qudit mappings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new set of local fermion-to-qudit mappings for simulating fermionic lattice systems. We focus on the use of multi-level qudits, specifically ququarts. Traditional mappings, such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JWT), while useful, often result in non-local operators that scale unfavorably with system size. To address these challenges, we introduce mappings that efficiently localize fermionic operators on qudits, reducing the non-locality and operator weights associated with JWT. We propose one mapping for spinless fermions and two mappings for spinful fermions, comparing their performance in terms of qudit-weight, circuit depth, and gate complexity. By leveraging the extended local Hilbert space of qudits, we show that these mappings enable more efficient quantum simulations in terms of two-qudit gates, reducing hardware requirements without increasing computational complexity. We validate our approach by simulating prototypical models such as the spinless t-V model and the Fermi-Hubbard model in two dimensions, using Trotterized time evolution. Our results highlight the potential of qudit-based quantum simulations in achieving scalability and efficiency for fermionic systems on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Tight upper bound of the maximal quantum violation of Gisin's elegant Bell inequality and its application in randomness certification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The violation of a Bell inequality implies the existence of nonlocality, making device-independent randomness certification possible. This paper derives a tight upper bound for the maximal quantum violation of Gisin's elegant Bell inequality (EBI) for arbitrary two-qubit states, along with the constraints required to achieve this bound. This method provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for violating the EBI for several quantum states, including pure two-qubit states and the Werner states. The lower bound of certifiable global randomness is analyzed based on the tight upper bound of the EBI for pure two-qubit states, with a comparison to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. The relationship between the noise level and the lower bound of certifiable global randomness with respect to the Werner states is also explored, and the comparisons with both the CHSH inequality and the chained inequality are given. The results indicate that when the state approaches a maximally entangled state within specific quantified ranges, the EBI demonstrates advantages over both the CHSH inequality and the chained inequality, potentially enhancing practical device-independent randomness generation rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Much like classical supercomputers, scaling up quantum computers requires an optical interconnect. However, signal attenuation leads to irreversible qubit loss, making quantum interconnect design guidelines and metrics different from conventional computing. Inspired by the classical Dragonfly topology, we propose a multi-group structure where the group switch routes photons emitted by computational end nodes to the group's shared pool of Bell state analyzers (which conduct the entanglement swapping that creates end-to-end entanglement) or across a low-diameter path to another group. We present a full-stack analysis of system performance, a combination of distributed and centralized protocols, and a resource scheduler that plans qubit placement and communications for large-scale, fault-tolerant systems. We implement a prototype three-node switched interconnect and create two-hop entanglement with fidelities of at least 0.6. Our design emphasizes reducing network hops and optical components to simplify system stabilization while flexibly adjusting optical path lengths. Based on evaluated loss and infidelity budgets, we find that moderate-radix switches enable systems meeting expected near-term needs, and large systems are feasible. Our design is expected to be effective for a variety of quantum computing technologies, including ion traps and superconducting qubits with appropriate wavelength transduction.</description>

Abstract: Fock-state lattices (FSLs), composed of photon number states with infinite Hilbert space, have emerged as a promising platform for simulating high-dimensional physics due to their potential to extend into arbitrarily high dimensions. Here, we demonstrate the construction of multi-dimensional FSLs using superconducting quantum circuits. By controlling artificial gauge fields within their internal structures, we investigate flux-induced extreme localization dynamics, such as Aharonov-Bohm caging, extending from 2D to 3D. We also explore the coherent interference of quantum superposition states, achieving extreme localization within specific subspaces assisted by quantum entanglement. Our findings pave the way for manipulating the behavior of a broad class of quantum states in higher-dimensional systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07577v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are being used to improve the probing of the state spaces of many particle systems as approximations to wavefunctions and in order to avoid the recurring sign problem of quantum monte-carlo. One may ask whether the usual classical neural networks have some actual hidden quantum properties that make them such suitable tools for a highly coupled quantum problem. I discuss here what makes a system quantum and to what extent we can interpret a neural network as having quantum remnants. I suggest that a system can be quantum both due to its fundamental quantum constituents and due to the rules of its functioning, therefore, we can obtain entanglement both due to the quantum constituents' nature and due to the functioning rules, or, in category theory terms, both due to the quantum nature of the objects of a category and of the maps. From a practical point of view, I suggest a possible experiment that could extract entanglement from the quantum functioning rules (maps) of an otherwise classical (from the point of view of the constituents) neural network.</description>

      <title>Bounds on eigenstate thermalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which asserts that every eigenstate of a many-body quantum system is indistinguishable from a thermal ensemble, plays a pivotal role in understanding thermalization of isolated quantum systems. Yet, no evidence has been obtained as to whether the ETH holds for any few-body operators in a chaotic system; such few-body operators include crucial quantities in statistical mechanics, such as the total magnetization, the momentum distribution, and their low-order thermal and quantum fluctuations. Here, we show the existence of upper and lower bounds on $m_{\ast}$ such that all $m$-body operators with $m &lt; m_{\ast}$ satisfy the ETH. For $N$-particles systems, these bounds are given in the form ${\alpha}_L \leq m_{\ast} / N \leq {\alpha}_U$, where ${\alpha}_L$ and ${\alpha}_U$ are $N$-independent positive numbers. We rigorously prove this statement for systems with Haar-distributed energy eigenstates and provide numerical evidence for generic systems with local and few-body interactions. Our results imply that generic systems satisfy the ETH for any few-body operators, including their thermal and quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a discrete truncated Wigner method to analyze the real-time evolution of dissipative SU(${\cal N}$) spin systems coupled with a Markovian environment. This semiclassical approach is not only numerically efficient but also particularly capable of accurately capturing local loss processes due to its local linearity in the dynamical equations. We apply the method to a state-of-the-art experiment involving an analog quantum simulator of a three-dimensional dissipative Bose-Hubbard model in a strongly interacting regime. Our numerical results show good agreement with experimental data, specifically capturing the continuous quantum Zeno effect in the dynamics subjected to a gradual change of the ratio between the hopping amplitude and the onsite interaction across the superfluid-Mott insulator crossover. Furthermore, we present comparative analyses with the continuous truncated Wigner method, derived as an effective Fokker-Planck equation for SU(${\cal N}$) classical spin variables, showing that the discrete method outperforms the continuous one in simulating the long-time dynamics of SU(2) and SU(3) spin models. The discrete phase space framework offers a versatile and powerful tool for exploring a wide range of open quantum many-body systems in dimensions higher than one dimension, where numerically exact methods are impractical due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space dimension.</description>

Abstract: Distinguishing whether a system supports alternate low-energy (locally stable) states -- stable (true vacuum) versus metastable (false vacuum) -- by direct observation can be difficult when the lifetime of the state is very long but otherwise unknown. Here we demonstrate, in a tractable model system, that there are physical phenomena on much shorter time scales that can diagnose the difference. Specifically, we study the time evolution of the magnetization following a quench in the tilted quantum Ising model, and show that its magnitude spectrum is an effective diagnostic. Small transition bubbles are more common than large ones, and we see characteristic differences in the size dependence of bubble lifetimes even well below the critical size for false vacuum decay. We expect this sort of behavior to be generic in systems of this kind. We show such signatures persist in a continuum field theory. This also opens the possibility of similar signatures of the potential metastable false vacuum of our universe well before the beginning of a decay process to the true vacuum.</description>

Abstract: We systematically construct two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) three-state Potts paramagnets with gapless edge modes on a triangular lattice. First, we study microscopic lattice models for the gapless edge and, using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) approach, investigate the finite size scaling of the low-lying excitation spectrum and the entanglement entropy. Based on the obtained results, we identify the universality class of the critical edge, namely the corresponding conformal field theory and the central charge. Finally, we discuss the inherent symmetries of the edge models and the emergent winding symmetry distinguishing between two SPT phases. As a result, the two topologically nontrivial and the trivial phases define a general one-dimensional chain supporting a tricriticality, which we argue supports a gapless SPT order in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Defining classical and quantum chaos through adiabatic transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a formalism which defines chaos in both quantum and classical systems in an equivalent manner by means of \textit{adiabatic transformations}. The complexity of adiabatic transformations which preserve classical time-averaged trajectories (quantum eigenstates) in response to Hamiltonian deformations serves as a measure of chaos. This complexity is quantified by the (properly regularized) fidelity susceptibility. Physically this measure quantifies long time instabilities of physical observables due to small changes in the Hamiltonian of the system. Our exposition clearly showcases the common structures underlying quantum and classical chaos and allows us to distinguish integrable, chaotic but non-thermalizing, and ergodic/mixing regimes. We apply the fidelity susceptibility to a model of two coupled spins and demonstrate that it successfully predicts the universal onset of chaos, both for finite spin $S$ and in the classical limit $S\to\infty$.

      <title>Final States in Quantum Cosmology: Cosmic Acceleration as a Quantum Post-Selection Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard quantum theory admits naturally statistical ensembles that are both pre-selected and post-selected, i.e., they involve both an initial and a final state. We argue that there is no compelling physical reason to preclude a probability assignment with a final quantum state at the cosmological level. We therefore analyze the implications of a final state in the probability assignment for quantum cosmology. To this end, we derive effective classical equations of motion for systems subject to both initial and final conditions. Remarkably, these effective equations do not depend on the details of the quantum theory, but only on the geometric features of the classical state space. When applied to Friedman-Robertson-Walker cosmological models, these effective equations generically describe cosmic acceleration in the absence of a cosmological constant, dark energy, or modified gravitational dynamics. Therefore, cosmic acceleration emerges as a quantum post-selection effect, that is, a macroscopic quantum phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Investigating finite-size effects in random matrices by counting resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10271v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonance counting is an intuitive and widely used tool in Random Matrix Theory and Anderson Localization. Its undoubted advantage is its simplicity: in principle, it is easily applicable to any random matrix ensemble. On the downside, the notion of resonance is ill-defined, and the `number of resonances' does not have a direct mapping to any commonly used physical observable like the participation entropy, the fractal dimensions, or the gap ratios (r-parameter), restricting the method's predictive power to the thermodynamic limit only where it can be used for locating the Anderson localization transition. In this work, we reevaluate the notion of resonances and relate it to measurable quantities, building a foundation for the future application of the method to finite-size systems.

      <title>Single vibronic level fluorescence spectra from Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In single vibronic level (SVL) fluorescence experiments, the electronically excited initial state is also excited in one or several vibrational modes. Whereas computing all contributing Franck-Condon factors individually becomes impractical in large systems, a time-dependent formalism has not been applied to simulate emission from arbitrary initial vibrational levels. Here, we use Hagedorn functions, which are products of a Gaussian and carefully generated polynomials, to represent SVL initial states. In systems where the potential is at most quadratic, the Hagedorn functions are exact solutions to the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation and can be propagated with the same equations of motion as a simple Gaussian wavepacket. Having developed an efficient recursive algorithm to compute the overlaps between two Hagedorn wavepackets, we can now evaluate emission spectra from arbitrary vibronic levels using a single trajectory. We validate the method in two-dimensional global harmonic models by comparing it with quantum split-operator calculations. Additionally, we study the effects of displacement, distortion (squeezing), and Duschinsky rotation on SVL spectra. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the Hagedorn approach to high-dimensional systems on an example of displaced, distorted, and Duschinsky-rotated harmonic model with 100 degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Fault Localization in a Microfabricated Surface Ion Trap using Diamond Nitrogen-Vacancy Center Magnetometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As quantum computing hardware becomes more complex with ongoing design innovations and growing capabilities, the quantum computing community needs increasingly powerful techniques for fabrication failure root-cause analysis. This is especially true for trapped-ion quantum computing. As trapped-ion quantum computing aims to scale to thousands of ions, the electrode numbers are growing to several hundred with likely integrated-photonic components also adding to the electrical and fabrication complexity, making faults even harder to locate. In this work, we used a high-resolution quantum magnetic imaging technique, based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, to investigate short-circuit faults in an ion trap chip. We imaged currents from these short-circuit faults to ground and compared to intentionally-created faults, finding that the root-cause of the faults was failures in the on-chip trench capacitors. This work, where we exploited the performance advantages of a quantum magnetic sensing technique to troubleshoot a piece of quantum computing hardware, is a unique example of the evolving synergy between emerging quantum technologies to achieve capabilities that were previously inaccessible.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions from Heating to non-heating in SU(1, 1) quantum dynamics: applications to Bose-Einstein condensates and periodically driven coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement properties in non-equilibrium quantum systems with the SU(1, 1) structure. Through M\"obius transformation, we map the dynamics of these systems following a sudden quench or a periodic drive onto three distinct trajectories on the Poincar\'e disc, corresponding the heating, non-heating, and a phase boundary describing these non-equilibrium quantum states. We consider two experimentally feasible systems where their quantum dynamics exhibit the SU(1, 1) structure: the quench dynamics of the Bose-Einstein condensates and the periodically driven coupled oscillators. In both cases, the heating, non-heating phases, and their boundary manifest through distinct signatures in the phonon population where exponential, oscillatory, and linear growths classify these phases. Similarly, the entanglement entropy and negativity also exhibit distinct behaviors (linearly, oscillatory, and logarithmic growths) characterizing these phases, respectively. Notibly, for the periodically driven coupled oscillators, the non-equilibrium properties are characterized by two sets of SU(1, 1) generators. The corresponding two sets of the trajectories on two Poincar\'e discs lead to a more complex phase diagram. We identify two distinct phases within the heating region discernible solely by the growth rate of the entanglement entropy, where a discontinuity is observed when varying the parameters across the phase boundary within in heating region. This discontinuity is not observed in the phonon population.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An optical frequency comb comprises a cluster of equally spaced, phase-locked spectral lines. Replacing these classical components with correlated quantum light gives rise to cluster quantum frequency combs, providing abundant quantum resources for measurement-based quantum computation and multi-user quantum networks. We propose and generate cluster quantum microcombs within an on-chip optical microresonator driven by multi-frequency lasers. Through resonantly enhanced four-wave mixing processes, continuous-variable cluster states with 60 qumodes are deterministically created. The graph structures can be programmed into one- and two-dimensional lattices by adjusting the configurations of the pump lines, which are confirmed inseparable based on the measured covariance matrices. Our work demonstrates the largest-scale cluster states with unprecedented raw squeezing levels from a photonic chip, offering a compact and scalable platform for computational and communicational tasks with quantum advantages.</description>

Abstract: Wide-field magnetic microscopy using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond can yield high-quality magnetic images of DC and AC magnetic fields. The unique combination of micron-scale spatial resolution of scalar or vector fields at room temperature and parallel camera readout make this an appealing technique for applications in biology, geology, condensed-matter physics, and electronics. However, while NV magnetic microscopy has achieved great success in these areas, historically the accessible frequency range has been limited. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by implementing the recently developed technique of quantum frequency mixing. With this approach, we generate wide-field magnetic images of test structures driven by alternating currents up to 70 MHz, well outside the reach of DC and Rabi magnetometry methods. With further improvements, this approach could find utility in hyperspectral imaging for electronics power spectrum analysis, electronics diagnostics and troubleshooting, and quantum computing hardware validation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that quantizing gravity on a null hypersurface leads to the emergence of a CFT associated with each null ray. This result stems from the ultralocal nature of null physics and is derived through a canonical analysis of the Raychaudhuri equation, interpreted as a constraint generating null time reparametrizations. The CFT exhibits a non-zero central charge, providing a mechanism for the quantum emergence of time in gravitational systems and an associated choice of vacuum state. Our analysis reveals that the central charge quantifies the degrees of freedom along each null ray. Throughout our investigation, the area element of a cut plays a crucial role, necessitating its treatment as a quantum operator due to its dynamic nature in phase space or because of quantum backreaction. Furthermore, we show that the total central charge diverges in a perturbative analysis due to the infinite number of null generators. This divergence is resolved if there is a discrete spectrum for the area form operator. We introduce the concept of `embadons' to denote these localized geometric units of area, the fundamental building blocks of geometry at a mesoscopic quantum gravity scale.</description>

      <title>Impact of quantum noise on phase transitions in an atom-cavity system with limit cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations are inherent in open quantum systems and they affect not only the statistical properties of the initial state but also the time evolution of the system. Using a generic minimal model, we show that quantum noise smoothens the transition between a stationary and a dynamical phase corresponding to a limit cycle (LC) in the semiclassical mean-field approximation of a generic open quantum system. Employing truncated Wigner approximation, we show that the inherent quantum noise pushes the system to exhibit signatures of LCs for interaction strengths lower than the critical value predicted by the standard mean-field theory, suggesting a noise-induced emergence of temporal ordering. Our work demonstrates that the apparent crossover-like behavior between stationary phases brought by finite-size effects from quantum fluctuations also apply to transitions involving dynamical phases. To demonstrate this on a specific physical system, we consider a transversely pumped atom-cavity setup, wherein LCs have been observed and identified as continuous time crystals. We compare the oscillation frequencies of the LCs in the one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional regimes, and find that the frequencies have larger shot-to-shot fluctuations in 1D. This has an important consequence in the effectiveness of entrainment of LCs for a periodically driven pump intensity or light-matter coupling strength.</description>

Abstract: Fluorescence collection from individual emitters plays a key role in state detection and remote entanglement generation, fundamental functionalities in many quantum platforms. Planar photonics have been demonstrated for robust and scalable addressing of trapped-ion systems, motivating consideration of similar elements for the complementary challenge of photon collection. Here, using an argument from the reciprocity principle, we show that far-field photon collection efficiency can be simply expressed in terms of the fields associated with the collection optic at the emitter position alone. We calculate collection efficiencies into ideal paraxial and fully vectorial focused Gaussian modes parameterized in terms of focal waist, and further quantify the modest enhancements possible with more general beam profiles, establishing design requirements for efficient collection. Towards practical implementation, we design, fabricate, and characterize two diffractive collection elements operating at $\lambda=397$ nm; a forward emitting design is predicted to offer 0.25% collection efficiency into a single waveguide mode, while a more efficient reverse-emitting design offers $1.14\%$ collection efficiency, albeit with more demanding fabrication requirements. Close agreement between simulated and measured emission for both designs indicates practicality of these collection efficiencies, and we indicate avenues to improved devices approaching the limits predicted for ideal beams. We point out a particularly simple integrated waveguide configuration for polarization-based remote entanglement generation enabled by integrated collection.</description>

      <title>Phonon-induced modification of polaritonic Rabi oscillations in the presence of the dark excitonic condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optically inactive (dark) intervalley momentum-forbidden excitons are characterized by relatively long life time, and therefore are desirable candidates for realizing collective excitonic phases. However, testing their coherence by light directly is impossible. Here we propose a method for detecting a dark excitonic condensate. It relies on the interaction between excitons and phonons responsible for the interconversion between bright and dark excitons. As long as the dark condensate forms, the Rabi oscillations between photons and bright excitons can become strongly modified, and can be viewed as the photon-exciton-phonon polaritonic effect. The multi-component nature of the dark condensate consistent with the point-group symmetry is taken into account in the limit of weak phonon-exciton interaction. A perspective for the case of the strong interaction leading to the polaronic effect is discussed.</description>

Abstract: By using the Efetov's super-symmetric formalism we computed analytically the mean spectral density $\rho(E)$ for the L\'evy and the L\'evy -Rosenzweig-Porter random matrices which off-diagonal elements are strongly non-Gaussian with power-law tails. This makes the standard Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation inapplicable to such problems. We used, instead, the functional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation which allowed to solve the problem analytically for large sizes of matrices. We show that $\rho(E)$ depends crucially on the control parameter that drives the system through the transition between the ergodic and the fractal phases and it can be used as an order parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hagedorn wavepackets have been used to compute single vibronic level (SVL) spectra efficiently in model harmonic potentials. To make the Hagedorn approach practical for realistic polyatomic molecules with anharmonicity, here we combine local harmonic Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics with on-the-fly ab initio dynamics. We then test this method by computing the SVL fluorescence spectra of difluorocarbene, a small, floppy molecule with a very anharmonic potential energy surface. Our time-dependent approach obtains the emission spectra of all initial vibrational levels from a single anharmonic semiclassical wavepacket trajectory without the need to fit individual anharmonic vibrational wavefunctions and to calculate the Franck-Condon factors for all vibronic transitions. We show that, whereas global harmonic models are inadequate for CF2, the spectra computed with the on-the-fly local harmonic Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics agree well with experimental data, especially for low initial excitations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Fluctuations and Brownian Motion Detection of Gravitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a way to detect gravitons by replicating the Brownian motion experiment. The Bose-Einstein occupation number $N_g$ for gravitons can be large enough to be the particle components of the gravitational random fluctuations in a physical system. The stochastic gravitational noise produced by the gravitons displaces a massive test particle in a physical system, allowing for the detection of gravitons. Possible experiments to detect gravitons are proposed involving collective stochastic fluctuations of a large number of gravitons, causing a Brownian motion displacement $\Delta x$ of a massive test body. Gravitational wave experiments involving advanced interferometer techniques and mirrors could detect the large collective number of gravitons, and could detect Brownian motion of test particles in the detectors component mirrors. The problem of reducing thermal and other background noise is investigated.</description>

      <title>Duality defect in a deformed transverse-field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical quantities with long lifetimes have both theoretical significance in the study of quantum many-body systems and practical implications for quantum technologies. In this manuscript, we investigate the roles played by topological defects in the construction of quasi-conserved quantities, using as a prototypical example the Kramers-Wannier duality defect in a deformed 1d quantum transverse field Ising model. We construct the duality defect Hamiltonian in three different ways: half-chain Kramers-Wannier transformation, utilization of techniques in the Ising fusion category, and defect-modified weak integrability breaking deformation. The third method is also applicable for the study of generic integrable defects under weak integrability breaking deformations. We also work out the deformation of defect-modified higher charges in the model and study their slower decay behavior. Furthermore, we consider the corresponding duality defect twisted deformed Floquet transverse field Ising model, and investigate the stability of the isolated zero mode associated with the duality defect in the integrable Floquet Ising model, under such weak integrability breaking deformation.</description>

      <title>Relative volume of comparable pairs under semigroup majorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23196v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any semigroup $\mathcal{S}$ of stochastic matrices induces a semigroup majorization relation $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$ on the set $\Delta_{n-1}$ of probability $n$-vectors. Pick $X,Y$ at random in $\Delta_{n-1}$: what is the probability that $X$ and $Y$ are comparable under $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$? We review recent asymptotic ($n\to\infty$) results and conjectures in the case of majorization relation (when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of doubly stochastic matrices), discuss natural generalisations, and prove a new asymptotic result in the case of majorization, and new exact finite-$n$ formulae in the case of UT-majorization relation, i.e. when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of upper-triangular stochastic matrices.</description>

      <title>Stationary acoustic black hole solutions in Bose-Einstein condensates and their Borel analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with the idea of finding solutions that could possibly correspond to a so-called acoustic (or Unruh) black/white holes. Those are flows with horizons where the speed of the flow goes from sub-sonic to super-sonic. This is because sound cannot go back from the supersonic to the subsonic region. The speed of sound plays the role of the speed of light in a gravitational black hole, an important difference being that there are excitations that can go faster than the speed of sound and therefore can escape the sonic black hole. Here, the motion of the BEC is described by the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE). More concretely, we discuss singular Stationary solutions of Gross-Pitaevskii equation in 2D (with Circular symmetry) and 3D (with Spherical symmetry). We use these solutions to study the local speed of sound and magnitude of flow velocity of the condensate to see whether they cross, indicating the potential existence of a sonic analog of a black/white hole. We discuss numerical techniques used and also study the semi-analytical Laplace-Borel resummation of asymptotic series solutions to see how well they agree with numerical solutions. We also study how the resurgent transseries plays a role in these solutions.</description>

      <title>Connecting Gravity and Quantum Physics: Primordial Black Holes and the Evolution of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel framework to explore the fundamental relationship between gravity and quantum mechanics, with particular emphasis on the role of primordial black holes (PBHs) in cosmology. Through the concept of self-gravitating condensed light, specifically in the form of the experimentally discovered photon Bose-Einstein condensate, this work examines the quantum attributes of PBHs and their implications for early universe dynamics, baryogenesis, and the very early formation of galaxies and large-scale structures, established by JWST data. The model also investigates quantized characteristics of PBHs, such as mass, entropy, and temperature, suggesting that quantum processes are fundamental to black hole mechanics. By addressing issues like the cosmological constant problem and the information loss paradox, dark matter, and dark energy, this work provides insights into Planck-scale physics and proposes that PBHs may serve as a bridge between quantum theory and general relativity. This study ultimately posits that understanding PBH physics is essential to resolving major cosmological and astrophysical paradoxes for the ultimate unification of quantum mechanics with gravity.</description>

      <title>Chirally-protected state manipulation by tuning one-dimensional statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral symmetry is broken by typical interactions in lattice models, but the statistical interactions embodied in the anyon-Hubbard model are an exception. It is an example of a correlated hopping model in which chiral symmetry protects a degenerate zero-energy subspace. Complementary to the traditional approach of anyon braiding in real space, we adiabatically evolve the statistical parameter in the anyon-Hubbard model and we find non-trivial Berry phases and holonomies in this chiral subspace. The corresponding states possess stationary checkerboard pattern in their $N$-particle densities which are preserved under adiabatic manipulation. We give an explicit protocol for how these chirally-protected zero energy states can be prepared, observed, validated, and controlled.</description>

      <title>Acoustic black holes, white holes, and wormholes in Bose-Einstein condensates in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a previous article, we studied stationary solutions to the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) corresponding to acoustic (or Unruh) black/white holes, namely configurations where the flow becomes supersonic creating a horizon for phonons. In this paper, we consider again the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE) but looking for stationary numerical solutions in the case where the couplings are position dependent in a prescribed manner. Initially we consider a 2D quantum gas in a funnel-like spatial metric. We then reinterpret this solution as a solution in a flat metric but with spatially dependent coupling and external potential. In these solutions the local speed of sound and magnitude of flow velocity cross, indicating the existence of a supersonic region and therefore of sonic analogues of black/white holes and wormholes. We discuss the numerical techniques used. We also study phase (and density) fluctuations in these solutions and derive approximate acoustic metric tensors. For certain external potentials, we find uniform density acoustic black hole configurations and obtain their Hawking temperature.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar acoustic white hole solutions in Bose-Einstein condensates and their Borel analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study Self-Similar configurations of non-relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) described by the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE). To be precise, we discuss singular Self-similar solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in 2D (with circular symmetry) and 3D (with spherical symmetry). We use these solutions to check for the crossover between the local speed of sound in the condensate and the magnitude of the flow velocity of the condensate, indicating the existence of a supersonic region and thus a sonic analog of a black/white hole. This is because phonons cannot go against the condensate flow from the supersonic to the subsonic region in such a system. We also discuss numerical techniques used and study the semi-analytical Laplace-Borel resummation of asymptotic series solutions while making use of the asymptotic transseries to justify the choice of numerical and semi-analytical approaches taken.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, topological invariants, flat bands, and topological quantized current in the incommensurate regimes.</description>

      <title>The generalized CV conjecture of Krylov complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the ``complexity=volume" (CV) conjecture in the wormhole to the quantum states in the framework of information geometry. In particular, we conjecture that Krylov complexity equals the volume of the Fubini-Study metric in the information geometry. In order to test our conjecture, we study the general Hermitian two-mode Hamiltonian according to the Weyl algebra both in the closed and open systems. By employing the displacement operator, we find that the wave function for a closed system corresponds to the well-known two-mode squeezed state. For an open system, we can create a wave function known as the open two-mode squeezed state by using the second kind of Meixner polynomials. Remarkably, in both cases, the resulting volume of the corresponding Fubini-Study metric provides strong evidence for the generalized CV conjecture.</description>
