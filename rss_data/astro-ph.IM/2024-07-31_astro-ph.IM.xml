      <title>SSPACE Astrobiology Payload-1 (SAP-1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SSPACE Astrobiology Payload (SAP) series, starting with the SAP-1 project is designed to conduct in-situ microbiology experiments in low earth orbit. This payload series aims to understand the behaviour of microbial organisms in space, particularly those critical for human health, and the corresponding effects due to microgravity and solar/galactic radiation. SAP-1 focuses on studying Bacillus clausii and Bacillus coagulans, bacteria beneficial to humans. It aims to provide a space laboratory for astrobiology experiments under microgravity conditions. The hardware developed for these experiments is indigenous and tailored to meet the unique requirements of autonomous microbiology experiments by controlling pressure, temperature, and nutrition flow to bacteria. A rotating platform, which forms the core design, is innovatively utilised to regulate the flow and mixing of nutrients with dormant bacteria. The technology demonstration models developed at SSPACE have yielded promising results, with ongoing efforts to refine, adapt for space conditions, and prepare for integration with nanosatellites or space modules. The anticipated payload will be compact, approximately 1U in size (10cm x 10cm x 10cm), consume less than 5W power, and offer flexibility for various microbiological studies.</description>

      <title>Differences between Gaia DR2 and Gaia EDR3 photometry: demonstration, consequences, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We produce a new photometric calibration for the combined six-filter system formed by $Gaia$ DR2 + EDR3 $G$+$G_{\rm BP}$+$G_{\rm RP}$ using an improved STIS/HST spectrophotometric library with very red stars. The comparison between observed and synthetic photometry yields residual dispersions of just 3.4-8.7 mmag, resulting in the most accurate and precise whole-sky large-dynamic-range optical photometric system ever obtained. We include some tests and applications.</description>

      <title>Toward Spectrum Coexistence: First Demonstration of the Effectiveness of Boresight Avoidance between the NRAO Green Bank Telescope and Starlink Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NRAO and SpaceX have been engaged in coordinated testing efforts since Fall 2021, including conducting experiments on different interference avoidance schemes for the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico, and the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) inside the National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ) in West Virginia. The Starlink system is capable of avoiding direct illumination of telescope sites with their adaptive tasking to place downlink beams far away. Nevertheless, even satellites operating in this mode can potentially present strong signals into the telescope's receiver system if they pass close to the telescope's main beam at the boresight. For additional protection, Starlink satellites can either momentarily redirect or completely disable their downlink channels while they pass within some minimum angular separation threshold from the telescope's boresight, methods that are referred to as "telescope boresight avoidance". In two separate experiments conducted since Fall 2023, NRAO and SpaceX arranged to have the GBT observe a fixed RA/Dec position in the sky, chosen to have a large number of close-to-boresight Starlink passages. Preliminary analysis from these two experiments illustrate the feasibility of these avoidance methods to significantly reduce, if not eliminate, the negative impact of close-to-boresight satellite passages. Importantly, these experiments demonstrate the value of continuing cooperative efforts between NRAO and SpaceX, and expanding cooperation between the radio astronomy and satellite communities more generally.</description>

      <title>SQUIDs for detection of potential dark matter candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) are extremely sensitive magnetic flux sensors which render them useful in a wide array of instrumentation. SQUIDs are often paired with other detectors as a readout mechanism to obtain quantitative insight. SQUIDs have impacted many fields but much less addressed is its impact on the field of fundamental physics, particularly in the search for dark matter. Dark matter is believed to make up around 27% of all mass-energy content of the universe and will provide critical insight into understanding large-scale structures of the universe. Axions and WIMPs are the prominent two dark matter candidates whose search has been fueled by the usage of SQUID read-outs.</description>

      <title>Determination of electron screening potential of 6 Li(p,{\alpha})3 He reaction using MultiLayer Perceptron based neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Understanding the nuclear reactions between light charged nuclei at sub-coulomb energy region holds significant importance in several astrophysical processes. Determination of the precise reaction cross-section within the astrophysically important Gamow range is difficult because of electron screening. Various polynomial fits, R-Matrix and Indirect Trojan horse method estimate much higher electron screening energies as compared to the adiabatic limit. Purpose: Obtain the bare astrophysical S-factor of 6 Li(p,{\alpha})3 He using Multi-Layer Perceptron based Artificial Neural Network based analysis and extract the electron screening energies. Methods: Experimental S-factor of 6 Li(p,{\alpha})3 He, available in literature, are reanalyzed using the Multi-LayerPerceptron based Artificial Neural Network based algorithm to obtain the energy dependent astrophysical S-factor. Bare astrophysical S-factor is also calculated using the same Feed-forward Artificial Neural Network from the data range above 60 keV where the electron screening effect is expected to be negligible. Electron screening potential is then obtained by taking the ratio of total shielded S-factor with the bare S-factor. Results and Conclusions: The electron screening potential obtained from the Present work through the Artificial Neural network based algorithm is found to be 220 eV. The extracted electron screening potential through the present analysis indicates that the Artificial Neural Network might be an alternative tools for estimation the electron screening potential involving light nuclei.</description>

      <title>gwforge: A user-friendly package to generate gravitational-wave mock data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next-generation gravitational-wave detectors, with their improved sensitivity and wider frequency bandwidth, will be capable of observing almost every compact binary signal from epochs before the first stars began to form, increasing the number of detectable binaries to hundreds of thousands annually. This will enable us to observe compact objects through cosmic time, probe extreme matter phenomena, do precision cosmology, study gravity in strong field dynamical regimes and potentially allow observation of fundamental physics beyond the standard model. However, the richer data sets produced by these detectors will pose new computational, physical and astrophysical challenges, necessitating the development of novel algorithms and data analysis strategies. To aid in these efforts, this paper introduces gwforge, a user-friendly, lightweight Python package, to generate mock data for next-generation detectors. We demonstrate the package's capabilities through data simulation examples and highlight a few potential applications: performance loss due to foreground noise, bright-siren cosmology and impact of waveform systematics on binary parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>FCN4Flare: Fully Convolution Neural Networks for Flare Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar flares originate from the sudden reconnection of magnetic flux lines within the star's atmosphere, particularly in the chromosphere. Automated flare detection enables exploiting vast photometric datasets from missions like Kepler. Prior methods rely on outlier detection, facing challenges of complexity, detection accuracy, and scalability. This paper presents FCN4Flare, a deep learning approach using fully convolutional networks for precise point-to-point flare prediction regardless of light curve length. Key innovations include the NaN Mask to handle missing data, dilated convolutions to preserve local information, and the MaskDice loss to mitigate severe class imbalance. Experiments demonstrate significantly improved detection performance over previous models, with a 0.64 Dice coefficient on Kepler data. Applying FCN4Flare to Kepler and LAMOST, we compile a catalog of 30,285 high-confidence flares across 1426 stars. Flare energies are estimated and stellar/exoplanet properties analyzed, identifying pronounced activity for an M-dwarf hosting a habitable zone planet. This work overcomes limitations of prior flare detection methods via deep learning, enabling new scientific discoveries through analysis of photometric time-series data.</description>

      <title>SPECtrophotometer for TRansmission spectroscopy of exoplanets (SPECTR)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SPECtrophotometer for TRansmission spectroscopy of exoplanets (SPECTR) is a new low-resolution optical (3800 {\AA} - 6850 {\AA}) spectrophotometer installed at the Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory (BOAO) 1.8 m telescope. SPECTR is designed for observing the transmission spectra of transiting exoplanets. Unique features of SPECTR are its long slit length of 10 arcminutes which facilitates observing the target and the comparison star simultaneously, and its wide slit width to minimize slit losses. SPECTR will be used to survey exoplanets, such as those identified by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), providing information about their radii across the wavelength range. In this paper, we present the design of SPECTR and the observational results of the partial transit of HD 189733 b and a full transit of Qatar-8 b. Analyses show the SPECTR's capability on the white light curves with an accuracy of one ppt. The transmission spectrum of HD 189733 b shows general agreement with previous studies.</description>

      <title>The Villafranca project: Combining Gaia and ground-based surveys to study Galactic OB groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Villafranca project is studying Galactic stellar groups with OB stars combining information from $Gaia$ and ground-based surveys. We summarize the status of the project and we present its most important results. The Villafranca project has been used to produce a new astrometric calibration for $Gaia$ (E)DR3, which improves the previous one significantly for bright stars. We have discovered that dynamical interactions among massive stars at a very young age ($\sim$1 Ma or less) can play a significant interaction in the dynamical evolution of clusters. As a consequence, our current view of the massive-star IMF may be distorted and the number of free-floating neutron stars and black holes higher than previously considered.</description>

      <title>Blind and robust estimation of adaptive optics point spread function and diffuse halo with sharp-edged objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context . Initially designed to detect and characterise exoplanets, extreme adaptive optics (AO) systems open a new window onto the Solar System by resolving its small bodies. Nonetheless, their study remains limited by the accuracy of the knowledge of the AO-corrected point spread function (AO-PSF) that degrades their image and produces a bright halo, potentially hiding faint moons in their close vicinity. Aims . To overcome the random nature of AO-PSFs, I aim to develop a method that blindly recovers the PSF and its faint structured extensions directly into the data of interest, without any prior on the instrument or the object's shape. The objectives are both to deconvolve the object and to properly estimate and remove its surrounding halo to highlight potential faint companions. Methods . My method first estimated the PSF core via a parametric model fit, under the assumption of a sharp-edged flat object. Then, the resolved object and the PSF extensions were alternatively deconvolved with a robust method, insensitive to model outliers, such as cosmic rays or unresolved moons. Finally, the complex halo produced by the AO system was modelled and removed from the data. Results . The method is validated on realistic simulations with an on-sky AO-PSF from the SPHERE/ZIMPOL instrument. On real data, the proposed blind deconvolution algorithm strongly improves the image sharpness and retrieves details on the surface of asteroids. In addition, their moons are visible in all tested epochs despite important variability in turbulence conditions. Conclusions . My method shows the feasibility of retrieving the complex features of AO-PSFs directly from the data of interest. It paves the way towards more precise studies of asteroid surfaces and the discovery and characterisation of Solar System moons in archival data or with future instruments on extremely large telescopes with ever more complex AO-PSFs.</description>

      <title>GEO and LEO: The Final Frontier for Plutonic FFP Parallax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I show that microlens parallaxes, $\pi_{\rm E}$, can be derived for free-floating planets (FFPs) with masses down to that of Pluto, by combining observations from a satellite in geosynchronous (GEO) orbit with another observatory that is on or near Earth's surface, i.e., either ground-based or in low Earth orbit (LEO). Because these low-mass FFPs typically have measurements of the angular Einstein radius, $\theta_{\rm E}$, from finite-source effects, such $\pi_{\rm E}$ measurements directly yield the FFP mass $M=\theta_{\rm E}/\kappa \pi_{\rm E}$ where $\kappa$ is a physical constant. Such Earth-GEO measurements almost perfectly complement Earth-L2 measurements, which extend to higher FFP mass and greater FFP distance. LEO-only observations can yield mass measurement at even smaller FFP mass and nearer FFP distances. I discuss methods for breaking the Refsdal (1966) two-fold degeneracy in $\pi_{{\rm E},\pm}$.</description>

      <title>FNet II: Spectral Classification of Quasars, Galaxies, Stars, and broad absorption line (BAL) Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we enhance the FNet, a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) with a residual neural network (ResNet) architecture, to perform spectral classification of quasars, galaxies, stars, and broad absorption line (BAL)-quasars in the SDSS-IV catalog from DR17 of eBOSS. Leveraging its convolutional layers and the ResNet structure with different kernel sizes, FNet autonomously identifies various patterns within the entire sample of spectra. Since FNet does not require the intermediate step of identifying specific lines, a simple modification enabled our current network to classify all SDSS spectra. This modification involves changing the final output layer from a single value (redshift) to multiple values (probabilities of all classes), and accordingly adjusting the loss function from mean squared error (MSE) to cross-entropy. FNet achieves a completeness of 99.00\% $\pm$ 0.20 for galaxies, 98.50\% $\pm$ 0.30 for quasars, 99.00\% $\pm$ 0.18 for BAL-quasars, and 98.80\% $\pm$ 0.20 for stars. These results are comparable to those obtained using QuasarNET, a standard CNN employed in the SDSS routine, comprises convolutional layers without the ResNet structure with equal kernel sizes, and is utilized for redshift measurement and classification by identifying seven emission lines. QuasarNET, in order to overcome the problem of finding a CIV emission line with broad absorption which is slightly more challenging than that of detecting emission lines requires to add BAL CIV line to the list of lines that the network learns to identify. However, this procedure is not necessary in FNet as it learns the features through a self-learning procedure.</description>

      <title>Spurious Solar-Wind Effects on Acceleration Noise in LISA Pathfinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spurious solar-wind effects are a potential noise source in the measurements of the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Comparative models are used to predict the possible impact of this noise factor and estimate spurious solar-wind effects on acceleration noise in LISA Pathfinder (LPF). Data from NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), situated at the L1 Lagrange point, served as a reliable source of solar-wind data. The data sets were compared over the 114-day time period from March 1, 2016 to June 23, 2016. To evaluate these effects, the data from both satellites were formatted, gap-filled, and adapted for comparison, and a coherence plot comparing the results of the Fast Fourier Transformations. The coherence plot suggested that solar-wind had a minuscule effect on the LPF, and higher frequency coherence (LISA's main observing band) can be attributed to random chance correlation. This result indicates that measurable correlation due to solar-wind noise over 3-month timescales can be ruled out as a noise source. This is encouraging, although another source of noise from the sun, solar irradiance pressure, is estimated to have a more significant effect and has yet to be analyzed.</description>

      <title>Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS): 90 GHz Telescope Pointing, Beam Profile, Window Function, and Polarization Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) is a telescope array that observes the cosmic microwave background (CMB) over ~75% of the sky from the Atacama Desert, Chile, at frequency bands centered near 40, 90, 150, and 220 GHz. CLASS measures the large angular scale CMB polarization to constrain the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the optical depth to last scattering. This paper presents the optical characterization of the 90GHz telescope, which has been observing since July 2018. Observations of the Moon establish the pointing while dedicated observations of Jupiter are used for beam calibration. The standard deviations of the pointing error in azimuth, elevation, and boresight angle are 1.3, 2.1, and 2.0 arcminutes, respectively, over the first 3 years of observations. This corresponds to a pointing uncertainty ~7% of the beam's full width at half maximum (FWHM). The effective azimuthally-symmetrized instrument 1D beam estimated at 90 GHz has an FWHM of 0.620+/-0.003 deg and a solid angle of 138.7+/-0.6(stats.)+/-1.1(sys.) usr integrated to a radius of 4 deg. The corresponding beam window function drops to b_ell^2 = 0.93, 0.71, 0.14 at ell = 30, 100, 300, respectively. Far-sidelobes are studied using detector-centered intensity maps of the Moon and measured to be at a level of 10^-3 or below relative to the peak. The polarization angle of Tau A estimated from preliminary survey maps is 149.6+/-0.2(stats.) deg in equatorial coordinates. The instrumental temperature-to-polarization (T-to-P) leakage fraction, inferred from per-detector demodulated Jupiter scan data, has a monopole component at the level of 1.7 x 10^-3, a dipole component with an amplitude of 4.3 x 10^-3, with no evidence of quadrupolar leakage.</description>

      <title>Scalable Bayesian uncertainty quantification with data-driven priors for radio interferometric imaging</title>

Abstract: Next-generation radio interferometers like the Square Kilometer Array have the potential to unlock scientific discoveries thanks to their unprecedented angular resolution and sensitivity. One key to unlocking their potential resides in handling the deluge and complexity of incoming data. This challenge requires building radio interferometric imaging methods that can cope with the massive data sizes and provide high-quality image reconstructions with uncertainty quantification (UQ). This work proposes a method coined QuantifAI to address UQ in radio-interferometric imaging with data-driven (learned) priors for high-dimensional settings. Our model, rooted in the Bayesian framework, uses a physically motivated model for the likelihood. The model exploits a data-driven convex prior, which can encode complex information learned implicitly from simulations and guarantee the log-concavity of the posterior. We leverage probability concentration phenomena of high-dimensional log-concave posteriors that let us obtain information about the posterior, avoiding MCMC sampling techniques. We rely on convex optimisation methods to compute the MAP estimation, which is known to be faster and better scale with dimension than MCMC sampling strategies. Our method allows us to compute local credible intervals, i.e., Bayesian error bars, and perform hypothesis testing of structure on the reconstructed image. In addition, we propose a novel blazing-fast method to compute pixel-wise uncertainties at different scales. We demonstrate our method by reconstructing radio-interferometric images in a simulated setting and carrying out fast and scalable UQ, which we validate with MCMC sampling. Our method shows an improved image quality and more meaningful uncertainties than the benchmark method based on a sparsity-promoting prior.

      <title>A Hamiltonian, post-Born, three-dimensional, on-the-fly ray tracing algorithm for gravitational lensing</title>

Abstract: The analyses of the next generation cosmological surveys demand an accurate, efficient, and differentiable method for simulating the universe and its observables across cosmological volumes. We present Hamiltonian ray tracing (HRT) -- the first post-Born (accounting for lens-lens coupling and without relying on the Born approximation), three-dimensional (without assuming the thin-lens approximation), and on-the-fly (applicable to any structure formation simulations) ray tracing algorithm based on the Hamiltonian formalism. HRT performs symplectic integration of the photon geodesics in a weak gravitational field, and can integrate tightly with any gravity solver, enabling co-evolution of matter particles and light rays with minimal additional computations. We implement HRT in the particle-mesh library $\texttt{pmwd}$, leveraging hardware accelerators such as GPUs and automatic differentiation capabilities based on $\texttt{JAX}$. When tested on a point-mass lens, HRT achieves sub-percent accuracy in deflection angles above the resolution limit across both weak and moderately strong lensing regimes. We also test HRT in cosmological simulations on the convergence maps and their power spectra.</description>

      <title>Machine-assisted classification of potential biosignatures in earth-like exoplanets using low signal-to-noise ratio transmission spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for atmospheric biosignatures in Earth-like exoplanets is one of the most pressing challenges in observational astrobiology. Detecting biogenic gases in terrestrial planets requires high resolution and long integration times. In this work, we developed and tested a machine-learning general methodology, intended to classify transmission spectra with low Signal-to-Noise Ratio according to their potential to contain biosignatures. For that purpose, we trained a set of models capable of classifying noisy transmission spectra, as having methane, ozone, and/or water (multilabel classification), or simply as being interesting for follow-up observations (binary classification). The models were trained with $\sim\, 10^6$ synthetic spectra of planets similar to TRAPPIST-1 e, which were generated with the package MultiREx, especially developed for this work. The trained algorithms correctly classified test planets with transmission spectra having SNR $&lt;$ 6 and containing methane and/or ozone at mixing ratios similar to those of modern and Proterozoic Earth. Tests on realistic synthetic spectra based on the current Earth\'s atmosphere show at least one of our models would classify as likely having biosignatures and using only one transit, most of the inhabited terrestrial planets observed with the JWST/NIRSpec PRISM around M-dwarfs located at distances similar or smaller than that of TRAPPIST-1 e. The implication of this result for the designing of observing programs and future surveys is enormous since machine-assisted strategies similar to those presented here could significantly optimize the usage of JWST resources for biosignature searching, while maximizing the chances of a real discovery after dedicated follow-up observations of promising candidates.</description>
