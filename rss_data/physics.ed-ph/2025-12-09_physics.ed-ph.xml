      <title>Small Language Models Reshape Higher Education: Courses, Textbooks, and Teaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have introduced novel paradigms in science and education, their adoption in higher education is constrained by inherent limitations. These include a tendency to produce inaccuracies and high computational requirements, which compromise the strict demands for accurate and reliable knowledge essential in higher education. Small language models (MiniLMs), by contrast, offer distinct advantages in professional education due to their lightweight nature and precise retrieval capabilities. This research takes "Atmospheric Physics" as an example. We established a specialized corpus and image repository by gathering over 550,000 full-text PDFs from over 130 international well-respected journals in Earth and environmental science. From this collection, we extracted over 100 million high-quality sentence-level corpus and more than 3 million high-resolution academic images. Using MiniLMs, these resources were organized into a high-dimensional vector library for precise retrieval and efficient utilization of extensive educational content. Consequently, we systematically redesigned the courses, textbooks, and teaching strategies for "Atmospheric Physics" based on MiniLMs. The course is designed as a "interdisciplinary-frontier" system, breaking down traditional boundaries between atmospheric science, space science, hydrology, and remote sensing. Teaching materials are transformed from static, lagging text formats into a dynamic digital resource library powered by MiniLM. For teaching methods, we have designed a question-based learning pathway. This paradigm promotes a shift from passive knowledge transfer to active cognitive development. Consequently, this MiniLM-driven "Atmospheric Physics" course demonstrates a specific avenue for "AI for education".</description>

      <title>Earth radius from a single sunrise image: a classroom-ready activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a photograph of the shadow of Mont Blanc taken from Geneva at sunrise, we derive an upper limit for the Earth radius. After presenting the observational context and the model underlying assumptions, we determine the direction of the solar rays relative to the local vertical. This direction constrains the Earth maximum diameter which -- once corrected for atmospheric refraction -- amounts to roughly 1.7 times its presently accepted value. This work illustrates a pedagogical approach to scientific inquiry, showing how simple observations, combined with reasoning and elementary mathematical and geometrical tools, can yield meaningful physical estimates.</description>

      <title>"Be Better Than You Need to Be": A-Level Physics Students' Rants, Resilience and Peer Pedagogy on TikTok</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amid the growth of social media, students increasingly turn to short-form platforms for study support and advice. This study examines how A-level Physics is portrayed by student creators on TikTok, a popular platform amongst students for peer-to-peer educational guidance, information sharing, and collective knowledge building. Using reflexive thematic analysis of 57 TikTok videos via #alevelphysics, we explore how A-level Physics is characterised and what pathways to success are constructed within these informal discourses. The findings show that the subject is depicted as both intellectually demanding and emotionally taxing, with the examination system perceived as a flawed gatekeeper. Creators narrate their experiences through a blend of hyperboles, frustration, and resilience, offering sophisticated peer-generated pedagogies alongside cautionary tales. Recommendations emphasise strategic resource curation, sustained practice, systematic memorisation, and a mindset of deliberate over-preparation. These portrayals of subject demands and agentic responses resonate with prior research on the cultural construction of physics as hard and exclusionary, while also illustrating how affinity spaces on social media enable students to reframe difficulty through shared feelings and tactics. We discuss the value of student-led online discourses about high-stakes examinations for educators in supporting prospective and current physics students.</description>

      <title>The use of a simple digital weather station (not only) in teaching physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of key goals of contemporary physics (and, realistically, STEM) education is to develop students' science literacy and critical thinking skills. In this paper, we present the construction and use of several versions of a simple school-based digital weather station that students can use to measure fundamental physical quantities (temperature, pressure, air humidity, light intensity) as part of school activities. The weather stations were constructed at our workplace using an Arduino microcontroller, BBC micro: bit, and the school measurement system Coach. This paper proposes not only the design and related programming of the weather stations but also how students can collect, analyse, and interpret measured data, thereby learning scientific methods and developing science literacy and critical thinking. This hands-on approach also develops students' experimental skills, emphasizes the cross-curricular relationships between physics, computer science and geography, and teaches them to work with accurate data in the context of real environmental problems.</description>

      <title>A few ideas to promote inclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Promoting diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA) is both a legal and professional responsibility in French research institutions. This paper presents practical strategies to foster inclusive work environments within French research units. We summarize the regulatory context, key findings from the INSU-AA prospective on discrimination, and fundamental principles for promoting equity. We discuss approaches to mitigate implicit biases across all career stages, from early education to retirement, and outline strategies for equitable recruitment and career advancement. Concrete initiatives in one of our units (LESIA/LIRA) are described, including internal communications, exhibitions, and accessible pedagogical activities. The creation of a dedicated commission within the unit council ensures coordinated DEIA efforts, legitimized by institutional support and methodical planning. By sharing these experiences, we provide actionable guidance for research units seeking to advance DEIA in science.</description>
