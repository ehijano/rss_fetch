      <title>The contribution of turbulent AGN coronae to the diffuse neutrino flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) can accelerate protons to energies of $\sim$ 10-100 TeV, with secondary production of high-energy neutrinos. If the acceleration is driven by magnetized turbulence, the main properties of the resulting proton and neutrino spectra can be deduced based on insights from particle-in-cell simulations of magnetized turbulence. We have previously shown that these properties are consistent with the TeV~neutrino signal observed from the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068. In this work, we extend this result to a population study. We show that the produced neutrino flux depends mainly on the energetics of the corona -- the relative fraction of X-ray, magnetic, and non-thermal proton energy -- and on the spectral energy distribution of the AGN. We find that coronae with similar properties can explain neutrinos from the candidate AGN for which IceCube has reported an excess, albeit less significant than NGC 1068. Building on this framework, we show how the neutrino signal evolves with the AGN luminosity, and use this AGN sequence to predict the diffuse neutrino flux from the extragalactic population, showing that it can account for the diffuse neutrino signal observed by IceCube in the $\sim$1-100 TeV energy range.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Modelling of Early Peaks in Type Ibc Supernovae with Shock Cooling Emission from Circumstellar Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent high-cadence transient surveys have uncovered a rare subclass of Type Ibc supernovae (SNe) that exhibit an early, blue peak lasting a few days before the main, radioactively powered peak. Since progenitors of Type Ibc SNe are typically compact and lack an extended envelope, this early peak is commonly attributed to shock cooling emission from circumstellar matter (CSM) surrounding the progenitor star. As such, these SNe provide a unique opportunity to constrain the pre-explosion activity of Type Ibc SN progenitors. We present the first systematic study of this Type Ibc SN population that uses hydrodynamic modelling. We simulated Type Ibc SNe exploding in a CSM using the multi-group radiation-hydrodynamics code STELLA, exploring a range of SN and CSM properties. By comparing the resulting theoretical multi-band light curves to a sample of seven Type Ibc SNe with early peaks, we constrained their CSM properties. Assuming a wind-like density distribution for the CSM, we found CSM masses of $10^{-2} - 10^{-1} \ \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and CSM radii of $(1 - 5) \times 10^3 \ \mathrm{R}_\odot$. While the masses were roughly consistent with a previous estimate obtained using an analytical model, the radii were significantly different, likely due to our assumption of spatially spread out CSM. We infer that the progenitors could have created CSM via late-time binary mass transfer or pulsational pair instability. We also estimate that, in the planned ULTRASAT high-cadence survey, $\sim 30$ shock cooling peaks from Type Ibc SNe will be observed.</description>

      <title>Radio emission across the entire rotation phases of pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-sensitive observations of bright pulsars by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) have revealed weak radio emission continuously emerged in the rotation phases between the main pulse and interpulse of an rotating neutron star. We develop a model for the polarized radio emission radiated from different heights in the pulsar magnetosphere and examine emission intensity distribution over the whole rotation phases of pulsars seen from all directions by the line of sight. We find that for pulsars with small periods and the magnetosphere filled with much more relativistic particles, the polarized radio emission can be generated in all rotation phases for both the aligned and perpendicular rotating neutron stars. When the line of sight cuts the pulsar emission beam between the rotation and magnetic axes, the polarization angles have the same sense of variation gradient for the ``main'' pulse and ``interpulse''. If the line of sight cuts the beams between the inclined magnetic axis and the equator, the opposite senses can be found for the main pulse and interpulse. In addition to the pulsed emission, we find persistent radio emission generated in the pulsar magnetosphere. The model can naturally explain the emission across the entire rotation phases.</description>

      <title>Search for Type IL Gamma-ray Bursts: Criterion, Results, Verification and Physical Implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an interesting subclass of gamma-ray burst (GRB), Type IL GRB (such as GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A) features a long-duration prompt emission but originating from compact binary merger. The "long duration" emisison of Type IL GRB are dominately composed of the main burst, rather than the extended emission, differentiating them from the traditional "long-short" GRB (e.g., GRB 060614). Previous study has reported several Type IL GRBs by visual inspection of their light curves. In this work, we established a detailed criterion to identify Type IL GRBs by light curve, and then systematically searched the archival \textit{Fermi}/GBM data with this criterion, resulting in a sample of 5 type IL GRBs from January 1, 2014 to January 1, 2024, i.e. GRB 230307A, GRB 211211A, GRB 200914A, GRB 200311A and GRB 170228A. Apart from the light curve pattern, we find that the temporal and spectral properties of these 5 GRBs also support this classification. Interestingly, we find that the energy ratio between extended emission and main emission is almost constant ($\sim0.7$, with small scattering) for these GRBs, which have strong implication on the mechanism of Type IL burst. We discuss theoretical models to interpret the progenitor, central engine, and extended emission of these Type IL bursts.</description>

      <title>Dielectronic recombination studies of ions relevant to kilonovae and non-LTE plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents calculations of rate coefficients, resonance strengths, and cross sections for the dielectronic recombination (DR) of Y^+, Sr^+, Te^2+, and Ce^2+--low-charge ions relevant to kilonovae and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) plasmas. Using relativistic atomic structure methods, we computed DR rate coefficients under conditions typical of these environments. Our results highlight the critical role of low-lying DR resonances in shaping rate coefficients at kilonova temperatures (~ 10^4 K) and regulating charge-state distributions. Pronounced near-threshold DR resonances significantly influence the evolving ionization states and opacity of neutron star merger ejecta. Comparisons with previous studies emphasize the necessity of including high-n Rydberg states for accurate DR rate coefficients, especially for complex heavy ions with dense energy levels. Discrepancies with existing datasets underscore the need for refined computational techniques to minimize uncertainties. These results provide essential input for interpreting spectroscopic observations of neutron star mergers, including James Webb Space Telescope data. We also put forward suitable candidates for experimental studies, recognizing the challenges involved in such measurements. The data presented here have potential to refine models of heavy-element nucleosynthesis, enhance plasma simulation accuracy, and improve non-LTE plasma modeling in astrophysical and laboratory settings.</description>

      <title>Evidence for repeating fast radio bursts association with fast super-twisted magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright millisecond radio events of unknown extra-galactic origin. Magnetars are one of the main contenders. Some sources, the repeaters, produce multiple events but so far generally without the characteristic periodicity that one could associate with the spin of a neutron star. We fit a geometrical model to the two main repeaters of the CHIME/FRB catalogue, namely FRB 20180814A and FRB 20180916B. Assuming the bursts originate from a magnetar's magnetosphere, we constrain the spin and magnetic parameters of the star which are encoded into burst spectro-temporal morphologies. We estimate that a very strong toroidal magnetic component together with spin periods of respectively $2.3_{-0.5}^{+0.5} ~ \rm s$ and $0.8_{-0.2}^{+0.1} ~ \rm s$ best explain the data. We argue that this points towards young magnetars with super-twisted magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic diagnostics of high-temperature plasma in stellar corona using Fe XXIV--XXVI K-shell lines with XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The RS CVn type binary star GT Mus was observed during its quiescence using the Resolve X-ray microcalorimeter spectrometer onboard XRISM. The main and satellite lines of the Fe XXIV--XXVI K-shell transitions were resolved for the first time from stellar sources. We conducted line ratio analysis to investigate any deviations from collisional onization equilibrium (CIE) and Maxwell electron energy distribution with a single-temperature. By using five combinations of direct excitation lines and dielectronic recombination satellite lines in three line complexes (Fe He$\alpha$, Ly$\alpha$, and He$\beta$), we found that the plasma is well characterized by two-temperature thermal plasmas with temperatures of 1.7 and 4.3 keV, which is consistent with a thermal broadening of Fe XXV and the broadband fitting results in the 1.7--10 keV band. Other forms of deviation from a single-temperature plasma, such as different ionization and electron temperatures or the $\kappa$ distribution for the electron energy distributions, are not favored, which is reasonable for stellar coronae at quiescence. This study demonstrates the utility of the Fe K-shell line ratio diagnostics to probe plasma conditions using X-ray microcalorimeters.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the Comptonizing medium of the black-hole candidate Swift J1727.8$-$1613 along the hard to hard-intermediate state transition using NICER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the properties of the Comptonizing medium in the black-hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613 using the time-dependent Comptonization model vkompth, using NICER observations of type-C QPOs in the hard and hard-intermediate states. During the 2023 outburst of the source, we measure the rms and phase lags of the QPO across 45 observations as the QPO frequency, $\nu_{\rm QPO}$, evolves from $\sim 0.3$ Hz to $\sim 7$ Hz. By simultaneously fitting the time-averaged spectrum of the source and the rms and lag spectra of the QPO, we derive the evolution of the disk and corona parameters. At $\nu_{\rm QPO} = 0.34$ Hz, the QPO phase lags are hard, with 10 keV photons lagging 0.5 keV photons by $\sim 0.5$ rad. As $\nu_{\rm QPO}$ increases, the lags for the same energy bands decrease, reaching near zero at $\nu_{\rm QPO} \sim 1.2$ Hz, and then reverse to soft lags of $\sim -1.1$ rad at $\nu_{\rm QPO} \sim 7$ Hz. Initially, the inner radius of the accretion disk is truncated at $\sim 30-40 R_g$ (assuming a 10 solar-mass black hole) and, as the QPO frequency increases, the truncation radius decreases down to $\sim 10 R_g$. Initially, two coronas of sizes of $\sim 6.5 \times 10^3$ km and $\sim 2 \times 10^3$ km, extend over the disk and are illuminated by different regions of the disk. As the QPO frequency increases, both the coronas shrink to $\sim 2 \times 10^3$ km at $\nu_{\rm QPO} = 2.5$ Hz. Following a data gap, one corona expands again, peaking at a size of $\sim 2 \times 10^4$ km. We interpret the evolution of the coronal size in the context of accompanying radio observations, discussing its implications for the interplay between the corona and the jet.</description>

      <title>Probable evidence for a transient mega-electron volt emission line in the GRB 221023A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of spectral line in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is importance for studying GRB physics, as it provides insights into the composition and physical conditions of the GRB environment. However, progress in detecting X-ray or gamma-ray emission and absorption lines in GRB spectra has been relatively slow, only the narrow emission line feature of about 10 MeV found in GRB 221009A has exhibited a significance exceeding $5 \sigma$. Here, we report the probable evidence of a narrow emission feature at about 2.1 mega-electron volts (MeV) in the spectrum of GRB 221023A. The highest statistical significance of this feature is observed in the time interval between 8 and 30 seconds after Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor trigger, with the chance probability value $&lt;2.56 \times 10^{-5}$ (after accounting for the look-elsewhere effect), corresponding to a Gaussian-equivalent significance $&gt; 4.20 \sigma$. We interpret this feature as being generated through the de-excitation of excited electrons in the relativistic hydrogen-like high-atomic-number ions entrained in the GRB jet.</description>

      <title>Revisiting X-ray polarization of the shell of Cassiopeia A using spectropolarimetric analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray synchrotron radiation is expected to be highly polarized. Thanks to the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), it is now possible to evaluate the degree of X-ray polarization in sources such as supernova remnants (SNRs). Jointly using IXPE data and high-resolution Chandra observations, we perform a spatially resolved spectropolarimetric analysis of SNR Cassiopeia A (Cas A). We focus in the 3-6 keV energy band on regions near the shell dominated by nonthermal synchrotron emission. By combining IXPE's polarization sensitivity with Chandra's higher spatial and spectral resolution, we constrain the local polarization degree (PD) and polarization angle (PA) across the remnant. Our analysis reveals PD values ranging locally from 10% to 26%, showing significant regional variations that underscore the complex magnetic field morphology of Cas A. The polarization vectors indicate a predominantly radial magnetic field, consistent with previous studies. Thanks to the improved modeling of thermal contamination using Chandra data, we retrieve higher PD values compared to earlier IXPE analysis and more significant detections with respect to the standard IXPEOBSSIM analysis. Finally, we also estimate the degree of magnetic turbulence {\eta} from the measured photon index and PD, under the assumption of an isotropic fluctuating field across the shell of Cas A.</description>

      <title>ESPRESSO reveals a single but perturbed broad-line region in the supermassive black hole binary candidate PG 1302-102</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new, Bayesian analysis of the highest-resolution optical spectrum of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary candidate PG 1302-102, obtained with ESPRESSO@VLT (R \simeq 138, 000). Our methodology, based on robust Bayesian model selection, reveals the presence of multiple narrow emission lines at the expected redshift of the source and confirms (for H\{beta}) and detects (for H{\gamma}) the presence of redshifted broad components. Additionally, we have discovered a very broad and, if it is associated with the H\{beta}, very redshifted component at {\lambda} \simeq 5000{\AA}. We evaluate two scenarios for explaining the observed broad emission line (BEL) in PG 1302-102. In the case in which the redshifted BEL asymmetry arises from the orbital motion of a putative binary, our measurements coupled with simple estimates of the broad-line region (BLR) sizes suggest that the individual black hole BLRs are either settled in a single BLR or in the process of merging and, therefore truncated and highly disturbed. Alternatively, in the scenario of a single SMBH, we explain the distorted emission of the BELs with a nonsymmetric distribution of the BLR clouds; namely, a thin disk with a spiral perturbation. This BLR configuration is statistically preferred over any empirical multi-Gaussian fit and simultaneously explains the asymmetric emission of the H{\beta} and H{\gamma} close to the bulk of the line and any additional excess (or the lack of it, in the case of the H{\gamma}) at much longer wavelengths. The physical origins of the perturbation are unclear, and a connection with the possible presence of a black hole binary cannot be ruled out. Given the growing evidence from theoretical and observational works demonstrating the common presence of disturbed BLRs in active galactic nuclei, we argue that an origin related to self-gravitating instabilities may be more plausible.</description>

      <title>MACER3D -- an upgrade of MACER2D with enhanced subgrid models and gas physics -- and its application to simulating AGN feedback in a massive elliptical galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MACER3D (Multiscale AGN-regulated Cosmic Ecosystem Resolver in 3D), a new suite of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations that study active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback on galactic scales over Gyr duration, with major enhancement in subgrid models and gas physics over its predecessor -- MACER (Massive AGN Controlled Ellipticals Resolved) which is in two dimensions (hereafter MACER2D). MACER3D resolves gas dynamics from within the Bondi radius ($\sim 25\,\mathrm{pc}$) to halo scales. Combined with black hole accretion theory, it enables an accurate calculation of AGN outputs and subsequently their large-scale feedback effects. We present results from simulating an isolated elliptical galaxy with different feedback configurations. In the fiducial model with both AGN and supernova (SN) feedback, the temporal evolution of AGN luminosity and star formation rate are strongly correlated, suggesting shared dependence on the availability of gas supply for SMBH accretion and star formation. AGN duty cycles of several percent with a single-cycle timescale of $\sim 10^2\,\mathrm{Myr}$ agree with observations, while models with only AGN or SN feedback fail to reproduce observed cycles. While all models maintain a quiescent galaxy state, fiducial AGN+SN feedback model results in higher star formation than no-SN feedback, suggesting SN feedback, when acting synergistically with AGN feedback, may positively impact star formation. Combined AGN and SN feedback enhances halo-scale metal enrichment compared to single-feedback models. The simulated X-ray properties match observations and predict transient cavities produced by cold-mode AGN winds from past burst events. The differences between the results obtained by MACER2D and MACER3D are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Universal profile for cosmic birefringence tomography with radio galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to tomographically probe cosmic birefringence using radio galaxies. We show that the redshift evolution of the cosmic birefringence angle induced by a slow-rolling pseudoscalar field, which is a candidate for dynamical dark energy, is independent of the detailed model of the pseudoscalor field. This universal profile evolves predominantly at $z\lesssim10$. In contrast, if the origin is a dark matter-like pseudscalor field, the resulting birefringence angle tends to be negligible in the low-redshift regime. This new insight provides a strong motivation to independently test the cosmic birefringence using polarized astrophysical sources such as radio galaxies. We find that a sample size of $\order{10^5-10^6}$ is required to distinguish the profiles, which is achievable with ongoing and upcoming radio surveys such as ASKAP or SKA.</description>

      <title>A post-Newtonian approach to neutron star oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors are expected to constrain the properties of extreme density matter via observations of static and dynamical tides in binary neutron star inspirals. The required modelling is straightforward in Newtonian gravity -- where the tide can be represented in terms of a sum involving the star's oscillation modes -- but not yet fully developed in general relativity -- where the mode-sum approach is problematic. As a step towards more realistic models, we are motivated to explore the post-Newtonian (pN) approach to the problem (noting that the modes should still provide an adequate basis for a tidal expansion up to 2pN order). Specifically, in this paper we develop the pN framework for neutron star oscillations and explore to what extent the results remain robust for stars in the strong-field regime. Our numerical results show that the model is accurate for low-mass stars ($\lesssim 0.8M_{\odot}$), but becomes problematic for more massive stars. However, we demonstrate that the main issues can be resolved (at the cost of abandoning the consistency of the pN expansion) allowing us to extend the calculation into the neutron star regime. For canonical neutron stars ($\approx 1.4M_\odot$) our adjusted formulation provides the fundamental mode of the star with an accuracy comparable to that of the relativistic Cowling approximation. For lower mass stars, our approach is significantly better.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the rotational properties of inverted hybrid stars (also termed cross stars), which have been recently proposed as a possible new class of compact stars characterized by an outer layer of quark matter and a core of hadrons, in an inverted structure compared to traditional hybrid stars. We analyze distinct models representing varying depths of quark-hadron phase transitions. Our findings reveal that, while cross stars rotating at their Kepler frequencies typically exhibit a significantly higher mass and larger circumferential radius as anticipated, interestingly, there is a significant increase in potential twin configurations in the case of rapid rotations. We further study sequences of constant baryonic mass, representing potential paths of rotational evolution. Our results indicate that not all stars in these sequences are viable due to the onset of phase transitions during spin-down, leading to possible mini-collapses. We also investigate the phenomenon of ``back-bending" during spin-down sequences, which is manifested in a rather different shape for cross stars due to their inverted structure and the large density discontinuity caused by the strong phase transition, in contrast to traditional hybrid stars. Our research enriches existing studies by introducing the significant aspect of rotation, unveiling intr</description>

      <title>Propagation-induced Frequency-dependent Polarization Properties of Fast Radio Burst</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frequency-dependent polarization properties provide crucial insights into the radiation mechanisms and magnetic environments of fast radio bursts (FRBs). We explore an analytical solution of radiative transfer of the polarization properties of FRBs as a strong incoming wave propagates in a homogeneous magnetized plasma. The cases of a thermal plasma is studied in detail. The rotational axis of the polarization spectrum undergoes precession with frequency on the Poincar\'e sphere when the medium has both strong Faraday rotation and conversion. Such precession on the Poincar\'e sphere could occur in hot or cold plasma with a strong magnetic field component perpendicular to the line of sight. Significant absorption can exist in a dense plasma medium, which may give rise to a highly circularly polarized outgoing wave. We apply the analytical solution with the mixing Faraday case to fit the observations of frequency-dependent Stokes parameters for FRB 20180301A and FRB 20201124A. The analytical solution offers a more physical description of FRBs' magnetic environment properties than the empirical ``generalized Faraday rotation'' method commonly adopted in the literature. The frequency-dependent Stokes parameters may be associated with reversing rotation measures or the presence of a persistent radio source around an FRB.</description>

      <title>Autocorrelation signatures in time-resolved black hole flare images: secondary peaks and convergence structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strong gravitational field of a black hole bends light, forming multi-level images, yet extracting precise spacetime information from them remains challenging. In this study, we investigate how gravitational lensing leaves unique and detectable signatures in black hole movies using autocorrelation analysis. By examining the two-dimensional autocorrelation of a movie depicting a hotspot orbiting a Kerr black hole, as viewed by a near-axis observer, we identify a persistent secondary peak structure induced by gravitational lensing. Notably, these secondary peaks converge to a fixed point in the time-angle lag domain, largely independent of the hotspot's orbital radius. This key property suggests that combining future black hole flare observations with advanced autocorrelation analysis could effectively disentangle lensing effects from orbital dynamics, enabling direct measurement of black hole parameters. Our findings establish autocorrelation as a powerful tool for probing spacetime geometry, offering new insights into gravitational physics through time-resolved black hole images.</description>

      <title>Spin evolution modeling for a newly-formed white dwarf resulting from binary white dwarf merger</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Merger of two white dwarfs (WDs) has been proposed to form an isolated WD having high magnetization and rapid rotation. We study the influence of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind on spin evolution of the newly-formed merger product. We consider the scenario that the merger product appears as a giant-star-like object with a radius of $&gt; 10^{10}$ cm and a luminosity of the order of an Eddington value. We solve a structure of the merger product under the hydrostatic equilibrium and identify the position of the slow-point in the hot envelope. It is found that if such a giant-star-like object is spinning with an angular speed of the order of the Keplerian value, the MHD wind can be produced. The mass-loss rate is estimated to be of the order of $\sim 10^{20-21}~\mathrm{g~s^{-1}}$, and the timescale of the spin down is $\sim 10\text{-}10^{3}$ years, which depends on stellar magnetic field. We discuss that the final angular momentum when the MHD wind is terminated is related to the magnetic flux and initial radiation luminosity of the merger product. We apply our model to three specific magnetic WD sources ZTF J190132.9+145808.7, SDSS J221141.8+113604.4, and PG 1031+234 by assuming that those WDs were as a result of the merger product. We argue that the current periods of ZTF J190132.9+145808.7 and PG 1031+234 that are strongly magnetized WDs are related to the initial luminosity at the giant phase. For SDSS J221141.8+113604.4, which is mildly magnetized WD, its angular momentum was almost determined when the spin-down timescale due to MHD wind is comparable to the cooling timescale in the giant phase.</description>

      <title>Measuring the asymmetric expansion of the Fe ejecta of Cassiopeia A with XRISM/Resolve</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The expansion structure of supernova remnants (SNRs) is important for understanding not only how heavy elements are distributed into space, but also how supernovae explode. The ejecta expansion structure of the young core-collapse SNR Cas A is investigated, with Doppler parameter mapping of the Fe-K complex by the Resolve microcalorimeter onboard the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission, XRISM. It is found that the Fe ejecta are blueshifted in the southeast (SE) and redshifted in the northwest (NW), indicating an incomplete shell structure, similar to the intermediate mass elements (IMEs), such as Si and S. The Fe has a velocity shift of $\sim1400$ km~s$^{-1}$ in the NW and $\sim2160$ km~s$^{-1}$ in the SE region, with the error range of a few 100s km~s$^{-1}$. These values are consistent with those for the IMEs in the NW region, whereas larger than those for the IMEs in the SE region, although the large error region prevented us from concluding which component has significantly higher velocity. The line broadening is larger in the center with values of $\sim$2000--3000~km~s$^{-1}$, and smaller near the edges of the remnant. The radial profiles of the Doppler shift and broadening of the IMEs and Fe indicate that the Fe ejecta may expand asymmetrically as IME ejacta, although the large error regions do not allow us to conclude it. Moreover, we see little bulk Doppler broadening of the Fe lines in the northeastern jet region whereas the IME lines exhibit significant broadening. No such narrow lines are detected in the NW region. These findings suggest an asymmetric expansion of the ejecta potentially driven by large-scale asymmetries originating from the supernova explosion. This interpretation aligns with the large-scale asymmetries predicted by models of neutrino-driven supernova explosions.</description>

      <title>Observing radio transients with Phased ALMA: Pulses from the Galactic Centre magnetar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio transients, such as pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), are primarily detected at centimetre radio wavelengths, where higher luminosities are found. However, observations of sources in dense environments are heavily affected by propagation effects which may hinder a detection. Millimetre wave observations bypass this complication but require the largest radio telescopes to compensate for the lower flux densities. When used in phased mode, the ALMA radio telescope provides an equivalent dish size of 84m, being the most sensitive instrument at mm/sub mm. With its high time resolution it offers a unique opportunity to study radio transients in an unexplored window. We study the Galactic Centre (GC) magnetar, PSR J1745$-$2900, as a laboratory for magnetars in complex magneto-turbulent environments and to link with FRBs. We showcase the potential of ALMA in phased mode to observe radio transients and to achieve, for some sources, the first ever detections outside the cm wave range. We studied the GC magnetar using ALMA archival data of Sgr A* at Band 3 from the 2017 GMVA campaign. We searched in intensity and classified the pulses based on their circular and linear polarisation properties and arrival phase. We detected eight pulses with energies in the range of 10$^{29}$ erg. We constructed its cumulative energy distribution and we fit a power law, where the event rate scales with energy as $R \propto E^{\gamma}$. The result is an exponent of $\gamma = -2.4 \pm 0.1$. With the $\gamma -$value and the system properties of phased ALMA, we estimate that over 160 known pulsars could be detected by ALMA. For repeating FRBs, observing during their peak activity window could lead to several detections. We expect that ALMA's lower frequency bands with polarisation capabilities, will serve as a pioneer on mm wave searches for pulsars and to study complex environments involving radio transients.</description>

      <title>Does the Sun have a Dark Disk?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sun is not quite a perfect sphere, and its oblateness, thought to be induced through its rotation, has been measured using optical observations of its radius. Its gravitational quadrupole moment can then be deduced using solar models, or through helioseismology, and it can also be determined from measurements of its gravitational effects on Mercury's orbit. The various assessments do not appear to agree, with the most complete and precise orbital assessments being in slight excess of other determinations. This may speak to the existence of a non-luminous disk or ring, where we also note evidence for a circumsolar dust ring within Mercury's orbit from the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) mission. Historically, too, a protoplanetary disk may have been key to reconciling the Sun's metallicity with its neutrino yield. The distribution of the non-luminous mass within Mercury's orbit can modify the relative size of the optical and orbital quadrupole moments in different ways. We develop how we can use these findings to limit the mass of a dark disk, ring, or halo in the immediate vicinity of the Sun, and we note how future observational studies of the inner solar system can not only refine these constraints but also help to identify and to assess the mass of its dark-matter component.</description>

      <title>Black hole with global monopole charge in self-interacting Kalb-Ramond field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore a static, spherically symmetric black hole solution in the context of a self-interacting Kalb-Ramond field coupled with a global monopole. By incorporating the effects of Lorentz-violating term $\ell$ and the monopole charge $\eta$ in the KR field, we derive the modified gravitational field equations and analyze the resulting black hole spacetime. The obtained solution exhibits deviations from the Schwarzschild metric with topological defect, as it is influenced by the monopole charge and self-interaction potential. We investigate the thermodynamic properties of the black hole, including its Hawking temperature, entropy, and specific heat, revealing novel stability conditions. Additionally, we perform solar system tests such as perihelion precession, gravitational redshift, light deflection, and time delay of signals to impose constraints on the Lorentz-violating parameter and monopole charge. Our findings suggest that these parameters have to be significantly small, although there are different constraints imposed by individual tests, ranging from $10^{-9}\leq|\ell|\leq 10^{-4}$ and $10^{-9}\leq\eta\leq 10^{-6}\, \mathrm{m}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Extending Israel-Stewart theory: Causal bulk viscosity at large gradients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a class of relativistic fluid models for cold and dense matter with bulk viscosity, whose equilibrium equation of state is polytropic. These models reduce to Israel-Stewart theory for small values of the viscous stress $\Pi$. However, when $\Pi$ becomes comparable to the equilibrium pressure $P$, the evolution equations "adjust" to prevent the onset of far-from-equilibrium pathologies that would otherwise plague Israel-Stewart. Specifically, the equations of motion remain symmetric hyperbolic and causal at all times along any continuously differentiable flow, and across the whole thermodynamic state space. This means that, no matter how fast the fluid expands or contracts, the hydrodynamic equations are always well-behaved (away from singularities). The second law of thermodynamics is enforced exactly. Near equilibrium, these models can accommodate an arbitrarily complicated dependence of the bulk viscosity coefficient $\zeta$ on both density and temperature.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlation between soft X-rays and galaxies A new benchmark for galaxy evolution models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents the construction and validation of complete stellar mass-selected, volume-limited galaxy samples using the Legacy Survey (data release 10) galaxy catalogs, covering $\sim16,800$ deg$^2$ of extra-galactic sky, and extending to redshift $z&lt;0.35$. We measure the correlation function of these galaxies with tiny statistical uncertainties at the percent level and systematic uncertainties up to 5\%. A 4-parameter halo occupation distribution (HOD) model is fitted to retrieve the population of host halos, yielding results on the stellar to halo mass relation consistent with the current models of galaxy formation and evolution. Using these complete galaxy samples, we measure and analyze the cross-correlation (X-corr) between galaxies and all soft X-ray photons observed by SRG/eROSITA in the 0.5-2 keV band over $\sim13,000$ deg$^2$. The cross correlation measurements have unprecedented sub-percent statistical uncertainty and ~5-10\% systematic uncertainty.
  An extension to the halo model is introduced to interpret the X-corr, decomposing contributions from X-ray point sources, hot gas (CGM), satellites, and the 2-halo term. For low stellar mass thresholds ($\log M^*/M_{\odot}&gt;$ 10, 10.25, 10.5), we find that the point source emission dominates the X-corr at small separation ($r&lt;80$kpc). Then, in the range ($80&lt;r&lt;2$Mpc), the emission from large halos hosting satellite galaxies dominates. Finally, on scales beyond that considered here ($r&gt;2$Mpc), the 2-halo term becomes dominant. Interestingly, there is no scale at which the CGM dominates. In the range ($20&lt;r&lt;200$kpc), the CGM contributes to more than 10\% of the signal. Progressively, with the minimum stellar mass increasing, the CGM emission increases. We constrain the $M_{500c}-L_X$ scaling relation slope, $1.629^{+0.091}_{-0.089}$, at the 5\% level using the samples with the lowest mass threshold.</description>

Abstract: We have developed a simple analytic formula that well describes quadrupole $l$-changing collisions of the form $nl \rightarrow nl'$, as confirmed by comparison with numerical quantal Born calculations obtained with the program autostructure (Badnell 2011). Such formulae could easily be included in models of astrophysical plasma emission, such as the hydrogen and helium-like recombination spectra. When compared with the results of previous quantal calculations based upon an analytic solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation by Vrinceanu &amp; Flannery (2001), we find relatively good agreement, with the exception of large $l &gt; n/2$ transitions. We provide a tentative explanation for such discrepancies. However, we also show that the rates for quadrupole $l$-changing collisions are typically two orders of magnitude lower than the dipolar ones. Inclusion of the quadrupolar rates in a hydrogenic collisional-radiative model of nebular plasma shows minimal changes to the level populations, typically within 1% in nebular conditions. Simple and complete theories are now available for $l$-changing collisions suitable for astrophysical applications.</description>
