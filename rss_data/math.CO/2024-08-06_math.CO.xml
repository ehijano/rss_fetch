      <title>Ramsey theory and strength of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numbering $f$ of a graph $G$ of order $n$ is a labeling that assigns distinct elements of the set $\left\{ 1,2,\ldots ,n\right\} $ to the vertices of $G$, where each $uv\in E\left( G\right) $ is labeled $f\left( u\right) +f\left( v\right) $. The strength $\mathrm{str}\left( G\right) $ of $G$ is defined by $\mathrm{str}\left( G\right) =\min \left\{ \mathrm{str}_{f}\left( G\right) \left\vert f\text{ is a numbering of }G\right. \right\}$, where $\mathrm{str}_{f}\left( G\right) =\max \left\{ f\left( u\right) +f\left( v\right) \left\vert uv\in E\left( G\right) \right. \right\} $. Let $f\left( n\right) $ denote the maximum of $\mathrm{str}\left( G\right) +% \mathrm{str}\left( \overline{G}\right) $ over nonempty graphs $G$ and $% \overline{G}$ of order $n$, where $\overline{G}$ represents the complement of $G$. In this paper, we establish a lower bound for the Ramsey numbers related to the concept of strength of a graph and show a sharp lower bound for $f\left( n\right) $. In addition to these results, we provide another lower bound and remark some exact values for $f\left( n\right) $. Furthermore, we extend existing necessary and sufficient conditions involving the strength of a graph. Finally, we investigate bounds for $\mathrm{str}\left( G\right) +\mathrm{str}\left( \overline{G}\right) $ whenever $G$ and $\overline{G}$ are nonempty graphs of order $n$. Throughout this paper, we propose some open problems arising from our study.</description>

      <title>On the max min of the algebraic degree and the nonlinearity of a Boolean function on an affine subspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the max min of the algebraic degree and the nonlinearity of a Boolean function in $n$ variables when restricted to a $k$-dimensional affine subspace of $\textbf{F}_2^n$. Previous authors have focused on the cases when the max min of the algebraic degree is 0 or 1. Upper bounds, lower bounds and a conjecture on the exact value in special cases is presented.</description>

Abstract: We provide a very elementary proof of a classical extremality result due to Sidorenko (Discrete Math.\ 131.1-3, 1994), which states that among all graphs $G$ on $k$ vertices, the $k-1$-edge star maximises the number of graph homomorphisms of $G$ into any graph $H$.</description>

      <title>On the two problems in Ramsey achievement games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p,q$ be two integers with $p\geq q$. Given a finite graph $F$ with no isolated vertices, the generalized Ramsey achievement game of $F$ on the complete graph $K_n$, denoted by $(p,q;K_n,F,+)$, is played by two players called Alice and Bob. In each round, Alice firstly chooses $p$ uncolored edges $e_1,e_2,...,e_p$ and colors it blue, then Bob chooses $q$ uncolored edge $f_1,f_2,...,f_q$ and colors it red; the player who can first complete the formation of $F$ in his (or her) color is the winner. The generalized achievement number of $F$, denoted by ${a}(p,q;F)$ is defined to be the smallest $n$ for which Alice has a winning strategy. If $p=q=1$, then it is denoted by ${a}(F)$, which is the classical achievement number of $F$ introduced by Harary in 1982. If Alice aims to form a blue $F$, and the goal of Bob is to try to stop him, this kind of game is called the first player game by Bollob\'{a}s. Let ${a}^*(F)$ be the smallest positive integer $n$ for which Alice has a winning strategy in the first player game.
  A conjecture due to Harary states that the minimum value of ${a}(T)$ is realized when $T$ is a path and the maximum value of ${a}(T)$ is realized when $T$ is a star among all trees $T$ of order $n$. He also asked which graphs $F$ satisfy $a^*(F)=a(F)$? In this paper, we proved that $n\leq {a}(p,q;T)\leq n+q\left\lfloor (n-2)/p \right\rfloor$ for all trees $T$ of order $n$, and obtained a lower bound of ${a}(p,q;K_{1,n-1})$, where $K_{1,n-1}$ is a star. We proved that the minimum value of ${a}(T)$ is realized when $T$ is a path which gives a positive solution to the first part of Harary's conjecture, and ${a}(T)\leq 2n-2$ for all trees of order $n$. We also proved that for $n\geq 3$, we have $2n-2-\sqrt{(4n-8)\ln (4n-4)}\leq a(K_{1,n-1})\leq 2n-2$ with the help of a theorem of Alon, Krivelevich, Spencer and Szab\'o. We proved that $a^*(P_n)=a(P_n)$ for a path $P_n$.</description>

      <title>Tesler matrices and Lusztig data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study asymptotics of Tesler matrices using Kostant pictures, as well as partial orders on these. We show that the Lusztig data partial order on Kostant pictures refines the 'merge' partial order on Kostant pictures, and that the merge partial order on Kostant pictures is equivalent to a partial order on Tesler matrices. This equivalence requires integral flow graphs. Using Kostant pictures we find logarithmic asymptotics of some families of Tesler matrices.</description>

      <title>The generalized Ramsey number $f(n, 5, 8) = \frac 67 n + o(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $(p, q)$-coloring of $K_n$ is a coloring of the edges of $K_n$ such that every $p$-clique has at least $q$ distinct colors among its edges. The generalized Ramsey number $f(n, p, q)$ is the minimum number of colors such that $K_n$ has a $(p, q)$-coloring. Gomez-Leos, Heath, Parker, Schweider and Zerbib recently proved $f(n, 5, 8) \ge \frac 67 (n-1)$. Here we prove an asymptotically matching upper bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an infinite family of triples (G, S1, S2) consisting of a group G and a pair (S1,S2) of distinct subsets of G with the following properties. 1. The distributions of the simple random walks on the two Cayley graphs Cay(G, S1) and Cay(G, S2) are the same at an arbitrary specified moment of time, under a permutation of the vertices. 2. The Spectra of Cay(G, Si) is decomposed into a disjoint union of two subsets A and Bi of the equal size, which satisfies B1 = -B2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ian Macdonald's works changed our perspective on so many parts of algebraic combinatorics and formal power series. This talk will display some selected works of the art of Ian Macdonald, representative of different periods of his oeuvre, and analyze how they resonate, both for the past development of our subject and for its future.
  This paper was prepared for the occasion of a lecture in tribute to Ian G. Macdonald, delivered at FPSAC 2024 in Bochum, Germany on 22 July 2024. I want to express thanks to the Executive Committee of FPSAC, the Organizing Committee of FPSAC 2024, and to the whole of our FPSAC 2024 community for making this lecture a possibility and for considering me for its delivery. Macdonald is my hero, and to be asked to play such a role in his legacy touches me deeply.</description>

      <title>A spectral Lov\'{a}sz-Simonovits theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental result in extremal graph theory attributes to Mantel's theorem, which states that every graph on $n$ vertices with more than $\lfloor n^2/4 \rfloor$ edges contains a triangle. About half of a century ago, Lov\'{a}sz and Simonovits (1975) provided a supersaturation phenomenon, which asserts that for $q&lt; n/2$, every graph with $\lfloor n^2/4 \rfloor +q$ edges contains at least $q\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ triangles. This result solved a conjecture proposed by Erd\H{o}s in 1962. In this paper, we establish a spectral version of the result of Lov\'{a}sz and Simonovits. Let $Y_{n,2,q}$ be the graph obtained from the bipartite Tur\'{a}n graph $T_{n,2}$ by embedding a matching with $q$ edges into the vertex part of size $\lceil n/2\rceil$. Using the supersaturation-stability method and the classical spectral techniques, we firstly prove that for $n\ge 300q^2$, each graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $\lambda (G) \ge \lambda (Y_{n,2,q})$ contains at least $q\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ triangles. Moreover, let $T_{n,2,q}$ be the graph obtained from $T_{n,2}$ by embedding a star with $q$ edges into the vertex part of size $\lceil n/2\rceil$. Secondly, we show further that $T_{n,2,q}$ is the unique spectral extremal graph that contains at most $q\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ triangles and attains the maximum of the spectral radius. This result answers a spectral triangle counting problem due to Ning and Zhai (2023). Thirdly, we present an asymptotically spectral stability result under a specific constraint on the triangle covering number. The third result could be regarded as a spectral extension of a recent result proved by Balogh and Clemen (2023), and independently by Liu and Mubayi (2022).</description>

      <title>Vertex-separating path systems in random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set $V$ is said to be separated by subsets $V_1,\ldots,V_k$ if, for every pair of distinct elements of $V$, there is a set $V_i$ that contains exactly one of them. Imposing structural constraints on the separating subsets is often necessary for practical purposes and leads to a number of fascinating (and, in some cases, already classical) graph-theoretic problems.
  In this work, we are interested in separating the vertices of a random graph by path-connected vertex sets $V_1,\ldots,V_k$, jointly forming a separating system. First, we determine the size of the smallest separating system of $G(n,p)$ when $np\to \infty$ up to lower order terms, and exhibit a threshold phenomenon around the sharp threshold for connectivity. Second, we show that random regular graphs of sufficiently high degree can typically be optimally separated by $\lceil \log_2 n\rceil$ sets. Moreover, we provide bounds for the minimum degree threshold for optimal separation of general graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For normal play, impartial games, we define penults as those positions in which every option results in an immediate win for the other player. We explore the number of tokens in penults of two positional games, Impartial Tic and Impartial Tak. We obtain a complete classification in the former case. We then explore winning strategies and further directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the help of El Bachraoui's lemma, the creative microscoping method, and a new form of the Chinese remainder theorem for coprime polynomials, we prove a $q$-supercongruence for double series and a $q$-supercongruence for triple series modulo the sixth power of a cyclotomic polynomial. As conclusions, two corresponding supercongruences for double and triple series, which are associated with the (D.2) supercongruence of Van Hamme, are given.</description>

      <title>The commutant of divided difference operators, Klyachko's genus, and the comaj statistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [Hamaker-Pechenik-Speyer-Weigandt, Nenashev, Pechenik-Weigandt] are studied certain operators on polynomials and power series that commute with all divided difference operators $\partial_i$. We introduce a second set of "martial" operators {\martial_i} that generate the full commutant, and show how a Hopf-algebraic approach naturally reproduces the operators $\xi^\nu$ from [Nenashev]. We then pause to study Klyachko's homomorphism $H^*(Fl(n)) \to H^*($the permutahedral toric variety$)$, and extract the part of it relevant to Schubert calculus, the "affine-linear genus''. This genus is then re-obtained using Leibniz combinations of the {\martial_i}. We use Nadeau-Tewari's $q$-analogue of Klyachko's genus to study the equidistribution of $\ell$ and comaj on $[n]\choose k$, generalizing known results on $S_n$.</description>

      <title>Periodicity and decidability of translational tilings by rational polygonal sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The periodic tiling conjecture asserts that if a region $\Sigma\subset \mathbb R^d$ tiles $\mathbb R^d$ by translations then it admits at least one fully periodic tiling. This conjecture is known to hold in $\mathbb R$, and recently it was disproved in sufficiently high dimensions. In this paper, we study the periodic tiling conjecture for polygonal sets: bounded open sets in $\mathbb R^2$ whose boundary is a finite union of line segments. We prove the periodic tiling conjecture for any polygonal tile whose vertices are rational. As a corollary of our argument, we also obtain the decidability of tilings by rational polygonal sets. Moreover, we prove that any translational tiling by a rational polygonal tile is weakly-periodic, i.e., can be partitioned into finitely many singly-periodic pieces.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the undecidability of translational tiling of $n$-dimensional space $\mathbb{Z}^n$ with a set of $k$ tiles. It is known that tiling $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with translated copies with a set of $8$ tiles is undecidable. Greenfeld and Tao gave strong evidence in a series of works that for sufficiently large dimension $n$, the translational tiling problem for $\mathbb{Z}^n$ might be undecidable for just one tile. This paper shows the undecidability of translational tiling of $\mathbb{Z}^3$ with a set of $6$ tiles.</description>

      <title>Cops and Attacking Robbers with Cycle Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the Cops and Attacking Robbers game, a variant of Cops and Robbers, where the robber is empowered to attack a cop in the same way a cop can capture the robber. In a graph $G$, the number of cops required to capture a robber in the Cops and Attacking Robbers game is denoted by $\attCop(G)$. We characterise the triangle-free graphs $G$ with $\attCop(G) \leq 2$ via a natural generalisation of the cop-win characterisation by Nowakowski and Winkler \cite{nowakowski1983vertex}. We also prove that all bipartite planar graphs $G$ have $\attCop(G) \leq 4$ and show this is tight by constructing a bipartite planar graph $G$ with $\attCop(G) = 4$. Finally we construct $17$ non-isomorphic graphs $H$ of order $58$ with $\attCop(H) = 6$ and $\cop(H)=3$. This provides the first example of a graph $H$ with $\attCop(H) - \cop(H) \geq 3$ extending work by Bonato, Finbow, Gordinowicz, Haidar, Kinnersley, Mitsche, Pra\l{}at, and Stacho \cite{bonato2014robber}. We conclude with a list of conjectures and open problems.</description>

We show that if a code is $t$-homogeneous that is, the codewords of the code for every given weight hold a $t$-design, then its Jacobi polynomial in genus $g$ with composition $T$ with $|T|\leq t$ can be obtained from its weight enumerator in genus~$g$ using the polarization operator. Using this fact, we investigate the invariant ring, which relates the homogeneous Jacobi polynomials of the binary codes in genus $g$. Specifically, the generators of the invariant ring appearing for $g=1$ are obtained. Moreover, we define the split Jacobi polynomials in genus~$g$ and obtain the MacWilliams type identity for it. A split generalization for higher genus cases of the relation between the Jacobi polynomials and weight enumerator of a $t$-homogeneous code also given.</description>

      <title>A complete characterization of split digraphs with a strong arc decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A \textbf{strong arc decomposition} of a (multi-)digraph $D(V, A)$ is a partition of its arc set $A$ into two disjoint arc sets $A_1$ and $A_2$ such that both of the spanning subdigraphs $D(V, A_1)$ and $D(V, A_2)$ are strong. In this paper, we fully characterize all split digraphs that do not have a strong decomposition. This resolves two problems proposed by Bang-Jensen and Wang and contributes to a series of efforts aimed at addressing this problem for specific graph classes. This work continues the research on semicomplete composition [Bang-Jensen, Gutin and Yeo, J. Graph Theory, 2020]; on locally semicomplete digraphs [Bang-Jensen and Huang, J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 2010]; on a type of tournaments [Bang-Jensen and Yeo, Combinatorica, 2004].</description>

      <title>Some Property of an Ultrafilter and Graph parameters on Connectivity System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02299v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ultrafilter is a maximal filter on a set, playing a crucial role in set theory and topology for rigorously handling limits, convergence, and compactness. A connectivity system is defined as a pair (X, f), where X is a finite set and f is a symmetric submodular function. Understanding the duality in these parameters helps to elucidate the relationship between different decompositions and measures of a graph's complexity. In this paper, we delve into ultrafilters on connectivity systems, applying Tukey's Lemma to these systems. Additionally, we explore prefilters, ultra-prefilters, and subbases within the context of connectivity systems. Furthermore, we introduce and investigate new parameters related to width, length, and depth.</description>

      <title>Characterization of geodesic distance on infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph and let $d_G$ be the geodesic distance on $V(G)$. The metric spaces $(V(G), d_{G})$ are characterized up to isometry for all finite connected $G$ by David C. Kay and Gary Chartrand in 1964. The main result of the paper expands this characterization on the infinite connected graphs. We also prove that every metric space with integer distances between its points admits an isometric embedding into $(V(G), d_G)$ for suitable $G$.</description>

      <title>Disproof of a conjecture by Erd\H{o}s, Gimbel and Straight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cochromatic number $\zeta(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the smallest number of colors in a vertex-coloring of $G$ such that every color class induces an independent set or a clique. In 1988, Erd\H{o}s, Gimbel and Straight conjectured that every $K_5$-free graph $G$ with $\zeta(G)&gt;3$ satisfies $\chi(G)\le \zeta(G)+2$. In this note, we present a counterexample to this conjecture and discuss related results and questions.</description>

      <title>A Characterisation of lines in finite Lie incidence geometries of classical type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider any classical Grassmannian geometry $\Gamma$, that is, any projective or polar Grassmann space. Suppose lines have size s + 1. Then we classify all sets of size s + 1 with the property that no object of opposite type in the corresponding building, is opposite every point of the set. It turns out that such sets are either lines, or hyperbolic lines in suitable residues isomorphic to (symplectic) generalised quadrangles (where the restriction in parentheses only holds for rank at least 3; if $\Gamma$ has rank 2 then any hyperbolic line of size s + 1 does the job). This is a far-reaching extension of a famous and fundamental result of Bose &amp; Burton in the 1960s.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of $q$-Mahonian numbers of type $B$ and log-concavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of earlier work of Arslan \cite{Ars}, who introduced the Mahonian number of type $B$ by using a new statistic on the hyperoctahedral group $B_{n}$, in response to questions he suggested in his paper entitled "{\it A combinatorial interpretation of Mahonian numbers of type $B$}" published in arXiv:2404.05099v1. We first give the Knuth-Netto formula and generating function for the subdiagonals on or below the main diagonal of the Mahonian numbers of type $B$, then its combinatorial interpretations by lattice path/partition and tiling. Next, we propose a $q$-analogue of Mahonian numbers of type $B$ by using a new statistics on the permutations of the hyperoctahedral group $B_n$ that we introduced, then we study their basic properties and their combinatorial interpretations by lattice path/partition and tiling. Finally, we prove combinatorially that the $q$-analogue of Mahonian numbers of type $B$ form a strongly $q$-log-concave sequence of polynomials in $k$, which implies that the Mahonian numbers of type $B$ form a log-concave sequence in $k$ and therefore unimodal.</description>

Then we characterized gapsets which leads to a more efficient computational approach towards numerical semigroups and finally we introduce the extension of gapsets and prove that the sequence of the number of gapsets of size $g$ is non-decreasing as a weak version of Bras-Amor\'os's conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say a red/blue edge-coloring of the $n$-dimensional cube graph, $Q_n$, is antipodal if all pairs of antipodal edges have different colors. Norine conjectured that in such a coloring there must exist a pair of antipodal vertices connected by a monochromatic path. Previous work has proven this conjecture for $n\le 6$. Using SAT solvers we verify that the conjecture holds for $n = 7$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending a classic result of Johnson and Newman, this paper provides a matrix characterization for two generalized cospectral graphs with a pair of generalized cospectral vertex-deleted subgraphs. As an application, we present a new condition for the reconstructibility of a graph. In particular, we show that a graph with at least three vertices is reconstructible if there exists a vertex-deleted subgraph that is almost controllable and has a nontrivial automorphism.</description>

      <title>Graphon branching processes and fractional isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their study of the giant component in inhomogeneous random graphs, Bollob\'as, Janson, and Riordan introduced a class of branching processes parametrized by a possibly unbounded graphon. We prove that two such branching processes have the same distribution if and only if the corresponding graphons are fractionally isomorphic, a notion introduced by Greb\'ik and Rocha.
  A different class of branching processes was introduced by Hladk\'y, Nachmias, and Tran in relation to uniform spanning trees in finite graphs approximating a given connected graphon. We prove that two such branching processes have the same distribution if and only if the corresponding graphons are fractionally isomorphic up to scalar multiple. Combined with a recent result of Archer and Shalev, this implies that if uniform spanning trees of two dense graphs have a similar local structure, they have a similar scaling limit.
  As a side result we give a characterization of fractional isomorphism for graphs as well as graphons in terms of their connected components.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the higher weight spectra of $q$-ary Reed-Muller codes $C_q=RM_q(2,2)$ for all prime powers $q$. This is equivalent to finding the usual weight distributions of all extension codes of $C_q$ over every field extension of $F_q$ of finite degree. To obtain our results we will utilize well-known connections between these weights and properties of the Stanley-Reisner rings of a series of matroids associated to each code $C_q$. In the process, we are able to explicitly determine all the graded Betti numbers of matroids associated to $C_q$ and its elongations.</description>

In fact we obtain the same conclusion for every cycle $C_\ell$ with $\ell\geq 19$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental results show that, when the order $n$ is odd, there are de Bruijn sequences such that the corresponding complement sequence and the reverse sequence are the same. In this paper, we propose one efficient method to generate such de Bruijn sequences. This solves an open problem asked by Fredricksen forty years ago for showing the existence of such de Bruijn sequences when the odd order $n &gt;1$. Moreover, we refine a characterization of de Bruijn sequences with the same complement and reverse sequences and study the number of these de Bruijn sequences, as well as the distribution of de Bruijn sequences of the maximum linear complexity.</description>

      <title>On the central ball in a translation invariant involutive field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The iterated composition of two operators, both of which are involutions and translation invariant, partitions the set of lattice points in the plane into an infinite sequence of discrete parabolas. Each such parabola contains an associated stairway-like path connecting certain points on it, induced by the alternating application of the aforementioned operators. Any two lattice points in the plane can be connected by paths along the square grid composed of steps either on these stairways or towards taxicab neighbors. This leads to the notion of the parabolic-taxicab distance between two lattice points, obtained as the minimum number of steps of this kind needed to reach one point from the other.
  In this paper, we describe patterns generated by points on paths of bounded parabolic-taxicab length and provide a complete description of the balls centered at the origin. In particular, we prove an earlier conjecture on the area of these balls.</description>

Abstract: This paper is about the positive part $U_q^+$ of the $q$-deformed enveloping algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$. The algebra $U_q^+$ admits an embedding, due to Rosso, into a $q$-shuffle algebra $\mathbb{V}$. The underlying vector space of $\mathbb{V}$ is the free algebra on two generators $x,y$. Therefore, the algebra $\mathbb{V}$ has a basis consisting of the words in $x,y$. Let $U$ denote the image of $U_q^+$ under the Rosso embedding. In our first main result, we find all the words in $x,y$ that are contained in $U$. One type of solution is called alternating. The alternating words have been studied by Terwilliger. There is another type of solution, which we call doubly alternating. In our second main result, we display many commutator relations involving the doubly alternating words. In our third main result, we describe how the doubly alternating words are related to the alternating words.</description>

      <title>A polynomial resultant approach to algebraic constructions of extremal graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.15148v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Tur\'{a}n problem asks for the largest number of edges ex$(n,H)$ in an $n$-vertex graph not containing a fixed forbidden subgraph $H$, which is one of the most important problems in extremal graph theory. However the order of magnitude of ex$(n,H)$ for bipartite graphs is known only in a handful of cases. In particular, giving explicit constructions of extremal graphs is very challenging in this field. In this paper, we develop a polynomail resultant approach to algebraic construction of explicit extremal graphs, which can efficiently decide whether a specified structure exists. A key insight in our approach is the multipolynomial resultant, which is a fundamental tool of computational algebraic geometry. Our main results include the matched lowers bounds for Tur\'{a}n number of $1$-subdivision of $K_{3,t_{1}}$ and linear Tur\'{a}n number of Berge theta hyerpgraph $\Theta_{3,t_{2}}^{B}$ with $t_{1}=25$ and $t_{2}=217$. Moreover, the constant $t_{1}$ improves the random algebraic construction of Bukh and Conlon~[Rational exponents in extremal graph theory, J. Eur. Math. Soc. 20 (2018), 1747-1757] and makes progress on the known estimation for the smallest value of $t_{1}$ concerning a problem posed by Conlon, Janzer and Lee ~[More on the extremal number of subdivisions, Combinatorica, to appear], while the constant $t_{2}$ improves a result of He and Tait~[Hypergraphs with few berge paths of fixed length between vertices, SIAM J. Discrete Math., 33(3), 1472-1481].</description>

Abstract: The number of unbalanced interior nodes of divide-and-conquer trees on $n$ leaves is known to form a sequence of dilations of the Takagi function on dyadic rationals. We use this fact to derive identities on the Takagi function and on the Hamming weight of an integer in terms of the Takagi function.</description>

      <title>Simple Procedures for Left and Right Keys of Semi-Standard Young Tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give simple procedures to obtain the left and right keys of a semi-standard Young tableau. Keys derive their interest from the fact that they encode the characters of Demazure and opposite Demazure modules for the general and special linear groups. Given the importance of keys, there are indeed several procedures available in the literature to determine them. In comparison, our procedures are new (to the best of our knowledge) and especially simple. Having said that, we hasten to add that there is nothing new in any individual ingredient that goes into our procedures. These ingredients are all routine, straightforward, and (in any case) occur in the literature. But they never quite seem to have been put together as done here.
  Our procedures end up repeatedly performing the Deodhar lifts, maximal lifts for the left key and minimal lifts for right key. Together with the well known fact that keys can be obtained by such repeated lifts, this justifies the procedures. The relevance of Deodhar lifts to combinatorial models for Demazure characters is well known in Standard Monomial Theory. Right and left keys appear respectively as initial and final directions of Lakshmibai-Seshadri paths in Littelmanns Path Model Theory.</description>

Abstract: A matroid M is cyclically orderable if there is a cyclic permutation of the elements of M such that any r consecutive elements form a basis in M. An old conjecture of Kajitani, Miyano, and Ueno states that a matroid M is cyclically orderable if and only if for all nonempty subsets X in E(M), |X|/r(M) is less than or equal to |E(M)|/r(M). In this paper, we verify this conjecture for all paving matroids.</description>

      <title>On CNF formulas irredundant with respect to unit clause propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01750v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two CNF formulas are called ucp-equivalent, if they behave in the same way with respect to the unit clause propagation (UCP). A formula is called ucp-irredundant, if removing any clause leads to a formula which is not ucp-equivalent to the original one. As a consequence of known results, the ratio of the size of a ucp-irredundant formula and the size of a smallest ucp-equivalent formula is at most $n^2$, where $n$ is the number of the variables. We demonstrate an example of a ucp-irredundant formula for a symmetric definite Horn function which is larger than a smallest ucp-equivalent formula by a factor $\Omega(n/\ln n)$ and, hence, a general upper bound on the above ratio cannot be smaller than this.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of matroids, called graph curve matroids. A graph curve matroid is associated to a graph and defined on the vertices of the graph as a ground set. We prove that these matroids provide a combinatorial description of hyperplane sections of degenerate canonical curves in algebraic geometry. Our focus lies on graphs that are 2-connected and trivalent, which define identically self-dual graph curve matroids, but we also develop generalizations. Finally, we provide an algorithm to compute the graph curve matroid associated to a given graph, as well as an implementation and data of examples that can be used in Macaulay2.</description>

Abstract: We showed with J. P. Gollin that if a (possibly infinite) homogeneous linear equation system has only the trivial solution, then there exists an injective function from the variables to the equations such that each variable appears with non-zero coefficient in its image. Shortly after, a more elementary proof was found by Aharoni and Guo. In this note we present a very short matroid-theoretic proof of this theorem.</description>

      <title>Counting induced subgraphs with the Kromatic symmetric function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chromatic symmetric function $X_G$ is a sum of monomials corresponding to proper vertex colorings of a graph $G$. Crew, Pechenik, and Spirkl (2023) recently introduced a $K$-theoretic analogue $\overline{X}_G$ called the Kromatic symmetric function, where each vertex is instead assigned a nonempty set of colors such that adjacent vertices have nonoverlapping color sets. $X_G$ does not distinguish all graphs, but a longstanding open question is whether it distinguishes all trees. We conjecture that $\overline{X}_G$ does distinguish all graphs. As evidence towards this conjecture, we show that $\overline{X}_G$ determines the number of copies in $G$ of certain induced subgraphs on 4 and 5 vertices as well as the number of induced subgraphs isomorphic to each graph consisting of a star plus some number of isolated vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a matching $M$ in the hypercube $Q^n$, the \emph{profile} of $M$ is the vector $\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,\ldots, x_n) \in \mathbb{N}^n$ such that $M$ contains $x_i$ edges whose endpoints differ in the $i$th coordinate. If $M$ is a perfect matching, then it is clear that $||\boldsymbol{x}||_1 = 2^{n-1}$ and it is easy to show that each $x_i$ must be even. Verifying a special case of a conjecture of Balister, Gy\H{o}ri, and Schelp, we show that these conditions are also sufficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set of $2^n$ candidates is presented to a commission. At every round, each member of this commission votes by pairwise comparison, and one-half of the candidates is deleted from the tournament, the remaining ones proceeding to the next round until the $n$-th round (the final one) in which the final winner is declared. The candidates are arranged on a board in a given order, which is maintained among the remaining candidates at all rounds. A study of the size of the commission is carried out in order to obtain the desired result of any candidate being a possible winner. For $2^n$ candidates with $n \geq 3$, we identify a voting profile with $4n -3$ voters such that any candidate could win just by choosing a proper initial order of the candidates. Moreover, in the setting of a random number of voters, we obtain the same results, with high probability, when the expected number of voters is large.</description>

      <title>Dual Ramsey degrees for some graph-like structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show that some natural classes of structures such as graphs, posets and metric spaces have both dual small and dual big Ramsey degrees with respect to some natural classes of morphisms such as quotient maps in case of graphs and posets, or non-expansive surjections in case of metric spaces. The only exception is the class of reflexive tournaments: they have neither dual small nor dual big Ramsey degrees. Our proof strategy is based on the categorical interpretation of structural Ramsey theory. Starting from a category we are interested in, we engineer an synthetic expansion to piggyback on a category where the dual Ramsey property has been established. We then use the additive properties of dual Ramsey degrees to get back to the original category of "natural" objects and morphisms and conclude that it has finite dual Ramsey degrees.</description>

Abstract: We characterize compatible families of real-rooted polynomials, allowing both positive and negative leading coefficients. Our characterization naturally generalizes the same-sign characterization used by Chudnovsky and Seymour in their famous 2007 paper proving the real-rootedness of independence polynomials of claw-free graphs, thus fully settling a question left open in their paper. Our methods are generally speaking elementary, utilizing mainly linear algebra and the established theory of interlacing polynomials, with a bit of invariant theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:math/0209005v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1986, Oliver Pretzel studied the set of orientations of a connected finite graph $G$ and showed that any two such orientations having the same flow-difference around all closed loops can be obtained from one another by a succession of local moves of a simple type. Here I show that the set of orientations of $G$ having the same flow-differences around all closed loops can be given the structure of a distributive lattice. When the graph is drawn on the plane, a dual version of the construction puts a distributive lattice structure on the set of orientations of $G$ having the same indegrees at all vertices. In both settings, adjacent lattice-elements are related by simple local moves. This construction unifies earlier, similar constructions in combinatorics and statistical mechanics. It also gives rise to a lattice structure on spanning trees that seems to be new.</description>

Abstract: The Tautological Lamination arises in holomorphic dynamics as a combinatorial model for the geometry of 1-dimensional slices of the Shift Locus. In each degree $q$ the tautological lamination defines an iterated sequence of partitions of $1$ (one for each integer $n$) into numbers of the form $2^m q^{-n}$. Denote by $N_q(n,m)$ the number of times $2^mq^{-n}$ arises in the $n$th partition. We prove a recursion formula for $N_q(n,0)$, and a gap theorem: $N_q(n,n)=1$ and $N_q(n,m)=0$ for $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor &lt; m &lt; n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any polarization of an artin monomial ideal defines a triangulated ball. This proves a conjecture of A.Almousa, H.Lohne and the first author.
  Geometrically, polarizations of ideals containing $(x_1^{a_1}, \ldots, x_n^{a_n})$ define full-dimensional triangulated balls on the sphere which is the join of boundaries of simplices of dimensions $a_1-1, \cdots, a_n-1$. We give a simple description of the boundaries of these triangulated balls, which are triangulated spheres.
  Combinatorially, these triangulated balls derive from subsets of products of finite sets $A_1 \times A_2 \times \cdots \times A_n$ which we call bitight. The subset and its complement fulfill exchange conditions similar to that of matroids.
  In the appendix we show that the squeezed balls of G.Kalai derive from polarizations of artin monomial ideals</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of a family of polytopes that naturally arise in connection with a problem in distributed data storage, namely service rate region polytopes. The service rate region of a distributed coded system describes the data access requests that the underlying system can support. In this paper, we study the polytope structure of the service rate region with the primary goal of describing its geometric shape and properties. We achieve so by introducing various structural parameters of the service rate region and establishing upper and lower bounds for them. The techniques we apply in this paper range from coding theory to optimization. One of our main results shows that every rational point of the service rate region has a so-called rational allocation, answering an open question in the research area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13250v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the distributions of lengths of runs in random sequences of elements from a totally ordered set (total order) or partially ordered set (partial order). In particular, we produce novel formulae for the expected value, variance, and probability generating function (PGF) of such lengths in the case of an arbitrary total order. Our focus is on the case of distributions with both atoms and diffuse (absolutely or singularly continuous) mass which has not been addressed in this generality before. We also provide a method of calculating the PGF of run lengths for countably series-parallel partial orders. Additionally, we prove a strong law of large numbers for the distribution of run lengths in a particular realization of an infinite sequence.</description>

      <title>Cross-ratio degrees and triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cross-ratio degree problem counts configurations of n points on P^1 with n-3 prescribed cross-ratios. Cross-ratio degrees arise in many corners of combinatorics and geometry, but their structure is not well-understood in general. Interestingly, examining various special cases of the problem can yield combinatorial structures that are both diverse and rich. In this paper we prove a simple closed formula for a class of cross-ratio degrees indexed by triangulations of an n-gon; these degrees are connected to the geometry of the real locus of M_{0,n}, and to positive geometry.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Holographic Entropy Cone via Cycle Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by bit threads, we introduce a new prescription for computing entropy vectors outside the holographic entropy cone. By utilizing cycle flows on directed graphs, we show that the maximum cycle flow associated to any subset of vertices, which corresponds to a subsystem, manifestly obeys purification symmetry. Furthermore, by restricting ourselves to a subclass of directed graphs, we prove that the maximum cycle flow obeys both subadditivity and strong subadditivity, thereby establishing it as a viable candidate for the entropy associated to the subsystem. Finally, we demonstrate how our model generalizes the entropy vectors obtainable via conventional flows in undirected graphs, as well as conjecture that our model similarly generalizes the entropy vectors arising from hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>On the resilience of the quadratic Littlewood-Offord problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical resilience of the anti-concentration properties of Rademacher polynomials in face of adversarial deterministic noise taking the form of sign-flips. Given a multilinear polynomial $f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ and a Rademacher vector $\boldsymbol{\xi} \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ (with independent entries), our results provide probabilistic lower bound estimations on the number of sign-flips that $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ can sustain without ``inflating" the atom probability $\sup_{x \in \mathbb{R} } \mathbb{P}\{f(\boldsymbol{\xi}) = x\}$ otherwise resulting in an adversarially biased distribution. Special emphasis is put on bilinear and quadratic forms, for which strengthened estimates are attained. From a computational perspective, our results in this venue are instance-bound in such a way that allows for an efficient computation of the statistical resilience guarantees from the quadratic polynomial itself directly. All of our probabilistic lower bound resilience guarantees are asymptotically tight.
  On route, we provide a short proof for a new small-ball probability estimate fitting Rademacher multilinear polynomials $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ removeing a polylog-factor from the classical Meka-Nguyen-Vu bound provided the coefficients are independent of $n$ (dimension-free, hereafter). This removal was conjectured to be possible by Meka-Nguyen-Vu regardless of our assumption. Bilinear Rademacher forms with dimension-free coefficients arise naturally in Combinatorics and specifically in the dense case of the edge-statistics conjecture posed by Alon, Hefetz, Krivelevich, and Tyomkyn. This case of the conjecture was resolved by Kwan and Sauermann. Replacing the appeal to the Meka-Nguyen-Vu classical bound in the work of Kwan, Sudakov, and Tran with our shortly proved result attains an additional proof of the dense case of the edge-statistics conjecture.</description>

      <title>Fast computation of permanents over $\mathbb{F}_3$ via $\mathbb{F}_2$ arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method of representing an element of $\mathbb{F}_3^n$ as an element of $\mathbb{F}_n^2 \times \mathbb{F}_n^2$ which in practice will be a pair of unsigned integers. We show how to do addition, subtraction and pointwise multiplication and division of such vectors quickly using primitive binary operations (and, or, xor). We use this machinery to develop a fast algorithm for computing the permanent of a matrix in $\mathbb{F}_3^{n\times n}$. We present Julia code for a natural implementation of the permanent and show that our improved implementation gives, roughly, a factor of 80 speedup for problems of practical size. Using this improved code, we perform Monte Carlo simulations that suggest that the distribution of $\mbox{perm}(A)$ tends to the uniform distribution as $n \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Fra\"{i}ss\'{e}'s Conjecture and big Ramsey degrees of structures admitting finite monomorphic decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that a countable structure admitting a finite monomorphic decomposition has finite big Ramsey degrees if and only if so does every monomorphic part in its minimal monomorphic decomposition. The necessary prerequisite for this result is the characterization of monomorphic structures with finite big Ramsey degrees: a countable monomorphic structure has finite big Ramsey degrees if and only if it is chainable by a chain with finite big Ramsey degrees. Interestingly, both characterizations require deep structural properties of chains. Fra\"{i}ss\'{e}'s Conjecture (actually, its positive resolution due to Laver) is instrumental in the characterization of monomorphic structures with finite big Ramsey degrees, while the analysis of big Ramsey combinatorics of structures admitting a finite monomorphic decomposition requires a product Ramsey theorem for big Ramsey degrees. We find this last result particularly intriguing because big Ramsey degrees misbehave notoriously when it comes to general product statements.</description>
