      <title>Large-Scale Knowledge Integration for Enhanced Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-training machine learning models on molecular properties has proven effective for generating robust and generalizable representations, which is critical for advancements in drug discovery and materials science. While recent work has primarily focused on data-driven approaches, the KANO model introduces a novel paradigm by incorporating knowledge-enhanced pre-training. In this work, we expand upon KANO by integrating the large-scale ChEBI knowledge graph, which includes 2,840 functional groups -- significantly more than the original 82 used in KANO. We explore two approaches, Replace and Integrate, to incorporate this extensive knowledge into the KANO framework. Our results demonstrate that including ChEBI leads to improved performance on 9 out of 14 molecular property prediction datasets. This highlights the importance of utilizing a larger and more diverse set of functional groups to enhance molecular representations for property predictions.

      <title>Deep vectorised operators for pulsatile hemodynamics estimation in coronary arteries from a steady-state prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular hemodynamic fields provide valuable medical decision markers for coronary artery disease. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is the gold standard for accurate, non-invasive evaluation of these quantities in vivo. In this work, we propose a time-efficient surrogate model, powered by machine learning, for the estimation of pulsatile hemodynamics based on steady-state priors. We introduce deep vectorised operators, a modelling framework for discretisation independent learning on infinite-dimensional function spaces. The underlying neural architecture is a neural field conditioned on hemodynamic boundary conditions. Importantly, we show how relaxing the requirement of point-wise action to permutation-equivariance leads to a family of models that can be parametrised by message passing and self-attention layers. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 74 stenotic coronary arteries extracted from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) with patient-specific pulsatile CFD simulations as ground truth. We show that our model produces accurate estimates of the pulsatile velocity and pressure while being agnostic to re-sampling of the source domain (discretisation independence). This shows that deep vectorised operators are a powerful modelling tool for cardiovascular hemodynamics estimation in coronary arteries and beyond.</description>

      <title>Beyond Sequence: Impact of Geometric Context for RNA Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of RNA properties, such as stability and interactions, is crucial for advancing our understanding of biological processes and developing RNA-based therapeutics. RNA structures can be represented as 1D sequences, 2D topological graphs, or 3D all-atom models, each offering different insights into its function. Existing works predominantly focus on 1D sequence-based models, which overlook the geometric context provided by 2D and 3D geometries. This study presents the first systematic evaluation of incorporating explicit 2D and 3D geometric information into RNA property prediction, considering not only performance but also real-world challenges such as limited data availability, partial labeling, sequencing noise, and computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce a newly curated set of RNA datasets with enhanced 2D and 3D structural annotations, providing a resource for model evaluation on RNA data. Our findings reveal that models with explicit geometry encoding generally outperform sequence-based models, with an average prediction RMSE reduction of around 12% across all various RNA tasks and excelling in low-data and partial labeling regimes, underscoring the value of explicitly incorporating geometric context. On the other hand, geometry-unaware sequence-based models are more robust under sequencing noise but often require around 2-5x training data to match the performance of geometry-aware models. Our study offers further insights into the trade-offs between different RNA representations in practical applications and addresses a significant gap in evaluating deep learning models for RNA tasks.</description>

      <title>Multiple Gaussian process models based global sensitivity analysis and efficient optimization of in vitro mRNA transcription process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The in vitro transcription (IVT) process is a critical step in RNA production. To ensure the efficiency of RNA manufacturing, it is essential to optimize and identify its key influencing factors. In this study, multiple Gaussian Process (GP) models are used to perform efficient optimization and global sensitivity analysis (GSA). Firstly, multiple GP models were constructed using the data from multiple experimental replicates, accurately capturing the complexities of the IVT process. Then GSA was conducted to determine the dominant reaction factors, specifically the concentrations of reactants NTP and Mg across all data-driven models. Concurrently, a multi-start optimization algorithm was applied to these GP models to identify optimal operational conditions that maximize RNA yields across all surrogate models. These optimized conditions are subsequently validated through additional experimental data.</description>

      <title>End-Stage Liver Disease Comorbidities in Patients Awaiting Transplantation: Identification and Impact on Liver Transplant Survival</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-Stage Liver Disease (ESLD), a complex condition, has high rates of co-occurring comorbidities affecting multiple organ systems. There is no clear evidence-based practice (EBP) guidelines addressing the progression of comorbidities in ESLD patients awaiting liver transplantation (LT) and their impact on survival, both pre- and post-transplant. This study aimed to identify and quantify the trajectory of the most common and deteriorating comorbidities in ESLD patients awaiting LT and to analyze their effect on patient outcomes. An initial exploratory phase to identify frequent comorbidities in ESLD patients. Relevant EBP-driven data for diagnosing and measuring the progression of these conditions were collected and organized into five research matrices. In the quantitative phase, a retrospective analysis was conducted using longitudinal de-identified data from electronic health records (EHR) for patients who underwent LT between 2011-2021. Data included demographics, labs, procedures, and medications. Descriptive statistics and survival analysis assessed the association of comorbidities with post-transplant survival. The five most frequent comorbidities identified were Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), Malnutrition, Portal Hypertension (PH), and Ascites. Of the 722 patients analyzed, 68.2% were male, mean age of 54.81 (SD = 11.24), and 19.8% died post-LT. Survival analysis showed a gradual decline over time, with the most significant drop at five years post-LT. Significant predictors of post-LT survival were age at transplant (p=0.01), waitlist time (p=0.004), DM at listing (p=0.02), low albumin (p=0.03), and CKD stage 5 development after listing (p=0.04). This study highlights the variability in diagnosing and measuring comorbidities in ESLD patients and provides insights into their progression and impact on post-LT survival.</description>

      <title>In-vivo high-resolution \chi-separation at 7T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12239v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently introduced quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) technique, $\chi$-separation, offers the capability to separate paramagnetic ($\chi_{\text{para}}$) and diamagnetic ($\chi_{\text{dia}}$) susceptibility distribution within the brain. In-vivo high-resolution mapping of iron and myelin distribution, estimated by $\chi$-separation, could provide a deeper understanding of brain substructures, assisting the investigation of their functions and alterations. This can be achieved using 7T MRI, which benefits from a high signal-to-noise ratio and susceptibility effects. However, applying $\chi$-separation at 7T presents difficulties due to the requirement of an $R_2$ map, coupled with issues such as high specific absorption rate (SAR), large $B_1$ transmit field inhomogeneities, and prolonged scan time.
  To address these challenges, we developed a novel deep neural network, R2PRIMEnet7T, designed to convert a 7T $R_2^*$ map into a 3T $R_2'$ map. Building on this development, we present a new pipeline for $\chi$-separation at 7T, enabling us to generate high-resolution $\chi$-separation maps from multi-echo gradient-echo data. The proposed method is compared with alternative pipelines, such as an end-to-end network and linearly-scaled $R_2'$, and is validated against $\chi$-separation maps at 3T, demonstrating its accuracy. The 7T $\chi$-separation maps generated by the proposed method exhibit similar contrasts to those from 3T, while 7T high-resolution maps offer enhanced clarity and detail. Quantitative analysis confirms that the proposed method surpasses the alternative pipelines. The proposed method results well delineate the detailed brain structures associated with iron and myelin. This new pipeline holds promise for analyzing iron and myelin concentration changes in various neurodegenerative diseases through precise structural examination.</description>

      <title>Automatic Screening for Children with Speech Disorder using Automatic Speech Recognition: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech is a fundamental aspect of human life, crucial not only for communication but also for cognitive, social, and academic development. Children with speech disorders (SD) face significant challenges that, if unaddressed, can result in lasting negative impacts. Traditionally, speech and language assessments (SLA) have been conducted by skilled speech-language pathologists (SLPs), but there is a growing need for efficient and scalable SLA methods powered by artificial intelligence. This position paper presents a survey of existing techniques suitable for automating SLA pipelines, with an emphasis on adapting automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for children's speech, an overview of current SLAs and their automated counterparts to demonstrate the feasibility of AI-enhanced SLA pipelines, and a discussion of practical considerations, including accessibility and privacy concerns, associated with the deployment of AI-powered SLAs.</description>

      <title>Learning to rumble: Automated elephant call classification, detection and endpointing using deep architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of detecting, isolating and classifying elephant calls in continuously recorded audio. Such automatic call characterisation can assist conservation efforts and inform environmental management strategies. In contrast to previous work in which call detection was performed at a segment level, we perform call detection at a frame level which implicitly also allows call endpointing, the isolation of a call in a longer recording. For experimentation, we employ two annotated datasets, one containing Asian and the other African elephant vocalisations. We evaluate several shallow and deep classifier models, and show that the current best performance can be improved by using an audio spectrogram transformer (AST), a neural architecture which has not been used for this purpose before, and which we have configured in a novel sequence-to-sequence manner. We also show that using transfer learning by pre-training leads to further improvements both in terms of computational complexity and performance. Finally, we consider sub-call classification using an accepted taxonomy of call types, a task which has not previously been considered. We show that also in this case the transformer architectures provide the best performance. Our best classifiers achieve an average precision (AP) of 0.962 for framewise binary call classification, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.957 and 0.979 for call classification with 5 classes and sub-call classification with 7 classes respectively. All of these represent either new benchmarks (sub-call classifications) or improvements on previously best systems. We conclude that a fully-automated elephant call detection and subcall classification system is within reach. Such a system would provide valuable information on the behaviour and state of elephant herds for the purposes of conservation and management.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium microbial dynamics unveil a new macroecological pattern beyond Taylor's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive analytical benchmark, relying on Fokker-Planck formalism, to study microbial dynamics in presence of both biotic and abiotic forces. In equilibrium, we observe a balance between the two kinds of forces, leading to no correlations between species abundances. This implies that real microbiomes, where correlations have been observed, operate out of equilibrium. Therefore, we analyze non-equilibrium dynamics, presenting an ansatz for an approximate solution that embodies the complex interplay of forces in the system. This solution is consistent with Taylor's law as a coarse-grained approximation of the relation between species abundance and variance, but implies subtler effects, predicting unobserved structure beyond Taylor's law. Motivated by this theoretical prediction, we refine the analysis of existing metagenomic data, unveiling a novel universal macroecological pattern. Finally, we speculate on the physical origin of Taylor's law: building upon an analogy with Brownian motion theory, we propose that Taylor's law emerges as a Fluctuation-Growth relation resulting from equipartition of environmental resources among microbial species.</description>
