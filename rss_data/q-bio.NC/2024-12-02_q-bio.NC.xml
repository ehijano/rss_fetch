      <title>Traits and tangles: An analysis of the Big Five paradigm by tangle-based clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the recently developed mathematical theory of tangles, we re-assess the mathematical foundations for applications of the five factor model in personality tests by a new, mathematically rigorous, quantitative method. Our findings broadly confirm the validity of current tests, but also show that more detailed information can be extracted from existing data. We found that the big five traits appear at different levels of scrutiny. Some already emerge at a coarse resolution of our tools at which others cannot yet be discerned, while at a resolution where these _can_ be discerned, and distinguished, some of the former traits are no longer visible but have split into more refined traits or disintegrated altogether. We also identified traits other than the five targeted in those tests. These include more general traits combining two or more of the big five, as well as more specific traits refining some of them. All our analysis is structural and quantitative, and thus rigorous in explicitly defined mathematical terms. Since tangles, once computed, can be described concisely in terms of very few explicit statements referring only to the test questions used, our findings are also directly open to interpretation by experts in psychology. Tangle analysis can be applied similarly to other topics in psychology. Our paper is intended to serve as a first indication of what may be possible.</description>

      <title>Decoding Imagined Movement in People with Multiple Sclerosis for Brain-Computer Interface Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a heterogeneous autoimmune-mediated disorder affecting the central nervous system, commonly manifesting as fatigue and progressive limb impairment. This can significantly impact quality of life due to weakness or paralysis in the upper and lower limbs. A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) aims to restore quality of life through control of an external device, such as a wheelchair. However, the limited BCI research in people with MS is insufficient. The current study aims to expand on the current MS-BCI literature by highlighting the feasibility of decoding MS imagined movement. We collected electroencephalography (EEG) data from eight participants with various symptoms of MS and ten neurotypical control participants. Participants made imagined movements of the hands and feet as directed by a go no-go protocol. Binary regularised linear discriminant analysis was used to classify imagined movement at individual time-frequency points. The frequency bands which provided the maximal accuracy, and the associated latency, were compared. In all MS participants, the classification algorithm achieved above 70% accuracy in at least one imagined movement vs. rest classification and most movement vs. movement classifications. There was no significant difference between classification of limbs with weakness or paralysis to neurotypical controls. Both the MS and control groups possessed decodable information within the alpha (7-13 Hz) and beta (16-30 Hz) bands at similar latency. This study is the first to demonstrate the feasibility of decoding imagined movements in people with MS. As an alternative to the P300 response, motor imagery-based control of a BCI may also be combined with existing motor imagery therapy to supplement MS rehabilitation. These promising results merit further long term BCI studies to investigate the effect of MS progression on classification performance.</description>

      <title>The role of inhibitory neuronal variability in modulating phase diversity between coupled networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuronal heterogeneity, characterized by the presence of a multitude of spiking neuronal patterns, is a widespread phenomenon throughout the nervous system. In particular, the brain exhibits strong variability among inhibitory neurons. Despite the huge neuronal heterogeneity across brain regions, which in principle could decrease synchronization, cortical areas coherently oscillate during various cognitive tasks. Therefore, the functional significance of neuronal heterogeneity remains a subject of active investigation. Previous studies typically focus on the role of heterogeneity in the dynamic properties of only one population. Here, we explore how different types of inhibitory neurons can contribute to the diversity of the phase relations between two cortical areas. This research sheds light on the potential impact of local properties, such as neuronal variability, on communication between distant brain regions. We show that both homogeneous and heterogeneous inhibitory networks can exhibit phase diversity and nonintuitive regimes such as anticipated synchronization (AS) and phase bistability. It has been proposed that the bi-stable phase could be related to bi-stable perception, such as in the Necker cube. Moreover, we show that heterogeneity enlarges the region of zero-lag synchronization and bistability. We also show that the parameter controlling inhibitory heterogeneity modulates the transition from the usual delayed synchronization regime (DS) to AS. Finally, we show that the inhibitory heterogeneity drives the internal dynamics of the free-running population. Therefore, we suggest a possible mechanism to explain when the DS-AS transition occurs via zero-lag synchronization or bi-stability.</description>

      <title>Neuroplasticity and Psychedelics: a comprehensive examination of classic and non-classic compounds in pre and clinical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuroplasticity, the ability of the nervous system to adapt throughout an organism's lifespan, offers potential as both a biomarker and treatment target for neuropsychiatric conditions. Psychedelics, a burgeoning category of drugs, are increasingly prominent in psychiatric research, prompting inquiries into their mechanisms of action. Distinguishing themselves from traditional medications, psychedelics demonstrate rapid and enduring therapeutic effects after a single or few administrations, believed to stem from their neuroplasticity-enhancing properties. This review examines how classic psychedelics (e.g., LSD, psilocybin, N,N-DMT) and non-classic psychedelics (e.g., ketamine, MDMA) influence neuroplasticity. Drawing from preclinical and clinical studies, we explore the molecular, structural, and functional changes triggered by these agents. Animal studies suggest psychedelics induce heightened sensitivity of the nervous system to environmental stimuli (meta-plasticity), re-opening developmental windows for long-term structural changes (hyper-plasticity), with implications for mood and behavior. Translating these findings to humans faces challenges due to limitations in current imaging techniques. Nonetheless, promising new directions for human research are emerging, including the employment of novel positron-emission tomography (PET) radioligands, non-invasive brain stimulation methods, and multimodal approaches. By elucidating the interplay between psychedelics and neuroplasticity, this review informs the development of targeted interventions for neuropsychiatric disorders and advances understanding of psychedelics' therapeutic potential.</description>

      <title>Bayesian mechanics of self-organising systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian mechanics provides a framework that addresses dynamical systems that can be conceptualised as Bayesian inference. However, elucidating the requisite generative models is essential for empirical applications to realistic self-organising systems. This work shows that the Hamiltonian of generic dynamical systems constitutes a class of generative models, thus rendering their Helmholtz energy equivalent to variational free energy under the identified generative model. The self-organisation that minimises the Helmholtz energy entails matching the system's Hamiltonian with that of the environment, leading to the ensuing emergence of their generalised synchrony. In essence, these self-organising systems can be read as performing variational Bayesian inference of their interacting environment. These properties have been demonstrated using coupled oscillators, simulated and living neural networks, and quantum computers. This framework offers foundational characterisations and predictions regarding asymptotic properties of self-organising systems interacting with their environment, providing insights into potential mechanisms underlying the emergence of intelligence.</description>

      <title>Large language models surpass human experts in predicting neuroscience results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03230v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific discoveries often hinge on synthesizing decades of research, a task that potentially outstrips human information processing capacities. Large language models (LLMs) offer a solution. LLMs trained on the vast scientific literature could potentially integrate noisy yet interrelated findings to forecast novel results better than human experts. To evaluate this possibility, we created BrainBench, a forward-looking benchmark for predicting neuroscience results. We find that LLMs surpass experts in predicting experimental outcomes. BrainGPT, an LLM we tuned on the neuroscience literature, performed better yet. Like human experts, when LLMs were confident in their predictions, they were more likely to be correct, which presages a future where humans and LLMs team together to make discoveries. Our approach is not neuroscience-specific and is transferable to other knowledge-intensive endeavors.</description>

      <title>Reanimating Images using Neural Representations of Dynamic Stimuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While computer vision models have made incredible strides in static image recognition, they still do not match human performance in tasks that require the understanding of complex, dynamic motion. This is notably true for real-world scenarios where embodied agents face complex and motion-rich environments. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art video diffusion models to decouple static image representation from motion generation, enabling us to utilize fMRI brain activity for a deeper understanding of human responses to dynamic visual stimuli. Conversely, we also demonstrate that information about the brain's representation of motion can enhance the prediction of optical flow in artificial systems. Our novel approach leads to four main findings: (1) Visual motion, represented as fine-grained, object-level resolution optical flow, can be decoded from brain activity generated by participants viewing video stimuli; (2) Video encoders outperform image-based models in predicting video-driven brain activity; (3) Brain-decoded motion signals enable realistic video reanimation based only on the initial frame of the video; and (4) We extend prior work to achieve full video decoding from video-driven brain activity. This framework advances our understanding of how the brain represents spatial and temporal information in dynamic visual scenes. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining brain imaging with video diffusion models for developing more robust and biologically-inspired computer vision systems. We show additional decoding and encoding examples on this site: https://sites.google.com/view/neural-dynamics/home.</description>

      <title>Confidence is detection-like in high-dimensional spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Confidence estimates are often "detection-like" - driven by positive evidence in favour of a decision. This empirical observation has been interpreted as showing human metacognition is limited by biases or heuristics. Here we show that Bayesian confidence estimates also exhibit heightened sensitivity to decision-congruent evidence in higher-dimensional signal detection theoretic spaces, leading to detection-like confidence criteria. This effect is due to a nonlinearity induced by normalisation of confidence by a large number of unchosen alternatives. Our analysis suggests that detection-like confidence is rational when computing confidence in a higher-dimensional evidence space than that assumed by the experimenter.</description>

      <title>Homogenized $\textit{C. elegans}$ Neural Activity and Connectivity Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is renewed interest in modeling and understanding the nervous system of the nematode $\textit{Caenorhabditis elegans}$ ($\textit{C. elegans}$), as this small model system provides a path to bridge the gap between nervous system structure (connectivity) and function (physiology). However, existing physiology datasets, whether involving passive recording or stimulation, are in distinct formats, and connectome datasets require preprocessing before analysis can commence. Here we compile and homogenize datasets of neural activity and connectivity. Our neural activity dataset is derived from 11 $\textit{C. elegans}$ neuroimaging experiments, while our connectivity dataset is compiled from 9 connectome annotations based on 3 primary electron microscopy studies and 1 signal propagation study. Physiology datasets, collected under varying protocols, measure calcium fluorescence in labeled subsets of the worm's 300 neurons. Our preprocessing pipeline standardizes these datasets by consistently ordering labeled neurons and resampling traces to a common sampling rate, yielding recordings from approximately 900 worms and 250 uniquely labeled neurons. The connectome datasets, collected from electron microscopy reconstructions, represent the entire nervous system as a graph of connections. Our collection is accessible on HuggingFace, facilitating analysis of the structure-function relationship in biology using modern neural network architectures and enabling cross-lab and cross-animal comparisons.</description>

      <title>The brain versus AI: World-model-based versatile circuit computation underlying diverse functions in the neocortex and cerebellum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI's significant recent advances using general-purpose circuit computations offer a potential window into how the neocortex and cerebellum of the brain are able to achieve a diverse range of functions across sensory, cognitive, and motor domains, despite their uniform circuit structures. However, comparing the brain and AI is challenging unless clear similarities exist, and past reviews have been limited to comparison of brain-inspired vision AI and the visual neocortex. Here, to enable comparisons across diverse functional domains, we subdivide circuit computation into three elements -- circuit structure, input/outputs, and the learning algorithm -- and evaluate the similarities for each element. With this novel approach, we identify wide-ranging similarities and convergent evolution in the brain and AI, providing new insights into key concepts in neuroscience. Furthermore, inspired by processing mechanisms of AI, we propose a new theory that integrates established neuroscience theories, particularly the theories of internal models and the mirror neuron system. Both the neocortex and cerebellum predict future world events from past information and learn from prediction errors, thereby acquiring models of the world. These models enable three core processes: (1) Prediction -- generating future information, (2) Understanding -- interpreting the external world via compressed and abstracted sensory information, and (3) Generation -- repurposing the future-information generation mechanism to produce other types of outputs. The universal application of these processes underlies the ability of the neocortex and cerebellum to accomplish diverse functions with uniform circuits. Our systematic approach, insights, and theory promise groundbreaking advances in understanding the brain.</description>
