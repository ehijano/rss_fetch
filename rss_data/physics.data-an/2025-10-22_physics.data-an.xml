      <title>Exploring Complexity Changes in Diseased ECG Signals for Enhanced Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complex dynamics of the heart are reflected in its electrical activity, captured through electrocardiograms (ECGs). In this study we use nonlinear time series analysis to understand how ECG complexity varies with cardiac pathology. Using the large PTB-XL dataset, we extracted nonlinear measures from lead II ECGs, and cross-channel metrics (leads II, V2, AVL) using Spearman correlations and mutual information. Significant differences between diseased and healthy individuals were found in almost all measures between healthy and diseased classes, and between 5 diagnostic superclasses ($p&lt;.001$). Moreover, incorporating these complexity quantifiers into machine learning models substantially improved classification accuracy measured using area under the ROC curve (AUC) from 0.86 (baseline) to 0.87 (nonlinear measures) and 0.90 (including cross-time series metrics).</description>

      <title>Robust interpretation of electrochemical impedance spectra using numerical complex analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a non-invasive technique widely used for understanding charge transfer and charge transport processes in electrochemical systems and devices. Standard approaches for the interpretation of EIS data involve starting with a hypothetical circuit model for the physical processes in the device based on experience/intuition, and then fitting the EIS data to this circuit model. This work explores a mathematical approach for extracting key characteristic features from EIS data by relying on fundamental principles of complex analysis. These characteristic features can ascertain the presence of inductors and constant phase elements (non-ideal capacitors) in circuit models and enable us to answer questions about the identifiability and uniqueness of equivalent circuit models. In certain scenarios such as models with only resistors and capacitors, we are able to enumerate all possible families of circuit models. Finally, we apply the mathematical framework presented here to real-world electrochemical systems and highlight results using impedance measurements from a lithium-ion battery coin cell.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian replica exchange augmented with diffusion-based generative models and importance sampling to assess biomolecular conformational basins and barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhanced sampling techniques are essential for exploring biomolecular conformational dynamics that occur on timescales inaccessible to conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This study introduces a framework that combines Hamiltonian replica exchange with solute tempering (REST2) with denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and importance sampling to enhance the mapping of conformational free-energy landscapes. Building on previous applications of DDPMs to temperature replica exchange (TREM), we propose two key improvements. First, we adapt the method to REST2 by treating potential energy as a fluctuating variable. This adaptation allows for more efficient sampling in large biomolecular systems. Second, to further improve resolution in high-barrier regions, we develop an iterative scheme combining replica exchange, DDPM, and importance sampling along known collective variables. Benchmarking on the mini-protein CLN025 demonstrates that DDPM-refined REST2 achieves comparable accuracy to TREM while requiring fewer replicas. Application to the enzyme PTP1B reveals a loop transition pathway consistent with prior complex biased simulations, showcasing the approach's ability to uncover high-barrier transitions with minimal computational overhead with respect to conventional replica exchange approaches. Overall, this hybrid strategy enables more efficient exploration of free-energy landscapes, expanding the utility of generative models in enhanced sampling simulations.</description>
