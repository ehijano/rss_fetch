      <title>Irreducible Koopman representations for nonsingular actions on boundaries of rooted trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a countable branch group of automorphisms of a spherically homogeneous rooted tree. Under some assumption on finitarity of $G$, we construct, for each sequence $\omega\in\{0,1\}^\Bbb N$, an irreducible unitary representation $\kappa_\omega$ of $G$. Every two representations $\kappa_\omega$ and $\kappa_{\omega'}$ are weakly equivalent. They are unitarily equivalent if and only if $\omega$ and $\omega'$ are tail equivalent. Each $\kappa_\omega$ appears as the Koopman representation associated with some ergodic $G$-quasiinvariant measure (of infinite product type) on the boundary of the tree.</description>

      <title>Pointwise ergodic theorems for non-conventional bilinear averages along $(\lfloor n^c\rfloor,-\lfloor n^c\rfloor)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every $c\in(1,23/22)$ and every probability dynamical system $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu,T)$ we prove that for any $f,g\in L^{\infty}_{\mu}(X)$ the bilinear ergodic averages \[ \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^Nf(T^{\lfloor n^c\rfloor}x)g(T^{-\lfloor n^c\rfloor}x)\quad\text{converge for $\mu$-a.e. $x\in X$.} \] In fact, we consider more general sparse orbits $(\lfloor h(n)\rfloor,-\lfloor h(n)\rfloor)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$, where $h$ belongs to the class of the so-called $c$-regularly varying functions. This is the first pointwise result for bilinear ergodic averages taken along deterministic sparse orbits where modulation invariance is present.</description>

      <title>The nexus between disease surveillance, adaptive human behavior and epidemic containment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epidemics exhibit interconnected processes that operate at multiple time and organizational scales, a hallmark of complex adaptive systems. Modern epidemiological modeling frameworks incorporate feedback between individual-level behavioral choices and centralized interventions. Nonetheless, the realistic operational course for disease detection, planning, and response is often overlooked. Disease detection is a dynamic challenge, shaped by the interplay between surveillance efforts and transmission characteristics. It serves as a tipping point that triggers emergency declarations, information dissemination, adaptive behavioral responses, and the deployment of public health interventions. Evaluating the impact of disease surveillance systems as triggers for adaptive behavior and public health interventions is key to designing effective control policies.
  We examine the multiple behavioral and epidemiological dynamics generated by the feedback between disease surveillance and the intertwined dynamics of information and disease propagation. Specifically, we study the intertwined dynamics between: $(i)$ disease surveillance triggering health emergency declarations, $(ii)$ risk information dissemination producing decentralized behavioral responses, and $(iii)$ centralized interventions. Our results show that robust surveillance systems that quickly detect a disease outbreak can trigger an early response from the population, leading to large epidemic sizes. The key result is that the response scenarios that minimize the final epidemic size are determined by the trade-off between the risk information dissemination and disease transmission, with the triggering effect of surveillance mediating this trade-off. Finally, our results confirm that behavioral adaptation can create a hysteresis-like effect on the final epidemic size.</description>

      <title>Persistence of hyperbolic solutions of ODE's under functional perturbations: Applications to the motion of relativistic charged particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rigorously construct a variety of orbits for certain delay differential equations, including the electrodynamic equations formulated by Wheeler and Feynman in 1949. These equations involve delays and advances that depend on the trajectory itself, making it unclear how to formulate them as evolution equations in a conventional phase space. Despite their fundamental significance in physics, their mathematical treatment remains limited.
  Our method applies broadly to various functional differential equations that have appeared in the literature, including advanced/delayed equations, neutral or state-dependent delay equations, and nested delay equations, under appropriate regularity assumptions.
  Rather than addressing the notoriously difficult problem of proving the existence of solutions for all the initial conditions in a set, we focus on the direct construction of a diverse collection of solutions. This approach is often sufficient to describe physical phenomena. For instance, in certain models, we establish the existence of families of solutions exhibiting symbolic dynamics.
  Our method is based on the assumption that the system is, in a weak sense, close to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) with "hyperbolic" solutions as defined in dynamical systems. We then derive functional equations to obtain space-time corrections.
  As a byproduct of the method, we obtain that the solutions constructed depend very smoothly on parameters of the model. Also, we show that many formal approximations currently used in physics are valid with explicit error terms. Several of the relations between different orbits of the ODE persist qualitatively in the full problem.</description>

      <title>On the distribution of the angle between Oseledets spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note is concerned with the distribution of the angles between Oseledets subspaces for linear cocycles driven by an ergodic transformation. We restrict ourselves to dimension $2$, and give particular attention to the question of log-integrability of those angles. In the setting of random i.i.d.\ products of matrices, we construct examples of probability measures on \(\GL_2(\R)\) with finite first moment, for which the angle between Oseledets directions of the associated cocycle is not log-integrable. Building on work for the totally irreducible case by Benoist and Quint, we show that for probability measures with finite second moment the angle between Oseledets subspaces is always log-integrable. Then we pivot to general measurable \(\GL_2(\R)\)-cocycles over an arbitrary ergodic automorphism of a non-atomic Lebesgue space. We show that no integrability condition on the distribution of the matrices is sufficient to guarantee log-integrability of the angle between Oseledets spaces. In fact, in this context we show that the joint distribution of the Oseledets spaces may be chosen arbitrarily. We also obtain a similar flexibility result for bounded cocycles under the proper condition on the distribution of angles.</description>

      <title>From Opinion Polarization to Climate Action: A Social-Climate Model of the Opinion Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a coupled social-climate network model to understand the interaction between climate change opinion spread and the climate system and determine the role of this interaction in shaping collective actions and global temperature changes. In contrast to previous social-climate models that discretized opinions, we assumed opinions on climate change form a continuum, and were thereby able to capture more nuanced interactions. The model shows that resistance to behaviour change, elevated mitigation costs, and slow response to climate events can result in a global temperature anomaly in excess of 2{\deg}C. However, this outcome could be avoided by lowering mitigation costs and increasing the rate of interactions between individuals with differing opinions (social learning). Our model is the first to demonstrate the emergence of opinion polarization in a human-environment system. We predict that polarization of opinions in a population can be extinguished, and the population will adopt mitigation practices, when the response to temperature change is sensitive, even at higher mitigation costs. It also indicates that even with polarized opinion, an average pro-mitigative opinion in the population can reduce emissions. Finally, our model underscores how frequent and unexpected social or environmental changes, such as policy changes or extreme weather events, can slow climate change mitigation. This analysis helps identify the factors that support achieving international climate goals, such as leveraging peer influence and decreasing stubbornness in individuals, reducing mitigation costs, and encouraging climate-friendly lifestyles. Our model offers a valuable new framework for exploring the integration of social and natural sciences, particularly in the domain of human behavioural change.</description>

      <title>Computer-Assisted Proofs of Solitons in Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rigorously prove the existence of gap solitons in the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation with a periodic potential. These nonlinear localized solutions emerge in spectral gaps and play a crucial role in understanding Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). To prove them, we reformulate the problem as the search for homoclinic orbits in a higher-dimensional dynamical system. We then use computer-assisted proof techniques, combined with a functional analytic framework, to rigorously validate numerically approximated homoclinic orbits. This work bridges computational evidence and formal mathematical proofs, providing a solid foundation for the study of solitons in the GP equation.</description>

      <title>The Small-Gain Condition for Infinite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, attempts have been made to extend ISS small-gain theorems from finite networks to countably infinite, locally finite networks. Under specific assumptions about the subsystems and the ISS formulation, corresponding infinite-dimensional small-gain results have been proven. However, concerning the assumptions about the interconnection gains and the way they influence the subsystems, these results are still too narrow to be considered a full extension of the state-of-the-art for finite networks. We take a step to closing this gap by a thorough investigation of certain classes of monotone operators associated with an infinite network. Our results shed more light on the theory of finite networks, yield complete characterizations of the small-gain condition for specific ISS formulations and show very clearly which obstacles still have to be overcome to obtain a complete theory for the most general case.</description>

      <title>Uniform Boundedness of Homogeneous Incompressible Flows in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the extendability of local solutions for incompressible 3D Navier-Stokes and 3D Euler problems, with initial data $\mathbf{u}_0$ in the Sobolev space $H^s (\mathbb{R}^3)$, where $s$ ensures the existence and uniqueness of classical solutions. A geometric decomposition of the configuration space, identified by the orthogonality between the solution $\mathbf{u}$ and the pressure forces $\nabla p$, splits the problem into two simpler subproblems, which enable the uniform boundedness of the solution in each component of the partition, thereby ensuring the extendability of the solution.</description>

      <title>A new Lagrangian approach to optimal control of second-order systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose and study a new approach to formulate the optimal control problem of second-order differential equations, with a particular interest in those derived from force-controlled Lagrangian systems. The formulation results in a new hyperregular control Langrangian and, thus, a new control Hamiltonian whose equations of motion provide necessary optimality conditions. We compare this approach to Pontryagin's maximum principle (PMP) in this setting, providing geometric insight into their relation. This leads us to define an extended Tulczyjew's triple with controls. Moreover, we study the relationship between Noether symmetries of this new formulation and those of the PMP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the geometric property (T) for discretized warped cones of an action of finitely generated group $G$ on a compact metric space $M$. We show that if $M$ is a compact Riemannian manifold and the action is free, measure preserving, ergodic and isometric, then the associated discretized warped cone $\bigsqcup_n M\times \{t(n)\}$ does not have geometric property (T) for any sequence of positive numbers $\{t(n)\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ converging to $\infty$.
  As an application, we obtain new examples of expanders without geometric property (T).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17058v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The potential for multistationarity, or the existence of steady-state multiplicity, in the Earth System raises concerns that the planet could reach a climatic `tipping point,' rapidly transitioning to a warmer steady-state from which recovery may be practically unattainable. In detailed Earth models that require extensive computation time, it is difficult to make an a priori prediction of the possibility of multistationarity. In this study, we demonstrate Chemical Reaction Network Theory (CRNT) analysis of a simple heuristic box model of the Earth System carbon cycle with the human intervention of Direct Air Capture. CRNT leverages parameter-minimal analysis, relying primarily on the graphical and kinetic structure of the reaction network system, to identify necessary conditions for steady-state multiplicity. The analysis reveals necessary conditions for the combination of system parameters where steady-state multiplicity may exist. With this method, other negative emissions technologies (NET) may be screened in a relatively simple manner to aid in the priority setting by policymakers. Beyond multistationarity, the analysis provides insights into key system properties, such as absolute concentration robustness and some conditions for atmospheric carbon reduction.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on the dimension of the global attractor of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations on the $\beta-$plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article establishes estimates on the dimension of the global attractor of the two-dimensional rotating Navier-Stokes equation for viscous, incompressible fluids on the $\beta$-plane. Previous results in this setting by M.A.H. Al-Jaboori and D. Wirosoetisno (2011) had proved that the global attractor collapses to a single point that depends only the longitudinal coordinate, i.e., zonal flow, when the rotation is sufficiently fast. However, an explicit quantification of the complexity of the global attractor in terms of $\beta$ had remained open. In this paper, such estimates are established which are valid across a wide regime of rotation rates and are consistent with the dynamically degenerate regime previously identified. Additionally, a decomposition of solutions is established detailing the asymptotic behavior of the solutions in the limit of large rotation.</description>

      <title>Pitch Plane Trajectory Tracking Control for Sounding Rockets via Adaptive Feedback Linearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a pitch plane trajectory tacking control solution for suborbital launch vehicles relying on adaptive feedback linearization. Initially, the 2D dynamics and kinematics for a single-engine, thrust-vector-controlled sounding rocket are obtained for control design purposes. Then, an inner-outer control strategy, which simultaneously tackles attitude and position control, is adopted, with the inner-loop comprising the altitude and pitch control and the outer-loop addressing the horizontal (downrange) position control. Feedback linearization is used to cancel out the non-linearities in both the inner and outer dynamics. Making use of Lyapunov stability theory, an adaptation law, which provides online estimates on the inner-loop aerodynamic uncertainty, is jointly designed with the output tracking controller via adaptive backstepping, ensuring global reference tracking in the region where the feedback linearization is well-defined. The zero dynamics of the inner-stabilized system are then exploited to obtain the outerloop dynamics and derive a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with integral action, which can stabilize them as well as reject external disturbances. In the outermost loop, the estimate on the correspondent aerodynamic uncertainty is indirectly obtained by using the inner loop estimates together with known aerodynamics relations. The resulting inner-outer position control solution is proven to be asymptotically stable in the region of interest. Using a single-stage sounding rocket, propelled by a liquid engine, as reference vehicle, different mission scenarios are tested in a simulation environment to verify the adaptability of the proposed control strategy. The system is able to track the requested trajectories while rejecting external wind disturbances. Furthermore, the need to re-tune the control gains in between different mission scenarios is minimal to none.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08644v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The brain rapidly adapts to new contexts and learns from limited data, a coveted characteristic that artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms struggle to mimic. Inspired by the mechanical oscillatory rhythms of neural cells, we developed a learning paradigm utilizing link strength oscillations, where learning is associated with the coordination of these oscillations. Link oscillations can rapidly change coordination, allowing the network to sense and adapt to subtle contextual changes without supervision. The network becomes a generalist AI architecture, capable of predicting dynamics of multiple contexts including unseen ones. These results make our paradigm a powerful starting point for novel models of cognition. Because our paradigm is agnostic to specifics of the neural network, our study opens doors for introducing rapid adaptive learning into leading AI models.</description>
