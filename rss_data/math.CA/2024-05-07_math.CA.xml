      <title>Adventitious angles problem: the lonely fractional derived angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the "classical" adventitious angle problem, for a given set of three angles $a$, $b$, and $c$ measured in integral degrees in an isosceles triangle, a fourth angle $\theta$ (the derived angle), also measured in integral degrees, is sought. We generalize the problem to find $\theta$ in fractional degrees. We show that the triplet $(a, b, c) = (45^\circ, 45^\circ, 15^\circ)$ is the only combination that leads to $\theta = 7\frac{1}{2}^\circ$ as the fractional derived angle.</description>

      <title>On pointwise convergence of cone multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $p\ge 2$, and $\lambda&gt;\max\{n|\tfrac 1p-\tfrac 12|-\tfrac12, 0\}$, we prove the pointwise convergence of cone multipliers, i.e. $$ \lim_{t\to\infty}T_t^\lambda(f)\to f \text{ a.e.},$$ where $f\in L^p(\mathbb R^n)$ satisfies $supp\ \widehat f\subset\{\xi\in\mathbb R^n:\ 1&lt;|\xi_n|&lt;2\}$. Our main tools are weighted estimates for maximal cone operators, which are consequences of trace inequalities for cones.</description>

      <title>Hypergeometric accelerations with shifted indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chu and Zhang, in 2014, introduced hypergeometric transforms derived through the application of an Abel-type summation lemma to Dougall's ${}_{5}H_{5}$-series. These transforms were applied by Chu and Zhang to obtain accelerated rates of convergence, yielding rational series related to the work of Ramanujan and Guillera. We apply a variant of an acceleration method due to Wilf using what we refer to as shifted indices for Pochhammer symbols involved in our first-order, inhomogeneous recurrences derived via Zeilberger's algorithm, to build upon Chu and Zhang's accelerations, recovering many of their accelerated series and introducing many inequivalent series for universal constants, including series of Ramanujan type involving linear polynomials as summand factors, as in Ramanujan's series for $\frac{1}{\pi}$.</description>

      <title>A solution in terms of mock modular forms for the $q$-Painlev\'{e} equation of the type $(A_2+A_1)^{(1)}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a solution of the $(A_2+A_1)^{(1)}$ $q$-Painlev\'{e} equation in terms of the $\mu$-function. The $\mu$-function introduced by Zwegers is the most fundamental object in the study of mock theta functions. The results of this paper give us an expectation that the theory of mock modular forms and the $\tau$-functions of discrete integrable systems are closely related.</description>

      <title>Similar point configurations via group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for $d\ge 2,\, k\ge 2$, if the Hausdorff dimension of a compact set $E\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is greater than $\frac{d^2}{2d-1}$, then, for any given $r &gt; 0$, there exist $(x^1, \dots, x^{k+1})\in E^{k+1}$, $(y^1, \dots, y^{k+1})\in E^{k+1}$, a rotation $\theta \in \mathrm{O}_d(\mathbb{R})$, and a vector $a \in \mathbb{R}^d$ such that $rx^j = \theta y^j - a$ for $1 \leq j \leq k+1$. Such a result on existence of similar $k$-simplices in thin sets had previously been established under a more stringent dimensional threshold in Greenleaf, Iosevich and Mkrtchyan \cite{GIM21}. The argument we are use to prove the main result here was previously employed in Bhowmik and Rakhmonov \cite{BR23} to establish a finite field version. We also show the existence of multi-similarities of arbitrary multiplicity in $\R^d$, show how to extend these results from similarities to arbitrary proper continuous maps, as well as explore a general group-theoretic formulation of this problem in vector spaces over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Extremizers for the Rogosinski - Szeg\"o estimate of the second coefficient in nonnegative sine polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the class of sine polynomials $b_1\sin t+b_2\sin2t+...+b_N\sin Nt,\; (b_N\not= 0),$ which are nonnegative on $(0,\pi)$, W. Rogosinski and G. Szeg\"o derived, among other things, exact bounds for $|b_2|$ via the Luk\'acs presentation of nonnegative algebraic polynomials and a variational type argument for exact bounds, but they did not find the extremizers. Within this algebraic framework, we construct explicit polynomials which attain these bounds and prove their uniqueness.
  The proof uses the Fej\'er - Riesz representation of nonnegative trigonometric polynomials, a 7-band Toeplitz matrix of arbitrary finite dimension, and Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind and their derivatives.</description>

      <title>Ladder operators for generalized Zernike or disk polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to report on several ladder operators for generalized Zernike polynomials which are orthogonal polynomials on the unit disk $\mathbf{D}\,=\,\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2: \; x^2+y^2\leqslant 1\}$ with respect to the weight function $W_{\mu}(x,y)\,=\,(1-x^2-y^2)^{\mu}$ where $\mu&gt;-1$. These polynomials can be expressed in terms of the univariate Jacobi polynomials and, thus, we start by deducing several ladder operators for the Jacobi polynomials. Due to the symmetry of the disk and the weight function $W_{\mu}$, it turns out that it is more convenient to use complex variables $z\,=\, x+iy$ and $\bar{z}\,=\,x-iy$. Indeed, this allows us to systematically use the univariate ladder operators to deduce analogous ones for the complex generalized Zernike polynomials. Some of these univariate and bivariate ladder operators already appear in the literature. However, to the best of our knowledge, the proofs presented here are new. Lastly, we illustrate the use of ladder operators in the study of the orthogonal structure of some Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Borel subsets $\Theta\subset O(d)\times \mathbb{R}^d$ (the set of all rigid motions) and $E\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, we define \begin{align*}
  \Theta(E):=\bigcup_{(g,z)\in \Theta}(gE+z). \end{align*} In this paper, we investigate the Lebesgue measure and Hausdorff dimension of $\Theta(E)$ given the dimensions of the Borel sets $E$ and $\Theta$, when $\Theta$ has product form. We also study this question by replacing rigid motions with the class of dilations and translations; and similarity transformations. The dimensional thresholds are sharp. Our results are variants of some previously known results in the literature when $E$ is restricted to smooth objects such as spheres, $k$-planes, and surfaces.</description>

Abstract: We define the generalized Dirichlet beta and Riemann zeta functions in terms of the integrals, involving powers of the hyperbolic secant and cosecant functions. The corresponding functional equations are established. Some consequences of the Ramanujan identity for zeta values at odd integers are investigated and new formulae of the Ramanujan type are obtained.</description>

      <title>Almost periodicity and boundary values of Dirichlet series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ almost periodicity to establish analogues of the Hardy--Stein identity and the Littlewood--Paley formula for Hardy spaces of Dirichlet series. A construction of Saksman and Seip shows that the limits in this Littlewood--Paley formula cannot be interchanged. We apply this construction to show that the limits in the definition of the mean counting function for Dirichlet series cannot be interchanged. These are essentially statements about the two different kinds of boundary values that we associate with Dirichlet series that converge to a bounded analytic function in a half-plane. The treatment of the mean counting function also involves an investigation of the zero sets and Blaschke products of such Dirichlet series.</description>

Abstract: We prove Hilbert transform identities involving conformal maps via the use of Rellich identity and the solution of the Neumann problem in a graph Lipschitz domain in the plane. We obtain as consequences new $L^2$-weighted estimates for the Hilbert transform, including a sharp bound for its norm as a bounded operator in weighted $L^2$ in terms of a weight constant associated to the Helson-Szeg\"o theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study existence and uniqueness of a transmission problem in simply connected domains in the plane with data in weighted Lebesgue spaces by first investigating solvability results of a related novel problem associated to a homeomorphism in the real line and domains given by the upper and lower half planes. Our techniques are based on the use of conformal maps and Rellich identities for the Hilbert transform, and are motivated by previous works concerning the Dirichlet, Neumann and Zaremba problems.</description>

      <title>Sharp Spectral Projection Estimates for the Torus at $p_c=\frac{2(n+1)}{n-1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove sharp spectral projection estimates for tori in all dimensions at the exponent $p_c=\frac{2(n+1)}{n-1}$ for shrinking windows of width $1$ down to windows of length $\lambda^{-1+\kappa}$ for fixed $\kappa&gt;0$. This improves and slightly generalizes the work of Blair-Huang-Sogge who proved sharp results for windows of width $\lambda^{-\frac{1}{n+3}}$, and the work of Hickman, Germain-Myerson, and Demeter-Germain who proved results for windows of all widths but incurred a sub-polynomial loss. Our work uses the approaches of these two groups of authors, combining the bilinear decomposition and microlocal techniques of Blair-Huang-Sogge with the decoupling theory and explicit lattice point lemmas used by Hickman, Germain-Myerson, and Demeter-Germain to remove these losses.</description>

      <title>On gamma functions with respect to the alternating Hurwitz zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1730, Euler defined the Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$ by the integral representation. It possesses many interesting properties and has wide applications in various branches of mathematics and sciences. According to Lerch, the Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$ can also be defined by the derivative of the Hurwitz zeta function $$\zeta(z,x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+x)^{z}}$$ at $z=0$. Recently, Hu and Kim defined the corresponding Stieltjes constants $\widetilde{\gamma}_{k}(x)$ and Euler constant $\widetilde{\gamma}_{0}$ from the Taylor series of the alternating Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta_{E}(z,x)$ $$\zeta_{E}(z,x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{(n+x)^z}.$$ And they also introduced the corresponding Gamma function $\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)$ which has the following Weierstrass--Hadamard type product $$\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)=\frac{1}{x}e^{\widetilde{\gamma}_{0}x}\prod_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(e^{-\frac{x}{k}}\left(1+\frac{x}{k}\right)\right)^{(-1)^{k+1}}.$$
  In this paper, we shall further investigate the function $\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)$, that is, we obtain several properties in analogy to the classical Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$, including the integral representation, the limit representation, the recursive formula, the special values, the log-convexity, the duplication formula and the reflection equation. Furthermore, we also prove a Lerch-type formula, which shows that the derivative of $\zeta_{E}(z,x)$ can be representative by $\widetilde\Gamma(x)$. As an application to Stark's conjecture in algebraic number theory, we will explicit calculate the derivatives of the partial zeta functions for the maximal real subfield of cyclotomic fields at $z=0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the generating function $\Phi^{(N)}$ for the reciprocals $N$-th power of factorials. We show a connection of product formulas for such series with the periods for certain families of algebraic hypersurfaces. For these families we describe their singular loci. We show that these singular loci are given by zeros of the Buchstaber-Rees polynomials, which define $N$-valued group laws. We describe a generalized Frobenius method and use it to obtain special expansions for multiplication kernels in the sense of Kontsevich. Using these expansions we provide some experimental results that connect $N$-Bessel kernels and the hierarchies of the palindromic unimodal polynomials. We study the properties of such polynomials and conjecture positivity of their roots. We also discuss the connection with Kloosterman motives as a version of the mirror duality.</description>

      <title>Dimension of homogeneous iterated function systems with algebraic translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $ \mu $ be the self-similar measure associated with a homogeneous iterated function system $ \Phi = \{ \lambda x + t_j \}_{j=1}^m $ on ${\Bbb R}$ and a probability vector $ (p_{j})_{j=1}^m$, where $0\neq \lambda\in (-1,1)$ and $t_j\in {\Bbb R}$. Recently by modifying the arguments of Varj\'u (2019), Rapaport and Varj\'u (2024) showed that if $t_1,\ldots, t_m$ are rational numbers and $0&lt;\lambda&lt;1$, then $$ \dim \mu =\min\Big \{ 1, \; \frac{\sum_{j=1}^m p_{j}\log p_{j}}{ \log |\lambda| }\Big\}$$ unless $ \Phi $ has exact overlaps. In this paper, we further show that the above equality holds in the case when $t_1,\ldots, t_m$ are algebraic numbers and $0&lt;|\lambda|&lt;1$. This is done by adapting and extending the ideas employed in the recent papers of Breuillard, Rapaport and Varj\'u.</description>

      <title>Differential equations on a $k$-dimensional torus: Poincar\'e type results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ordinary differential equations of the first order on the torus have been investigated in detail by H. Poincar\'e, P. Bohl and A. Denjoy. P. Bohl, back in 1916, emphasised the importance of the transfer of the results for the order $k=1$ to the case $k&gt;1$, adding at the same time: "However, any attempt to do so would be hopeless". The following more than hundred years have only confirmed Bohl's forecast. It became clear that a new approach to this problem is needed.
  In this paper, we propose a new (non-Hamiltonian) and promising approach. We use Hamiltonians, that is, ordinary differential systems of equations of the first order, only for heuristics. In the main scheme and corresponding proofs we do not use these systems. Instead of differential systems, we study sets of continuous vector functions $\phi(t,\eta)$ satisfying certain important conditions. Limit sets and left and right rotation vectors appear in the case $k&gt;1$. Some of our results are new even in the case $k=1.$ Under simple and natural conditions, the left and right rotation vectors coincide and a precise analog of the well-known H. Poincar\'e's result is derived for $k&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Sharp $\ell^q(L^p)$ decoupling for paraboloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17748v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short expository note, we prove the following result, which is a special case of the main theorem in arXiv:2011.09451. For each $n \ge 2$ and $p, q \in [2, \infty]$, we prove upper bounds of $\ell^q(L^p)$ decoupling constants for paraboloids in $\mathbb R^n$, as well as presenting extremisers for each case. Both are sharp up to $\varepsilon$-losses.</description>

      <title>On the spectrality of a class of Moran measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the spectrality of a class of Moran measures $\mu_{\mathcal{P},\mathcal{D}}$ on $\mathbb{R}$ generated by $\{(p_n,\mathcal{D}_n)\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$, where $\mathcal{P}=\{p_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of positive integers with $p_n&gt;1$ and $\mathcal{D}=\{\mathcal{D}_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of digit sets of $\mathbb{N}$ with the cardinality $\#\mathcal{D}_{n}\in \{2,3,N_{n}\}$. We find a countable set $\Lambda\subset\mathbb{R}$ such that the set $\{e^{-2\pi i \lambda x}|\lambda\in\Lambda\}$ is a orthonormal basis of $L^{2}(\mu_{\mathcal{P},\mathcal{D}})$ under some conditions. As an application, we show that when $\mu_{\mathcal{P},\mathcal{D}}$ is absolutely continuous, $\mu_{\mathcal{P},\mathcal{D}}$ not only is a spectral measure, but also its support set tiles $\mathbb{R}$ with $\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>Identities on Zagier's rank two examples for Nahm's problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.10748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $r\geq 1$ be a positive integer, $A$ a real positive definite symmetric $r\times r$ matrix, $B$ a vector of length $r$, and $C$ a scalar. Nahm's problem is to describe all such $A,B$ and $C$ with rational entries for which a specific $r$-fold $q$-hypergeometric series (denoted by $f_{A,B,C}(q)$) involving the parameters $A,B,C$ is modular. When the rank $r=2$, Zagier provided eleven sets of examples of $(A,B,C)$ for which $f_{A,B,C}(q)$ is likely to be modular. We present a number of Rogers--Ramanujan type identities involving double sums, which give modular representations for Zagier's rank two examples. Together with several known cases in the literature, we verified ten of Zagier's examples and give conjectural identities for the remaining example.</description>

      <title>Counterexamples and weak (1,1) estimates of wave operators for fourth-order Schr\"odinger operators in dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to investigating the $L^p$-bounds of wave operators $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ associated with fourth-order Schr\"odinger operators $H=\Delta^2+V$ on $\mathbb{R}^3$. We consider that real potentials satisfy $|V(x)|\lesssim \langle x\rangle^{-\mu}$ for some $\mu&gt;0$. A recent work by Goldberg and Green \cite{GoGr21} has demonstrated that wave operators $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ under the condition that $\mu&gt;9$, and zero is a regular point of $H$. In this paper, we aim to further establish endpoint estimates for $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ in two significant ways. First, we provide counterexamples that illustrate the unboundedness of $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ on the endpoint spaces $L^1(\mathbb{R}^3)$ and $L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^3)$, even for non-zero compactly supported potentials $V$. Second, we establish weak (1,1) estimates for the wave operators $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ and their dual operators $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)^*$ in the case where zero is a regular point and $\mu&gt;11$. These estimates depend critically on the singular integral theory of Calder\'on-Zygmund on a homogeneous space $(X,d\omega)$ with a doubling measure $d\omega$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the confluent hypergeometric process with a varying external potential in the super-exponential region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a determinantal point process on the interval $(-s,s)$, associated with the confluent hypergeometric kernel. Let $\mathcal{K}^{(\alpha,\beta)}_s$ denote the trace class integral operator acting on $L^2(-s, s)$ with the confluent hypergeometric kernel. Our focus is on deriving the asymptotics of the Fredholm determinant $\det(I-\gamma \mathcal{K}^{(\alpha,\beta)}_s)$ as $s \to +\infty$, while simultaneously $\gamma \to 1^-$ in a super-exponential region. In this regime of double scaling limit, our asymptotic result also gives us asymptotics of the eigenvalues $\lambda^{(\alpha, \beta)}_k(s)$ of the integral operator $\mathcal{K}^{(\alpha,\beta)}_s$ as $s \to +\infty$. Based on the integrable structure of the confluent hypergeometric kernel, we derive our asymptotic results by applying the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method to analyze the related Riemann-Hilbert problem.</description>

      <title>A missing theorem on dual spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We answer in the affirmative the surprisingly difficult questions: If a complex Banach space possesses a real predual X, then is X a complex Banach space?
  If a complex Banach space possesses a real predual, then does it have a complex predual? We also answer the analogous questions for operator spaces, that is spaces of operators on a Hilbert space, up to complete isometry. Indeed we use operator space methods to solve the Banach space question above.</description>
