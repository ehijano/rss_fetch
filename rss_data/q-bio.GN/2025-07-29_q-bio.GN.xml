      <title>BioNeuralNet: A Graph Neural Network based Multi-Omics Network Data Analysis Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-omics data offer unprecedented insights into complex biological systems, yet their high dimensionality, sparsity, and intricate interactions pose significant analytical challenges. Network-based approaches have advanced multi-omics research by effectively capturing biologically relevant relationships among molecular entities. While these methods are powerful for representing molecular interactions, there remains a need for tools specifically designed to effectively utilize these network representations across diverse downstream analyses. To fulfill this need, we introduce BioNeuralNet, a flexible and modular Python framework tailored for end-to-end network-based multi-omics data analysis. BioNeuralNet leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn biologically meaningful low-dimensional representations from multi-omics networks, converting these complex molecular networks into versatile embeddings. BioNeuralNet supports all major stages of multi-omics network analysis, including several network construction techniques, generation of low-dimensional representations, and a broad range of downstream analytical tasks. Its extensive utilities, including diverse GNN architectures, and compatibility with established Python packages (e.g., scikit-learn, PyTorch, NetworkX), enhance usability and facilitate quick adoption. BioNeuralNet is an open-source, user-friendly, and extensively documented framework designed to support flexible and reproducible multi-omics network analysis in precision medicine.</description>

      <title>Nullstrap-DE: A General Framework for Calibrating FDR and Preserving Power in DE Methods, with Applications to DESeq2 and edgeR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential expression (DE) analysis is a key task in RNA-seq studies, aiming to identify genes with expression differences across conditions. A central challenge is balancing false discovery rate (FDR) control with statistical power. Parametric methods such as DESeq2 and edgeR achieve high power by modeling gene-level counts using negative binomial distributions and applying empirical Bayes shrinkage. However, these methods may suffer from FDR inflation when model assumptions are mildly violated, especially in large-sample settings. In contrast, non-parametric tests like Wilcoxon offer more robust FDR control but often lack power and do not support covariate adjustment. We propose Nullstrap-DE, a general add-on framework that combines the strengths of both approaches. Designed to augment tools like DESeq2 and edgeR, Nullstrap-DE calibrates FDR while preserving power, without modifying the original method's implementation. It generates synthetic null data from a model fitted under the gene-specific null (no DE), applies the same test statistic to both observed and synthetic data, and derives a threshold that satisfies the target FDR level. We show theoretically that Nullstrap-DE asymptotically controls FDR while maintaining power consistency. Simulations confirm that it achieves reliable FDR control and high power across diverse settings, where DESeq2, edgeR, or Wilcoxon often show inflated FDR or low power. Applications to real datasets show that Nullstrap-DE enhances statistical rigor and identifies biologically meaningful genes.</description>

      <title>GenoMAS: A Multi-Agent Framework for Scientific Discovery via Code-Driven Gene Expression Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gene expression analysis holds the key to many biomedical discoveries, yet extracting insights from raw transcriptomic data remains formidable due to the complexity of multiple large, semi-structured files and the need for extensive domain expertise. Current automation approaches are often limited by either inflexible workflows that break down in edge cases or by fully autonomous agents that lack the necessary precision for rigorous scientific inquiry. GenoMAS charts a different course by presenting a team of LLM-based scientists that integrates the reliability of structured workflows with the adaptability of autonomous agents. GenoMAS orchestrates six specialized LLM agents through typed message-passing protocols, each contributing complementary strengths to a shared analytic canvas. At the heart of GenoMAS lies a guided-planning framework: programming agents unfold high-level task guidelines into Action Units and, at each juncture, elect to advance, revise, bypass, or backtrack, thereby maintaining logical coherence while bending gracefully to the idiosyncrasies of genomic data.
  On the GenoTEX benchmark, GenoMAS reaches a Composite Similarity Correlation of 89.13% for data preprocessing and an F$_1$ of 60.48% for gene identification, surpassing the best prior art by 10.61% and 16.85% respectively. Beyond metrics, GenoMAS surfaces biologically plausible gene-phenotype associations corroborated by the literature, all while adjusting for latent confounders.
