      <title>Photonic Neuromorphic Computing enabled by a BIC Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic neuromorphic computing promises revolutionary advances in parallel and high-speed processing, yet a key challenge persists: co-integrating nonlinearity, dense connectivity, and intrinsic memory monolithically to enable brain-inspired, spatiotemporal information processing. Here, we overcome this challenge by introducing a monolithic photonic recurrent network based on an active metasurface operating at bound state in the continuum (BIC). The BIC mode mediates strong,long-range coupling across the lattice, creating a reconfigurable recurrent network topology in hardware. Concurrently, the gain medium provides both optical nonlinearity for neuronal activation and a finite carrier lifetime that serves as a built in, analog temporal memory. This synergy enables computation to emerge directly from the collective spatiotemporal dynamics of the driven-dissipative photonic system, effectively realizing a physical reservoir computer on a chip. We experimentally validate a minimal yet physically complete system on benchmark tasks: brain MRI image classification and human action recognition, achieving 92.16% and 85.36% accuracies, respectively. This work establishes a scalable pathway toward ultrafast, energy-efficient neuromorphic intelligence where processing is an inherent property of tailored light matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Anomalous High-Energy Second Plateau in High Harmonic Generation from Fullerenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore with ab-initio theory high harmonic generation (HHG) from a series of gas-phase fullerenes (from C$_{20}$ to C$_{60}$, including isomers) under varying laser conditions (different ellipticities, angular orientations, intensities and wavelengths). We find that HHG emission from fullerenes exhibits a prominent high-energy second plateau, extending well above the expected semi-classical cutoff, e.g. for an 800 nm driving laser with a peak intensity of $10^{14}$ W/cm$^2$, the anomalous $2^{nd}$ plateau cutoff is 115 eV. We theoretically analyze the underlying $2^{nd}$ plateau physical mechanism and determine that: (i) It differs from the standard SFA-like mechanism; (ii) It is recombination- based; (iii) It has an unusual inverted cutoff scaling with wavelength (whereby the cutoff decreases with increasing wavelength, until reaching a saturation); and (iv) It exhibits a linear cutoff dependence with electric field amplitude E$_0$ . We further rule out real-space trajectory based pictures, indicating that the most likely culprits are sharp quantum mechanical resonances in the fullerene family. Our work establishes a new route for high energy coherent broadband emission without requiring mid-IR driving and uncovers a novel HHG mechanism in complex structure quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Emerging Multidimensional Real-Space Topological Structures at Chiral Bound States in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As widely studied topological singularities, bound states in the continuum (BICs) have revealed rich physical properties through their momentum-space topology. Here, we reveal and experimentally demonstrate that magnetically induced chiral BICs possess multidimensional topological structures extending into real space. We design and realize a gyromagnetic photonic crystal slab where magnetic field breaks the time-reversal symmetry and lifts the degeneracy of BICs, creating a pair of chiral BICs with opposite circular polarizations. Near-field scanning measurements reveal phase vortices with quantized topological charges, spatially distributed near-field chirality, and skyrmionic Stokes textures arising from magnetic control. Our work unveils a previously unexplored dimension of BIC topology and establishes gyromagnetic photonic crystals as versatile platforms for manipulating complex topological states.</description>

      <title>Quantum squeezing in an all-resonant periodically poled lithium niobate microresonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum noise limits the sensitivity of optical measurements, but squeezed states of light enable quantum-enhanced metrology, sensing, and information processing. Most on-chip squeezed-light sources rely on Kerr ($\chi^{(3)}$) nonlinearities, remain limited by pump power and excess loss constraints. Quadratic ($\chi^{(2)}$) platforms instead provide stronger parametric interactions, lower pump power requirements, and greater spectral engineering flexibility. Here, we demonstrate strong, broadband squeezed-light generation on a thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chip using a dual-resonant optical parametric amplifier implemented in a single periodically poled LN (PPLN) microresonator. Near-full-depth domain inversion is achieved simultaneously with highly over-coupled resonances, exhibiting escape efficiencies exceeding 90% and intrinsic quality factors above 2.5 million in a 0.6 mm$^2$ X-cut TF-PPLN resonator, enabling efficient squeezing at 1587 nm when pumped at 793.5 nm. Operating in the continuous-wave regime, we directly measure -0.81 dB of squeezing below the shot-noise limit with a pump power of 27 mW, together with +4.29 dB of anti-squeezing. From these measurements, we infer an on-chip squeezing level of -7.52 dB $\pm$ 0.22 dB (95% confidence interval: [-7.96,-7.10] dB), and an on-chip anti-squeezing level of +9.62 dB $\pm$ 0.25 dB. We demonstrate single-mode squeezing at degeneracy with a squeezed-light spectrum exceeding 10.3 THz. This work reports the highest squeezing ratio among integrated $\chi^{(2)}$ cavity platforms and the first quasi-phase matched, fully resonant $\chi^{(2)}$ cavity squeezer on chip, establishing a scalable route to fully integrated power-efficient squeezed-light sources for quantum-enhanced sensing and metrology.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of the effect of dispersion on squeezing generation in a synchronously pumped optical parametric oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An experimental investigation of intracavity dispersion effects in a synchronously pumped optical parametric oscillator (SPOPO) is presented. A flexible setup combining spectral and phase shaping of both pump and local oscillator fields with frequency-resolved balanced homodyne detection is employed to examine how intracavity dispersion influences squeezing. Different cavity configurations with varying finesse and dispersion conditions are studied, and the squeezing is measured as a function of pump power and local oscillator bandwidth. Contrary to expectations based on existing theoretical models, the measured squeezing levels remain essentially unchanged as dispersion varies. To account for these observations, a modeling approach is introduced in which intracavity dispersion is described as an effective spectral filtering occurring at the stage of SPOPO supermode generation. Within this framework, the filtering is incorporated directly into the interaction Hamiltonian of the nonlinear process. This perspective establishes a consistent experimental benchmark for the study of dispersion in SPOPOs and underscores the importance of spectral filtering in the interpretation of multimode squeezing experiments.</description>

      <title>Kerr-induced Spectral Interferometry for Direct Ultra-sensitive Phase Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the phase of light is fundamental to optical imaging, sensing, and signal processing applications. Conventional optical phase measurements rely on multipath configurations, bulky interferometric setups, and computationally intensive data pipelines, limiting scalability, robustness, and practicality. We introduce a technique that allows for reference-free in-line phase retrieval of abrupt phase transitions in optical pulses directly from spectral measurements. Theory, simulations, and experiments concurrently explain the effect as a result of a Kerr-mediated interference between a projected linear wave component and the high-intensity residual of the phase-altered pulse. Utilizing this phenomenon, we demonstrate algorithm-free phase measurements of up to {\pi}/385 sensitivity and shot-to-shot signal prominence at 13 dB above noise at 80 MHz rates and 50 pJ pulse energies. This approach offers new paths toward the use of femtosecond pulses as broadband data carriers for optical communications, information processing, and direct high-throughput phase imaging.</description>

      <title>Hard X-Ray Zernike-Type Phase-Contrast Imaging with a Two-Block Crystal System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel scheme for Zernike-type hard X-ray phase-contrast imaging is proposed. The scheme relies on X-ray dynamical diffraction in a two-block crystal system with parallel crystal plates of equal thickness. A phase shifter providing a $\pi/2$ phase shift is placed in the inter-block gap of the crystal system. The method operates in a scanning geometry. The proposed imaging setup is compact and does not require conventional focusing optics. Numerical simulations of phase-contrast image formation are performed.</description>

      <title>HELIOS: A surface integral equation software for light scattering in homogeneous, periodic, and stratified environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present HELIOS (HomogEneous and Layered medIa Optical Scattering), an open-source surface integral equation (SIE) software designed for modeling light scattering by particles embedded in homogeneous or layered media and periodic backgrounds. The code implements the Poggio-Miller-Chang-Harrington-Wu-Tsai (PMCHWT) formulation that has demonstrated exceptional reliability in solving scattering problems with penetrable objects. Domain boundaries are discretized using triangular meshes, upon which the electric and magnetic surface current densities are expanded using the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis functions. For periodic structures, such as photonic crystals and metasurfaces, HELIOS employs Ewald's transformation to efficiently evaluate the infinite series associated with 2D lattices. Regarding stratified media, the code utilizes a matrix-friendly approach for the layered media Green's tensor, computing Sommerfeld integrals and accelerating calculations through a tabulation-interpolation scheme. The source code is implemented in C++, while a Python interface manages the workflow, including simulation setup, solver run, and post-processing. The accuracy and versatility of HELIOS are demonstrated through various examples that cover all its functionalities.</description>

      <title>Versatile CMOS modulation-free self-isolating stabilized precision lasers on a chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-low-noise stabilized lasers are a fundamental tool for precision quantum technologies, optical clocks, microwave and millimeter-wave generation, and fiber sensing. Existing systems rely on table-top bulk-optic components -- discrete lasers, reference cavities, isolators, modulators and frequency shifters -- limiting portability, scalability, and manufacturability. While these systems offer flexibility in laser design to tailor linewidth, frequency noise, and wavelength to specific applications, fully integrating a stabilized laser onto a chip without sacrificing performance and versatility has remained elusive. Here, we report integration of the precision stabilized laser in the low-loss silicon nitride photonic platform, combining a flexible isolator-free core laser design with a modulation-free stabilization cavity. We demonstrate a stabilized widely tunable self-isolating extended cavity tunable laser monolithically integrated with an on-chip coil-loaded Mach-Zehnder interferometer (CL-MZI). This design yields a fundamental linewidth of 1.7 - 10.5 Hz across a 60 nm tuning range, integral linewidth of 299 - 505 Hz over a 30 nm tuning range, frequency noise reduction of over 5 orders of magnitude, and an Allan-Deviation (ADEV) of 6.5x10-13 at 0.08 ms. We next highlight the versatility of this approach by demonstrating a self-isolating stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) laser, that provides nonlinear noise suppression of high frequency noise by multiple orders of magnitude, stabilized to an on-chip CL-MZI. The stabilized SBS laser achieves 4 Hz fundamental linewidth, 74 Hz integral linewidth, and ADEV of 2.8x10-13 at 5 ms. These results bring the performance and versatility of table-top stabilized laser systems to a chip for the first time, providing a path to scalable, low-cost, and manufacturable precision lasers for portable quantum, sensing, and communications applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Interband Optical Nonlinearities from Coupled Quantum Wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent, rapid advances in nonlinear chipscale nanophotonics in the visible and near-infrared have been largely driven by manipulating the local dielectric environment proximate to decades-old workhorse bulk nonlinear optical materials, rather than increasing the inherent strength of their nonlinear response. While proposed decades ago, we demonstrate the first experimental realization of a new class of designer nonlinear materials that leverage the interband optical transition in asymmetric structures to provide strong second order susceptibility, $\chi^{(2)}$. Using simple AlGaAs/GaAs coupled quantum wells operating in the near-infrared as a prototype, we observed strong second harmonic generation enhancement of 1550 nm to 775 nm over bulk controls. Extracted $\chi^{(2)}$ values were as high as 2750 pm/V, which is $&gt;$7x that of bulk GaAs. Furthermore, measured susceptibilities agreed well with quantum mechanical calculations of $\chi^{(2)}$ using layer profiles extracted from electron microscopy. Growth interruptions were employed to improve interfacial abruptness in response to electron microscopy characterization, resulting in increased $\chi^{(2)}$ toward the simulation predictions for ideal heterointerfaces. More complex layer designs showed predicted $\chi^{(2)}$ up to 7 nm/V. Such materials are anticipated to find myriad applications, including entangled photon generation at telecommunications wavelengths for chipscale quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Coherent Virtual Absorption in Dielectric Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through temporal shaping of the excitation signal, the complex-frequency scattering zeros of a lossless structure can be accessed, enabling a storage-release mechanism referred to as coherent virtual absorption. Practical demonstrations of this mechanism, however, have been limited to simple configurations such as slabs and spheres, where analytical solutions allow accurate prediction of the complex-frequency scattering zeros. Here, we extend this concept into the realm of metasurfaces and demonstrate coherent virtual absorption in realistic and dispersive metasurface configurations. Through a combination of full-wave analysis and rational approximation, we present a practical scheme to identify suitable complex-frequency zeros and achieve coherent virtual absorption successfully. Our approach can be implemented in arbitrary metasurface configurations with any number of ports, providing a robust framework for optimized energy storage, memories, optical sensing, and modulation in practical photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Temporal metamaterials with passive switching as impedance-matched absorbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments on temporal reflection in transmission line metamaterials and theoretical treatments of dispersive time-varying media have unearthed the fundamental role of modulation mechanisms on the interface conditions, underpinning the introduction of passive photonic time crystals with stable momentum band gaps. Drawing from these concepts, it is shown that temporal metamaterials with simultaneous passive permittivity and permeability switching exhibit wideband absorption with impedance-matching, effectively behaving as one-dimensional perfectly matched layers. Under the effective medium theory, the loss mechanism is attributed to the emergent effective electric and magnetic conductivities, which are used to derive an approximate matching condition for asynchronous modulation and to engineer lossy material properties. The proposed approach and its performance beyond the Rozanov bound are verified with semi-analytical calculations as well as full-wave simulations, and the possibility of realizing a two-dimensional temporal perfectly matched layer is discussed.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits on QBER and Distance in Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables information-theoretic secure communication, yet its ultimate tolerance to noise and achievable transmission distance remain fundamentally constrained. We establish the maximum quantum bit error rate (QBER) compatible with secure QKD and derive corresponding upper bounds on communication distance. Our results follow from a fundamental capacity threshold for qubit Pauli channels and apply to protocols based on two or more mutually unbiased bases, using either single-photon or weak coherent sources. By connecting information-theoretic limits to realistic physical noise models, we obtain universal bounds on achievable distances in fiber and free-space links, including diffraction-limited constraints relevant to deep-space quantum communications. These findings clarify the ultimate noise robustness of QKD and delineate the fundamental boundaries of secure quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Quantum Electrodynamics with Gain: Modified Fluctuations and Their Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Macroscopic quantum electrodynamics (MQED) provides a unified framework to describe quantum electromagnetic fields in the presence of arbitrary macroscopic environments. Central to this theory is the field correlation, which governs both radiative (e.g., Lamb shifts and the Purcell effect) and mechanical phenomena, such as van der Waals and Casimir forces. In this tutorial, we provide an overview of MQED and its extension to active media, highlighting fluctuation-induced forces as manifestations of gain-modified field correlations.</description>

Abstract: Ultrafast lasers create extreme, non-equilibrium thermodynamic conditions that can transiently reach pressures and temperatures comparable to interior core of the earth. Here we show that femtosecond excitation of amorphous silica-hafnia multilayer dielectrics drives the formation of high-pressure crystalline phases of silica including stishovite, seifertite, and the pyrite-type high density structure, within confined subsurface regions.Using TEM, SAED, and 4D-STEM, we directly map nanoscale phase evolution and identify crystalline motifs embedded inside laser generated blisters.Complementary molecular dynamics simualtions reveal the thermodynamic pathway underlying these transformations, where rapid electronic pressure initiates densification and octahedral coordination, followed by temperature driven crystallization and displacive transitions during ultrafast quenching. The resulting polymorphs reflects a dual-stage pathway inaccessible under equilibrium processing. Our results establish femtosecond laser excitation as a viable route to synthesize and stabilize ultrahigh-density high pressure silica phases under ambient conditions, without a diamond anvil cell, with implications for laser-damage mechanisms, high-energy-density materials, and planetary physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Optically Resolving the Number of Colloidal Quantum Dots in a Subwavelength Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The number resolution of solid-state artificial atoms is of fundamental interest for the study of quantum few-body systems, yet remains experimentally challenging. Quantum optical experiments offer a non-invasive approach which links up macroscopic measurements with the quantity of quantum emitters. In this work, we propose a time-domain quantum optical methodology for the strict numbering of colloidal CdSe/CdS/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) confined in subwavelength-size polystyrene capsules. The non-polarized, homogeneously broadened emission of colloidal QDs in the subwavelength volume satisfies the description of Dicke's superradiance of identical quantum emitters. An analytic relation describes the numerical dependence of the second-order photon correlation on the number and the collective lifetime of emitters, yielding an experimental counting range of colloidal QDs from one to ten. This work provides a robust pathway for the non-invasive numbering of artificial atoms and the investigation of collective light-matter interactions at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Highly Efficient Second/Third Harmonic Generation in van der Waals Layered Material AgScP2S6 with Anisotropic Polarization and Temperature Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-crystal X-ray diffraction and nonlinear optical measurements, especially second- and third-harmonic generation (SHG/THG) are comprehensively investigated for the van der Waals layered material AgScP2S6 with a non-centrosymmetric P31c (159) space group. Linear optical constants are extracted using spectroscopic ellipsometry and applied in fitting the harmonic generation behavior. Polarization-resolved SHG and THG measurements exhibit pronounced anisotropy, with emission patterns well-described by theoretical models derived from the khi(2) and khi(3) tensor elements. The material demonstrates exceptionally high nonlinear susceptibilities, with khi(2) ~ 10^(-8) m/V and khi(3) ~ 10^(-17) m^2/V^2 which is a few orders of magnitude greater than comparable 2D materials reported in the literature. Temperature-dependent SHG and THG measurements from 300 K to 25 K reveal exponential decay in harmonic signal intensities, attributed to reduced carrier mobility, with no evidence of structural phase transitions, consistent with results from single crystal diffraction and heat capacity measurements. Polarization-resolved SHG and THG measurements also reveal distinct orientation and ellipticity trends, highlighting the anisotropic nonlinear tensor contributions and contrasting polarization selection rules in the material. These results establish AgScP2S6 as a high-performance, thermally stable, and highly anisotropic nonlinear candidate material suitable for compact photonic applications such as ultrafast optical modulators, polarization-sensitive detectors, and wavelength-tunable light sources.</description>

      <title>A Maxwell Fish-Eye Lens in a Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally realize an analogue of the optical Maxwell fish-eye lens (MFEL) using phononic excitations in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). A MFEL is characterized by a radially symmetric, spatially varying refractive index with the remarkable property that rays emitted from any point within the lens are perfectly focused at their image points. While the implementation of such gradient-index lenses is challenging in conventional optical systems, BECs offer a highly tunable platform in which the spatially varying speed of sound of collective excitations -- phonons, the acoustic-wave analogues of photons -- can be engineered and their dynamics observed in real time. Time-resolved measurements of phonon wavefronts reveal focusing behavior that shows good agreement with analytical theory and numerical simulations. This work provides both a geometric and physical framework for engineering effective refractive indices using ultracold atoms, and simulating wave propagation on effective spherical geometries.</description>

      <title>Connecting Quantum Contextuality and Nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum theory departs from classical physics in its treatment of correlations, most prominently through the phenomena of contextuality and nonlocality. Once regarded primarily as foundational curiosities, these effects are now understood as key operational resources for quantum computation, communication, and simulation. Although traditionally investigated in distinct settings, recent theoretical and experimental advances have revealed deep conceptual, mathematical, and operational connections between them. This review presents a unified perspective on these developments based on sheaf-theoretic and graph-theoretic frameworks, which provide theory-independent characterizations of statistical correlations. These approaches clarify the structural relationship between contextuality and nonlocality, facilitate the formulation of experimentally testable inequalities, and guide implementations in realistic physical platforms, with particular emphasis on photonic systems. By bridging abstract theoretical structures and concrete experimental realizations, this review sheds light on the nonclassical foundations of quantum correlations and their emerging role in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Polarization-selective quantum cooperative response in dual-species atom arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform for quantum light-matter interfaces, yet single-species arrays are constrained by in-plane symmetry, restricting polarization control. Here we investigate the cooperative optical response of dual-species subwavelength atom arrays, in which intrinsic polarizability difference breaks in-plane symmetry. By engineering the lattice spacing and detunings, the arrays exhibit polarization-dependent subradiant modes, enabling complete reflection of specific polarization component. Leveraging this mechanism, we assemble array units as functional pixels and demonstrate a scalable polarization-selective quantum light modulator. Our work establishes a dynamically reconfigurable atomic-photonic platform for versatile subwavelength quantum optical elements.</description>

      <title>Interface States in Space-Time Photonic Crystals: Topological Origin, Propagation and Amplification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18523v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the topology of spatiotemporal media poses a fundamental challenge: their remarkable properties stem from breaking spatial and temporal symmetries, yet this same breaking obscures their topological characterization. Here, we show that space-time symmetries persist in crystals with travelling-wave modulations whose velocities can be either lower (subluminal) or higher (superluminal) than the speed of light, enabling the study of their topological properties and the prediction of spatiotemporal interface states. For each modulation regime, we use a Lorentz transformation to a frame in which the modulation depends on only one of the transformed variables. Then, we identify a conserved joint parity-time-reversal symmetry in the new variables that enforces the quantization of a spatiotemporal Zak phase, elevating it to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant. Finally, we calculate the associated interface states and uncover unique features arising from time-varying effects, including selective directional amplification, propagation along subluminal and superluminal boundaries, frequency- and momentum-converted replicas, and broadband amplification even in the absence of momentum gaps. Our framework holds for spatiotemporal modulations of any velocity, unifying a wide class of systems that includes photonic time crystals, and clarifying their topological origin.</description>

Abstract: The interaction between free electrons and optical modes underlies a variety of quantum and nanoscale light-matter phenomena, yet the associated momentum exchange with the sample largely remained overlooked. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the momentum transfer from free electrons to planar samples during optical mode excitation using momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy. The momentum transfer to the sample modifies the apparent dispersion relation which is significant when the planner sample is tilted. Under specific conditions, the sample receives momentum opposite to the electron beam direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an energy-space density matrix framework to investigate the interaction of extremely short optical pulses (ESPs) with transparent conducting oxides (TCOs). This approach captures not only electron populations, material polarization, and the permittivity, but also the quantum coherences between states. Compared to traditional momentum-space models, the energy-space formulation offers substantial computational simplification while retaining accuracy. Building on but going beyond the scope of Ref.~\cite{single_cycle_nlty_Letter}, we focus on dynamical features previously unexplored. Our formulation reveals clear signatures of quantum coherence in the net absorption dynamics and highlights the emergence of strong excited-state absorption under intense excitation. It also clarifies that spontaneous emission can be neglected in this regime. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of pump pulse intensity on the local field's duration, spectral broadening and shift, and phase induced by carrier dynamics, highlighting the absorptive nature of the nonlinear response. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding nonlinear light-matter interaction in dispersive, low-density electron systems driven far from equilibrium by intense broadband excitation.</description>

      <title>Robust quantized transport from topological quasienergy winding in long-range-coupling synthetic quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantized transport is a prominent feature in topological physics, with canonical examples being the quantum Hall effect and adiabatic Thouless pump, which are based on the Chern number, a topological invariant of 2D systems. Going beyond the Chern-number-based paradigms, quantized transports can also arise from k-direction quasienergy winding unique to periodically driven (Floquet) systems, which are free of dimensionality and adiabaticity limitations. However, lattices displaying winding of their quasienergy bands require asymmetric long-range couplings that are difficult to achieve in lattices of real-space coupled sites. Here, by leveraging photonic synthetic dimensions we construct asymmetric long-range-couplings in a one-dimensional temporal quantum walk based on three coupled fiber loops. We demonstrate quantized transport arising from the winding of quasienergy bands in k direction. We show that the average group velocity of an initial wave packet is proportional to the winding number, which leads to a quantized transport displacement. To better visualize this quantized displacement, we cascade two regions with flipped nearest/long-range couplings and observe a focusing effect with a quantized spatial shift in the focusing point. We also probe the robust properties of quantized transport against obstacles and disorders. The study initiates quasienergy-winding-based topological transports, which can feature applications in precise and robust imaging and information processing.</description>

      <title>Time-bin encoded quantum key distribution over 120 km with a telecom quantum dot source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) with deterministic single photon sources has been demonstrated over intercity fiber and free-space channels. The previous implementations relied mainly on polarization encoding schemes, which are susceptible to birefringence, polarization-mode dispersion and polarization-dependent loss in practical fiber networks. In contrast, time-bin encoding offers inherent robustness and has been widely adopted in mature QKD systems using weak coherent laser pulses. However, its feasibility in conjunction with a deterministic single-photon source has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. In this work, we construct a time-bin encoded QKD system employing a high-brightness quantum dot (QD) single-photon source operating at telecom wavelength. Our proof-of-concept experiment successfully demonstrates the possibility of secure key distribution over fiber link of 120 km, while maintaining extraordinary long-term stability over 6 hours of continuous operation. This work provides the first experimental validation of integrating a quantum dot single-photon source with time-bin encoding in a telecom-band QKD system. In addition, it demonstrates the highest secure key rate among the time-bin QKDs based on single-photon sources. This development signifies a substantial advancement in the establishment of a robust and scalable QKD network based on solid-state single-photon technology</description>

      <title>MaxwellLink: A unified framework for self-consistent light-matter simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in light-matter simulations is bridging the disparate time and length scales of electrodynamics and molecular dynamics. Current computational approaches often rely on heuristic approximations of either the electromagnetic (EM) or the material component, hindering the exploration of complex light-matter systems. Herein, MaxwellLink -- a modular, open-source Python framework -- is developed for the massively parallel, self-consistent propagation of classical EM fields interacting with a large heterogeneous molecular ensemble. The package utilizes a robust TCP/UNIX socket interface to couple EM solvers with a wide range of molecular drivers. In this initial release, MaxwellLink supports EM solvers spanning from single-mode cavities to full-feature three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) engines, and molecules described by multilevel open quantum systems, force-field and first-principles molecular dynamics, and nonadiabatic real-time Ehrenfest dynamics. With the socket-based architecture, users can seamlessly switch between levels of theory of either the EM solver or molecules without modifying the counterpart. Moreover, the EM engine and molecular drivers scale independently across multiple high-performance computing (HPC) nodes, facilitating large-scale simulations previously inaccessible to existing numerical schemes. The versatility and accuracy of this code are further demonstrated through applications including superradiance, radiative energy transfer, vibrational strong coupling in Bragg resonators, and plasmonic heating of molecular gases. By providing a unified, extensible engine, MaxwellLink potentially offers a powerful platform for exploring emerging phenomena across the research fronts of spectroscopy, quantum optics, plasmonics, and polaritonics.</description>
