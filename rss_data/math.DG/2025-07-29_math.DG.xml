      <title>Rigidity of Translation Surfaces in the Three-Dimensional Sphere $\mathbb{S}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19646v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A translation surface in the three-dimensional sphere $\mathbb{S}^3$ is a surface generated by the quaternionic product of two curves, called generating curves. In this paper, we present rigidity results for such surfaces. We introduce an associated frame for curves in $\mathbb{S}^3$, and by means of it, we describe the local intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of translation surfaces in $\mathbb{S}^3$. The rigidity results, concerning minimal and constant mean curvature surfaces, are given in terms of the curvature and torsion of the generating curves and their proofs rely on the associated frame of such curves. Finally, we present a correspondence between translation surfaces in $\mathbb{S}^3$ and translation surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We show that these surfaces are locally isometric, and we present a relation between their mean curvatures.</description>

      <title>On Nilpotent and Solvable Quasi-Einstein Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the structure of nilpotent Lie groups and unimodular solvable Lie groups with quasi-Einstein metric $(M,g,X)$ when $X$ is a left-invariant vector field. We define such a metric as a totally left-invariant quasi-Einstein metric. We prove that any non-flat unimodular solvable Lie group $S$ with a totally left-invariant quasi-Einstein metric, must have one-dimensional center. Along with this, if the adjoint action $ad_a$ of $S$ is a normal derivation, then $S$ must be standard, and have a quasi-Einstein nilpotent group as its nilradical. We also establish some necessary conditions for a nilpotent Lie group to be totally left-invariant quasi-Einstein. We prove that any left-invariant metric on Heisenberg Lie group is quasi-Einstein, and these are the only two-step nilpotent Lie groups that admit a totally left-invariant quasi-Einstein metric. We also obtain a structure theorem for quasi-Einstein compact manifolds $\Gamma\backslash G,$ where $G$ is unimodular solvable and $\Gamma$ is its discrete cocompact subgroup. As a consequence of these results, we prove that the only non-Abelian nilpotent Lie groups that admit a totally left-invariant quasi-Einstein metric and a discrete compact quotient, up to dimension six, are the 3-dimensional and 5-dimensional Heisenberg groups.</description>

      <title>Criteria for parabolicity and hyperbolicity of conductive Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the physics of anisotropic conductive materials we consider a linear elliptic operator $\Delta_{\mathcal{W}}$ of divergence type on a Riemannian manifold $(M^{n}, g)$. The operator is determined by the metric $g$ and by a given conductivity, which is modeled by a smooth self adjoint tensor field $\mathcal{W}$ of type $(1,1)$. We establish new conditions for a conductive manifold $(M, g, \mathcal{W})$ to be $\mathcal{W}$-parabolic or $\mathcal{W}$-hyperbolic. Here, by definition, a $\mathcal{W}$-hyperbolic manifold (as opposed to a $\mathcal{W}$-parabolic manifold) admits an effective electric current $J$, i.e. a bounded potential function $u$, which is a solution to the $\mathcal{W}$-Laplace equation $\Delta_{\mathcal{W}}(u) = 0$ with a finite flux of the current $J = -\mathcal{W}(\nabla u)$ to infinity. We prove a number of intrinsic conditions on $g$ and $\mathcal{W}$, that tell the type ( $\mathcal{W}$-hyperbolic or $\mathcal{W}$-parabolic) of conductive Riemannian manifolds. And we prove similar extrinsic conditions for submanifolds (involving also naturally the second fundamental form), that give the type of the submanifolds when they are endowed with the inherited conductivities from the ambient conductive space. Our results are furthermore illustrated by corresponding families of examples, which emphasize how the present setting and results generalize previous findings concerning the usual Laplacian for Riemannian manifolds (with homogeneous, constant, conductivity) as well as similar recent results for weighted manifolds and submanifolds. We also present novel examples of $\mathcal{W}$-hyperbolic manifolds where the conductivity tensor is 'extracted' from the curvature tensor of the manifold itself, such as e.g. the metric equivalents of the Einstein tensor and the Schouten tensor.</description>

      <title>The space of closed $G2$-structures. II. concavity and hypersymplectic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the space of closed $G_2$-structures equipped with Bryant's Dirichlet-type metric, we continue to utilise the geodesic, constructed in our previous article, to show that, under a normalisation condition Hitchin's volume functional is geodesically concave and the $G_2$ Laplacian flow decreases the length. Furthermore, we also construct various examples of hyper-symplectic manifolds on geodesic concavity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we obtain classification of the topological holonomy groups in $SO(3)$. Such a group is given by one of the following: a finite group (such groups are classified by Klein); a commutative infinite group which is generated by one or two elements, and dense in a subgroup of $SO(3)$ isomorphic to $SO(2)$; a non-commutative infinite group generated by two elements of order $2$, $\infty$ such that these rotation axes are orthogonal; a non-commutative infinite group which is dense in $SO(3)$.</description>

      <title>On the first Neumann eigenvalue for critical points of a weighted area functional with asymptotically flat ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the following work, we obtain a lower bound for the first Neumann eingevalue of the drift Laplacian $\Delta^{\varphi}$ for a family of properly embedded $[\varphi,\vec{e}_{3}]$-minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with concave function $\varphi$ and asymptotically flat ends. As application, we obtain a control on the topology for that surfaces with finite total curvature. The strategy will consists in an integration of the Bouchner's formula by the works of A. Lichnerowicz and S. Brendle, R. Tsiamis and relate said eigenvalue with the Poincare's constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study red blood cells using the Helfrich-Canham functional: due to their lipid bilayer structure, RBCs are naturally modeled using the theory of elastic surfaces. In this study, we demonstrate that Cassinian ovals, except for the limiting case of the round sphere, do not solve the shape equation. We further discuss conditions under which they may serve as effective approximations.</description>

      <title>Topological Data Analysis and Topological Deep Learning Beyond Persistent Homology -- A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a rapidly evolving field in applied mathematics and data science that leverages tools from topology to uncover robust, shape-driven insights in complex datasets. The main workhorse is persistent homology, a technique rooted in algebraic topology. Paired with topological deep learning (TDL) or topological machine learning, persistent homology has achieved tremendous success in a wide variety of applications in science, engineering, medicine, and industry. However, persistent homology has many limitations due to its high-level abstraction, insensitivity to non-topological changes, and reliance on point cloud data. This paper presents a comprehensive review of TDA and TDL beyond persistent homology. It analyzes how persistent topological Laplacians and Dirac operators provide spectral representations to capture both topological invariants and homotopic evolution. Other formulations are presented in terms of sheaf theory, Mayer topology, and interaction topology. For data on differentiable manifolds, techniques rooted in differential topology, such as persistent de Rham cohomology, persistent Hodge Laplacian, and Hodge decomposition, are reviewed. For one-dimensional (1D) curves embedded in 3-space, approaches from geometric topology are discussed, including multiscale Gauss-link integrals, persistent Jones polynomials, and persistent Khovanov homology. This paper further discusses the appropriate selection of topological tools for different input data, such as point clouds, sequential data, data on manifolds, curves embedded in 3-space, and data with additional non-geometric information. A review is also given of various topological representations, software packages, and machine learning vectorizations. Finally, this review ends with concluding remarks.</description>

      <title>Linearizations and optimization problems in diffeological spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By generalizing the notion of linearization, a concept originally arising from microlocal analysis and symbolic calculus, to diffeological spaces, we make a first proposal setting for optimization problems in this category.
  We show how linearizations allow the construction of smooth paths and variational flows without requiring canonical charts or gradients. With these constructions, we introduce a general optimization algorithm adapted to diffeological spaces under weakened assumptions. The method applies to spaces of mappings with low regularity.
  Our results show that weak convergence toward minima or critical values can still be achieved under diffeological conditions. The approach extends classical variational methods into a flexible, non-linear infinite-dimensional framework. Preliminary steps to the search for fixed points of diffeological mappings are discussed.</description>

      <title>On Minkowski's monotonicity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address an old open question in convex geometry that dates back to the work of Minkowski: what are the equality cases of the monotonicity of mixed volumes? The problem is equivalent to that of providing a geometric characterization of the support of mixed area measures. A conjectural characterization was put forward by Schneider (1985), but has been verified to date only for special classes of convex bodies. In this paper we resolve one direction of Schneider's conjecture for arbitrary convex bodies in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and resolve the full conjecture in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Among the implications of these results is a mixed counterpart of the classical fact, due to Monge, Hartman--Nirenberg, and Pogorelov, that a surface with vanishing Gaussian curvature is a ruled surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For non-amenable finitely generated virtually free groups, we show that the combinatorial Euler characteristic introduced by Emerson and Meyer is the preimage of the K-theory class of higher Kazhdan projections under the Baum-Connes assembly map. This allows to represent the K-theory class of their higher Kazhdan projection as a finite alternating sum of the K-theory classes of certain averaging projections. The latter is associated to the finite subgroups appearing in the fundamental domain of their Bass-Serre tree. As an immediate application we obtain non-vanishing calculations for delocalised $\ell^2$-Betti numbers for this class of groups.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for strictly negatively curved manifolds of infinite volume and bounded geometry, the bounded fundamental class, defined via integration of the volume form over straight top-dimensional simplices, vanishes if and only if the Cheeger isoperimetric constant is positive. This gives a partial affirmative answer to a conjecture of Kim and Kim. Furthermore, we show that for all strictly negatively curved manifolds of infinite volume, the positivity of the Cheeger constant implies the vanishing of the bounded volume class, solving one direction of the conjecture in full generality.</description>

Abstract: Bowers and Stephenson introduced the notion of inversive distance circle packings as a natural generalization of Thurston's circle packings. They further conjectured that discrete conformal maps induced by inversive distance circle packings converge to the Riemann mapping. In this paper, we prove Bowers-Stephenson's conjecture for Jordan domains by establishing a solvability theorem of certain prescribing combinatorial curvature problems for inversive distance circle packings.</description>

      <title>Uniform Convergence of Metrics on Alexandrov Surfaces with Bounded Integral Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.05620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove uniform convergence of metrics $g_k$ on a closed surface with bounded integral curvature (measure) in the sense of A.D. Alexandrov, under the assumption that the curvature measures $\mathbb{K}_{g_k}=\mu^1_k-\mu^2_k$, where $\mu^1_k,\mu^2_k$ are nonnegative Radon measures converging weakly to measures $\mu^1,\mu^2$ respectively, and $\mu^1$ is less than $2\pi$ at each point (no cusps). This is the global version of Yu. G. Reshetnyak's well-known result on uniform convergence of metrics on a domain in $\mathbb{C}$, and answers affirmatively the open question on the metric convergence on a closed surface. We also give an analytic proof of the fact that a (singular) metric $g=e^{2u}g_0$ with bounded integral curvature on a closed Riemannian surface $(\Sigma,g_0)$ can be approximated by smooth metrics in the fixed conformal class $[g_0]$. % in terms of distance functions, curvature measures and conformal factors. Results on a closed surface with varying conformal classes and on complete noncompact surfaces are obtained as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article constructs coassociative submanifolds in $G_2$-manifolds arising from Joyce's generalised Kummer construction. The novelty compared to previous constructions is that these submanifolds all lie within the critical region of the $G_2$-manifold in which the metric degenerates. This forces the volume of the coassociatives to shrink to zero when the orbifold-limit is approached.</description>

Abstract: We show that modeling a Grassmannian as symmetric orthogonal matrices $\operatorname{Gr}(k,\mathbb{R}^n) \cong\{Q \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} : Q^{\scriptscriptstyle\mathsf{T}} Q = I, \; Q^{\scriptscriptstyle\mathsf{T}} = Q,\; \operatorname{tr}(Q)=2k - n\}$ yields exceedingly simple matrix formulas for various curvatures and curvature-related quantities, both intrinsic and extrinsic. These include Riemann, Ricci, Jacobi, sectional, scalar, mean, principal, and Gaussian curvatures; Schouten, Weyl, Cotton, Bach, Pleba\'nski, cocurvature, nonmetricity, and torsion tensors; first, second, and third fundamental forms; Gauss and Weingarten maps; and upper and lower delta invariants. We will derive explicit, simple expressions for the aforementioned quantities in terms of standard matrix operations that are stably computable with numerical linear algebra. Many of these aforementioned quantities have never before been presented for the Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>On the flows of linear fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note provides a detailed proof of the fact that a linear vector field on a vector bundle has a flow by vector bundle isomorphisms. It implies then easily the existence of global solutions to linear non-autonomous ODE's, with a standard time-dependent flow construction. As a further application, a simple proof of the smooth triviality of vector bundles over contractible bases is given. Finally, a detailed elementary proof of the isomorphy (as Lie algebras) of all fibers of the kernel of a transitive Lie algebroid is given.</description>

Abstract: We prove that a generic $4$-dimensional integrable rolling distribution of contact elements with the symmetry of the tangency configuration (excluding developable seed and isotropic developable leaves) splits into an $1$-dimensional family of generic $3$-dimensional integrable rolling distributions of contact elements with the symmetry of the tangency configuration, thus introducing a new definition of the B\"{a}cklund transformation in the isometric deformation of surfaces.</description>

      <title>Bounds of Scalar curvature, S-curvature and distortion on $\infty$-Einstein Finsler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript investigates the curvature and topological properties of certain $\infty$-Einstein Finsler metrics on Finsler metric measure spaces. By imposing symmetry conditions, we construct a series of special metrics and analyze their equivalence on special manifolds. Provided a Ricci curvature bound, we establish a linear growth lower bound estimate for the S-curvature and the distortion, revealing the interplay between curvature and measure on $\infty$-Einstein Finsler manifolds. Furthermore, by introducing scalar curvature and imposing a linear growth lower bound condition, we derive upper and lower bounds for the distortion, S-curvature, and the scalar curvature itself on asymmetric essential gradient Ricci solitons with certain non-Riemannian curvature constraints. These results yield direct topological finiteness conclusions for some forward-complete $\infty$-Einstein Finsler manifolds. Our work partially addresses Gromov's conjecture of scalar curvature in the context of Finsler metric measure spaces and provides a foundation for further research in geometric analysis within general Finsler geometry.</description>

      <title>Integrability of homogeneous exact magnetic flows on spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider motion of a material point placed in a constant homogeneous magnetic field in $\mathbb R^n$ and also motion restricted to the sphere $S^{n-1}$. While there is an obvious integrability of the magnetic system in $\mathbb R^n$, the integrability of the system restricted to the sphere $S^{n-1}$ is highly non-trivial. We prove complete integrability of the obtained restricted magnetic systems for $n\le 6$. The first integrals of motion of the magnetic flows on the spheres $S^{n-1}$, for $n=5$ and $n=6$, are polynomials of the degree $1$, $2$, and $3$ in momenta. We prove noncommutative integrability of the obtained magnetic flows for any $n\ge 7$ when the systems allow a reduction to the cases with $n\le 6$. We conjecture that the restricted magnetic systems on $S^{n-1}$ are integrable for all $n$.</description>

      <title>Warped products over one-dimensional base spaces and the RCD condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the Riemannian curvature-dimension condition $\mathsf{RCD}(KN,N+1)$ for an $N$-warped product $B\times_f^N F$ over a one-dimensional base space $B$ with a Lipschitz function $f: B\rightarrow \mathbb R_{\geq 0}$, provided (1) $f$ is a $Kf$-concave function, (2) $f$ satisfies a sub-Neumann boundary condition $\frac{\partial f}{\partial n}\geq 0$ on $\partial B\backslash f^{-1}(0)$ and $F$ is a compact metric measure space satisfying (3) the condition $\mathsf{RCD}(K_F (N-1), N)$ with $K_F:= \sup_B \{ (Df)^2 + Kf^2\}$. The result is sharp, i.e. we show that (1), (2) and (3) are necessary for the validity of statement provided $K_F\geq 0$. In general, only a weaker statement is true. If $f$ is assumed to be $Kf$-affine, then the condition $\mathsf{RCD}(K N, N+1)$ for the $N$-warped product holds if and only if the condition $\mathsf{RCD}(K_F(N-1), N)$ holds for $F$ for any $K_F\in \mathbb R$.</description>

      <title>Spectral rigidity of manifolds with Ricci bounded below and maximal bottom spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spectrum of the Laplacian on complete, non-compact manifolds $M^n$ whose Ricci curvature satisfies $\mathrm{Ric} \geq -(n-1)\mathrm{H}(r)$, for some continuous, non-increasing $\mathrm{H}$ with $\mathrm{H}-1 \in L^1(\infty)$. We prove that if the bottom spectrum attains the maximal value $\frac{(n-1)^2}{4}$ compatible with the curvature bound, then the spectrum of $M$ coincides with that of hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$, namely, $\sigma(M) = \left[ \frac{(n-1)^2}{4}, \infty \right)$. The result can be localized to an end $E$ with infinite volume.</description>

      <title>On the rigidity of manifolds with respect to Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate local rigidity properties related to Gagliardo-Nirenberg constants and unweighted Yamabe-type constants. Let $V$ be an open bounded subset of an $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ whose Gagliardo-Nirenberg constant satisfies
  \[
  \mathbb{G}_{\alpha}^{\pm}(V,g) \geq \mathbb{G}_{\alpha}^{\pm}(\mathbb{R}^n,g_{\mathbb{R}^n}),
  \]
  where $(\mathbb{R}^n,g_{\mathbb{R}^n})$ denotes the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space with its standard metric. We show that for $\alpha \in (0,1) \cup \left(1,\frac{n+6}{n+2}\right)$ when $n \leq 6$ or $\alpha \in (0,1) \cup \left(1,\frac{n}{n-2}\right]$ when $n \geq 7$, if the first eigenvalue of the Ricci tensor satisfies
  \[
  \int_V \lambda_1(\operatorname{Rc}) \, d\mu_g \geq 0,
  \]
  then $V$ must be flat. When $\alpha$ belongs to a specific subinterval around $1$ within the above range, $\mathbb{G}_{\alpha}^{\pm}(V,g) \geq \mathbb{G}_{\alpha}^{\pm}(\mathbb{R}^n,g_{\mathbb{R}^n})$ and the weaker curvature condition of the scalar curvature
  \[
  \int_{V} \operatorname{Sc} \, d\mu_g \geq 0
  \]
  already imply that $V$ is flat. Moreover, we prove that for $\alpha$ sufficiently close to 1, the condition
  \[
  \mathbb{Y}_{\alpha}^{\pm}(V,g) \geq \mathbb{G}_{\alpha}^{\pm}(\mathbb{R}^n,g_{\mathbb{R}^n})
  \]
  on the unweighted Yamabe-type constants guarantees the flatness of $V$.</description>

      <title>Random graphs, expanding families and the construction of noncompact hyperbolic surfaces with uniform spectral gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and analyze a random graph model $\mathcal{F}_{\chi,n}$, which is a configuration model consisting of interior and boundary vertices. We investigate the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues for graphs in $\mathcal{F}_{\chi,n}$ under various growth regimes of $\chi$ and $n$. When $n = o\left(\chi^{\frac{2}{3}}\right)$, we prove that almost every graph in the model is connected and forms an expander family. We also establish upper bounds for the first Steklov eigenvalue, identifying scenarios in which expanders cannot be constructed. Furthermore, we explicitly construct an expanding family in the critical regime $n \asymp g$, and apply it to build a sequence of complete, noncompact hyperbolic surfaces with uniformly positive spectral gaps.</description>
