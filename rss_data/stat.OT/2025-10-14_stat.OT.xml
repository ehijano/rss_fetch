      <title>Examining the Interface Design of Tidyverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tidyverse is a popular meta-package comprising several core R packages to aid in various data science tasks, including data import, manipulation and visualisation. Although functionalities offered by the tidyverse can generally be replicated using other packages, its widespread adoption in both teaching and practice indicates there are factors contributing to its preference, despite some debate over its usage. Thissuggests that particular aspects, such as interface design, may play a significant role in its selection. Examining the interface design can potentially reveal aspects that aid the design process for developers. While Tidyverse has been lauded for adopting a user-centered design, arguably some elements of the design focus on the work domain instead of the end-user. We examine the Tidyverse interface design via the lens of human computer interaction, with an emphasis on data visualisation and data wrangling, to identify factors that might serve as a model for developers designing their packages. We recommend that developers adopt an iterative design that is informed by user feedback, analysis and complete coverage of the work domain, and ensure perceptual visibility of system constraints and relationships.</description>

      <title>Robust Causal Discovery in Real-World Time Series with Power-Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploring causal relationships in stochastic time series is a challenging yet crucial task with a vast range of applications, including finance, economics, neuroscience, and climate science. Many algorithms for Causal Discovery (CD) have been proposed, but they often exhibit a high sensitivity to noise, resulting in misleading causal inferences when applied to real data. In this paper, we observe that the frequency spectra of typical real-world time series follow a power-law distribution, notably due to an inherent self-organizing behavior. Leveraging this insight, we build a robust CD method based on the extraction of power -law spectral features that amplify genuine causal signals. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets with known causal structures, demonstrating its robustness and practical relevance.</description>
