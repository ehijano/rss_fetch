      <title>Spherical solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation in the expanding universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We produce an explicit formula for the wave function of the spherically symmetric fields emitted to the FLRW universe with the scale factor generated by the de Sitter universe. As an application of these explicitly written solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation, we test the decay in time of the field generated by a pionic atom.</description>

      <title>Physical blowups via buffered time change in a mean-field neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Idealized networks of integrate-and-fire neurons with impulse-like interactions obey McKean-Vlasov diffusion equations in the mean-field limit. These equations are prone to blowups: for a strong enough interaction coupling, the mean-field rate of interaction diverges in finite time with a finite fraction of neurons spiking simultaneously, thereby marking a macroscopic synchronous event. Characterizing these blowup singularities analytically is the key to understanding the emergence and persistence of spiking synchrony in mean-field neural models. Such a treatment is possible via time change techniques for a Poissonian variation of the classically considered integrate-and-fire dynamics. However, just as for shock solutions for nonlinear conservation laws, there are several admissible blowup solutions to the corresponding McKean-Vlasov equations. Because of this ambiguity, it is unclear which notion of blowup solutions shall be adopted. Here, we unambiguously define physical blowup dynamics as solutions to a fixed-point problem bearing on the time change associated to the McKean-Vlasov equation. To justify the physicality of this formulation, we introduce a buffering mechanism that regularizes blowup dynamics, while satisfying the same conservation principles as the finite-dimensional particle-system dynamics. We then show that physical blowup dynamics are recovered from these regularized solutions in the limit of vanishing buffering. Our approach also shows that these physical solutions are unique, globally defined, and avoid the so-called eternal blowup phenomenon, as long as the neurons exhibit nonzero, distributed refractory periods, a reasonable modeling assumption.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Analysis of a Kinetic Model of Confined Suspensions of Self-Propelled Rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of active matter under confinement poses significant challenges due to the intricate coupling between dynamics near boundaries and those in the bulk. A defining feature of active matter systems is that a substantial portion of their dynamics takes place near confining boundaries. In our previous work, we developed a kinetic framework that enables direct computation of the probability distribution functions for both the position and orientation of active rods. A distinguishing aspect of this approach is its explicit treatment of wall accumulation through the use of two coupled probability distribution functions: one describing the bulk population and the other representing rods accumulated at the boundary. Another novel feature is the structure of the governing equation, which is degenerate: it is second-order in one non-temporal variable and first-order in another. The main focus of this paper is to rigorously justify this model via multi-scale analysis. We first establish well-posedness of the system and then employ two distinct multi-scale derivations to obtain the model as a singular limit of a more classical kinetic system in the regime of vanishing translational diffusion. For analytical clarity, we consider the case in which active rods, once accumulated at the wall, remain permanently confined there. This work provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for reduced kinetic models of confined active matter, bridging microscopic dynamics and macroscopic accumulation phenomena.</description>

      <title>Ground state and multiple solutions for modified autonomous fourth-order elliptic equations with Berestycki-Lions type conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article establishes the existence of a ground state and infinitely many solutions for the modified fourth-order elliptic equation:
  \[
  \begin{aligned}
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
  \Delta^2 u - \Delta u + u - \frac{1}{2}u\Delta(u^2) = f(u), &amp; \text{in } \mathbb{R}^N,
  u \in H^2(\mathbb{R}^N),
  \end{array}
  \right.
  \end{aligned}
  \]
  where $4 &lt; N \leq 6$ and$f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a nonlinearity of Berestycki-Lions type.
  For the ground state solution, we develop a novel approach that combines Jeanjean's technique with a Pohozaev-Palais-Smale sequence construction. When $f$ is odd, we prove infinite multiplicity of radially symmetric solutions via minimax methods on a topologically constrained comparison functional. This work resolves the lack of results for this autonomous problem under almost the weakest nonlinearity conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantization of blow-up masses for the Finsler $N$-Liouville equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantization results for blow-up phenomena play crucial roles in the analysis of partial differential equations. Here we quantify the blow-up masses to the following Finsler $N$-Liouville equation $$-Q_{N}u_{n}=V_{n}e^{u_{n}}\quad\mbox{in}~ \Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^{N}, N \ge 2.$$ Our study generalizes the classical result of Li-Shafrir [Indiana Univ. Math.J.,1994] for Liouville equation, Wang-Xia's work for anisotropic Liouville equation in $\mathbb{R}^2$ [JDE, 2012], and Esposito-Lucia's for the $N$-Laplacian case in $\mathbb{R}^N$ ($N \geq 3$) in their recent paper [CVPDE, 2024].</description>

      <title>Strichartz and local smoothing estimates for the fractional Schr\"odinger equations over fractal time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain Strichartz-type estimates for the fractional Schr\"odinger operator $f \mapsto e^{it(-\Delta)^{\gamma/2}} f$ over a time set $E$ of fractal dimension. To obtain those estimates capturing fractal nature of $E$, we employ the notions in the spirit of the Assouad dimension, such as, bounded Assouad characteristic and Assouad specturm. We also prove the estimate $$ \| e^{it(-\Delta)^{\gamma/2}} f \|_{L_t^q(\mathrm{d}\mu; L_x^r(\mathbb{R}^d))} \le C \|f\|_{H^s}, $$ where $\mu$ is a measure satisfying an $\alpha$-dimensional growth condition. In addition, we establish related inhomogeneous estimates and $L^2$ local smoothing estimates. A surprising feature of our work is that, despite dealing with rough fractal sets, we extend the known estimates for the fractional Schr\"odinger operators in a natural way, precisely consistent with the associated fractal dimensions.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Harnack inequality in a disconnected region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a Harnack inequality for weak solutions of nonlocal equations in a disconnected region. The inequality compares the value of a solution on one connected component with its value on another, capturing a purely nonlocal phenomenon with no local analogue. We provide two different approaches: one based on the localized maximum principle and another on the Poisson kernel estimates.</description>

      <title>Limiting behavior of principal eigenvalues for a class of elliptic operators with degenerate large advection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that, in a number of circumstances, Theorem 1.2 of Chen and Lou \cite{ChLo} remains valid even when the function $m(x)$ of the advection term $-2sm'(x)$ is highly degenerate at its maximum. Our main result establishes that the limiting behavior of the principal eigenvalue is independent of the order of the zero of $m(x)-m(x_0)$ at $x=x_0$, where $m(x_0)=\|m\|_\infty$. Theorem 1.2 of Chen and Lou \cite{ChLo} imposed $m''(x_0)&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>Spectral density estimates of surface-localized eigenmodes for transmission eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a distinctive spectral pattern exhibited by transmission eigenfunctions in wave scattering theory. Building upon the discovery in [7, 8] that these eigenfunctions localize near the domain boundary, we derive sharp spectral density estimates--establishing both lower and upper bounds--to demonstrate that a significant proportion of transmission eigenfunctions manifest this surface-localizing behavior. Our analysis elucidates the connection between the geometric rigidity of eigenfunctions and their spectral properties. Though primarily explored within a radially symmetric framework, this study provides rigorous theoretical insights, advances new perspectives in this emerging field, and offers meaningful implications for inverse scattering theory.</description>

      <title>Existence and concentration phenomenon of multiple solutions for the fractional logarithmic Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson system via penalization method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the existence of multiple solutions for the fractional logarithmic Schr\"odinger-Possion system of the form
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  {\varepsilon}^{2\alpha} (-\Delta )^{\alpha}u+V(x) u+\phi u=u \log u^{2}+u^{q-1}, &amp; \text{in}\quad \mathbb{R}^{3},
  {\varepsilon}^{2\alpha} (-\Delta )^{\alpha}\phi=u^2, &amp; \text{in}\quad \mathbb{R}^{3}.
  \end{cases}
  \end{equation*} where $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is a small parameter, $q \in (4, 2_\alpha^*)$ with $\alpha\in(\frac{3}{4},1)$, $V: \mathbb{R}^{3} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function that satisfies some local potential hypothesis. By introducing a new Banach space, the energy functional become $C^{1}$, which create the conditions for studying the multiplicity of solutions involving Lusternik-Schnirelmann category. We prove that for $\varepsilon&gt;0$ small enough, the system has a positive ground state solution and each positive solution concentrates around a local minimum point of $V$.</description>

      <title>Diverse regularities for nonlocal parabolic De Giorgi classes I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we establish diverse Harnack inequalities for elements of a specific energy class, called the nonlocal parabolic (p-homogenous) De Giorgi class. This class encompasses the nonlinear parabolic counterpart of the seminal work of M. Cozzi (J. Funct. Anal., 2017) and embodies local weak solutions to the fractional heat equation. More precisely, we first derive the local boundedness and subsequently prove under minimal tail conditions several weak Harnack inequalities, measure theoretical propagation lemmas, and a full Harnack inequality for nonnegative members of the aforementioned class. Finally, we present a full proof of the local H\"older modulus of continuity, thereby establishing a Liouville-type rigidity property. The results are new even for the linear case, thereby showing that the recent achievements of Kassmann and Weidner (Duke Math. J., 2024) are structural properties, valid regardless of any equation. The techniques and ideas presented in this paper will open the door for further extensions to many natural directions.</description>

      <title>Kirchhoff-type equations involving the Fractional $(p,q)-$Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence and nonexistence of solutions for the following Kirchhoff-type fractional $(p\text{-}q)$-Laplacian problem:
  \begin{equation*} \begin{cases}
  M\left([u]^p_{p,s_1}\right)(-\Delta)^{s_1}_p u + M\left([u]^q_{q,s_2}\right)(-\Delta)^{s_2}_q u = \lambda\big[a(x)|u|^{p-2}u + b(x)|u|^{q-2}u\big] + h(x), &amp; \text{in } \Omega, \\ u = 0, &amp; \text{on } \mathbb{R}^N \setminus \Omega, \end{cases} \end{equation*}
  where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ ($N \geq 1$) is a bounded domain with smooth boundary, $0 &lt; s_1 &lt; s_2 &lt; 1$, and $s_1 p &lt; N$. We assume $1 &lt; q \leq p &lt; \theta p &lt; p^{*}_{s_1} := \dfrac{Np}{N - s_1 p}$, and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$. The functions $a(x), b(x)$, and $h(x)$ are non-negative, with $a, b \in L^\infty(\Omega)$ and $h \in L^q(\Omega)$.
  Using variational methods, we establish the existence of at least two weak solutions. The first solution is obtained via the direct minimization of the associated energy functional, and the second is obtained by applying the Mountain Pass Theorem. We also prove a nonexistence result for small values of the parameter $\lambda &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>Sharp remainder terms of weighted Hardy-Poincar\'e and Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl inequalities related to the Baouendi-Grushin operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain sharp remainder terms for the Hardy-Poincar\'e type inequality with general non-radial weights in the setting of Baouendi-Grushin vector fields (see Theorem 2.5). It is worth emphasizing that all of our results are new both in the Grushin and standard Euclidean setting. The method employed allows us to not only unify, but also improve the results of Kombe and Yener [KY18] for any $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ while holding true for complex-valued functions and providing explicit constants (Corollary 2.7). As a result, we are able to obtain sharp remainder terms to many known weighted Hardy-type inequalities (see Section 3.1). Aside from weighted Hardy-type inequalities, we also recover sharp remainder formula for the $L^{p}$-Poincar\'e inequality (Corollary 3.5). In the special case of radial weights, we are naturally able to introduce the notion of Grushin $p$-Bessel pairs (see Definition 2.9). Finally, we are able to apply the technique to establish the sharp remainder term of the Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl inequality in $L^{p}$ (Corollary 3.13) that includes the sharp constant.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz regularity for parabolic double phase equations with gradient nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the local Lipschitz regularity in space for the viscosity solutions to the parabolic double phase equation of the form \[ \smash{\partial_{t}u-\operatorname{div} \left(|Du|^{p-2}D u+a(z)|D u|^{q-2}D u\right)=f(z, Du)} \] by employing the Ishii-Lions method. In addition, we obtain H\"{o}lder estimate in time which turns out to be sharp in the degenerate regime. Here, $1&lt; p\leq q&lt;\infty,$ and the coefficient $a\geq 0$ is assumed to be bounded, locally Lipschitz continuous in space, and continuous in time. Furthermore, the non-homogeneity $f$ is assumed to be continuous on $\Omega\times \mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}^N,$ and to satisfy a suitable gradient growth condition. We also establish the equivalence between bounded viscosity solutions and weak solutions, under appropriate additional regularity assumption on the coefficient $a.$</description>

      <title>Global existence and uniqueness for Hibler's visco-plastic sea-ice model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove global existence and uniqueness of weak solutions to the momentum equations of Hibler's visco-plastic model for the dynamics of the arctic sea-ice covers. Although Hibler's model is standardly used in global climate simulations, there are only few rigorous mathematical results so far that mainly concern local-in-time well-posedness of globally regularized variants. Here, we consider Hibler's original model with local cut-off for arbitrarily small and large strain rates. Degeneracy and plasticity of the stress tensor hold in this range.</description>

      <title>Inaccuracy of Ensemble-Based Covariance Propagation, Beyond Sampling Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern data assimilation schemes typically use the same discrete dynamical model to evolve the state estimate in time also to approximate the evolution, or propagation, of the estimation error covariance. Ensemble-based methods, such as the ensemble Kalman filter, approximate the evolution of the covariance through the propagation of individual ensemble members. Thus, it is tacitly assumed that if the discrete state propagation and resulting mean state estimates are accurate, then the ensemble-based discrete covariance propagation will be accurate as well, apart from sampling errors due to limited ensemble size. Through a series of numerical experiments supported by analytical results, we demonstrate that this assumption is false when correlation length scales approach grid resolution. We show for states that satisfy advective dynamics, that while the discrete state propagation and ensemble mean state estimates are accurate, the corresponding ensemble covariances can be remarkably inaccurate, well beyond that expected from sampling errors or typical numerical discretization errors. The underlying problem is a fundamental discrepancy between discrete covariance propagation and the continuum covariance dynamics, which we can identify because the exact continuum covariance dynamics are known. Errors in the ensemble covariances, which can be at least one order of magnitude larger than those of the mean state when correlation lengths begin to approach grid scale, cannot be rectified by the usual methods, such as covariance inflation and localization. This work brings to light a fundamental problem for data assimilation schemes that propagate covariances using the same discrete dynamical model used to propagate the state.</description>

      <title>Is the optimal magnetic rectangle a square?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the dependence of the lowest eigenvalue of the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian on the geometry of rectangles, subject to homogeneous fields. We conjecture that the square is a global minimiser both under the area or perimeter constraints. Contrary to the well-known magnetic-free analogue, the present spectral problem does not admit explicit solutions. By establishing lower and upper bound to the eigenvalue, we establish the conjecture for weak magnetic fields. Moreover, we relate the validity of the conjecture to the simplicity of the eigenvalue and symmetries of minimisers of a non-convex minimisation problem.</description>

      <title>A Sharp KL-Convergence Analysis for Diffusion Models under Minimal Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have emerged as highly effective methods for synthesizing high-quality samples. Recent works have focused on analyzing the convergence of their generation process with minimal assumptions, either through reverse SDEs or Probability Flow ODEs. The best known guarantees, without any smoothness assumptions, for the KL divergence so far achieve a linear dependence on the data dimension $d$ and an inverse quadratic dependence on $\varepsilon$. In this work, we present a refined analysis that improves the dependence on $\varepsilon$. We model the generation process as a composition of two steps: a reverse ODE step, followed by a smaller noising step along the forward process. This design leverages the fact that the ODE step enables control in Wasserstein-type error, which can then be converted into a KL divergence bound via noise addition, leading to a better dependence on the discretization step size. We further provide a novel analysis to achieve the linear $d$-dependence for the error due to discretizing this Probability Flow ODE in absence of any smoothness assumptions. We show that $\tilde{O}\left(\tfrac{d\log^{3/2}(\frac{1}{\delta})}{\varepsilon}\right)$ steps suffice to approximate the target distribution corrupted with Gaussian noise of variance $\delta$ within $O(\varepsilon^2)$ in KL divergence, improving upon the previous best result, requiring $\tilde{O}\left(\tfrac{d\log^2(\frac{1}{\delta})}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ steps.</description>

      <title>Sharp bounds on the failure of the hot spots conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hot spots ratio of a domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ measures the degree of failure of Rauch's hot spots conjecture on that domain. We identify the largest possible value of this ratio over all connected Lipschitz domains $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, for any dimension $d$. As $d\to \infty$, we show that this maximal ratio converges to $\sqrt{e}$, which asymptotically matches the previous best known upper bound by Mariano, Panzo and Wang. For $d\ge 2$, we show that sets extremizing the hot spots ratio do not exist, and extremizing sequences must converge to a ball at a quantitative rate. We then give a sharp bound on the measure of the set for which the first Neumann eigenfunction exceeds its maximal boundary value. From this we deduce that the hot spots conjecture is asymptotically true "in measure'' as $d\to \infty$.</description>

      <title>The principal eigenvalue problem for a strongly anisotropic second-order elliptic operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an elliptic operator in which the second-order term is very small in one direction. In this regime, we study the behaviour of the principal eigenfunction and of the principal eigenvalue. Our first result deals with the limit of the principal eigenfunction and is shown with a representation of the principal eigenfunction as a quasi-stationary distribution. Subsequent results deal with the limit of the principal eigenvalue and are shown using Hamilton-Jacobi equations.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz regularity of fractional $p$-Laplacian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the H\"{o}lder regularity of the fractional $p$-Laplace equation of the form $(-\Delta_p)^s u=f$ where $p&gt;1, s\in (0, 1)$ and $f\in L^\infty_{\rm loc}(\Omega)$. Specifically, we prove that $u\in C^{0, \gamma_\circ}_{\rm loc}(\Omega)$ for $\gamma_\circ=\min\{1, \frac{sp}{p-1}\}$, provided that $\frac{sp}{p-1}\neq 1$. In particular, it shows that $u$ is locally Lipschitz for $\frac{sp}{p-1}&gt;1$. Moreover, we show that for $\frac{sp}{p-1}=1$, the solution is locally Lipschitz, provided that $f$ is locally H\"{o}lder continuous. Additionally, we discuss further regularity results for the fractional double-phase problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from the governing equations for geophysical flows, by means of a thin-shell approximation and a tangent plane approximation, we derive the equations describing, at leading order, the nonlinear ice-drift flow for regions centered around the North Pole. An exact solution is derived in the material/Lagrangian formalism, describing a superposition of oscillations, a mean Ekman flow and a geostrophic current.</description>

      <title>SDEs with critical general distributional drifts: sharp solvability and blow-ups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09244v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish weak well-posedness for SDEs having discontinuous diffusion coefficients and general distributional drifts that may introduce blow up effects. Our drifts satisfy minimal assumptions, i.e.\,we assume only that the Cauchy problem for the Kolmogorov backward equation is well-posed in the standard Hilbert triple $W^{1,2} \hookrightarrow L^2 \hookrightarrow W^{-1,2}$. By a result of Mazya and Verbitsky, these assumptions are precisely those drifts that can be represented as the sum of a form-bounded component (encompassing, for example, Morrey or Chang-Wilson-Wolff drifts) and a divergence-free distributional component in the ${\rm BMO}^{-1}$ space of Koch and Tataru.
  We apply our results to finite particle systems with strong attracting interactions immersed in a turbulent flow. This includes particle systems of Keller-Segel type. Crucially, in dimensions $d \geq 3$, we cover almost the entire admissible range of attraction strengths, reaching nearly to the blow-up threshold.
  As a further application of our results for SDEs and of the theory of Bessel processes, we obtain an improved upper bound on the constant in the many-particle Hardy inequality. Consequently, the lower bound previously derived by Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Laptev, and Tidblom is shown to be close to optimal.</description>
