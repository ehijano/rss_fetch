      <title>Thermal Resilience of Suspended Thin-Film Lithium Niobate Acoustic Resonators up to 550 {\deg}C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20840v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports a suspended thin-film lithium niobate (LN) piezoelectric resonator platform surviving high annealing temperatures of 550 {\deg}C, among the highest temperature at which the thermal resilience of suspended LN resonators is studied. Acoustic resonators are built on 600 nm thick transferred stoichiometric LN on silicon wafers with 40 nm thick platinum (Pt) electrodes, selected for high temperature operation. The fabricated resonators are first annealed at 250 {\deg}C, and the anneal temperature is incrementally increased to 550 {\deg}C after 7 rounds of annealing. The annealing is shown to upshift resonant frequencies and can increase the quality factor (Q), within a temperature range, before it gradually damages the device performance. This work presents promising results for using the suspended thin-film LN platform for resonators, sensors, and transducers in harsh thermal environments.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength thermometry without a priori emissivity information: from promise to disillusionment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) thermography provides 2D radiance maps of the IR radiation leaving the surfaces of a scene, based on preliminary calibration. Then, to convert radiance maps into temperature maps, we need to know the emissivity of each element of the scene conjugated to each of the detector elements in the camera's focal plane. Compared to the single-band approach, can multispectral thermography help solve the inverse temperature-emissivity separation problem? Multiwavelength thermometry (MWT) is known to be an underdetermined problem having a continuous infinity of solutions. For this reason, and right from the origin of MWT, it appeared necessary to introduce information on emissivity to assess temperature, for example, by means of an analytical model. Overlooking these recommendations, a number of papers appeared in the early 2000s exploring the idea that we could do without any a priori knowledge of emissivity. Growth became exponential from 2020 onward, with the allegedly successful application of neural networks, genetic algorithms, and other novel optimization methods. The aim of the present work is to recall the consequences of MWT as an underdetermined inverse problem, to highlight the errors made by ignoring them, and to bring us back to harsh reality: we must introduce information on emissivity in order to evaluate temperature accurately. Furthermore, this information has to be fully consistent with the true spectral emissivity. To this end, we propose a new method for optimal selection of the emissivity model. A series of blind tests was set up to benchmark different inversion algorithms. The results confirm the failure of the temperature-emissivity separation when no emissivity information is available, despite the multiwavelength approach, which in any case comes as no surprise.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Cell Counting through MLOps: A Structured Approach for Automated Cell Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models offer significant potential for advancing cell counting applications in neuroscience, medical research, pharmaceutical development, and environmental monitoring. However, implementing these models effectively requires robust operational frameworks. This paper introduces Cell Counting Machine Learning Operations (CC-MLOps), a comprehensive framework that streamlines the integration of ML in cell counting workflows. CC-MLOps encompasses data access and preprocessing, model training, monitoring, explainability features, and sustainability considerations. Through a practical use case, we demonstrate how MLOps principles can enhance model reliability, reduce human error, and enable scalable Cell Counting solutions. This work provides actionable guidance for researchers and laboratory professionals seeking to implement machine learning (ML)- powered cell counting systems.</description>

      <title>The effect of finite duration sources on modes and generalization of the d'Alembert solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of dispersive waves governed by linear wave equations, where a finite duration source is applied. The resulting wave may be viewed as the superposition of modes before the source is turned on and after it is turned off. We consider the problem of relating the modes after the source term is turned off to the modes before the source term was turned on. We obtain explicit formulas in both the wavenumber and position representations. A number of special cases are considered. Using the methods presented, we obtain a generalization of the d'Alembert solution which applies to linear wave equations with constant coefficients.</description>

Abstract: The seminar on energy recovery linacs (ERLs) is giving an overview of the field: How does an ERL work? What have been important milestones in ERL history? What are the reasons to use an ERL instead of a conventional accelerator? As examples of the landscape of machines, ranging from ancient ERLs up to future projects, this chapter will give results of the runs from CBETA (USA) and S-DALINAC (Germany). The two facilities bERLin-Pro/SEALab (Germany) and MESA (Germany) will belong to the next ERLs to be in operation and will be introduced briefly. The way to future ERLs will also be addressed.</description>

      <title>Flexible Perovskite/Silicon Monolithic Tandem Solar Cells Approaching 30% Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thanks to their excellent properties of low cost, lightweight, portability, and conformity, flexible perovskite-based tandem solar cells show great potentials for energy harvesting applications, with flexible perovskite/c-silicon tandem solar cells particularly promising for achieving high efficiency. However, performance of flexible perovskite/c-silicon monolithic tandem solar cells still greatly lags, due to challenges in simultaneously achieving both efficient photocarrier transport and reliable mitigation of residual stress. Here, we reveal the critical role of perovskite phase homogeneity, for achieving high-efficient and mechanical-stable flexible perovskite/c-silicon heterojunction monolithic tandem solar cells (PSTs) with textured surface. Through ensuring high phase homogeneity, which promotes charge transfer across all facets of the pyramid on the textured substrates and releases the residual stress at the perovskite/c-silicon interface, we demonstrate flexible PSTs with a bending curvature of 0.44 cm-1, and a certified power conversion efficiency of 29.88% (1.04 cm2 aperture area), surpassing all other types of flexible perovskite-based photovoltaic devices. Our results can lead to broad applications and commercialization of flexible perovskite/c-silicon tandem photovoltaics.</description>

      <title>Desynchronization in multilayer p-i-n drift step recovery diode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact semiconductor drift step recovery diodes (DSRDs) can have on high-power microwave applications make them a device of interest for future solid-state electronics. However, there is little known about their functionality and degradation under over-voltaging or high average power dissipation conditions that could therefore hinder their continual design and optimization toward better performance. The experiments on a Si seven layer DSRD conducted in the present paper allowed to broaden the understanding of its opening switching performance under over-voltaging conditions. A striking desynchronization was discovered and linked to junction and electro-neutral region damage through experiments and PSpice modelling.</description>

      <title>Experimental Observation of Extremely Strong Defect-Phonon Scatterings in Semiconductor Single Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The role of doping in tailoring thermal transport in semiconductors is critical for efficient thermal management in electronic devices. While the effects of doping have been extensively studied to tune electrical properties, its impact on thermal transport has not yet been thoroughly explored, particularly with respect to experimental investigations into exceptionally strong non-Rayleigh defect-phonon scattering phenomena. Herein, by combining the high-quality growth and advanced characterizations of cubic silicon carbide single crystals with well controlled boron doping, we experimentally observe anomalous strong defect-phonon scatterings, among the strongest reported in common semiconductors, that exceeds the predictions of the classic mass difference model by tens of times in magnitude. The measured thermal conductivity of doped 3C SiC match excellently with those predicted by first principle calculations in which resonant scattering of low frequency phonon is considered. Our findings not only shed light on the fundamental understanding of defect-phonon interactions and will also impact applications such as thermal management of electronics.</description>

      <title>Exploring the impact of the inverse Faraday effect on all-optical helicity-dependent magnetization switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All-optical helicity-dependent magnetization switching (AO-HDS) is the quickest data recording technique using only ultrashort laser pulses. FePt grains provide an ideal platform for examining the interaction of effects conducting magnetization switching. We identify the magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and the inverse Faraday effect (IFE) as the primary switching forces. Ultrafast photon absorption rapidly elevates electron temperatures, quenching magnetization. The MCD's helicity-dependent absorption ensures distinct electron temperatures, holding a finite switching probability by generating different spin noise rates in each spin channel. The IFE induces a magnetic moment, enhancing this probability. We present ultrashort laser pulse (&lt;200 fs) AO-HDS experiments in the near-infrared spectral range from 800 nm to 1500 nm, demonstrating a correlation between switching efficiency and absorbed energy density. Elevating electron temperatures to the Curie point enables the IFE to induce a magnetic moment for deterministic switching in the quenched magnetization state. Unlike in films or multilayers, where domain wall motion and domain growth govern the switching process, increasing the MCD in nanometer-sized grains does not enhance switching efficiency. Electrons around the Curie temperature typically reach increased switching rates for higher induced magnetization generated by the IFE. The MCD sets the necessary switching condition, separating electron temperatures. The IFE generates a magnetic moment, directing spins toward the desired orientation and improving switching efficiency. Every laser pulse initiates a new switching probability for each grain, increasing the role of direction indication by the IFE. Stronger absorption assures higher induced magnetization at low switching fluences.</description>

      <title>Efficient inverse design of large-area metasurfaces for incoherent light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.10701v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incoherent light is ubiquitous, yet designing optical devices that can handle its random nature is very challenging, since directly averaging over many incoherent incident beams can require a huge number of scattering calculations. We show how to instead solve this problem with a reciprocity technique which leads to three orders of magnitude speedup: one Maxwell solve (using any numerical technique) instead of thousands. This improvement enables us to perform efficient inverse design, large scale optimization of the metasurface for applications such as light collimators and concentrators. We show the impact of the angular distribution of incident light on the resulting performance, and show especially promising designs for the case of "annular" beams distributed only over nonzero angles.</description>

      <title>The impact of local noise recorded at the ET candidate sites on the signal to noise ratio of CBC gravitational wave signals for the ET triangle configuration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02166v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an evaluation of how site dependent noise can affect the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals in the future 3rd generation gravitational wave (GW) detector Einstein Telescope (ET). The design of ET is currently pushing the scientific community to study its scientific potential with respect to known, and possibly unexpected, GW signals using its design sensitivity curves. However, local ambient noise may have an impact on the ET sensitivity at low frequency and therefore affect the SNR of CBC signals at low frequency. Therefore, we study the impact of ambient noise on the ET sensitivity curve at the two sites candidate to host ET - Sardinia, in Italy, and the Euregio Meuse-Rhine (EMR) at the Netherlands-Belgium border - and infer the impact on the ET sensitivity curve and how the SNR of CBC signals at low frequencies is affected. We find that Sardinia shows results which are on par, if not better, than the design case. On the other hand, ambient noise for the current EMR sensitivity curve in Terziet causes a higher degradation of the SNR performances.</description>

      <title>Broadband Angular-selective Mid-infrared Photodetector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mid-infrared photodetectors are susceptible to background noise since every object in the surroundings emits thermal radiation from different directions. To reduce this background noise and enhance signal-to-noise ratio of mid-infrared sensing, different strategies to achieve angular-selective filtering have been proposed. However, these methods are either wavelength- and polarization-dependent, or require bulky lens or mirror systems. The former compromises the photodetector sensitivity, and the latter makes it difficult to integrate with wearable or on-chip devices. In this study, we present a novel angular-selective microstructure array that can seamlessly integrate onto a mid-infrared photodetector. Our compact device leverages the conservation of etendue to attain high angular selectivity over a broad range of mid-infrared wavelengths. Radiation from unwanted angles is substantially filtered, which leads to a markedly enhanced photodetection signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, the device's photoresponse is shown to be polarization- and wavelength-insensitive, avoiding signal losses associated with narrow spectral ranges or polarization dependence, and therefore circumventing degradation in photodetector sensitivity. Our broadband angular-selective mid-infrared photodetector holds great promise for wearable devices, medical diagnostics and space applications.</description>

      <title>Equivalent Circuit Modeling of a Lumped-element Loaded Metasurface under Arbitrary Incidence and Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we develop a simple equivalent circuit model (ECM) that predicts the spectral response of a lumped-element loaded single patterned layer reflective metasurface. The proposed ECM maintains accuracy across varying design parameters including dual-polarization, arbitrary obliquity and azimuthal rotation of incidence plane, as well as physical dimensions of the lumped elements. Our approach is built incrementally, starting from an elementary unit cell which is extended to a 2-by-2 arrangement that allows for multifunctionality and reconfigurability in both polarizations, independently. These capabilities facilitate the design of tunable holographic metasurfaces which can implement reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) for advanced wireless communication systems. We evaluate the limitations and accuracy of the proposed ECM with full-wave simulations (FWS), which evidence robustness up to 45 degrees and thus highlight its aptitude as a rapid design tool or a guide for FWS-based optimization.</description>
