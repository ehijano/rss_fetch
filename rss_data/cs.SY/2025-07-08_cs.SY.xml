      <title>Control Synthesis in Partially Observable Environments for Complex Perception-Related Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perception-related tasks often arise in autonomous systems operating under partial observability. This work studies the problem of synthesizing optimal policies for complex perception-related objectives in environments modeled by partially observable Markov decision processes. To formally specify such objectives, we introduce \emph{co-safe linear inequality temporal logic} (sc-iLTL), which can define complex tasks that are formed by the logical concatenation of atomic propositions as linear inequalities on the belief space of the POMDPs. Our solution to the control synthesis problem is to transform the \mbox{sc-iLTL} objectives into reachability objectives by constructing the product of the belief MDP and a deterministic finite automaton built from the sc-iLTL objective. To overcome the scalability challenge due to the product, we introduce a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method that converges in probability to the optimal policy. Finally, a drone-probing case study demonstrates the applicability of our method.</description>

      <title>Global Optimization of Multi-Flyby Trajectories for Multi-Orbital-Plane Constellations Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of mega-constellations in low Earth orbits has posed significant challenges to space traffic management, necessitating periodic inspections of satellites to ensure the sustainability of the space environment when economically feasible. This study addresses the orbital design challenge associated with inspecting numerous satellites distributed across multiple orbital planes through flybys by proposing an innovative orbital-plane-based inspection strategy. The proposed methodology reformulates the multi-satellite flyby problem into a multi-rendezvous trajectory planning problem by proposing an analytical approach to determine a maneuver-free inspection orbit that enables flyby of all satellites within a specific orbital plane. Additionally, a three-layer global optimization framework is developed to tackle this problem. The first layer establishes an approximate cost evaluation model for orbital plane visitation sequences, utilizing a genetic algorithm to identify the optimal sequence from a vast array of candidate planes, thereby maximizing inspection targets while minimizing fuel consumption. The second layer constructs a mixed-integer programming model to locally refine the rendezvous epochs and orbital parameters of each inspection orbit to reduce the total velocity increment. The third layer accurately computes the optimal impulsive maneuvers and trajectories between inspection orbits. In contrast to traditional low-Earth orbit rendezvous optimization frameworks, the proposed framework fully leverages the adjustable freedom in inclination and right ascension of the ascending node (RAAN) of inspection orbits, significantly reducing the total velocity increment. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively address the trajectory optimization problem associated with constellation inspection for tens of thousands of satellites.</description>

      <title>Determination of Bandwidth of Q-filter in Disturbance Observers to Guarantee Transient and Steady State Performance under Measurement Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Q-filter-based disturbance observer (DOB) is one of the most widely used robust controller due to its design simplicity. Such simplicity arises from that reducing the time constant of low pass filters, not only ensures robust stability but also enhances nominal performance recovery -- ability to recover the trajectory of nominal closed-loop system. However, in contrast to noise-free environment, excessively small time constant can rather damage the nominal performance recovery under measurement noise. That is, minimizing time constant is no longer immediately guaranteeing nominal performance recovery. Motivated by this observation, this paper concentrates on determination of time constant to ensure transient and steady state performance. This analysis uses Lyapunov method based on the coordinate change inspired by the singular perturbation theory. As a result, we present an affordable noise level and open interval for the time constant that guarantees both the required performances. The analysis can also lead to theoretical demonstration on that excessively reducing time constant is assured to achieve target performance only for noise-free case.</description>

      <title>Game-Theoretic Modeling of Vehicle Unprotected Left Turns Considering Drivers' Bounded Rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the decision-making behavior of vehicles presents unique challenges, particularly during unprotected left turns at intersections, where the uncertainty of human drivers is especially pronounced. In this context, connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology emerges as a promising avenue for effectively managing such interactions while ensuring safety and efficiency. Traditional approaches, often grounded in game theory assumptions of perfect rationality, may inadequately capture the complexities of real-world scenarios and drivers' decision-making errors. To fill this gap, we propose a novel decision-making model for vehicle unprotected left-turn scenarios, integrating game theory with considerations for drivers' bounded rationality. Our model, formulated as a two-player normal-form game solved by a quantal response equilibrium (QRE), offers a more nuanced depiction of driver decision-making processes compared to Nash equilibrium (NE) models. Leveraging an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm coupled with a subtle neural network trained on precise microscopic vehicle trajectory data, we optimize model parameters to accurately reflect drivers' interaction-aware bounded rationality and driving styles. Through comprehensive simulation experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model in capturing the interaction-aware bounded rationality and decision tendencies between players. The proposed model proves to be more realistic and efficient than NE models in unprotected left-turn scenarios. Our findings contribute valuable insights into the vehicle decision-making behaviors with bounded rationality, thereby informing the development of more robust and realistic autonomous driving systems.</description>

      <title>Control Synthesis Along Uncertain Trajectories Using Integral Quadratic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a novel approach to synthesize robust controllers for nonlinear systems along perturbed trajectories. The approach linearizes the system with respect to a reference trajectory. In contrast to existing methods rooted in robust linear time-varying synthesis, the approach accurately includes perturbations that drive the system away from the reference trajectory. Hence, the controller obtained in the linear framework provides a significantly more robust nonlinear performance. The calculation of the controller is derived from robust synthesis approaches rooted in the integral quadratic constraints framework. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated on a pitch tracker design for a space launcher.</description>

      <title>Neural Substitute Solver for Efficient Edge Inference of Power Electronic Hybrid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancing the dynamics inference of power electronic systems (PES) to the real-time edge-side holds transform-ative potential for testing, control, and monitoring. How-ever, efficiently inferring the inherent hybrid continu-ous-discrete dynamics on resource-constrained edge hardware remains a significant challenge. This letter pro-poses a neural substitute solver (NSS) approach, which is a neural-network-based framework aimed at rapid accurate inference with significantly reduced computational costs. Specifically, NSS leverages lightweight neural networks to substitute time-consuming matrix operation and high-order numerical integration steps in traditional solvers, which transforms sequential bottlenecks into highly parallel operation suitable for edge hardware. Experimental vali-dation on a multi-stage DC-DC converter demonstrates that NSS achieves 23x speedup and 60% hardware resource reduction compared to traditional solvers, paving the way for deploying edge inference of high-fidelity PES dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study validates the use of Neural Lumped Parameter Differential Equations for open-loop setpoint control of the plunge sequence in Friction Stir Processing (FSP). The approach integrates a data-driven framework with classical heat transfer techniques to predict tool temperatures, informing control strategies. By utilizing a trained Neural Lumped Parameter Differential Equation model, we translate theoretical predictions into practical set-point control, facilitating rapid attainment of desired tool temperatures and ensuring consistent thermomechanical states during FSP. This study covers the design, implementation, and experimental validation of our control approach, establishing a foundation for efficient, adaptive FSP operations.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Mean Field Framework for Aggregators Participating in Wholesale Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of distributed energy resources (DERs), including rooftop solar and energy storage, is transforming the grid edge, where distributed technologies and customer-side systems increasingly interact with the broader power grid. DER aggregators, entities that coordinate and optimize the actions of many small-scale DERs, play a key role in this transformation. This paper presents a hybrid Mean-Field Control (MFC) and Mean-Field Game (MFG) framework for integrating DER aggregators into wholesale electricity markets. Unlike traditional approaches that treat market prices as exogenous, our model captures the feedback between aggregators' strategies and locational marginal prices (LMPs) of electricity. The MFC component optimizes DER operations within each aggregator, while the MFG models strategic interactions among multiple aggregators. To account for various uncertainties, we incorporate reinforcement learning (RL), which allows aggregators to learn optimal bidding strategies in dynamic market conditions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a mean-field equilibrium and validate the framework through a case study of the Oahu Island power system. Results show that our approach reduces price volatility and improves market efficiency, offering a scalable and decentralized solution for DER integration in wholesale markets.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Port Technique for Synthesising Rotational Components in Component Modal Synthesis Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Component Modal Synthesis (CMS) is a reduced order modelling method widely used for large-scale complex systems. It can effectively approximate system-level models through component synthesis, in which the repetitive geometrical components are modelled once and synthesised together. However, the conventional CMS only applies to systems with stationary components connected by strictly compatible ports, limiting it from modelling systems with moving components. This paper presents an adaptive port (AP) technique to extend CMS approaches for modelling parametric systems with rotational parts. To demonstrate the capability of the AP technique, we apply it to the Static Condensation Reduced Basis Element (SCRBE), one widely used variant of CMS approaches. The AP-based SCRBE (AP-SCRBE) can enforce the synthesis of rotational-stationary components over a shared adaptive port when the connecting surfaces of two components are discretisation-wise incompatible, which happens when one component moves relative to the others. Numerical experiments on the NREL 5MW wind turbine show that, in the context of rotational-stationary component synthesis, the AP-SCRBE can accurately and efficiently model the rotating rotor with pitch rotation of blades. It can produce almost identical results to a high-fidelity finite element model at two to three orders faster speeds.</description>

      <title>Airspeed estimation for UAVs using only propeller feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel analytical model for estimating the airspeed of fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) using solely propeller power and rotational speed measurements. The model can be used to replace Pitot-tube-based airspeed sensors, or contribute to redundancy in airspeed estimation. It does not require knowledge of the vehicle's dynamic model and is computationally lightweight. It leverages power and rotational speed feedback, which is readily available from modern Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs), thereby enabling seamless integration with existing systems and off-the-shelf components. A systematic approach is followed to derive the model structure based on least squares optimization and regularization techniques on Blade Element Momentum (BEM) simulation, wind tunnel, and flight test datasets. The final model generalizes well achieving a normalized Root Mean Square Error (nRMSE) of 5% on unseen flight data. The model parameters can be identified either offline, using flight logs with airspeed measurements, or in-flight, using a lightweight identification method based only on Global Positioning System (GPS) velocity data. The resulting system provides a robust and computationally efficient solution for real-time airspeed estimation across diverse fixed-wing UAV platforms.</description>

      <title>Optimization-Based Comparative System Evaluation of Single and Dual Traction Inverters with Focus on Partial Load Efficiency and Chip Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to electric transportation demands efficient and cost-effective powertrains. Optimizing energy use is crucial for extending range and reducing expenses. However, comparing inverter and motor efficiency based on inverter topologies is challenging due to biased methodologies that favor certain designs over others. This document introduces a novel optimization-based approach for enhancing partial load efficiency and minimizing chip area of single and dual traction inverters, indicating potential energy savings and cost reduction. Recent publications of both industry and academia underscore the importance of these design goals achieved by either novel inverter topologies or enhanced control methods. Two promising topologies with the inherent capability of partial load optimization are evaluated regarding chip area and system efficiency to find the most suitable concept for future electric vehicle power trains.</description>

      <title>On Decision-Dependent Uncertainties in Power Systems with High-Share Renewables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuously increasing renewable energy sources (RES) and demand response (DR) are becoming important sources of system flexibility. As a consequence, decision-dependent uncertainties (DDUs), interchangeably referred to as endogenous uncertainties, impose new characteristics to power system dispatch. The DDUs faced by system operators originate from uncertain dispatchable resources such as RES units or DR, while reserve providers encounter DDUs arising from the uncertain reserve deployment. This paper presents a systematic framework for addressing robust dispatch problems with DDUs. The main contributions include i) the robust characterization of DDUs with a dependency decomposition structure; ii) a generic DDU coping mechanism, manifested as the bilateral matching between uncertainty and flexibility; iii) analyses of the influence of DDU incorporation on the convexity/non-convexity of robust dispatch problems; and iv) generic solution algorithms adaptive for DDUs. Under this framework, the inherent distinctions and correlations between DDUs and DIUs are revealed, providing a fundamental theoretical basis for the economic and reliable operation of RES-dominated power systems. Applications in the source and demand sides illustrate the importance of considering DDUs and verify the effectiveness of proposed algorithms for robust dispatch with DDUs.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Spiking Neurons for Linear Quadratic Regulator Control of Multi-linked Pole on a Cart: from Single Neuron to Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging field of neuromorphic computing for edge control applications poses the need to quantitatively estimate and limit the number of spiking neurons, to reduce network complexity and optimize the number of neurons per core and hence, the chip size, in an application-specific neuromorphic hardware. While rate-encoding for spiking neurons provides a robust way to encode signals with the same number of neurons as an ANN, it often lacks precision. To achieve the desired accuracy, a population of neurons is often needed to encode the complete range of input signals. However, using population encoding immensely increases the total number of neurons required for a particular application, thus increasing the power consumption and on-board resource utilization. A transition from two neurons to a population of neurons for the LQR control of a cartpole is shown in this work. The near-linear behavior of a Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire neuron can be exploited to achieve the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control of a cartpole system. This has been shown in simulation, followed by a demonstration on a single-neuron hardware, known as Lu.i. The improvement in control performance is then demonstrated by using a population of varying numbers of neurons for similar control in the Nengo Neural Engineering Framework, on CPU and on Intel's Loihi neuromorphic chip. Finally, linear control is demonstrated for four multi-linked pendula on cart systems, using a population of neurons in Nengo, followed by an implementation of the same on Loihi. This study compares LQR control in the NEF using $7$ control and $7$ neuromorphic performance metrics, followed by a comparison with other conventional spiking and non-spiking controllers.</description>

      <title>On the Limits of Robust Control Under Adversarial Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a fundamental and important question in control: under what conditions does there fail to exist a robust control policy that keeps the state of a constrained linear system within a target set, despite bounded disturbances? This question has practical implications for actuator and sensor specification, feasibility analysis for reference tracking, and the design of adversarial attacks in cyber-physical systems. While prior research has predominantly focused on using optimization to compute control-invariant sets to ensure feasible operation, our work complements these approaches by characterizing explicit sufficient conditions under which robust control is fundamentally infeasible. Specifically, we derive novel closed-form, algebraic expressions that relate the size of a disturbance set -- modelled as a scaled version of a basic shape -- to the system's spectral properties and the geometry of the constraint sets.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a battery-less, self-powered water leak detection system that utilizes LoRa communication for long-range, real-time monitoring. The system harvests hydroelectric energy through a layered stack of conductive nanomaterials and metals, achieving a peak short-circuit current of over 500 mA and 1.65 V open-circuit voltage upon exposure to water. To address LoRa's higher power demands, an energy management subsystem -- comprising a DC-DC boost converter and a 100 mF supercapacitor -- ensures stable power delivery for the LLCC68 LoRa module. Experimental results demonstrate the system's ability to detect leaks as shallow as 0.5 mm, activate within 50 seconds across varying water depths, and transmit data reliably over LoRaWAN. This solution eliminates battery dependency, offering a scalable, maintenance-free approach for industrial, commercial, and residential applications, while advancing sustainable IoT infrastructure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a reformulation of the streaming dynamic mode decomposition method that requires maintaining a single orthonormal basis, thereby reducing computational redundancy. The proposed efficient streaming dynamic mode decomposition method results in a constant-factor reduction in computational complexity and memory storage requirements. Numerical experiments on representative canonical dynamical systems show that the enhanced computational efficiency does not compromise the accuracy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Modeling and control of a low-cost multirotor hybrid aerial underwater vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive modeling and control framework for a low-cost multirotor hybrid aerial-aquatic vehicle (MHAUV) capable of seamless air-water transitions. A hybrid dynamics model is proposed to account for the distinct hydrodynamic and aerodynamic forces across three operational zones: aerial, aquatic, and transitional hybrid regions. The model incorporates variable buoyancy, added mass effects, and fluid resistance, with thrust characteristics of submerged propellers analyzed through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. A hierarchical control strategy is developed, combining twisting sliding mode control (TWSMC) for robust attitude stabilization during medium transitions with cascade PID controllers for precise motion tracking in homogeneous media. Experimental validation using a modified FPV quadrotor prototype demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach, achieving steady-state height errors below 0.1 m and attitude fluctuations under 5{\deg} during repeated water-crossing maneuvers. The results highlight the system's adaptability to fluid medium variations while maintaining cost-effectiveness and operational simplicity.</description>

      <title>The Frequency Response of Networks as Open Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many biological, technological, and social systems are effectively networks of interacting individual systems. Typically, these networks are not isolated objects, but interact with their environment through both signals and information that is received by specific nodes with an input function or released to the environment by other nodes with an output function. An important question is whether the structure of different networks, together with the particular selection of input and output nodes, is such that it favors the passing or blocking of such signals. For a given network and a given choice of the input and output nodes, the H2-norm provides a natural and general quantification of the extent to which input signals-whether deterministic or stochastic, periodic or arbitrary-are amplified. We analyze a diverse set of empirical networks and conjecture that many naturally occurring systems-such as food webs, signaling pathways, and gene regulatory circuits-are structurally organized to enhance the passing of signals, facilitating the efficient flow of biomass, information, or regulatory activity. This passing behavior culminates in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), for which we analytically show that amplification depends on the number and length of input-output pathways, which is consistent with the well-known tendency of naturally emerging networks to approximate DAG structures. In contrast, the structure of engineered systems like power grids appears to be intentionally designed to suppress signal propagation, as the transmitted quantity-voltage phase differences-requires tight control to maintain synchronized operation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dynamical system approach for the control of a nonlinear dynamical system by defining the control problem in a Fiber bundle framework. The constructive procedure derived results in the generation of a NHIM/NAIM which facilitates the use of tools and ideas from dynamical system theory to analyze and understand the properties associated with the controlled system. The time scale separation, decoupling of system dynamics, and their role in the system behavior are analyzed. An overview of the benefits of the above approach is demonstrated by briefly discussing three main application areas.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sizing and Control of a Grid-Connected Battery in a Stacked Revenue Model Including an Energy Community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen rapid increases in intermittent renewable generation, requiring novel battery energy storage systems (BESS) solutions. One recent trend is the emergence of large grid-connected batteries, that can be controlled to provide multiple storage and flexibility services, using a stacked revenue model. Another emerging development is renewable energy communities (REC), in which prosumers invest in their own renewable generation capacity, but also requiring battery storage for flexibility. In this paper, we study settings in which energy communities rent battery capacity from a battery operator through a battery-as-a-service (BaaS) model. We present a methodology for determining the sizing and pricing of battery capacity that can be rented, such that it provides economic benefits to both the community and the battery operator that participates in the energy market. We examine how sizes and prices vary across a number of different scenarios for different types of tariffs (flat, dynamic) and competing energy market uses. Second, we conduct a systematic study of linear optimization models for battery control when deployed to provide flexibility to energy communities. We show that existing approaches for battery control with daily time windows have a number of important limitations in practical deployments, and we propose a number of regularization functions in the optimization to address them. Finally, we investigate the proposed method using real generation, demand, tariffs, and battery data, based on a practical case study from a large battery operator in the Netherlands. For the settings in our case study, we find that a community of 200 houses with a 330 kW wind turbine can save up to 12,874 euros per year by renting just 280 kWh of battery capacity (after subtracting battery rental costs), with the methodology applicable to a wide variety of settings and tariff types.</description>

      <title>Improving Action Smoothness for a Cascaded Online Learning Flight Control System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to improve the action smoothness of a cascaded online learning flight control system. Although the cascaded structure is widely used in flight control design, its stability can be compromised by oscillatory control actions, which poses challenges for practical engineering applications. To address this issue, we introduce an online temporal smoothness technique and a low-pass filter to reduce the amplitude and frequency of the control actions. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to analyze policy performance in the frequency domain. Simulation results demonstrate the improvements achieved by the two proposed techniques.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Trajectory Optimization and Control for an Underwater Suspended Robotic System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the trajectory optimization of an underwater suspended robotic system comprising an uncrewed surface vessel (USV) and an uncrewed underwater vehicle (UUV) for autonomous litter collection. The key challenge lies in the significant uncertainty in drag and weight parameters introduced by the collected litter. We propose a dynamical model for the coupled UUV-USV system in the primary plane of motion and a risk-aware optimization approach incorporating parameter uncertainty and noise to ensure safe interactions with the environment. A stochastic optimization problem is solved using a conditional value-at-risk framework. Simulations demonstrate that our approach reduces collision risks and energy consumption, highlighting its reliability compared to existing control methods.</description>

      <title>Feature-Based Belief Aggregation for Partially Observable Markov Decision Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a finite-state partially observable Markov decision problem (POMDP) with an infinite horizon and a discounted cost, and we propose a new method for computing a cost function approximation that is based on features and aggregation. In particular, using the classical belief-space formulation, we construct a related Markov decision problem (MDP) by first aggregating the unobservable states into feature states, and then introducing representative beliefs over these feature states. This two-stage aggregation approach facilitates the use of dynamic programming methods for solving the aggregate problem and provides additional design flexibility. The optimal cost function of the aggregate problem can in turn be used within an on-line approximation in value space scheme for the original POMDP. We derive a new bound on the approximation error of our scheme. In addition, we establish conditions under which the cost function approximation provides a lower bound for the optimal cost. Finally, we present a biased aggregation approach, which leverages an optimal cost function estimate to improve the quality of the approximation error of the aggregate problem.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Harmonics Reduction in Reset-Based Control Systems: Application to Precision Positioning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the limitations imposed by Bode's gain-phase relationship in linear controllers, a reset-based filter called the Constant in gain- Lead in phase (CgLp) filter has been introduced. This filter consists of a reset element and a linear lead filter. However, the sequencing of these two components has been a topic of debate. Positioning the lead filter before the reset element in the loop leads to noise amplification in the reset signal, whereas placing the lead filter after the reset element results in the magnification of higher-order harmonics. This study introduces a tunable lead CgLp structure in which the lead filter is divided into two segments, enabling a balance between noise reduction and higher-order harmonics mitigation. Additionally, a filtering technique is proposed, employing a target-frequency-based approach to mitigate nonlinearity in reset control systems in the presence of noise. The effectiveness of the proposed methods in reducing nonlinearity is demonstrated through both frequency domain and time-domain analyses using a simulated precision positioning system as a case study.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Nonlinear Power Split Control For BESS With Real-Time Simulation Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a mixed-integer, nonlinear, multi-objective optimization strategy for optimal power allocation among parallel strings in Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). High-fidelity control is achieved by co-simulating the optimizer with a BESS electro-thermal simulation that models spatial thermal dynamics of the battery, providing real-time State of Charge (SOC) and temperature feedback. The optimizer prioritizes reliability by enforcing power availability as a hard constraint and penalizing battery thermal derating. Within these bounds, the controller performs a Pareto sweep on the relative weights of inverter and battery losses to balance the trade-off between inverter efficiency and battery efficiency. The inverter loss model is based on an empirical lookup table (LUT) derived from a commercial inverter system, while the battery thermal loss model uses SOC and temperature-dependent internal resistance, with electric current computed from the battery Equivalent Circuit Model (ECM). When the optimization was applied to a two-string BESS, the competing effects of inverter and battery losses on system availability and thermal derating were observed. The balanced operation yielded improvements of 1% in battery efficiency, 1.5% in inverter efficiency, and 2% in derating efficiency, while maintaining higher availability. Additionally, a 5 degrees C reduction in BESS peak temperature also suggests reduced thermal stress without compromising availability.</description>

      <title>Accounting for Subsystem Aging Variability in Battery Energy Storage System Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a degradation-cost-aware optimization framework for multi-string battery energy storage systems, emphasizing the impact of inhomogeneous subsystem-level aging in operational decision-making. We evaluate four scenarios for an energy arbitrage scenario, that vary in model precision and treatment of aging costs. Key performance metrics include operational revenue, power schedule mismatch, missed revenues, capacity losses, and revenue generated per unit of capacity loss. Our analysis reveals that ignoring heterogeneity of subunits may lead to infeasible dispatch plans and reduced revenues. In contrast, combining accurate representation of degraded subsystems and the consideration of aging costs in the objective function improves operational accuracy and economic efficiency of BESS with heterogeneous aged subunits. The fully informed scenario, which combines aging-cost-aware optimization with precise string-level modeling, achieves 21% higher revenue per unit of SOH loss compared to the baseline scenario. These findings highlight that modeling aging heterogeneity is not just a technical refinement but may become a crucial enabler for maximizing both short-term profitability and long-term asset value in particular for long BESS usage scenarios.</description>

      <title>Force-IMU Fusion-Based Sensing Acupuncture Needle and Quantitative Analysis System for Acupuncture Manipulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acupuncture, one of the key therapeutic methods in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), has been widely adopted in various clinical fields. Quantitative research on acupuncture manipulation parameters is critical to achieve standardized techniques. However, quantitative mechanical detection of acupuncture parameters remains limited. This study establishes a kinematic and dynamic model of acupuncture, identifying key parameters such as lifting-thrusting force, acceleration, velocity, displacement, as well as twirling-rotating angular velocity and angle. To measure these critical parameters, we propose a quantitative system comprising a sensing needle equipped with a force sensor and an inertial measurement unit (IMU), as well as an external camera module to capture image information. By fusing visual and IMU data, we accurately identify the stationary or motion states of the needle, enabling segmented computation of lifting-thrusting velocity and displacement. The experimental results demonstrate that the sensing needle achieves comprehensive detection with high precision, featuring a nonlinearity error of 0.45% in force measurement and an RMSE of 1.2 mm in displacement. The extracted parameters provide an objective description of the operational characteristics and motion patterns of the four basic acupuncture manipulations. These findings provide valuable tools and methods for research in acupuncture standardization.</description>

      <title>A Corrective Frequency-Constrained Unit Commitment with Data-driven Estimation of Optimal UFLS in Island Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel corrective \gls{fcuc} formulation for island power systems by implementing data-driven constraint learning to estimate the optimal \gls{ufls}. The Tobit model is presented to estimate the optimal amount of \gls{ufls} using the initial rate of change of frequency. The proposed formulation enables co-optimizing operation costs and \gls{ufls}. The aim is to account for optimal \gls{ufls} occurrences during operation planning, without increasing them. This would potentially reduce system operation costs by relaxing the reserve requirement constraint. The performance of the proposed formulation has been analyzed for a Spanish island power system through various simulations. Different daily demand profiles are analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formulation. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to demonstrate the effects of changing the cost associated with \gls{ufls}. The corrective \gls{fcuc} is shown to be capable of reducing system operation costs without jeopardizing the quality of the frequency response in terms of \gls{ufls} occurrence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources reduces rotating inertia and even frequency control capacity, affecting frequency stability. This challenge is significant in \gls{ips} that already suffer from low inertia and frequency control capacity. This paper presents a comparative study on different \gls{fcuc} formulations applied to \gls{ips}. Then, by considering under-frequency load shedding as a significant measure of frequency stability in \gls{ips}, two indices are presented to fully compare the formulations from system benefits and computational burden perspectives. Simulations conducted on a real Spanish island show that the data-driven corrective \gls{fcuc} formulation has the most advantages among other formulations.</description>

Abstract: While artificial intelligence (AI) has been promising for fusion control, its inherent black-box nature will make compliant implementation in regulatory environments a challenge. This study implements and validates a real-time AI enabled linear and interpretable control system for successful divertor detachment control with the DIII-D lower divertor camera. Using D2 gas, we demonstrate feedback divertor detachment control with a mean absolute difference of 2% from the target for both detachment and reattachment. This automatic training and linear processing framework can be extended to any image based diagnostic for regulatory compliant controller necessary for future fusion reactors.</description>

      <title>Predictive Maintenance Optimization for Smart Vending Machines Using IoT and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing proliferation of vending machines in public and commercial environments has placed a growing emphasis on operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. Traditional maintenance approaches either reactive or time-based preventive are limited in their ability to preempt machine failures, leading to unplanned downtimes and elevated service costs. This research presents a novel predictive maintenance framework tailored for vending machines by leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and machine learning (ML) algorithms. The proposed system continuously monitors machine components and operating conditions in real time and applies predictive models to forecast failures before they occur. This enables timely maintenance scheduling, minimizing downtime and extending machine lifespan. The framework was validated through simulated fault data and performance evaluation using classification algorithms. Results show a significant improvement in early fault detection and a reduction in redundant service interventions. The findings indicate that predictive maintenance systems, when integrated into vending infrastructure, can transform operational efficiency and service reliability.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Robustness Bounds for Second-Order Pruning of Neural Controller Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural policies have unlocked agile flight for quadcopters, adaptive grasping for manipulators, and reliable navigation for ground robots, yet their millions of weights conflict with the tight memory and real-time constraints of embedded microcontrollers. Second-order pruning methods, such as Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) and its variants, including Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) and the recent SparseGPT, compress networks in a single pass by leveraging the local Hessian, achieving far higher sparsity than magnitude thresholding. Despite their success in vision and language, the consequences of such weight removal on closed-loop stability, tracking accuracy, and safety have remained unclear. We present the first mathematically rigorous robustness analysis of second-order pruning in nonlinear discrete-time control. The system evolves under a continuous transition map, while the controller is an $L$-layer multilayer perceptron with ReLU-type activations that are globally 1-Lipschitz. Pruning the weight matrix of layer $k$ replaces $W_k$ with $W_k+\delta W_k$, producing the perturbed parameter vector $\widehat{\Theta}=\Theta+\delta\Theta$ and the pruned policy $\pi(\cdot;\widehat{\Theta})$. For every input state $s\in X$ we derive the closed-form inequality $
\|\pi(s;\Theta)-\pi(s;\widehat{\Theta})\|_2 \le C_k(s)\,\|\delta W_k\|_2, $
where the constant $C_k(s)$ depends only on unpruned spectral norms and biases, and can be evaluated in closed form from a single forward pass. The derived bounds specify, prior to field deployment, the maximal admissible pruning magnitude compatible with a prescribed control-error threshold. By linking second-order network compression with closed-loop performance guarantees, our work narrows a crucial gap between modern deep-learning tooling and the robustness demands of safety-critical autonomous systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03022v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is a nature-inspired stochastic meta-heuristic of the swarm intelligence field that mimics the hunting behavior of grey wolves. Differential evolution (DE) is a popular stochastic algorithm of the evolutionary computation field that is well suited for global optimization. In this part, we introduce a new algorithm based on the hybridization of GWO and two DE variants, namely the GWO-DE algorithm. We evaluate the new algorithm by applying various numerical benchmark functions. The numerical results of the comparative study are quite satisfactory in terms of performance and solution quality.</description>

      <title>LTLCrit: A Temporal Logic-based LLM Critic for Safe and Efficient Embodied Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in reasoning tasks and general decision-making in static environments. In long-term planning tasks, however, errors tend to accumulate, often leading to unsafe or inefficient behavior, limiting their use in general-purpose settings. We propose a modular actor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by LTLCrit, a trajectory-level LLM critic that communicates via linear temporal logic (LTL). Our setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the guarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural language observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes new LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient behavior. The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety constraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term efficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve as the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize planning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LTLCrit to analyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules that improve future behavior. We evaluate our system on the Minecraft diamond-mining benchmark, achieving 100% completion rates and improving efficiency compared to baseline LLM planners. Our results suggest that enabling LLMs to supervise each other through logic is a powerful and flexible paradigm for safe, generalizable decision making.</description>

      <title>Statistical-Spatial Model for Motor Potentials Evoked Through Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for the Development of Closed-Loop Procedures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary motor cortex appears to be in the center of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). It is one of few locations that provide directly observable responses, and its physiology serves as model or reference for almost all other TMS targets, e.g., through the motor threshold and spatial targeting relative to its position. It furthermore sets the safety limits for the entire brain. Its easily detectable responses have led to closed-loop methods for a range of aspects, e.g., for automated thresholding, amplitude tracking, and targeting. The high variability of brain stimulation methods would substantially benefit from fast unbiased closed-loop methods. However, the development of more potent methods would early on in the design phase require proper models that allowed tuning and testing with sufficient without a high number of experiments, which are time-consuming and expensive or even impossible at the needed scale. On the one hand, theoretical researchers without access to experiments miss realistic spatial response models of brain stimulation to develop better methods. On the other hand, subjects should potentially not be exposed to early closed-loop-methods without sufficient prior testing as not yet well tuned feed-back as needed for closed-loop operation is known to erratic behavior.
  To bridge this gap, we developed a digital-twin-style population model that generates motor evoked potentials in response to virtual stimuli and includes statistical information on spatial (coil position and orientation) as well as recruitment in the population to represent inter- and intra-individual variability. The model allows users to simulate different subjects and millions of runs for software-in-the loop testing. The model includes all code to stimulate further development.</description>

      <title>Direction Estimation of Sound Sources Using Microphone Arrays and Signal Strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sound-tracking refers to the process of determining the direction from which a sound originates, making it a fundamental component of sound source localization. This capability is essential in a variety of applications, including security systems, acoustic monitoring, and speaker tracking, where accurately identifying the direction of a sound source enables real-time responses, efficient resource allocation, and improved situational awareness. While sound-tracking is closely related to localization, it specifically focuses on identifying the direction of the sound source rather than estimating its exact position in space. Despite its utility, sound-tracking systems face several challenges, such as maintaining directional accuracy and precision, along with the need for sophisticated hardware configurations and complex signal processing algorithms. This paper presents a sound-tracking method using three electret microphones. We estimate the direction of a sound source using a lightweight method that analyzes signals from three strategically placed microphones. By comparing the average power of the received signals, the system infers the most probable direction of the sound. The results indicate that the power level from each microphone effectively determines the sound source direction. Our system employs a straightforward and cost-effective hardware design, ensuring simplicity and affordability in implementation. It achieves a localization error of less than 6 degrees and a precision of 98%. Additionally, its effortless integration with various systems makes it versatile and adaptable. Consequently, this technique presents a robust and reliable solution for sound-tracking and localization, with potential applications spanning diverse domains such as security systems, smart homes, and acoustic monitoring.</description>

      <title>Multi-robot Aerial Soft Manipulator For Floating Litter Collection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Removing floating litter from water bodies is crucial to preserving aquatic ecosystems and preventing environmental pollution. In this work, we present a multi-robot aerial soft manipulator for floating litter collection, leveraging the capabilities of aerial robots. The proposed system consists of two aerial robots connected by a flexible rope manipulator, which collects floating litter using a hook-based tool. Compared to single-aerial-robot solutions, the use of two aerial robots increases payload capacity and flight endurance while reducing the downwash effect at the manipulation point, located at the midpoint of the rope. Additionally, we employ an optimization-based rope-shape planner to compute the desired rope shape. The planner incorporates an adaptive behavior that maximizes grasping capabilities near the litter while minimizing rope tension when farther away. The computed rope shape trajectory is controlled by a shape visual servoing controller, which approximates the rope as a parabola. The complete system is validated in outdoor experiments, demonstrating successful grasping operations. An ablation study highlights how the planner's adaptive mechanism improves the success rate of the operation. Furthermore, real-world tests in a water channel confirm the effectiveness of our system in floating litter collection. These results demonstrate the potential of aerial robots for autonomous litter removal in aquatic environments.</description>

      <title>Limits of Safe AI Deployment: Differentiating Oversight and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oversight and control (collectively, supervision) are often invoked as key levers for ensuring that AI systems are accountable, reliable, and able to fulfill governance and management requirements. However, the concepts are frequently conflated or insufficiently distinguished in academic and policy discourse, undermining efforts to design or evaluate systems that should remain under meaningful human supervision.
  This paper undertakes a targeted critical review of literature on supervision outside of AI, along with a brief summary of past work on the topic related to AI. We then differentiate control as being ex-ante or real-time, and operational rather than policy or governance. In contrast, oversight is either a policy and governance function, or is ex-post. We suggest that control aims to prevent failures. In contrast, oversight often focuses on detection, remediation, or incentives for future prevention; all preventative oversight strategies nonetheless necessitate control.
  Building on this foundation, we make three contributions. First, we propose a theoretically-informed yet policy-grounded framework that articulates the conditions under which each mechanism is possible, where they fall short, and what is required to make them meaningful in practice. Second, we outline how supervision methods should be documented and integrated into risk management, and drawing on the Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model, we outline a maturity model for AI supervision. Third, we explicitly highlight some boundaries of these mechanisms, including where they apply, where they fail, and where it is clear that no existing methods suffice. This foregrounds the question of whether meaningful supervision is possible in a given deployment context, and can support regulators, auditors, and practitioners in identifying both present limitations and the need for new conceptual and technical advances.</description>

      <title>Latent FxLMS: Accelerating Active Noise Control with Neural Adaptive Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Filtered-X LMS (FxLMS) is commonly used for active noise control (ANC), wherein the soundfield is minimized at a desired location. Given prior knowledge of the spatial region of the noise or control sources, we could improve FxLMS by adapting along the low-dimensional manifold of possible adaptive filter weights. We train an auto-encoder on the filter coefficients of the steady-state adaptive filter for each primary source location sampled from a given spatial region and constrain the weights of the adaptive filter to be the output of the decoder for a given state of latent variables. Then, we perform updates in the latent space and use the decoder to generate the cancellation filter. We evaluate how various neural network constraints and normalization techniques impact the convergence speed and steady-state mean squared error. Under certain conditions, our Latent FxLMS model converges in fewer steps with comparable steady-state error to the standard FxLMS.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Age of Trust and Throughput in Multi-Hop UAV-Aided IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Devices operating in Internet of Things (IoT) networks may be deployed across vast geographical areas and interconnected via multi-hop communications. Further, they may be unguarded. This makes them vulnerable to attacks and motivates operators to check on devices frequently. To this end, we propose and study an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-aided attestation framework for use in IoT networks with a charging station powered by solar. A key challenge is optimizing the trajectory of the UAV to ensure it attests as many devices as possible. A trade-off here is that devices being checked by the UAV are offline, which affects the amount of data delivered to a gateway. Another challenge is that the charging station experiences time-varying energy arrivals, which in turn affect the flight duration and charging schedule of the UAV. To address these challenges, we employ a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solution to optimize the UAV's charging schedule and the selection of devices to be attested during each flight. The simulation results show that our solution reduces the average age of trust by 88% and throughput loss due to attestation by 30%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) techniques enable robots to learn and generalize tasks from user demonstrations, eliminating the need for coding expertise among end-users. One established technique to implement LfD in robots is to encode demonstrations in a stable Dynamical System (DS). However, finding a stable dynamical system entails solving an optimization problem with bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) constraints, a non-convex problem which, depending on the number of scalar constraints and variables, demands significant computational resources and is susceptible to numerical issues such as floating-point errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel compositional approach that enhances the applicability and scalability of learning stable DSs with BMIs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents HERO (Hierarchical Testing with Rabbit Optimization), a novel black-box adversarial testing framework for evaluating the robustness of deep learning-based Prognostics and Health Management systems in Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems. Leveraging Artificial Rabbit Optimization, HERO generates physically constrained adversarial examples that align with real-world data distributions via global and local perspective. Its generalizability ensures applicability across diverse ICPS scenarios. This study specifically focuses on the Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell system, chosen for its highly dynamic operational conditions, complex degradation mechanisms, and increasing integration into ICPS as a sustainable and efficient energy solution. Experimental results highlight HERO's ability to uncover vulnerabilities in even state-of-the-art PHM models, underscoring the critical need for enhanced robustness in real-world applications. By addressing these challenges, HERO demonstrates its potential to advance more resilient PHM systems across a wide range of ICPS domains.</description>

      <title>Learning Humanoid Arm Motion via Centroidal Momentum Regularized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans naturally swing their arms during locomotion to regulate whole-body dynamics, reduce angular momentum, and help maintain balance. Inspired by this principle, we present a limb-level multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables coordinated whole-body control of humanoid robots through emergent arm motion. Our approach employs separate actor-critic structures for the arms and legs, trained with centralized critics but decentralized actors that share only base states and centroidal angular momentum (CAM) observations, allowing each agent to specialize in task-relevant behaviors through modular reward design. The arm agent guided by CAM tracking and damping rewards promotes arm motions that reduce overall angular momentum and vertical ground reaction moments, contributing to improved balance during locomotion or under external perturbations. Comparative studies with single-agent and alternative multi-agent baselines further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we deploy the learned policy on a humanoid platform, achieving robust performance across diverse locomotion tasks, including flat-ground walking, rough terrain traversal, and stair climbing.</description>

Abstract: Model reduction with error bounds in nonlinear systems with non-affine control inputs remains an active field of research. In this work we present a construction for Controllability and Observability Gramians in a class of non-affine control input systems satisfying certain induced norm properties. We do so using a combination of representational forms, including a novel function decomposition that resembles linear Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), in tandem with an additional unconventional decomposition of the dynamics, and Koopman operator theory. The resulting representation allows one to place error bounds on the $H_{\infty}$ norm on a reduced-order representation of the system computed using finite-dimensional nonlinear Controllability and Observability Gramians.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning of A Unified Policy For Whole-body Manipulation and Locomotion Skills</title>

Abstract: Equipping quadruped robots with manipulators provides unique loco-manipulation capabilities, enabling diverse practical applications. This integration creates a more complex system that has increased difficulties in modeling and control. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising solution to address these challenges by learning optimal control policies through interaction. Nevertheless, RL methods often struggle with local optima when exploring large solution spaces for motion and manipulation tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach that integrates an explicit kinematic model of the manipulator into the RL framework. This integration provides feedback on the mapping of the body postures to the manipulator's workspace, guiding the RL exploration process and effectively mitigating the local optima issue. Our algorithm has been successfully deployed on a DeepRobotics X20 quadruped robot equipped with a Unitree Z1 manipulator, and extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of this approach.</description>

      <title>Domain Adaptation of Drag Reduction Policy to Partial Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedback control of fluid-based systems poses significant challenges due to their high-dimensional, nonlinear, and multiscale dynamics, which demand real-time, three-dimensional, multi-component measurements for sensing. While such measurements are feasible in digital simulations, they are often only partially accessible in the real world. In this paper, we propose a method to adapt feedback control policies obtained from full-state measurements to setups with only partial measurements. Our approach is demonstrated in a simulated environment by minimising the aerodynamic drag of a simplified road vehicle. Reinforcement learning algorithms can optimally solve this control task when trained on full-state measurements by placing sensors in the wake. However, in real-world applications, sensors are limited and typically only on the vehicle, providing only partial measurements. To address this, we propose to train a Domain Specific Feature Transfer (DSFT) map reconstructing the full measurements from the history of the partial measurements. By applying this map, we derive optimal policies based solely on partial data. Additionally, our method enables determination of the optimal history length and offers insights into the architecture of optimal control policies, facilitating their implementation in real-world environments with limited sensor information.</description>

      <title>Implicit Dual-Control for Visibility-Aware Navigation in Unstructured Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigating complex, cluttered, and unstructured environments that are a priori unknown presents significant challenges for autonomous ground vehicles, particularly when operating with a limited field of view(FOV) resulting in frequent occlusion and unobserved space. This paper introduces a novel visibility-aware model predictive path integral framework(VA-MPPI). Formulated as a dual control problem where perceptual uncertainties and control decisions are intertwined, it reasons over perception uncertainty evolution within a unified planning and control pipeline. Unlike traditional methods that rely on explicit uncertainty objectives, the VA-MPPI controller implicitly balances exploration and exploitation, reducing uncertainty only when system performance would be increased. The VA-MPPI framework is evaluated in simulation against deterministic and prescient controllers across multiple scenarios, including a cluttered urban alleyway and an occluded off-road environment. The results demonstrate that VA-MPPI significantly improves safety by reducing collision with unseen obstacles while maintaining competitive performance. For example, in the off-road scenario with 400 control samples, the VA-MPPI controller achieved a success rate of 84%, compared to only 8% for the deterministic controller, with all VA-MPPI failures arising from unmet stopping criteria rather than collisions. Furthermore, the controller implicitly avoids unobserved space, improving safety without explicit directives. The proposed framework highlights the potential for robust, visibility-aware navigation in unstructured and occluded environments, paving the way for future advancements in autonomous ground vehicle systems.</description>

      <title>Rapid and Safe Trajectory Planning over Diverse Scenes through Diffusion Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe trajectory planning remains a significant challenge in complex environments, where traditional methods often trade off computational efficiency for safety. Comprehensive obstacle modeling improves safety but is computationally expensive, while approximate methods are more efficient but may compromise safety. To address this issue, this paper introduces a rapid and safe trajectory planning framework based on state-based diffusion models. Leveraging only low-dimensional vehicle states, the diffusion models achieve notable inference efficiency while ensuring sufficient collision-free characteristics. By composing diffusion models, the proposed framework can safely generalize across diverse scenarios, planning collision-free trajectories even in unseen scenes. To further ensure the safety of the generated trajectories, an efficient, rule-based safety filter is proposed, which selects optimal trajectories that satisfy both sufficient safety and control feasibility from among candidate trajectories. Both in seen and unseen scenarios, the proposed method achieves efficient inference time while maintaining high safety and stability. Evaluations on the F1TENTH vehicle further demonstrate that the proposed method is practical in real-world applications. The project page is at: https://rstp-comp-diffuser.github.io/.</description>

      <title>TeleSim: A Network-Aware Testbed and Benchmark Dataset for Telerobotic Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Telerobotic technologies are becoming increasingly essential in fields such as remote surgery, nuclear decommissioning, and space exploration. Reliable datasets and testbeds are essential for evaluating telerobotic system performance prior to real-world deployment. However, there is a notable lack of datasets that capture the impact of network delays, as well as testbeds that realistically model the communication link between the operator and the robot. This paper introduces TeleSim, a network-aware teleoperation dataset and testbed designed to assess the performance of telerobotic applications under diverse network conditions. TeleSim systematically collects performance data from fine manipulation tasks executed under three predefined network quality tiers: High, Medium, and Low. Each tier is characterized through controlled settings of bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet loss. Using OMNeT++ for precise network simulation, we record a wide range of metrics, including completion time, success rates, video quality indicators (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM)), and quality of service (QoS) parameters. TeleSim comprises 300 experimental trials, providing a robust benchmark for evaluating teleoperation systems across heterogeneous network scenarios. In the worst network condition, completion time increases by 221.8% and success rate drops by 64%. Our findings reveal that network degradation leads to compounding negative impacts, notably reduced video quality and prolonged task execution, highlighting the need for adaptive, resilient teleoperation protocols. The full dataset and testbed software are publicly available on our GitHub repository: https://github.com/ConnectedRoboticsLab and YouTube channel: https://youtu.be/Fz_1iOYe104.</description>

      <title>A Quadratic Programming Algorithm with $O(n^3)$ Time Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving linear systems and quadratic programming (QP) problems are both ubiquitous tasks in the engineering and computing fields. Direct methods for solving systems, such as Cholesky, LU, and QR factorizations, exhibit data-independent time complexity of $O(n^3)$. This raises a natural question: could there exist algorithms for solving QPs that also achieve \textit{data-independent} time complexity of $O(n^3)$? This raises a natural question: could there exist algorithms for solving QPs that also achieve data-independent time complexity of $O(n^3)$? This is critical for offering an execution time certificate for real-time optimization-based applications such as model predictive control. This article first demonstrates that solving real-time strictly convex QPs, Lasso problems, and support vector machine problems can be turned into solving box-constrained QPs (Box-QPs), which support a cost-free initialization strategy for feasible interior-point methods (IPMs). Next, focusing on solving Box-QPs, this article replaces the exact Newton step with an approximated Newton step (substituting the matrix-inversion operation with multiple rank-1 updates) within feasible IPMs. For the first time, this article proposes an implementable feasible IPM algorithm with $O(n^3)$ time complexity, by proving the number of iterations is exact $O(\sqrt{n})$ and the number of rank-1 updates is bounded by $O(n)$. Numerical validations/applications and codes are provided.</description>

      <title>The Difference between the Left and Right Invariant Extended Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been the industry standard for state estimation problems over the past sixty years. The Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) is a recent development of the EKF for the class of group-affine systems on Lie groups that has shown superior performance for inertial navigation problems. The IEKF comes in two versions, left- and right- handed respectively, and there is a perception in the robotics community that these filters are different and one should choose the handedness of the IEKF to match handedness of the measurement model for a given filtering problem. In this paper, we revisit these algorithms and demonstrate that the left- and right- IEKF algorithms (with reset step) are identical, that is, the choice of the handedness does not affect the IEKF's performance when the reset step is properly implemented. The reset step was not originally proposed as part of the IEKF, however, we provide simulations to show that the reset step improves asymptotic performance of all versions of the the filter, and should be included in all high performance algorithms. The GNSS-aided inertial navigation system (INS) is used as a motivating example to demonstrate the equivalence of the two filters.</description>

      <title>On-Demand Multimedia Delivery in 6G: An Optimal-Cost Steiner Tree Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth of multimedia data traffic in 6G networks poses unprecedented challenges for immersive communication, where ultra-high-definition, multi-quality streaming must be delivered on demand while minimizing network operational costs. Traditional routing approaches, such as shortest-path algorithms, fail to optimize flow multiplexing across multiple destinations, while conventional Steiner tree methods cannot accommodate heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) requirements-a critical need for 6G's personalized services. In this paper, we address a fundamental but unsolved challenge: the minimum flow problem (MFP) with multi-destination, heterogeneous outflow demands, which is pivotal for efficient multimedia distribution such as adaptive-resolution video streaming. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose a two-stage dynamic programming-enhanced On-demand Steiner Tree (OST) algorithm, the first approach that jointly optimizes flow aggregation and QoS-aware path selection for arbitrary outflow requirements. We rigorously prove the optimality of OST using mathematical induction, demonstrating that it guarantees the minimum-cost multicast flow under differentiated service constraints. Extensive experiments in 6G-like multimedia transmission scenarios show that OST reduces total network flow by over 10% compared to state-of-the-art methods while ensuring on-demand QoS fulfillment.

      <title>Exploring Core and Periphery Precepts in Biological and Artificial Intelligence: An Outcome-Based Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineering methodologies predominantly revolve around established principles of decomposition and recomposition. These principles involve partitioning inputs and outputs at the component level, ensuring that the properties of individual components are preserved upon composition. However, this view does not transfer well to intelligent systems, particularly when addressing the scaling of intelligence as a system property. Our prior research contends that the engineering of general intelligence necessitates a fresh set of overarching systems principles. As a result, we introduced the "core and periphery" principles, a novel conceptual framework rooted in abstract systems theory and the Law of Requisite Variety. In this paper, we assert that these abstract concepts hold practical significance. Through empirical evidence, we illustrate their applicability to both biological and artificial intelligence systems, bridging abstract theory with real-world implementations. Then, we expand on our previous theoretical framework by mathematically defining core-dominant vs periphery-dominant systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate a mutual information optimal control problem (MIOCP) for discrete-time linear systems. This problem can be regarded as an extension of a maximum entropy optimal control problem (MEOCP). Differently from the MEOCP where the prior is fixed to the uniform distribution, the MIOCP optimizes the policy and prior simultaneously. As analytical results, under the policy and prior classes consisting of Gaussian distributions, we derive the optimal policy and prior of the MIOCP with the prior and policy fixed, respectively. Using the results, we propose an alternating minimization algorithm for the MIOCP. Through numerical experiments, we discuss how our proposed algorithm works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving systems have made significant advances in Q&amp;A, perception, prediction, and planning based on local visual information, yet they struggle to incorporate broader navigational context that human drivers routinely utilize. We address this critical gap between local sensor data and global navigation information by proposing NavigScene, an auxiliary navigation-guided natural language dataset that simulates a human-like driving environment within autonomous driving systems. Moreover, we develop three complementary paradigms to leverage NavigScene: (1) Navigation-guided Reasoning, which enhances vision-language models by incorporating navigation context into the prompting approach; (2) Navigation-guided Preference Optimization, a reinforcement learning method that extends Direct Preference Optimization to improve vision-language model responses by establishing preferences for navigation-relevant summarized information; and (3) Navigation-guided Vision-Language-Action model, which integrates navigation guidance and vision-language models with conventional driving models through feature fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve performance across perception, prediction, planning, and question-answering tasks by enabling reasoning capabilities beyond visual range and improving generalization to diverse driving scenarios. This work represents a significant step toward more comprehensive autonomous driving systems capable of navigating complex, unfamiliar environments with greater reliability and safety.</description>

      <title>Coherent Track Before Detect: Detection via simultaneous trajectory estimation and long time integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:1709.00310v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the detection of manoeuvring small objects with radars. Such objects induce low signal to noise ratio (SNR) reflections in the received signal. We consider both co-located and separated transmitter/receiver pairs, i.e., mono-static and bi-static configurations, respectively, as well as multi-static settings involving both types. We propose coherent track before detect: A detection approach which is capable of coherently integrating these reflections within a coherent processing interval (CPI) in all these configurations and continuing integration for an arbitrarily long time across consecutive CPIs. {We estimate the complex value of the reflection coefficients for integration while simultaneously estimating the object trajectory. Compounded with these computations is the estimation of the unknown time reference shift of the separated transmitters necessary for coherent processing.} Detection is made by using the resulting integration value in a Neyman-Pearson test against a constant false alarm rate threshold. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a simulation example with a very low SNR object which cannot be detected with conventional techniques.</description>

Abstract: The steering control of an autonomous unicycle is considered. The underlying dynamical model of a single rolling wheel is discussed regarding the steady state motions and their stability. The unicycle model is introduced as the simplest possible extension of the rolling wheel where the location of the center of gravity is controlled. With the help of the Appellian approach, a state space representation of the controlled nonholonomic system is built in a way that the most compact nonlinear equations of motions are constructed. Based on controllability analysis, feedback controllers are designed which successfully carry out lane changing and turning maneuvers. The behavior of the closed-loop system is demonstrated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Barrier States Theory for Safety-Critical Multi-Objective Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-objective safety-critical control entails a diligent design to avoid possibly conflicting scenarios and ensure safety. This paper addresses multi-objective safety-critical control through a novel approach utilizing barrier states (BaS) to integrate safety into control design. It introduces the concept of safety embedded systems, where the safety condition is integrated with barrier functions to characterize a dynamical subsystem that is incorporated into the original model for control design. This approach reformulates the control problem to focus on designing a control law for an unconstrained system, ensuring that the barrier state remains bounded while achieving other performance objectives.
  The paper demonstrates that designing a stabilizing controller for the safety embedded system guarantees the safe stabilization of the original safety-critical system, effectively mitigating conflicts between performance and safety constraints. This approach enables the use of various legacy control methods from the literature to develop safe control laws. Moreover, it explores how this method can be applied to enforce input constraints and extend traditional control techniques to incorporate safety considerations. Additionally, the paper introduces input-to-state safety (ISSf) through barrier states for analyzing robust safety under bounded input disturbances and develops the notion of input-to-state safe stability IS3 for analyzing and designing robustly safe stabilizing feedback controls. The proposed techniques and concepts are used in various examples including the design of proportional-integral-derivative-barrier (PIDB) control for adaptive cruise control.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Dual Gradient Tracking for Distributed Resource Allocation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates privacy issues in distributed resource allocation over directed networks, where each agent holds a private cost function and optimizes its decision subject to a global coupling constraint through local interaction with other agents. Conventional methods for resource allocation over directed networks require all agents to transmit their original data to neighbors, which poses the risk of disclosing sensitive and private information. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm called differentially private dual gradient tracking (DP-DGT) for distributed resource allocation, which obfuscates the exchanged messages using independent Laplacian noise. Our algorithm ensures that the agents' decisions converge to a neighborhood of the optimal solution almost surely. Furthermore, without the assumption of bounded gradients, we prove that the cumulative differential privacy loss under the proposed algorithm is finite even when the number of iterations goes to infinity. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to simultaneously achieve these two goals in distributed resource allocation problems over directed networks. Finally, numerical simulations on economic dispatch problems within the IEEE 14-bus system illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>A hybrid systems framework for data-based adaptive control of linear time-varying systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the data-driven stabilization of discrete-time linear time-varying systems. The controller is defined as a linear state-feedback law whose gain is adapted to the plant changes through a data-based event-triggering rule. To do so, we monitor the evolution of a data-based Lyapunov function along the solution. When this Lyapunov function does not satisfy a designed desirable condition, an episode is triggered to update the controller gain and the corresponding Lyapunov function using the last collected data. The resulting closed-loop dynamics hence exhibits both physical jumps, due to the system dynamics, and episodic jumps, which naturally leads to a hybrid discrete-time system. We leverage the inherent robustness of the controller and provide general conditions under which various stability notions can be established for the system. Two notable cases where these conditions are satisfied are treated, and numerical results illustrating the relevance of the approach are discussed.</description>

      <title>QoE Maximization for Multiple-UAV-Assisted Multi-Access Edge Computing via an Online Joint Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In disaster scenarios, conventional terrestrial multi-access edge computing (MEC) paradigms, which rely on ground infrastructure, may become unavailable due to infrastructure damage. With high-probability line-of-sight (LoS) communication, flexible mobility, and low cost, uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted MEC is emerging as a promising paradigm to provide edge computing services for ground user devices (UDs) in disaster-stricken areas. However, the limited battery capacity, computing resources, and spectrum resources also pose serious challenges for UAV-assisted MEC, which can potentially shorten the service time of UAVs and degrade the quality of experience (QoE) of UDs without an effective control approach. To this end, in this work, we first present a hierarchical architecture of multiple-UAV-assisted MEC networks that enables the coordinated provision of edge computing services by multiple UAVs. Then, we formulate a joint task offloading, resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control optimization problem (JTRTOP) to maximize the QoE of UDs while considering the energy and resource constraints of UAVs. Since the problem is proven to be a future-dependent and NP-hard problem, we propose a novel online joint task offloading, resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control approach (OJTRTA) to solve the problem. Specifically, the JTRTOP is first transformed into a per-slot real-time optimization problem (PROP) using the Lyapunov optimization framework. Then, a two-stage optimization method based on game theory and convex optimization is proposed to solve the PROP. Simulation results show that the proposed OJTRTA outperforms various benchmark approaches and achieves at least a 10% improvement in the QoE of UDs compared to deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithms, thereby validating the superiority of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Deception in Nash Equilibrium Seeking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In socio-technical multi-agent systems, deception exploits privileged information to induce false beliefs in "victims," keeping them oblivious and leading to outcomes detrimental to them or advantageous to the deceiver. We consider model-free Nash-equilibrium-seeking for non-cooperative games with asymmetric information and introduce model-free deceptive algorithms with stability guarantees. In the simplest algorithm, the deceiver includes in his action policy the victim's exploration signal, with an amplitude tuned by an integrator of the regulation error between the deceiver's actual and desired payoff. The integral feedback drives the deceiver's payoff to the payoff's reference value, while the victim is led to adopt a suboptimal action, at which the pseudogradient of the deceiver's payoff is zero. The deceiver's and victim's actions turn out to constitute a "deceptive" Nash equilibrium of a different game, whose structure is managed - in real time - by the deceiver. We examine quadratic, aggregative, and more general games and provide conditions for a successful deception, mutual and benevolent deception, and immunity to deception. Stability results are established using techniques based on averaging and singular perturbations. Among the examples in the paper is a microeconomic duopoly in which the deceiver induces in the victim a belief that the buyers disfavor the deceiver more than they actually do, leading the victim to increase the price above the Nash price, and resulting in an increased profit for the deceiver and a decreased profit for the victim. A study of the deceiver's integral feedback for the desired profit reveals that, in duopolies with equal marginal costs, a deceiver that is greedy for very high profit can attain any such profit, and pursue this with arbitrarily high integral gain (impatiently), irrespective of the market preference for the victim.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of Multiple DER Aggregators on Wholesale Energy Markets: A Hybrid Mean Field Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into wholesale energy markets can greatly enhance grid flexibility, improve market efficiency, and contribute to a more sustainable energy future. As DERs -- such as solar PV panels and energy storage -- proliferate, effective mechanisms are needed to ensure that small prosumers can participate meaningfully in these markets. We study a wholesale market model featuring multiple DER aggregators, each controlling a portfolio of DER resources and bidding into the market on behalf of the DER asset owners. The key of our approach lies in recognizing the repeated nature of market interactions the ability of participants to learn and adapt over time. Specifically, Aggregators repeatedly interact with each other and with other suppliers in the wholesale market, collectively shaping wholesale electricity prices (aka the locational marginal prices (LMPs)). We model this multi-agent interaction using a mean-field game (MFG), which uses market information -- reflecting the average behavior of market participants -- to enable each aggregator to predict long-term LMP trends and make informed decisions. For each aggregator, because they control the DERs within their portfolio under certain contract structures, we employ a mean-field control (MFC) approach (as opposed to a MFG) to learn an optimal policy that maximizes the total rewards of the DERs under their management. We also propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method to help each agent learn optimal strategies within the MFG framework, enhancing their ability to adapt to market conditions and uncertainties. Numerical simulations show that LMPs quickly reach a steady state in the hybrid mean-field approach. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the combination of energy storage and mean-field learning significantly reduces price volatility compared to scenarios without storage.</description>

      <title>Experimental Study of Underwater Acoustic Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces with Synthetic Reflection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an underwater acoustic reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (UA-RIS) designed for long-range, high-speed, and environmentally friendly communication in oceanic environments. The proposed UA-RIS comprises multiple pairs of acoustic reflectors that utilize a synthetic reflection scheme to flexibly control the amplitude and phase of reflected waves. This capability enables precise beam steering to enhance or attenuate sound levels in specific directions. A prototype UA-RIS with 4*6 acoustic reflection units is constructed and tested in both tank and lake environments to evaluate performance. Experimental results using a continuous wave (CW) as the source signal demonstrate that the prototype is capable of effectively pointing reflected waves to targeted directions while minimizing side lobes through synthetic reflection. Field tests reveal that deploying the UA-RIS on the sender side considerably extends communication ranges by 28% in deep water and 46% in shallow waters. Furthermore, with a fixed communication distance, positioning the UA-RIS at the transmitter side substantially boosts data rates, with an average increase of 63.8% and peaks up to 96%. When positioned on the receiver side, the UA-RIS can expand the communication range in shallow and deep water environments by 40.6% and 66%, respectively. Moreover, placing the UA-RIS close to the receiver enhances data rates by an average of 80.3%, reaching up to 163% under certain circumstances.</description>

      <title>Identifying Large-Scale Linear Parameter Varying Systems with Dynamic Mode Decomposition Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) Systems are a well-established class of nonlinear systems with a rich theory for stability analysis, control, and analytical response finding, among other aspects. Although there are works on data-driven identification of such systems, the literature is quite scarce in terms of works that tackle the identification of LPV models for large-scale systems. Since large-scale systems are ubiquitous in practice, this work develops a methodology for the local and global identification of large-scale LPV systems based on nonintrusive reduced-order modeling. The developed method is coined as DMD-LPV for being inspired in the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). To validate the proposed identification method, we identify a system described by a discretized linear diffusion equation, with the diffusion gain defined by a polynomial over a parameter. The experiments show that the proposed method can easily identify a reduced-order LPV model of a given large-scale system without the need to perform identification in the full-order dimension, and with almost no performance decay over performing a reduction, given that the model structure is well-established.</description>

      <title>Modeling Driver Behavior in Speed Advisory Systems: Koopman-based Approach with Online Update</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate driver behavior modeling is essential for improving the interaction and cooperation of the human driver with the driver assistance system. This paper presents a novel approach for modeling the response of human drivers to visual cues provided by a speed advisory system using a Koopman-based method with online updates. The proposed method utilizes the Koopman operator to transform the nonlinear dynamics of driver-speed advisory system interactions into a linear framework, allowing for efficient real-time prediction. An online update mechanism based on Recursive Least Squares (RLS) is integrated into the Koopman-based model to ensure continuous adaptation to changes in driver behavior over time. The model is validated using data collected from a human-in-the-loop driving simulator, capturing diverse driver-specific trajectories. The results demonstrate that the offline learned Koopman-based model can closely predict driver behavior and its accuracy is further enhanced through an online update mechanism with the RLS method.</description>

Abstract: Estimating the parameters of nonlinear block-oriented state-space models from input-output data typically involves solving a highly non-convex optimization problem, which is prone to poor local minima and slow convergence. This paper presents a computationally efficient initialization method for nonlinear linear fractional representation (NL-LFR) models using periodic data. By first inferring the latent signals and subsequently estimating the model parameters, the approach generates initial estimates for use in a later nonlinear optimization step. The proposed method shows robustness against poor local minima, and achieves a twofold error reduction compared to the state-of-the-art on a challenging benchmark dataset.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning for robust dynamic metabolic control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic metabolic control enables key metabolic fluxes to be modulated in real time, enhancing bioprocess flexibility and expanding the available optimization degrees of freedom. This can be achieved, e.g., via targeted modulation of metabolic enzyme expression. However, identifying optimal dynamic control policies in metabolic engineering is challenging due to the generally high-dimensional solution space, and the need to manage potential metabolic burden and cytotoxic effects, arising from inducible enzyme expression. This task is further complicated by the presence of stochastic dynamics, which reduce the reproducibility of bioprocesses. Here, we propose a reinforcement learning framework to derive optimal dynamic metabolic control policies by allowing an agent (i.e., the controller) to interact with a surrogate dynamic model $\textit{in silico}$. To promote robustness in the metabolic control policies, we apply domain randomization, enabling the controller to generalize across system uncertainties. Our framework provides an alternative to conventional model-based control such as model predictive control, which requires model differentiation with respect to decision variables; an often impractical task when dealing with complex stochastic, nonlinear, stiff, and piecewise-defined dynamics. In contrast, our approach only requires forward integration, making the task much simpler. We demonstrate our framework in two $\textit{Escherichia coli}$ bioprocesses, one involving the dynamic control of acetyl-CoA carboxylase in the synthesis of fatty acids, and another one dealing with the dynamic control of adenosine triphosphatase in the synthesis of lactate.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Input and State Estimation under Output Quantization: A Gaussian Mixture approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simultaneous Input and State Estimation (SISE) enables the reconstruction of unknown inputs and internal states in dynamical systems, with applications in fault detection, robotics, and control. While various methods exist for linear systems, extensions to systems with output quantization are scarce, and no formal connections to limit Kalman filters are known in this context. This work addresses these gaps by proposing a novel SISE algorithm for linear systems with quantized output measurements. The proposed algorithm introduces a Gaussian mixture model formulation of the observation model, which leads to closed-form recursive equations in the form of a Gaussian sum filter. In the absence of input prior knowledge, the recursions are shown to converge to a limit-case SISE algorithm, implementable as a bank of linear SISE filters running in parallel. A simulation example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Toward a Harmonized Approach -- Requirement-based Structuring of a Safety Assurance Argumentation for Automated Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the increasing testing operations of automated vehicles on public roads, media reports on incidents show that safety issues caused by automated driving systems persist to this day. Manufacturers face high development uncertainty when aiming to deploy these systems in an open context. In particular, one challenge is establishing a valid argument at design time that the vehicles will exhibit reasonable residual risk when operating in its intended operational design domain. While there is extensive literature on assurance cases for safety-critical systems in general, the domain of automated driving lacks explicit requirements regarding the creation of safety assurance argumentations for automated vehicles. In this paper, we aim to narrow this gap by elaborating a requirement-based approach. We identify structural requirements for an argumentation based on published literature and supplement these with structural requirements derived from stakeholder concerns. We apply these requirements to obtain a proposal for a generic argumentation structure. The resulting "safety arguments" address the developed product (product argument), the underlying process (process argument) including its conformance/compliance to standards/laws (conformance/compliance argument), as well as an argumentation's context (context argument) and soundness (soundness argument). Finally, we outline argumentation principles in accordance with domain-specific needs and concepts.</description>

      <title>Lifelong reinforcement learning for health-aware fast charging of lithium-ion batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast charging of lithium-ion batteries remains a critical bottleneck for widespread adoption of electric vehicles and stationary energy storage systems, as improperly designed fast charging can accelerate battery degradation and shorten lifespan. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing a health-aware fast charging strategy that explicitly balances charging speed and battery longevity across the entire service life. The key innovation lies in establishing a mapping between anode overpotential and the state of health (SoH) of battery, which is then used to constrain the terminal charging voltage in a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) framework. By incorporating this SoH-dependent voltage constraint, our designed deep learning method mitigates side reactions and effectively extends battery life. To validate the proposed approach, a high-fidelity single particle model with electrolyte is implemented in the widely adopted PyBaMM simulation platform, capturing degradation phenomena at realistic scales. Comparative life-cycle simulations against conventional CC-CV, its variants, and constant current-constant overpotential methods show that the TD3-based controller reduces overall degradation while maintaining competitively fast charge times. These results demonstrate the practical viability of deep reinforcement learning for advanced battery management systems and pave the way for future explorations of health-aware, performance-optimized charging strategies.</description>

Abstract: Efficiently supporting remote firmware updates in Internet of Things (IoT) devices remains a significant challenge due to the limitations of many IoT communication protocols, which often make it impractical to transmit full firmware images. Techniques such as firmware partitioning have been introduced to mitigate this issue, but they frequently fall short, especially in battery-powered systems where time and energy constraints are critical. As a result, physical maintenance interventions are still commonly required, which is costly and inconvenient in large-scale deployments. In this work, we present a lightweight and innovative method that addresses this challenge by generating highly compact delta patches, enabling firmware reconstruction directly on the device. Our algorithm is specifically optimized for low-power devices, minimizing both memory usage and computational overhead. Compared to existing solutions, our approach significantly reduces the data volume needed for updates while maintaining performance comparable to more complex alternatives. Experimental evaluations confirm that our method yields substantial time and energy savings, making it particularly well-suited for battery-powered IoT nodes. Although our implementation targets the LoRaWAN protocol, the approach is flexible and can be adapted to other IoT communication technologies.</description>

      <title>A Distributed Local Energy Market Clearing Framework Using a Two-Loop ADMM Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diversity of prosumers' resources in energy communities can provide significant technical and economic benefits to both prosumers and the distribution system operator (DSO). To maximize these benefits, a coordination framework is required to address all techno-economic constraints as well as the objectives of all agents. This paper presents a fully distributed market-clearing scheme to coordinate the strategies of agents within a local energy community. In the proposed framework, prosumers, the DSO, and the local market operator (LMO) are the participating agents. The framework addresses the preferences and techno-economic constraints of all actors while preserving their privacy. The proposed model is based on a modified alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method with two outer and inner loops; the outer loop models the interactions between the LMO and prosumers, while the inner loop addresses the interactions between the LMO and the DSO. The model is demonstrated on IEEE-69bus test network, showcasing its effectiveness from various perspectives.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Periodic Systems: An Algebraic Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of row-by-row (or diagonal) decoupling of discrete-time linear multi-input multi-output systems with periodic time-varying coefficients using periodic state feedback. Previous solutions have tackled row-by-row decoupling using dynamic compensation for square systems and block-decoupling through regular state feedback for nonsquare systems with more outputs than inputs. While it appears likely that a row-by-row state feedback solution for square systems can be deduced from these findings, a direct argument seems more appropriate here as it presents a natural extension for decoupling nonsquare systems with more inputs than outputs. This extension, which necessitates nonregular state feedback, has yet to be explored for periodic systems. Our approach is purely algebraic, based on a time-invariant representation of the periodic system.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the Conditional Probability Densities of Time Interval Extrema with Application to Risk-Sensitive Scheduling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01358v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planning and scheduling activities in the electrical power system, such as the commitment of reserve generation, often involve the statistical characterization of peak demand. Due to the stationarity assumption of classical extreme value analysis (EVA), existing approaches in the industry apply EVA on simulated annual peaks created by weather-dependent surrogate models using Monte-Carlo simulations on a per-scenario basis. In day-ahead scheduling, the daily peak demand changes upon various factors besides temperature, Monte-Carlo experiments become intractable, and state-of-the-art generalized additive model for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS)-based nonstationary EVA is often impractical due to convergence issues on high-dimensional covariates. This article explores uncharted territories and proposes a novel nonstationary EVA estimator that predicts the probable peaks of high-resolution time intervals and their corresponding conditional probability densities based on calendar information and weather conditions where historical peaks are observed. Compared to GAMLSS, our method automatically discovers and robustly models complex relationships between the covariate and the peak demand density. We present a case study on the determination of day-ahead scheduling capacity and demonstrate that compared to the industry approach, our approach results in a 38% reduction in the yearly total committed capacity while maintaining the given risk requirement.</description>

      <title>Direct Integration of Recursive Gaussian Process Regression Into Extended Kalman Filters With Application to Vapor Compression Cycle Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a real-time capable algorithm for the learning of Gaussian Processes (GP) for submodels. It extends an existing recursive Gaussian Process (RGP) algorithm which requires a measurable output. In many applications, however, an envisaged GP output is not directly measurable. Therefore, we present the integration of an RGP into an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for the combined state estimation and GP learning. The algorithm is successfully tested in simulation studies and outperforms two alternative implementations -- especially if high measurement noise is present. We conclude the paper with an experimental validation within the control structure of a Vapor Compression Cycle typically used in refrigeration and heat pumps. In this application, the algorithm is used to learn a GP model for the heat-transfer values in dependency of several process parameters. The GP model significantly improves the tracking performance of a previously published model-based controller.</description>

      <title>ANN-Based Grid Impedance Estimation for Adaptive Gain Scheduling in VSG Under Dynamic Grid Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contrast to grid-following inverters, Virtual Synchronous Generators (VSGs) perform well under weak grid conditions but may become unstable when the grid is strong. Grid strength depends on grid impedance, which unfortunately varies over time. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive gain-scheduling control scheme for VSGs. First, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) estimates the fundamental-frequency grid impedance; then these estimates are fed into an adaptive gain-scheduling function to recalculate controller parameters under varying grid conditions. The proposed method is validated in Simulink and compared with a conventional VSG employing fixed controller gains. The results demonstrate that settling times and overshoot percentages remain consistent across different grid conditions. Additionally, previously unseen grid impedance values are estimated with high accuracy and minimal time delay, making the approach well suited for real-time gain-scheduling control.</description>

      <title>Auto-optimization of Energy Generation for Wave Energy Converters with Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an auto-optimization control framework for wave energy converters (WECs) to maximize energy generation under unknown and changing ocean conditions. The proposed control framework consists of two levels. The high-level controller operating at a longer time scale aims to maximize the average energy generation over several wave periods. The generated Power Take-Off (PTO) profile as the reference for the low-level physical system to follow. The new auto-optimization process leverages the parameterization of the non-stationary operation condition in WECs, establishing the relationship between the average energy generation and the key design parameters of the PTO force subject to the unknown wave parameters. The high-level controller is designed based on the concept of Dual Control for Exploration and Exploitation (DCEE) to quickly learn the unknown wave parameters by actively probing the ocean condition, while generating the optimal PTO profile. During this process, the uncertainty of the estimated wave condition is quantified and embedded in the optimization cost function to enable active learning. Simulation results under unknown regular and irregular waves demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of this novel auto-optimization WEC systems with active learning, outperforming model predictive control, extremum seeking and classic Bang-Bang control approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.06362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Iterative optimization algorithms depend on access to information about the objective function. In a differentiable programming framework, this information, such as gradients, can be automatically derived from the computational graph. We explore how nonlinear control algorithms, often employing linear and/or quadratic approximations, can be effectively cast within this framework. Our approach illuminates shared components and differences between gradient descent, Gauss-Newton, Newton, and differential dynamic programming methods in the context of discrete time nonlinear control. Furthermore, we present line-search strategies and regularized variants of these algorithms, along with a comprehensive analysis of their computational complexities. We study the performance of the aforementioned algorithms on various nonlinear control benchmarks, including autonomous car racing simulations using a simplified car model. All implementations are publicly available in a package coded in a differentiable programming language.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of stabilizing infinite-dimensional systems with input and output quantization. The closed-loop system we consider is subject to packet loss, whose average duration is assumed to be bounded. Given a bound on the initial state, we propose a design method for dynamic quantizers with zoom parameters. We show that the closed-loop state starting in a given region exponentially converges to zero if bounds on quantization errors and packet-loss intervals satisfy suitable conditions. Since the norms of the operators representing the system dynamics are used in the proposed quantizer design, we also present methods for approximately computing the operator norms.</description>

      <title>Learning Maximal Safe Sets Using Hypernetworks for MPC-based Local Trajectory Planning in Unknown Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel learning-based approach for online estimation of maximal safe sets for local trajectory planning in unknown static environments. The neural representation of a set is used as the terminal set constraint for a model predictive control (MPC) local planner, resulting in improved recursive feasibility and safety. To achieve real-time performance and desired generalization properties, we employ the idea of hypernetworks. We use the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis as the source of supervision during the training process, allowing us to consider general nonlinear dynamics and arbitrary constraints. The proposed method is extensively evaluated against relevant baselines in simulations for different environments and robot dynamics. The results show an increase in success rate of up to 52% compared to the best baseline while maintaining comparable execution speed. Additionally, we deploy our proposed method, NTC-MPC, on a physical robot and demonstrate its ability to safely avoid obstacles in scenarios where the baselines fail.</description>

      <title>Sensor-fusion based Prognostics for Deep-space Habitats Exhibiting Multiple Unlabeled Failure Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12159v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep-space habitats are complex systems that must operate autonomously over extended durations without ground-based maintenance. These systems are vulnerable to multiple, often unknown, failure modes that affect different subsystems and sensors in mode-specific ways. Developing accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prognostics is challenging, especially when failure labels are unavailable and sensor relevance varies by failure mode. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised prognostics framework that jointly identifies latent failure modes and selects informative sensors using only unlabeled training data. The methodology consists of two phases. In the offline phase, we model system failure times using a mixture of Gaussian regressions and apply a novel Expectation-Maximization algorithm to cluster degradation trajectories and select mode-specific sensors. In the online phase, we extract low-dimensional features from the selected sensors to diagnose the active failure mode and predict RUL using a weighted regression model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a simulated dataset that reflects deep-space telemetry characteristics and on a real-world engine degradation dataset, showing improved accuracy and interpretability over existing methods.</description>

      <title>A Runtime-Adaptive Transformer Neural Network Accelerator on FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer neural networks (TNN) excel in natural language processing (NLP), machine translation, and computer vision (CV) without relying on recurrent or convolutional layers. However, they have high computational and memory demands, particularly on resource-constrained devices like FPGAs. Moreover, transformer models vary in processing time across applications, requiring custom models with specific parameters. Designing custom accelerators for each model is complex and time-intensive. Some custom accelerators exist with no runtime adaptability, and they often rely on sparse matrices to reduce latency. However, hardware designs become more challenging due to the need for application-specific sparsity patterns. This paper introduces ADAPTOR, a runtime-adaptive accelerator for dense matrix computations in transformer encoders and decoders on FPGAs. ADAPTOR enhances the utilization of processing elements and on-chip memory, enhancing parallelism and reducing latency. It incorporates efficient matrix tiling to distribute resources across FPGA platforms and is fully quantized for computational efficiency and portability. Evaluations on Xilinx Alveo U55C data center cards and embedded platforms like VC707 and ZCU102 show that our design is 1.2$\times$ and 2.87$\times$ more power efficient than the NVIDIA K80 GPU and the i7-8700K CPU respectively. Additionally, it achieves a speedup of 1.7 to 2.25$\times$ compared to some state-of-the-art FPGA-based accelerators.</description>

      <title>Occlusion-Aware Consistent Model Predictive Control for Robot Navigation in Occluded Obstacle-Dense Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safety and motion consistency for robot navigation in occluded, obstacle-dense environments is a critical challenge. In this context, this study presents an occlusion-aware Consistent Model Predictive Control (CMPC) strategy. To account for the occluded obstacles, it incorporates adjustable risk regions that represent their potential future locations. Subsequently, dynamic risk boundary constraints are developed online to ensure safety. The CMPC then constructs multiple locally optimal trajectory branches (each tailored to different risk regions) to balance between exploitation and exploration. A shared consensus trunk is generated to ensure smooth transitions between branches without significant velocity fluctuations, further preserving motion consistency. To facilitate high computational efficiency and ensure coordination across local trajectories, we use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to decompose the CMPC into manageable sub-problems for parallel solving. The proposed strategy is validated through simulation and real-world experiments on an Ackermann-steering robot platform. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CMPC strategy through comparisons with baseline approaches in occluded, obstacle-dense environments.</description>

      <title>D4orm: Multi-Robot Trajectories with Dynamics-aware Diffusion Denoised Deformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents an optimization method for generating kinodynamically feasible and collision-free multi-robot trajectories that exploits an incremental denoising scheme in diffusion models. Our key insight is that high-quality trajectories can be discovered merely by denoising noisy trajectories sampled from a distribution. This approach has no learning component, relying instead on only two ingredients: a dynamical model of the robots to obtain feasible trajectories via rollout, and a fitness function to guide denoising with Monte Carlo gradient approximation. The proposed framework iteratively optimizes a deformation for the previous trajectory with the current denoising process, allows anytime refinement as time permits, supports different dynamics, and benefits from GPU acceleration. Our evaluations for differential-drive and holonomic teams with up to 16 robots in 2D and 3D worlds show its ability to discover high-quality solutions faster than other black-box optimization methods such as MPPI. In a 2D holonomic case with 16 robots, it is almost twice as fast. As evidence for feasibility, we demonstrate zero-shot deployment of the planned trajectories on eight multirotors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An effective approach to modeling non-Markovian quantum systems is to embed a principal (quantum) system of interest into a larger quantum system. A widely employed embedding is one that uses another quantum system, referred to as the auxiliary system, which is coupled to the principal system, and both the principal and auxiliary can be coupled to quantum white noise processes. The principal and auxiliary together form a quantum Markov system and the quantum white noises act as a bath (environment) for this system. Recently it was shown that the conditional evolution of the principal system in this embedding under continuous monitoring by a travelling quantum probe can be expressed as a system of coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that involve only operators of the principal system. The reduced conditional state of the principal only (conditioned on the measurement outcomes) is determined by the ``diagonal" blocks of this coupled systems of SDEs. It is shown here that the ``off-diagonal" blocks can be exactly eliminated up to their initial conditions, leaving a reduced closed system of SDEs for the diagonal blocks only. Under additional conditions the off-diagonal initial conditions can be made to vanish. This new closed system of equations, which includes an integration term involving a two-time stochastic kernel, represents the non-Markovian stochastic dynamics of the principal system under continuous-measurement. The system of equations determine the reduced conditional state of the principal only and may be viewed as a stochastic Nakajima-Zwanzig type of equation for continuously monitored non-Markovian quantum systems.</description>

      <title>CHIME: Conditional Hallucination and Integrated Multi-scale Enhancement for Time Series Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The denoising diffusion probabilistic model has become a mainstream generative model, achieving significant success in various computer vision tasks. Recently, there has been initial exploration of applying diffusion models to time series tasks. However, existing studies still face challenges in multi-scale feature alignment and generative capabilities across different entities and long-time scales. In this paper, we propose CHIME, a conditional hallucination and integrated multi-scale enhancement framework for time series diffusion models. By employing multi-scale decomposition and integration, CHIME captures the decomposed features of time series, achieving in-domain distribution alignment between generated and original samples. In addition, we introduce a feature hallucination module in the conditional denoising process, enabling the temporal features transfer across long-time scales. Experimental results on publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that CHIME achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits excellent generative generalization capabilities in few-shot scenarios.</description>

      <title>RoboMonkey: Scaling Test-Time Sampling and Verification for Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visuomotor control, yet ensuring their robustness in unstructured real-world environments remains a persistent challenge. In this paper, we investigate test-time scaling through the lens of sampling and verification as means to enhance the robustness and generalization of VLAs. We first demonstrate that the relationship between action error and the number of generated samples follows an exponentiated power law across a range of VLAs, indicating the existence of inference-time scaling laws. Building on these insights, we introduce RoboMonkey, a test-time scaling framework for VLAs. At deployment, RoboMonkey samples a small set of actions from a VLA, applies Gaussian perturbation and majority voting to construct an action proposal distribution, and then uses a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based verifier to select the optimal action. We propose a synthetic data generation pipeline for training such VLM-based action verifiers, and demonstrate that scaling the synthetic dataset consistently improves verification and downstream accuracy. Through extensive simulated and hardware experiments, we show that pairing existing VLAs with RoboMonkey yields significant performance gains, achieving a 25% absolute improvement on out-of-distribution tasks and 9% on in-distribution tasks. Additionally, when adapting to new robot setups, we show that fine-tuning both VLAs and action verifiers yields a 7% performance increase compared to fine-tuning VLAs alone.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Shared Control in Teleoperation Without Haptic Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Teleoperation with non-haptic VR controllers deprives human operators of critical motion feedback. We address this by embedding a multi-objective optimization problem that converts user input into collision-free UR5e joint trajectories while actively suppressing liquid slosh in a glass. The controller maintains 13 ms average planning latency, confirming real-time performance and motivating the augmentation of this teleoperation approach to further objectives.</description>

      <title>Online Convex Optimization for Coordinated Long-Term and Short-Term Isolated Microgrid Dispatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel non-anticipatory long-short-term coordinated dispatch framework for isolated microgrid with hybrid short-long-duration energy storages (LDES). We introduce a convex hull approximation model for nonconvex LDES electrochemical dynamics, facilitating computational tractability and accuracy. To address temporal coupling in SoC dynamics and long-term contracts, we generate hindsight-optimal state-of-charge (SoC) trajectories of LDES and netloads for offline training. In the online stage, we employ kernel regression to dynamically update the SoC reference and propose an adaptive online convex optimization (OCO) algorithm with SoC reference tracking and expert tracking to mitigate myopia and enable adaptive step-size optimization. We rigorously prove that both long-term and short-term policies achieve sublinear regret bounds over time, which improves with more regression scenarios, stronger tracking penalties, and finer convex approximations. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing costs by 73.4%, eliminating load loss via reference tracking, and achieving an additional 2.4% cost saving via the OCO algorithm. These benefits scale up with longer LDES durations, and the method demonstrates resilience to poor forecasts and unexpected system faults.</description>
