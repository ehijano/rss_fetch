      <title>General Constraints on Isocurvature from the CMB and Ly-$\alpha$ Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current cosmological data are well-described by the Lambda-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, which assumes adiabatic initial conditions for the primordial density perturbations. This agreement between data and theory enables strong constraints on new physics that generates isocurvature perturbations. Existing constraints typically assume a simple power law form for the isocurvature power spectrum. However, many new physics scenarios -- such as cosmological phase transitions and gravitational particle production -- can deviate from this assumption. To derive general constraints which apply to a wide variety of new physics scenarios, we consider four types of isocurvature modes (dark matter, baryon, dark radiation and neutrino density isocurvature) and parametrize the isocurvature power spectrum using two general forms: a delta function and a broken power law. Using data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations, the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, and CMB spectral distortions, we place constraints on the isocurvature power spectrum across a wide range of scales, from $10^{-4}\,\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ to $10^{4}\,\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Detecting galaxy-21-cm cross-correlation during reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic 21-cm signal promises to revolutionize studies of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Radio interferometers are aiming for a preliminary, low signal-to-noise (S/N) detection of the 21-cm power spectrum. Cross-correlating 21-cm with galaxies will be especially useful in these efforts, providing both a sanity check for initial 21-cm detection claims and potentially increasing the S/N due to uncorrelated residual systematics. Here we self-consistently simulate large-scale (1 Gpc) galaxy and 21-cm fields, computing their cross-power spectra for various choices of instruments as well as survey properties. We use 1080h observations with SKA-low AA* and HERA-350 as our benchmark 21-cm observations. We create mock Lyman alpha narrow-band, slitless and slit spectroscopic surveys, using benchmarks from instruments such as Subaru HyperSupremeCam, Roman grism, VLT MOONS, ELT MOSAIC, and JWST NIRCam. We forecast the resulting S/N of the galaxy-21-cm cross power spectrum, varying the galaxy survey area, depth and level of 21-cm foreground contamination for each pair of instruments. We find that the highest S/N is achievable through slitless, wide-area spectroscopic surveys, with the proposed Roman HLS survey resulting in a 55$\sigma$ detection of the cross power with 21-cm as observed with SKA-low AA* for our fiducial model. Narrow-band dropout surveys are unlikely to result in a detectable cross-power, due to their poor redshift localization. Slit spectroscopy can provide a high S/N detection of the cross power for SKA-low AA* observations. Specifically, the planned MOONRISE survey with MOONS on the VLT can result in a 3$\sigma$ detection, while a survey of comparable observing time using MOSAIC on the ELT can result in a 4$\sigma$ detection. Our results can be used to guide survey strategies, facilitating the detection of the galaxy-21-cm cross power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Vlasov Perturbation Theory and the role of higher cumulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to Vlasov Perturbation Theory (VPT) that solves for the hierarchy of cumulants of the phase-space distribution function to arbitrarily high truncation order in the context of cosmological structure formation driven by collisionless dark matter. We investigate the impact of higher cumulants on density and velocity power spectra as well as the bispectrum, and compare to scale-free $N$-body simulations. While there is a strong difference between truncation at the first cumulant, i.e. standard perturbation theory (SPT), and truncation at the second (i.e. including the velocity dispersion tensor), the third cumulant has a small quantitative impact and fourth and higher cumulants only have a minor effect on these summary statistics at weakly non-linear scales. We show that spurious exponential growth is absent in vector and tensor modes if scalar-mode constraints on the non-Gaussianity of the background distribution function that results from shell-crossing are satisfied, guaranteeing the screening of UV modes for all fluctuations of any type, as expected physically. We also show analytically that loop corrections to the power spectrum are finite within VPT for any initial power spectra consistent with hierarchical clustering, unlike SPT. Finally, we discuss the relation to and contrast our predictions with effective field theory (EFT), and discuss how the advantages of VPT and EFT approaches could be combined.</description>

      <title>Full-sky Models of Galactic Microwave Emission and Polarization at Sub-arcminute Scales for the Python Sky Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarized foreground emission from the Galaxy is one of the biggest challenges facing current and upcoming cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization experiments. We develop new models of polarized Galactic dust and synchrotron emission at CMB frequencies that draw on the latest observational constraints, that employ the ``polarization fraction tensor'' framework to couple intensity and polarization in a physically motivated way, and that allow for stochastic realizations of small-scale structure at sub-arcminute angular scales currently unconstrained by full-sky data. We implement these models into the publicly available Python Sky Model (PySM) software and additionally provide PySM interfaces to select models of dust and CO emission from the literature. We characterize the behavior of each model by quantitatively comparing it to observational constraints in both maps and power spectra, demonstrating an overall improvement over previous PySM models. Finally, we synthesize models of the various Galactic foreground components into a coherent suite of three plausible microwave skies that span a range of astrophysical complexity allowed by current data.</description>

      <title>Void and Density Walls Inhomogeneous Cosmic Web Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An approach to cosmological modelling is presented that incorporates the inhomogeneous structure of the Cosmic Web, specifically focusing on the interplay between cosmic voids and density walls. We extend the standard homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model to account for the observed large-scale structure of the universe. By modifying the Friedmann equations to include inhomogeneity terms representing voids and walls, we develop a more realistic description of cosmic evolution. Our model demonstrates how the presence of these structures affects the overall expansion rate of the universe and the growth of perturbations. We find that accounting for this inhomogeneous distribution leads to significant deviations from the predictions of standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology in the late-time universe. The Hubble and $\sigma_8$ structure growth tensions are addressed in the void-density wall model, leading to a resolution of these tensions. These results have important implications for the interpretation of cosmological observations when including the void and density wall Cosmic Web inhomogeneities.</description>

      <title>Stochastic lensing of stars by ultralight dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter is an interesting dark matter candidate describing the lightest end of the mass parameter space. This model produces an oscillating granular pattern in halo densities. These fluctuations have the potential to produce a time-varying density along the line of sight creating a small lensing signal for any stars observed through a dark matter halo which oscillates on the de Broglie timescale. In this work, we study this stochastic lensing signal taking into account the impact of density granules as well as the central soliton. We calculate the amplitude and temporal properties of this signal and estimate how stellar observations may be used to constrain the ultralight dark matter mass and abundance.</description>

      <title>Probing inflationary gravitational waves with cross-correlations: improved forecasting and validation with simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a follow-up study to the method recently proposed by Namikawa &amp; Sherwin (2023) to probe gravitational waves using cross-correlations between two CMB $B$-modes and a large-scale structure tracer. We first improve on the previous forecast by including the impact of CMB component separation and find that we can achieve $\sigma_r\simeq3.5\times10^{-3}$ by combining upcoming experiments, i.e., LiteBIRD, CMB-S4 and the Advanced Simons Observatory. With a more futuristic experiment, we can achieve even tighter constraints on $r$ if improved delensing can be realized. Using a simulated analysis pipeline, we also explore possible biases from higher-order terms in the lensing potential, which were previously not examined in detail. We find that these bias terms are negligible compared to a detectable signal from inflationary gravitational waves. Our simulated results confirm that this new method is capable of obtaining powerful constraints on $r$. The method is immune to Gaussian Galactic foregrounds and has a different response to non-Gaussian Galactic foregrounds than the $B$-mode power spectrum, offering an independent cross-check of $r$ constraints from the standard power spectrum analysis.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Bias due to non-Gaussian Foregrounds in an Optimal Reconstruction of CMB Lensing and Temperature Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the magnitude of the bias due to non-Gaussian extragalactic foregrounds on the optimal reconstruction of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing potential and temperature power spectra. The reconstruction is performed using a Bayesian inference method known as the marginal unbiased score expansion (MUSE). We apply MUSE to a minimum variance combination of multifrequency maps drawn from the Agora publicly available simulations of the lensed CMB and correlated extragalactic foreground emission. Taking noise levels appropriate to two years of data with the SPT-3G instrument on the South Pole Telescope, we find no statistically significant bias in the MUSE reconstruction when limited to angular multipoles $\ell \leq 3000$. We find a 4.7$\sigma$ bias in the recovered lensing potential power spectrum when smaller scale modes ($\ell \leq 3500$) are included. This work is a first step toward understanding the impact of extragalactic foregrounds on optimal reconstructions of CMB temperature and lensing potential power spectra.</description>

      <title>Constraining Anisotropic Universe Through Big Bang Nucleosynthesis: A Case Study of The Bianchi Type-I Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isotropy and homogeneity of our Universe are the cardinal principles of modern cosmology built on the definition of metric through the prescription by Friedmann-Lema$\hat{i}$tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW). From the aspects of geometry, the presence of anisotropy, inhomogeneity, or both are allowed in the metrics defined as the Bianchi type I and V metrics. In this letter, the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) formalism, and the latest observational constraints on nuclear abundances are being used to put bounds on the global anisotropy offered in the Bianchi type I metrics, providing a new path to explore in the background of global anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Impact of Calibration and Position Errors on Astrophysical Parameters of the {\hi} 21cm Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and Cosmic Dawn (CD) are pivotal stages during the first billion years of the universe, exerting a significant influence on the development of cosmic structure. The detection of the redshifted 21-cm signal from these epochs is challenging due to the dominance of significantly stronger astrophysical foregrounds and the presence systematics. This work used the 21cm E2E pipeline, followed by simulation methodology described \cite{2022Mazumder} to conduct synthetic observations of a simulated sky model that includes both the redshifted 21-cm signal and foregrounds. A framework was constructed using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Bayesian techniques to directly deduce astrophysical parameters from the measured power spectrum. This approach eliminates the need for explicit telescope effects correction in interferometric arrays such as SKA-Low and HERA. The present work investigates the impact of calibration and position errors on retrieving the redshifted 21-cm power spectrum for the above arrays. We assessed the effects of these inaccuracies on the deduced astrophysical parameters and established acceptable tolerance levels. Based on our results, the calibration error tolerance for ideal signal detection is 0.001 %. However, if the position errors exceed 0.048 arcseconds, the remaining foregrounds would obscure the target signal.</description>

      <title>Target Selection for the Redshift-Limited WAVES-Wide with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forthcoming Wide Area Vista Extragalactic Survey (WAVES) on the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) has a key science goal of probing the halo mass function to lower limits than possible with previous surveys. For that purpose, in its Wide component, galaxies targetted by WAVES will be flux-limited to $Z&lt;21.1$ mag and will cover the redshift range of $z&lt;0.2$, at a spectroscopic success rate of $\sim95\%$. Meeting this completeness requirement, when the redshift is unknown a priori, is a challenge. We solve this problem with supervised machine learning to predict the probability of a galaxy falling within the WAVES-Wide redshift limit, rather than estimate each object's redshift. This is done by training an XGBoost tree-based classifier to decide if a galaxy should be a target or not. Our photometric data come from 9-band VST+VISTA observations, including KiDS+VIKING surveys. The redshift labels for calibration are derived from an extensive spectroscopic sample overlapping with KiDS and ancillary fields. Our current results indicate that with our approach, we should be able to achieve the completeness of $\sim95\%$, which is the WAVES success criterion.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Physics and Cosmology with TianQin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of the surrounding world and the universe is an important theme in the legacy of humankind. The detection of gravitational waves is adding a new dimension to this grand effort. What are the fundamental physical laws governing the dynamics of the universe? What is the fundamental composition of the universe? How has the universe evolved in the past and how will it evolve in the future? These are the basic questions that press for answers. The space-based gravitational wave detector TianQin will tune in to gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency range ($10^{-4} \sim 1$ Hz, to be specific), opening a new gravitational wave spectrum window to explore many of the previously hidden sectors of the universe. TianQin will discover many astrophysical systems, populating the universe at different redshifts: some will be of new types that have never been detected before, some will have very high signal-to-noise ratios, and some will have very high parameter estimation precision. The plethora of information collected will bring us to new fronts on which to search for the breaking points of general relativity, the possible violation of established physical laws, the signature of possible new gravitational physics and new fundamental fields, and to improve our knowledge on the expansion history of the universe. In this white paper, we highlight the advances that TianQin can bring to fundamental physics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Introducing the THESAN-ZOOM project: radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of high-redshift galaxies with a multi-phase interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the THESAN-ZOOM project, a comprehensive suite of high-resolution zoom-in simulations of $14$ high-redshift ($z&gt;3$) galaxies selected from the THESAN simulation volume. This sample encompasses a diverse range of halo masses, with $M_\mathrm{halo} \approx 10^8 - 10^{13}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ at $z=3$. At the highest-resolution, the simulations achieve a baryonic mass of $142~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a gravitational softening length of $17~\mathrm{cpc}$. We employ a state-of-the-art multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) model that self-consistently includes stellar feedback, radiation fields, dust physics, and low-temperature cooling through a non-equilibrium thermochemical network. Our unique framework incorporates the impact of patchy reionization by adopting the large-scale radiation field topology from the parent THESAN simulation box rather than assuming a spatially uniform UV background. In total, THESAN-ZOOM comprises $60$ simulations, including both fiducial runs and complementary variations designed to investigate the impact of numerical and physical parameters on galaxy properties. The fiducial simulation set reproduces a wealth of high-redshift observational data such as the stellar-to-halo-mass relation, the star-forming main sequence, the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, and the mass-metallicity relation. While our simulations slightly overestimate the abundance of low-mass and low-luminosity galaxies they agree well with observed stellar and UV luminosity functions at the higher mass end. Moreover, the star-formation rate density closely matches the observational estimates from $z=3-14$. These results indicate that the simulations effectively reproduce many of the essential characteristics of high-redshift galaxies, providing a realistic framework to interpret the exciting new observations from JWST.</description>

Abstract: The population of the observed gravitational wave events encodes unique information on the formation and evolution of stellar-mass black holes, from the underlying astrophysical processes to the large-scale dynamics of the Universe. We use the ICAROGW analysis infrastructure to perform hierarchical Bayesian inference on the gravitational wave signals from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA third observing run, O3. Searching for additional structure and redshift evolution in the primary mass distribution, we explore the dependence of the mass spectrum reconstruction on different parametrizations and prior choices. For the stationary case, we find strong evidence (Bayes factor $B \simeq 180$) that the results obtained using a power-law model with a peak (Powerlaw-Gaussian)--the model preferred so far in the literature--are sensitive to prior bounds, affecting the resolvability of the $\sim 35 M_{\odot}$ peak. This behaviour is reproduced by simulated data, indicating a bimodal structure in the likelihood. Models with three mass features simultaneously capture a sharp $\sim 10M_{\odot}$ peak, a $\sim 35 M_{\odot}$ overdensity, and support for a $\sim 20 M_{\odot}$ overdensity preceded by a dip. Among these, a model with three power-law peaks (Powerlaw-Powerlaw-Powerlaw) is equally favored, in terms of evidence, over the Powerlaw-Gaussian model with wide priors. We find no statistical support for redshift evolution in the current data and provide constraints on the parameters governing this evolution, showing consistency with stationarity. We highlight possible limitations of the hierarchical Bayesian inference framework in reconstructing evolving features outside the detector horizon. Our work lays the foundations for a robust characterization of time-dependent population distributions, with significant implications for black hole astrophysics and gravitational wave cosmology.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Stasis from Field-Dependent Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological stasis is a new type of epoch in the cosmological timeline during which the cosmological abundances of different energy components -- such as vacuum energy, matter, and radiation -- remain constant despite the expansion of the universe. Previous studies have shown that stasis naturally arises in various scenarios beyond the Standard Model, either through sequential decays of states in large towers or via the annihilation of a single particle species in thermal equilibrium with itself. In this work, we demonstrate that stasis can also emerge from the decay of a single particle species whose decay width is dynamically regulated by a scalar field rolling down a Hubble-mass potential. By analyzing the fixed points of the dynamical system, we identify regions of the parameter space where stasis occurs as a global attractor of cosmic evolution. We also find that, depending on the specific abundance configuration, stasis solutions can manifest as either a stable node with asymptotic behavior or a stable spiral exhibiting intrinsic oscillations. Furthermore, we present an explicit model for this realization of stasis and explore its phenomenological constraints and implications.</description>

      <title>Scalar Field Fluctuations and the Production of Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the simplest possible candidates for dark matter is a stable scalar singlet beyond the Standard Model. If its mass is below the Hubble scale during inflation, long-wavelength modes of this scalar will be excited during inflation, and their subsequent evolution may lead to the correct relic density of dark matter. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of a spectator scalar. We examine three cases: (1) a non-interacting massive scalar, (2) a massive scalar with self-interactions of the form $\lambda_\chi \chi^p$, and (3) a massive scalar coupled to the inflaton $\phi$ through an interaction term of the form $\sigma_{n,m} \phi^n \chi^m$. In all cases, we assume minimal coupling to gravity and compare these results with the production of short-wavelength modes arising from single graviton exchange. The evolution is tracked during the reheating phase. Our findings are summarized using $(m_\chi, T_{\rm RH})$ parameter planes, where $m_\chi$ is the mass of the scalar field and $T_{\rm RH}$ is the reheating temperature after inflation. The non-interacting scalar is highly constrained, requiring $m_\chi &gt; 3 \times 10^{12}~\rm {GeV}$ and $ T_{\rm RH} \lesssim 7~\text{TeV}$ for an inflationary potential with a quadratic minimum. However, when self-interactions or couplings to the inflaton are included, the viable parameter space expands considerably. In these cases, sub-GeV and even sub-eV scalar masses can yield the correct relic abundance, opening new possibilities for light dark matter candidates. In all cases, we also impose additional constraints arising from the production of isocurvature fluctuations, the prevention of a secondary inflationary phase triggered by the spectator field, and the fragmentation of scalar condensates.</description>

      <title>A MOND model applied to the rotation curve of galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a modified Newton dynamics (MOND) model to study the rotation curves of galaxies. The model is described by an arctangent interpolating function and it fits the rotation curves of several galaxies without invoking the presence of dark matter. We took from the literature the rotation curve data of fifteen spiral galaxies, and used it to constrain the model parameter, $a_0$, as around $5\times 10^{-10}$ m/s$^2$. This parameter is also called the acceleration constant once it gives the acceleration scale where Newton's dynamics fails. The model can be further tested in different astrophysical scenarios, such as, the missing mass problem of galaxy clusters and the accelerated expansion of the Universe, thus leading to a more robust and well constrained model.</description>

      <title>Searching for gravitational-wave bursts from cosmic string cusps with the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array third data release</title>

Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are designed to detect nanohertz-frequency gravitational waves (GWs). Since GWs are anticipated from cosmic strings, PTAs offer a viable approach to testing their existence. We present the results of the first Bayesian search for gravitational-wave bursts from cosmic string cusps (GWCS) using the third PPTA data release for 30 millisecond pulsars. In this data collection, we find no evidence for GWCS signals. We compare a model with a GWCS signal to one with only noise, including a common spatially uncorrelated red noise (CURN), and find that our data is more consistent with the noise-only model.We then establish upper limits on the strain amplitude of GWCS at the pulsar term, based on the analysis of 30 millisecond pulsars, after finding no compelling evidence. We find the addition of a CURN with different spectral indices into the noise model has a negligible impact on the upper limits. And the upper limit range of the amplitude of the pulsar-term GWCS is concentrated between 10^{-12} and 10^{-11}. Finally, we set upper limits on the amplitude of GWCS events, parametrized by width and event epoch, for a single pulsar PSR J1857+0943. Moreover, we derive upper limit on the cosmic string tension as a function of burst width and compare it with previous results.</description>

      <title>Warm Hawking Relics From Primordial Black Hole Domination</title>

Abstract: We study the cosmological impact of warm, dark-sector relic particles produced as Hawking radiation in a primordial-black-hole-dominated universe before big bang nucleosynthesis. If these dark-sector particles are stable, they would survive to the present day as "Hawking relics" and modify the growth of cosmological structure. We show that such relics are produced with much larger momenta, but in smaller quantities than the familiar thermal relics considered in standard cosmology. Consequently, Hawking relics with keV-MeV masses affect the growth of large-scale structure in a similar way to eV-scale thermal relics like massive neutrinos. We model their production and evolution, and show that their momentum distributions are broader than comparable relics with thermal distributions. Warm Hawking relics affect the growth of cosmological perturbations and we constrain their abundance to be less than $2\%$ of the dark matter over a broad range of their viable parameter space. Finally, we examine how future measurements of the matter power spectrum can distinguish Hawking relics from thermal particles.</description>

      <title>Constraints on blue and red tilted primordial power spectra using dwarf galaxy properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the standard $\Lambda$+Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model is well tested on large scales, the primordial power spectrum may deviate from the $\Lambda$CDM spectrum on small scales due to specific dark matter properties or alternative inflationary models. These deviations affect the formation of dark matter structure, which subsequently leads to different observable properties of galaxies. In this work, we study the impact of a blue and red tilted power spectrum on the central density of dwarf galaxies. To do this, we model densities of dwarf galaxies using a combination of high-resolution numerical simulations and galaxy formation model. The model galaxies in $\Lambda$CDM are consistent with observations of 41 faint dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. The deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM power spectrum are constrained by the central matter densities of dwarf galaxies, which set stringent constraints on the possible small-scale tilt of the primordial power spectrum, improving on the current limits. Moreover, similar analysis can be applied to test any feature in the power spectrum at small scales between $k\sim 10-100$~Mpc$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>SpectrAx: Spectral Search of Axion-Like Particles Using Multi-Band Observations of Galaxy Clusters from SKA, SO, CMB-S4 and eROSITA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of axions or Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) has been predicted by various Beyond Standard Model (BSM) theories, and the proposed photon-ALP interaction is one of the ways to probe them. Such an interaction will lead to photon-ALP resonant conversion in galaxy clusters, resulting in a polarized spectral distortion in the CMB along the cluster line of sight. The estimation of this signal from galaxy clusters requires an estimation of their electron density and magnetic field profiles, as well as their redshifts. We have developed a new Bayesian framework \texttt{SpectrAx} that can use observations from different electromagnetic bands such as radio, CMB, optical, and X-ray to infer the astrophysical properties of a galaxy cluster, such as cluster its redshift, electron density and magnetic field, along with the BSM physics such as ALPs. We use simulated redshifts in our analysis, but that can be obtained by cross-matching with optical surveys having overlapping sky regions with the galaxy clusters. Also, we use radial profiles that are motivated from observations of galaxy clusters at low redshifts. By using the simulated data corresponding to the ALP mass of $10^{-14}$ eV for upcoming CMB surveys such as Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4 in combination with Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) we demonstrate the capability in accurately inferring the ALPs coupling strength along with the radial profile of electron density and magnetic field from galaxy clusters. The application of this framework to the data from future surveys by combining SKA+SO+eROSITA and SKA+CMB-S4+eROSITA will make it possible for the first time to explore both astrophysics and BSM physics from low-redshift galaxy clusters using a multi-band approach.</description>

      <title>Constraining circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves with CMB</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circular polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) offers a promising probe of the parity-violating physics of the early universe. In this paper, we propose a novel method to constrain the primordial circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves (GW) in the GHz range. An efficient conversion of gravitons to photons in a transverse cosmological magnetic field at the epoch of last scattering can generate excess chiral photons if the GW background is chiral in nature. This excess radiation distorts the CMB thermal black-body spectrum, which can be estimated by measuring the V-Stokes parameter in the CMB polarization. Using current upper limits on the angular power spectrum of circular polarization $C_l^{VV}$ from the CLASS, MIPOL, and SPIDER experiments, we obtain the most stringent constraints on the characteristic strain and circular polarization of the isotropic background of stochastic GWs at ${40\,\rm GHz}$ and ${150\,\rm GHz}$, respectively. Our work, therefore, provides an interesting possibility to constrain the circular polarization of high-frequency GWs using the V-mode polarization measurements of CMB.</description>

      <title>Peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters in a IllustrisTNG simulation based on mock observations of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are the largest self-gravitational systems in the Universe. They are valuable probes of the structure growth of the Universe when we estimate their peculiar velocities with the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effects. We investigate whether there is a systematic offset between the peculiar velocities ($v_{\rm z,kSZ}$) estimated with the kSZ effect and the true velocities of halos. We first created mocks of the 2D maps of SZ effects in seven frequency bands for galaxy clusters spanning a broad range of masses in TNG 300-3. We then derived the line-of-sight (LOS) peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters by applying an analytical formula to fit the spectra of the SZ effect. We find that the analytical formula-fitting method tends to overestimate the peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters, regardless of whether they approach us or recede from us. However, when galaxy clusters larger than 500 km/s were excluded, the slopes of the relations between $v_{\rm z,kSZ}$ and the real LOS velocities of galaxy clusters ($v_{\rm z,halo}$) were consistent with unity within the errors. Additionally, we further accounted for observational noise for different-aperture telescopes under different precipitable water vapor. The slopes for most cases are consistent with unity within the errors, and the errors of the slopes slightly increase with higher observation noise. The $|v_{\rm z,kSZ}-v_{\rm z,halo}|$ exhibits no obvious trend with increasing concentration and $M_{\rm 200}$. It is noteworthy that the $|v_{\rm z,kSZ}-v_{\rm z,halo}|$ is relatively high for galaxy clusters with strong active galactic nucleus feedback and high star formation rates. This indicates that these physical processes affect the cluster dynamic state and may reflect on the peculiar velocity estimated from the kSZ effect.</description>

      <title>Self-similar decomposition of the hierarchical merger tree of dark matter halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the merger tree of dark matter halos is approximately self-similar by investigating the universality of the subhalo peak mass function (PMF) describing the mass distribution of progenitor halos. Using a set of cosmological simulations and identifying subhalos of different merger levels with HBT+, we verify that the level-1 subhalo PMF is close to universal across halo mass, redshift, and cosmology. This approximate self-similarity allows us to analytically derive the subhalo PMF for subhalos accreted at any level (i.e., for sub-sub...halos) through self-convolutions of the level-1 PMF, and the resulting model shows good agreement with simulation measurements. We further derive a number of analytical properties on the hierarchical origin of subhalos, including the level distribution, accretion rate at each level, initial merger ratio distribution, and accretion redshift distribution. We find that higher-level subhalos dominate at progressively lower peak mass in the PMF and are more likely to originate from major mergers than lower-level ones. At a given mass ratio at accretion time, the subhalo accretion rates at each level track the growth rate of the host halo. At a fixed final mass ratio, however, the accretion redshift distribution of subhalos depends on the subhalo level, peak mass, and host mass. Higher-level and higher-mass-ratio subhalos tend to be accreted more recently, and more massive halos also accrete their subhalos more recently. Our model provides a concise summary of simulation results and can serve as a basis for further theoretical understanding of the hierarchical structure formation.</description>

Abstract: The mass and the spin of accreting and jetted black holes, at the center of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), can be probed by analyzing their electromagnetic spectra. For this purpose, we use the Spin-Modified Fundamental Plane of black hole activity, which non-linearly connects the following four variables (in the source frame): radio luminosity, X-ray or optical luminosity (via the [OIII] emission line), black hole mass and spin. Taking into account the uncertainties in luminosity measurements, conversion factors, relativistic beaming and physical properties of the AGN system, we derive lower bounds on the spins of a group of heavy, jetted AGNs. Using these results, we study the direct implications on the mass spectrum of the ultra-light particles of scalar (axion-like), vector (dark photon) and tensor types (additional spin-2 particles). We close unexplored gap in the parameter space $10^{-20}-10^{-19}$eV. We obtain upper bounds on the axion decay constant (equivalently lower bounds on the self-interaction strength) considering self-interactions could prevent the axion particles entering the instability, and be the reason for non-observation of superradiance. Assuming axion/scalar is described by mass and decay constant, we obtain upper limits on what fraction of dark matter can be formed by ultra-light particles and find that single spieces axion-like light particle can constitute at most $10\%$ of the dark matter in the mass range: $ 10^{-21} &lt; \mu \, (\mathrm{eV}) &lt; 10^{-17}$. Moreover, we derive similar bounds for vector and spin-2 particles and find that light vector fields can constitute at most $10^{-6}$ of the dark matter in $10^{-21}\, \mathrm{eV} &lt; \mu &lt; 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{eV}$ range, and light spin-2 fields can constitute at most $10^{-9}$ of the dark matter in $10^{-23}\, \mathrm{eV} &lt; \mu &lt; 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{eV}$ range.</description>

Abstract: The interaction of binary black hole mergers with their environments can be studied using numerical relativity simulations. These start only a short finite time before merger, at which point appropriate initial conditions must be imposed. A key task is therefore to identify the configuration that is appropriate for the binary and its environment at this stage of the evolution. In this work we study the behaviour of wave dark matter around equal mass black hole binaries, finding that there is a preferred, quasi-stationary profile that persists and grows over multiple orbits, in contrast to heavier mass dark matter where any overdensity tends to be dispersed by the binary motion. Whilst different initial configurations converge to the preferred quasi-stationary one after several orbits, unwanted transient oscillations are generated in the process, which may impact on the signal in short simulation runs. We also point out that naively superimposing the matter onto a circular binary results in artificially eccentric orbits due to the matter backreaction, which is an effect of the initial conditions and not a signature of dark matter. We discuss the further work required so that comparison of waveforms obtained with environments to vacuum cases can be done in a meaningful way.</description>

      <title>Revisiting van Citter-Zernike correlations in the presence of primordial gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00474v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a quantum field theory framework to describe the interaction between a gravitational wave (GW) background and an electromagnetic (EM) field emitted from a distant celestial source, such as a star. We demonstrate that a background of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), as predicted by the inflationary scenario, induces a loss of spatial coherence in the EM field as it propagates over cosmological distances. This effect leads to the degradation of van Cittert-Zernike correlations, ultimately rendering them unobservable - a phenomenon referred to as blurring. Since spatial coherence is observed in very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) measurements of distant quasars, this places constraints on the amplitude of the PGW background. We quantitatively evaluate the blurring effect caused by PGWs in a two-mode squeezed state, which represents the standard quantum state predicted by the simplest inflationary models. However, due to the weak coupling between GWs and the EM field, we find that the induced incoherence is too small to be detected in current VLBI observations.</description>

      <title>No evidence for anisotropy in galaxy spin directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern cosmology rests on the cosmological principle, that on large enough scales the Universe is both homogeneous and isotropic. A corollary is that galaxies' spin vectors should be isotropically distributed on the sky. This has been challenged by multiple authors for over a decade, with claims to have detected a statistically significant dipole pattern of spins. We collect all publicly available datasets with spin classifications (binary Z-wise/S-wise), and analyse them for large-angle anisotropies ($\ell \le 2$). We perform each inference in both a Bayesian and frequentist fashion, the former establishing posterior probabilities on the multipole parameters and the latter calculating $p$-values for rejection of the null hypothesis of isotropy (i.e. no power at $\ell&gt;0$). All analysis indicate consistency with isotropy to within $3\sigma$. We similarly identify no evidence for a "hemisphere anisotropy" that neglects the angular dependence of the dipole. We isolate the differences with contrary claims in the ad hoc or biased statistics that they employ. Our code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Breaking into the window of primordial black hole dark matter with x-ray microlensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the mass range $10^{-16}-10^{-11}~M_\odot$ may constitute all the dark matter. We show that gravitational microlensing of bright x-ray pulsars provide the most robust and immediately implementable opportunity to uncover PBH dark matter in this mass window. As proofs of concept, we show that the currently operational NICER telescope can probe this window near $10^{-14}~M_\odot$ with just two months of exposure on the x-ray pulsar SMC-X1, and that the forthcoming STROBE-X telescope can probe complementary regions in only a few weeks. These times are comparable to the week-long exposures obtained by NICER on various individual sources. We take into account the effects of wave optics and the finite extent of the source, which become important for the mass range of our PBHs. We also provide a spectral diagnostic to distinguish microlensing from transient background events and to broadly mark the PBH mass if true microlensing events are observed. In light of the powerful science case, i.e., the imminent discovery of dark matter searchable over multiple decades of PBH masses with achievable exposures, we strongly urge the commission of a dedicated large broadband telescope for x-ray microlensing. We derive the microlensing reach of such a telescope by assuming sensitivities of detector components of proposed missions, and find that with hard x-ray pulsar sources PBH masses down to a few $10^{-17}~M_\odot$ can be probed.</description>

      <title>Narrow line AGN selection in CEERS: spectroscopic selection, physical properties, X-ray and radio analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we spectroscopically select narrow-line AGN (NLAGN) among the $\sim 300$ publicly available medium-resolution spectra of the CEERS Survey. Using both traditional and newly identified emission line NLAGN diagnostics diagrams, we identified 52 NLAGN at $2\lesssim z\lesssim 9$ on which we performed a detailed multiwavelength analysis. We also identified 4 new $z\lesssim 2$ broad-line AGN (BLAGN), in addition to the 8 previously reported high-$z$ BLAGN. We found that the traditional BPT diagnostic diagrams are not suited to identify high-$z$ AGN, while most of the high-$z$ NLAGN are selected using the recently proposed AGN diagnostic diagrams based on the [OIII]$\lambda$4363 auroral line or high-ionization emission lines. We compared the emission line velocity dispersion and the obscuration of the sample of NLAGN with those of the parent sample without finding significant differences between the two distributions, suggesting a population of AGN heavily buried and not significantly impacting the host galaxies' physical properties, as further confirmed by SED-fitting. The bolometric luminosities of the high-$z$ NLAGNs selected in this work are well below those sampled by surveys before JWST, potentially explaining the weak impact of these AGN. Finally, we investigate the X-ray properties of the selected NLAGN and of the sample of high-$z$ BLAGN. We find that all but 4 NLAGN are undetected in the deep X-ray image of the field, as well as all the high-$z$ BLAGN. We do not obtain a detection even by stacking the undetected sources, resulting in an X-ray weakness of $\sim 1-2$ dex from what is expected based on their bolometric luminosities. To discriminate between a heavily obscured AGN scenario or an intrinsic X-ray weakness of these sources, we performed a radio stacking analysis, which did not reveal any detection leaving open the questions about the origin of the X-ray weakness.</description>

      <title>Probing a diffuse flux of axion-like particles from galactic supernovae with neutrino water Cherenkov detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we claim that axion-like particles (ALPs) with MeV masses can be produced with semi-relativistic velocities in core-collapse supernovae (SNe), generating a diffuse galactic flux. We show that these ALPs can be detected in neutrino water Cherenkov detectors via $a \, p \rightarrow p \, \gamma$ interactions. Using Super-Kamiokande data, we derive new constraints on the ALP parameter space, excluding a region spanning more than one order of magnitude in the ALP-proton coupling above cooling bounds for ALP masses in the range of $1-80$ MeV and ALP-proton couplings between $8\times10^{-6}-2\times10^{-4}$. We show that the future Hyper-Kamiokande will be able to probe couplings as small as $2.5\times10^{-6}$, fully closing the allowed region above SN 1987A cooling bounds.</description>

      <title>The Weinberg no-go theorem for cosmological constant and nonlocal gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how a nonlocal gravitational interaction can circumvent the Weinberg no-go theorem on cosmological constant, which forbids the existence of any solution to the cosmological constant problem within the context of local field theories unless some fine-tuning is assumed. In particular, Infinite Derivative Gravity theories hint at a possible understanding of the cosmological constant as a nonlocal gravitational effect on very large scales. In this perspective, one can describe the observed cosmic acceleration in terms of an effective field theory without relying on the fine-tuning of parameters or additional matter fields.</description>

      <title>Particle production from inhomogeneities: general metric perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present universal formulas for particle production from gravitational inhomogeneities. In the massless limit the result is strikingly simple and completely determined by the two-point function of the energy-momentum tensor that is fixed up to a constant - the central charge - for conformally coupled scalars, massless fermions and gauge fields. This result can be applied to any conformally coupled theory, weakly or strongly interacting, unifying previous derivations for fields of different spin and for scalar and tensor perturbations. We derive the results using the Schwinger method of 1PI effective action and through Bogoliubov transformations that allows to compute exclusive information on the distribution of particles. We then apply these results to stochastic backgrounds of scalar and tensor perturbations that can be generated by various phenomena such us inflationary perturbations and first order phase transitions. Differently from particle production usually considered in cosmology this mechanism allows for the production of massless fields. In particular the abundance induced by inhomogeneities can easily reproduce the dark matter abundance if scalar perturbations produced from inflation are enhanced at short scales.</description>

      <title>Positive-Energy Warp Drive in a De Sitter Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalizing the result of H. Ellis who embedded a warp bubble in the background of a black hole, we introduce a warp bubble in a de Sitter universe. We show that under certain conditions (namely, that the bubble is moving in the radial direction at a velocity equal to the speed of the expansion of the universe), it is possible for the bubble to have strictly non--negative Eulerian energy density and satisfy the averaged weak and null energy conditions (though they are violated locally). We also prove a more generic theorem that if perturbations of vacuum energy produce at least some underdense regions in all reference frames, they always result in local violations of NEC and WEC. We discuss the implications of these results and their possible applications to models of dark energy like "dark fluid" and quintessence, as well as to physical systems like Casimir cavities and analogue gravity setups.</description>
