      <title>Muon Capture on $^{6}$Li, $^{12}$C, and $^{16}$O from $Ab~Initio$ Nuclear Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muon capture on nuclei is one of the most promising probes of the nuclear electroweak current driving the yet-hypothetical neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. Both processes involve vector and axial-vector currents at finite momentum transfer, $q\sim 100$ MeV, as well as the induced pseudoscalar and weak-magnetism currents. Comparing measured muon-capture rates with reliable $ab~initio$ nuclear-theory predictions could help us validate these currents. To this end, we compute partial muon-capture rates for $^{6}$Li, $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O, feeding the ground and excited states in $^{6}$He, $^{12}$B and $^{16}$N, using $ab~initio$ no-core shell model with two- and three-nucleon chiral interactions. We remove the spurious center-of-mass motion by introducing translationally invariant operators and approximate the effect of hadronic two-body currents by Fermi-gas model. We solve the bound-muon wave function from the Dirac wave equations in the Coulomb field created by a finite nucleus. We find that the computed rates to the low-lying states in the final nuclei are in good agreement with the measured counterparts. We highlight sensitivity of some of the transitions to the sub-leading three-nucleon interaction terms. We also compare summed rates to several tens of final states with the measured total capture rates and note that we slightly underestimate the total rate with this simple approach due to limited range of excitation energies.</description>

      <title>Description of moment of inertia and the interplay between anti-pairing and pairing correlations in even-even $^{244}$Pu and $^{248}$Cm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the supersymmetry scheme, which includes many-body interactions and a perturbation possessing the SO(5) (or SU(5)) symmetry, the rotational bands of the $A\sim 250$ mass region are studied systematically. A novel modification is introduced, extending the Arima coefficient to the third order. This study is dedicated to the quantitative analysis of evolving trends in intraband $\gamma$-transition energy, kinematic, and the dynamic moment of inertia within the rotational bands of $^{244}$Pu and $^{248}$Cm. The computed outcomes exhibit an exceptional degree of agreement with experimental observations across various conditions. The significance of including a higher-order Arima coefficient is further examined by contrasting it with the previously suggested model. The calculated results demonstrate the significance of both the anti-pairing and pairing effects in the evolution of the dynamic moment of inertia. Additionally, these insights reveal the importance of a newly introduced parameter in accurately depicting complex nuclear behaviors such as back-bending, up-bending, and the downturn in the moment of inertia.</description>

      <title>Neutron scattering off spherical nuclei with global nonlocal dispersive optical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a global nonlocal and dispersive optical model potential for neutron scattering off spherical nuclei with incident energies up to 250 MeV. This optical model is an extension of the non-dispersive Perey-Buck potential. The imaginary components are chosen energy-dependent and the dispersive constraints are taken into account. The surface imaginary part is nonlocal, whereas the volume imaginary part above 10 MeV is local, allowing to reproduce total cross sections and scattering data for high energies. We obtain a good description of scattering observables for target-nuclei ranging from $A=16$, up to $209$. The inclusion of nonlocal spin-orbit term enables a better description of the analyzing power data relative to the local dispersive model.</description>

      <title>Accessing the speed of sound in relativistic ultracentral nucleus-nucleus collisions using the mean transverse momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been argued that the speed of sound of the strong interaction at high temperature can be measured using the variation of the mean transverse momentum with the particle multiplicity in ultracentral heavy-ion collisions. We test this correspondence by running hydrodynamic simulations at zero impact parameter with several equations of state, at several colliding energies from 0.2 TeV to 15 TeV per nucleon pair. The correspondence is found to be precise and robust for a smooth, boost-invariant fluid and an ideal detector. We discuss the differences between this ideal setup and an actual experiment. We conclude that the extraction of the speed of sound from data is reliable, and that the main uncertainty comes from our poor knowledge of the distribution of density fluctuations at the early stages of the collision.</description>

      <title>Investigating $D^0$ meson production in $p-$Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV with a multi-phase transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the production of $D^0$ meson in $p$+$p$ and $p-$Pb collisions using the improved AMPT model considering both coalescence and independent fragmentation of charm quarks after the Cronin broadening are included. After a detailed discussion of the improvements implemented in the AMPT model for heavy quark production, we show that the modified AMPT model can provide good description of $D^0$ meson spectra in $p-$Pb collisions, the $Q_{\rm pPb}$ data at different centrality and $R_{\rm pPb}$ data in both mid- and forward (backward) rapidities. We also studied the effects of nuclear shadowing and parton cascade on the rapidity dependence of $D^{0}$ meson production and $R_{\rm pPb}$. Our results indicate that having the same strength of the Cronin (i.e $\delta$ value) obtained from the mid-rapidity data leads to a considerable overestimation of the $D^0$ meson spectra and $R_{\rm pPb}$ data at high $p_{T}$ in the backward rapidity. As a result, the $\delta$ is determined via a $\chi^2$ fitting of the $R_{\rm pPb}$ data across various rapidities. This work lays the foundation for a better understanding of cold-nuclear-matter (CNM) effects in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay and double Gamow-Teller transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutrinoless double-$\beta$ ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay and the double Gamow-Teller (DGT) transition are investigated with the state-of-the-art Relativistic Configuration-interaction Density functional theory. A strong linear correlation between the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and the DGT transition is demonstrated. This linear correlation is found to originate from the similarity of the leading-order term of the $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay operator and the DGT-transition one, as revealed by expanding the $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay operator in terms of the spherical harmonics. The present results provide a strong support to constrain the $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay NMEs through the double charge-exchange reactions.</description>

      <title>Testing effective field theory with the most general neutron decay correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Built on the seminal works by Jackson-Treiman-Wyld and Ebel-Feldman, we derive the most general free neutron differential decay rate where all massive particles (neutron, proton and electron) are polarized. This introduces 33 new correlations in addition to the 18 existing ones, which over-constrain the coupling constants in the low-energy effective field theory of charged weak interactions, and thus provides stringent tests of the validity of the theory framework itself. We classify the correlation coefficients in terms of their Standard Model limit and discrete symmetries, and study their expansion with respect to the new physics coupling strengths, supplemented by the experiment-independent $\mathcal{O}(\alpha)$ virtual electromagnetic radiative corrections.</description>

      <title>Symmetric cumulant $sc_{2,4} \left \{ 4 \right \}$ and asymmetric cumulant $ac_{2} \left \{ 3 \right \}$ from transverse momentum conservation and flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multi-particle cumulants method can be used to reveal long-range collectivity in small and large colliding systems. The four-particle symmetric cumulant $sc_{2,4} \left \{ 4 \right \}$, three-particle asymmetric cumulant $ac_{2} \left \{ 3 \right \}$, and the normalised cumulants $nsc_{2,4} \left \{ 4 \right \}$ and $nac_{2} \left \{ 3 \right \}$ from the transverse momentum conservation and flow are calculated. The interplay between the two effects is also investigated. Our results are in good agreement with the recent ATLAS measurements of multi-particle azimuthal correlations with the subevent cumulant method, which provides insight into the origin of collective flow in small systems.</description>

      <title>Skewed generalized parton distributions of proton from basis light-front quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain all the leading-twist quark generalized parton distributions (GPDs) inside the proton at nonzero skewness within the basis light-front quantization framework. We employ the light-front wave functions of the proton from a light-front quantized Hamiltonian in the valence Fock sector consisting of a three-dimensional confinement potential and a one-gluon exchange interaction with fixed coupling. We find that the qualitative behaviors of our GPDs are similar to those of other theoretical calculations. We further examine the GPDs within the boost-invariant longitudinal coordinate, $\sigma=\frac{1}{2} b^- P^+$, which is identified as the Fourier conjugate of the skewness. The GPDs in the $\sigma$-space show diffraction patterns, which are akin to the diffractive scattering of a wave in optics.</description>

      <title>Shear viscosity of quark-gluon plasma at finite temperature and chemical potential and QCD phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the shear viscosity of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in the full QCD phase diagram within the framework of kinetic theory with the relaxation time approximation based on the $2 \leftrightarrow 2$ elastic scatterings of quark quasiparticles. The temperature and chemical potential dependent masses of particles, including $u, d, s$ quarks, their antiparticles, and exchanged mesons, are calculated in the Polyakov-loop extended Nambu--Jona Lasinio (PNJL) model. The results indicate that, at small chemical potential, the value of $\eta/s$ has a minimum near the Mott dissociation of mesons and increases rapidly in the lower-temperature side of the chiral crossover phase transition. At large chemical potential (high density), $\eta/s$ in the QGP phase is dominated by the temperature, and the value of $\eta/s$ is greatly enhanced at lower temperature. At intermediate temperature and chemical potential near the QCD phase transition, the situation is relatively complicated. The behavior of $\eta/s$ is influenced by the competition between temperature, density effect, and QCD phase transition.</description>

      <title>Global sensitivity analysis in Monte Carlo radiation transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Global Sensitivity Analysis for Monte Carlo radiation transport applications. GSA is usually combined with Uncertainty Quantification, where the latter quantifies the variability of a model output in the presence of uncertain inputs and the former attributes this variability to the inputs. The additional noise inherent to MC RT solvers due to the finite number of particle histories presents an additional challenge to GSA and UQ, which are well-established for deterministic solvers. In this contribution, we apply variance deconvolution to the Saltelli method to address MC RT solver noise without having to over-resolve the MC RT simulation.</description>

      <title>Transverse-momentum-dependent gluon distributions of proton within basis light-front quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gluon transverse-momentum dependent distributions (TMDs) are very important for revealing the internal structure of the proton. They correspond to a variety of experiments and are among the major tasks of the future electron-ion colliders. In this paper, we calculate the T-even gluon TMDs at the leading twist within the Basis Light-front Quantization framework. We employ the light-front wave functions of the proton obtained from a light-front quantized Hamiltonian with Quantum Chromodynamics input determined for its valence Fock sector with three constituent quarks and an additional Fock sector, encompassing three quarks and a dynamical gluon, with a three-dimensional confinement. After obtaining the numerical results we investigate the properties of gluon TMDs by checking whether they satisfy the Mulders-Rodrigues inequalities and investigate the correlations between transverse and longitudinal degrees of freedom. With their connection to unintegrated gluon distributions in mind, we further investigate the limiting behaviours of gluon TMDs in the small-$x$ and large-$x$ regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transverse polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperon within reconstructed jets in hadronic collisions offers a complementary platform to probe the polarized fragmentation function $D_{1T}^\perp$. We illustrate that by performing a global analysis of the transverse polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons produced in different kinematic regions and in different hadronic collisions, such as $pp$, $p\bar p$, $pA$, and $\gamma A$ collisions, we can pin down the flavor dependence of $D_{1T}^\perp$ which has been poorly constrained. Besides the single inclusive jet production, the $\gamma/Z^0$-boson associated jet production supplements with more capability in removing ambiguities in the flavor dependence of $D_{1T}^\perp$.</description>

      <title>Confinement of $N$-body systems and non-integer dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The squeezing process of a three-dimensional quantum system by use of an external deformed one-body oscillator potential can also be described by the $d$-method, without external field and where the dimension can take non-integer values. In this work we first generalize both methods to $N$ particles and any transition between dimensions below $3$. Once this is done, the use of harmonic oscillator interactions between the particles allows complete analytic solutions of both methods, and a direct comparison between them is possible. Assuming that both methods describe the same process, leading to the same ground state energy and wave function, an analytic equivalence between the methods arises. The equivalence between both methods and the validity of the derived analytic relation between them is first tested for two identical bosons and for squeezing transitions from 3 to 2 and 1 dimensions, as well as from 2 to 1 dimension. We also investigate the symmetric squeezing from 3 to 1 dimensions of a system made of three identical bosons. We have in all the cases found that the derived analytic relations between the two methods work very well. This fact permits to relate both methods also for large squeezing scenarios, where the brute force numerical calculation with the external field is too much demanding from the numerical point of view, especially for systems with more than two particles.</description>

      <title>Study of dark matter scattering off ${}^2$H and ${}^4$He nuclei within chiral effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study dark matter, assumed to be composed by weak interacting massive particles (WIMPs), scattering off ${}^2$H and ${}^4$He nuclei. In order to parameterize the WIMP-nucleon interaction the chiral effective field theory approach is used. Considering only interactions invariant under parity, charge conjugation and time reversal, we examine five interaction types: scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial and tensor. Scattering amplitudes between two nucleons and a WIMP are determined up to second order of chiral perturbation theory. We apply this program to calculate the interaction rate as function of the WIMP mass and of the magnitude of the WIMP-quark coupling constants. From our study, we conclude that the scalar nuclear response functions result much greater than the others due to theirs large combination of low energy constants. We verify that the leading order contributions are dominant in this low energy processes. We also provide an estimate for the background due to atmospheric neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Gluon Double-Spin Asymmetry in the Longitudinally Polarized $p+p$ Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the first-ever small-$x$ expression for the inclusive gluon production cross section in the central rapidity region of the longitudinally polarized proton-proton collisions. The cross section depends on the polarizations of both protons, therefore comprising the numerator of the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry $A_{LL}$ for the produced gluons. The cross section is calculated in the shock wave formalism and is expressed in terms of the polarized dipole scattering amplitudes on the projectile and target protons. We show that the small-$x$ evolution corrections are included into our cross section expression if one evolves these polarized dipole amplitudes using the double-logarithmic helicity evolution derived in \cite{Kovchegov:2015pbl, Kovchegov:2016zex, Kovchegov:2018znm, Cougoulic:2022gbk}. Our calculation is performed for the gluon sector only, with the quark contribution left for future work. When that work is complete, the resulting formula will be applicable to longitudinally polarized proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions, as well as to polarized semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) on a proton or a nucleus. Our results should allow one to extend the small-$x$ helicity phenomenology analysis of \cite{Adamiak:2023yhz} to the jet/hadron production data reported for the longitudinally polarized proton-proton collisions at RHIC and to polarized SIDIS measurements at central rapidities to be performed at the EIC.</description>

      <title>Tensor Polarization and Spectral Properties of Vector Meson in QCD Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.11890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the tensor polarization and the resulted spin alignment of a generic vector meson in local equilibrium up to the first order in hydrodynamic gradients using thermal field theory with dissipative effects incorporated. Several new contributions, including a novel shear-induced tensor polarization (SITP), are discovered and turn out sensitive to the in-medium spectral properties of the vector mesons. The phenomenological study reveals that these contributions, especially SITP, could generate substantial spin alignment in heavy-ion collisions, and potentially helps us to understand the large spin alignment observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Cluster formation near midrapidity -- can the mechanism be identified experimentally?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12019v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of weakly bound clusters in the hot and dense environment at midrapidity is one of the surprising phenomena observed experimentally in heavy-ion collisions from a low center of mass energy of a few GeV up to a ultra-relativistic energy of several TeV. Three approaches have been advanced to describe the cluster formation: coalescence at kinetic freeze-out, cluster formation during the entire heavy-ion collision by potential interaction between nucleons and deuteron production by hadronic reactions. We identify experimental observables, which can discriminate these production mechanisms for deuterons.</description>

      <title>Symmetry energy and neutron star properties constrained by chiral effective field theory calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the nuclear symmetry energy and neutron star properties using a Bayesian analysis based on constraints from different chiral effective field theory calculations using new energy density functionals that allow for large variations at high densities. Constraints at high densities are included from observations of GW170817 and from NICER. In particular, we show that both NICER analyses lead to very similar posterior results for the symmetry energy and neutron star properties when folded into our equation-of-state framework. Using the posteriors, we provide results for the symmetry energy and the slope parameter, as well as for the proton fraction, the speed of sound, and the central density in neutron stars. Moreover, we explore correlations of neutron star radii with the pressure and the speed of sound in neutron stars. Our 95\% credibility ranges for the symmetry energy $S_v$, the slope parameter $L$, and the radius of a 1.4$\msun$ neutron star, $R_{1.4}$, are $S_v=(30.6\text{--}33.9)$\,MeV, $L=(43.7\text{--}70.0)$\,MeV, and $R_{1.4}=(11.6\text{--}13.2)$\,km. Our analysis for the proton fraction shows that larger and/or heavier neutron stars are more likely to cool rapidly via the direct Urca process. Within our equation-of-state framework a maximum mass of neutron stars $M_{\rm max}&gt;2.1\msun$ indicates that the speed of sound needs to exceed the conformal limit.</description>

      <title>Electric dipole polarizability of low-lying excited states in atomic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Novel equations for the electric dipole polarizability $\alpha_{_{E1}}$ of low-lying excited states in atomic nuclei -- and the related $(-2)$ moment of the total photo-absorption cross section, $\sigma_{_{-2}}$ -- are inferred in terms of electric dipole and quadrupole matrix elements. These equations are valid for arbitrary angular momenta of the initial/ground and final/excited states and have been exploited in fully converged 1$\hbar\omega$ shell-model calculations of selected {\it p-} and {\it sd-}shell nuclei that consider configuration mixing; advancing previous knowledge from $^{17}$O to $^{36}$Ar, where thousands of electric dipole matrix elements are computed from isovector excitations which include the giant dipole resonance region. Our results are in reasonable agreement with previous shell-model calculations and follow -- except for $^{6,7}$Li and $^{17,18}$O -- Migdal's global trend provided by the combination of the hydrodynamic model and second-order non-degenerate perturbation theory. Discrepancies in $^{6,7}$Li and $^{17}$O arise as a result of the presence of $\alpha$-cluster configurations in odd-mass nuclei, whereas the disagreement in $^{18}$O comes from the mixing of intruder states, which is lacking in the shell-model interactions. More advanced \emph{ab initio} calculations of the dipole polarizability for low-lying excited states covering all the isovector states within the giant dipole resonance region are missing and could be very valuable to benchmark the results presented here and shed further light on how atomic nuclei polarize away from the ground state</description>

      <title>Quantum Fluctuations Driving the Generation and Strong Correlations of Fission Fragment Angular Momenta</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two critical issues in the study of the fission mechanism are how the fission fragment angular momenta (FFAM) develop dynamically from equilibrium and how they are correlated with each other. To this end, we construct a time-dependent generator coordinate method that incorporates crucial quantum fluctuations -- multiple rotations, vibrations, and their couplings -- based on covariant density functional theory, providing for the first time a global, microscopic, and dynamical study on the FFAM distribution. The calculated probability distributions of FFAM are in good agreement with the experimental measurements, and the sawtooth-like mass dependence of average FFAM is reproduced very well. It is noteworthy to find that the quantum fluctuations drive the generation and chaotic evolution of FFAM during fission fragment formation and induce the strong correlations of FFAM orientations at the small, medium, and large opening angles ($\phi_{\rm LH}\approx 30^{\rm o}$, $90^{\rm o}$, $160^{\rm o}$).</description>

      <title>Rapidity scan approach for net-baryon cumulants with a statistical thermal model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing rapidity-dependent measurements to map the QCD phase diagram provides a complementary approach to traditional beam-energy-dependent measurements around midrapidity. The changing nature of thermodynamic properties of QCD matter along the beam axis in heavy-ion collisions at low collision energies both motivates and poses challenges for this method. In this study, we derive the analytical cumulant-generating function for subsystems within distinct rapidity windows, while accounting for global net-baryon charge conservation of the full system. Rapidity-dependent net-baryon cumulants are then calculated for a system exhibiting inhomogeneity along the beam axis, and their sensitivity to finite acceptances through changing rapidity bin widths is explored. We highlight the nontrivial behaviors exhibited by these cumulants, underscoring their importance in establishing a noncritical baseline for interpreting net-proton cumulants in the search for the QCD critical point. Finally, we discuss the implications of the rapidity scan for mapping the QCD phase diagram within the current context.</description>

      <title>New aspect of chiral and axial breaking in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.12479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Violation of the $U(1)$ axial symmetry in QCD is stricter than the chiral $SU(2)$ breaking, simply because of the presence of the quantum axial anomaly. If the QCD gauge coupling is sent to zero, the strength of the $U(1)$ axial breaking coincides with that of the chiral $SU(2)$ breaking, which we shall in short call an axial-chiral coincidence. This coincidence is trivial since QCD then becomes a non-interacting theory. Actually, there exists another limit in the QCD parameter space, where an axial-chiral coincidence occurs even with nonzero QCD gauge coupling, that can be dubbed a nontrivial coincidence: it is the case with the massive light quarks $(m_l\neq 0)$ and the massless strange quark ($m_s=0$), due to the flavor-singlet nature of the topological susceptibility. This coincidence is robust and tied to the anomalous chiral Ward-Takahashi identity, which is operative even at hot QCD. This implies that the chiral $SU(2)$ symmetry is restored simultaneously with the $U(1)$ axial symmetry at high temperatures. This simultaneous restoration is independent of $m_l (\neq 0)$, hence is irrespective to the order of the chiral phase transition. In this paper, we discuss how the real-life QCD can be evolved from the nontrivial chiral-axial coincidence limit, by working on a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with the $U(1)$ axial anomaly contribution properly incorporated. It is shown that at high temperatures the large differences between the restorations of the chiral $SU(2)$ symmetry and the $U(1)$ axial symmetry for two light quarks and a sufficiently large current mass for the strange quark is induced by a significant interference of the topological susceptibility. Thus the deviation from the nontrivial coincidence, which is monitored by the strange quark mass controlling the topological susceptibility, provides a new way of understanding the chiral $SU(2)$ and $U(1)$ axial breaking in QCD.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Transition Form Factors of Baryon Resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical advancements have led to significant progress in our understanding of the electromagnetic structure of nucleons ($N$), nucleon excitations ($N^\ast$), and other baryons. These breakthroughs have been made possible by the capabilities of modern facilities, enabling the induction of photo- and electro-excitation of nucleon resonances. Recent experimental advances have sparked notable developments in theoretical approaches. New theoretical methods have been tested and proven to be robust, marking the beginning of a new era in our understanding on baryons. We present a comprehensive review of progress in experimental data on $\gamma^\ast N \to N^\ast$ reactions. Additionally, we discuss various analyses and theoretical results. Some of these methods have matured in their predictive power, offering new perspectives on exotic hadrons with multiquark components. We place special emphasis on both the low-$Q^2$ and large-$Q^2$ regions to reinforce crucial physical constraints on observables that hold in these limits. Furthermore, we illustrate that the combination of lattice QCD with chiral effective field theory and quark models, respectively, proves beneficial in interpreting data and applying constraints within those different regimes. As a practical contribution and for future reference, we review the formulas for helicity amplitudes, multipole form factors and the relations between these two sets of functions for transitions to resonances with general spin $J \geq \frac{1}{2}$. These formulas are ubiquitous and play a pivotal role in experimental and theoretical studies on baryon structure. Notably, the multipole transition form factors for $J \ge \frac{3}{2}$ resonances serve as valuable tools to test perturbative QCD results in the large-$Q^2$ region, thanks to the correlations between electric and magnetic transition form factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to probe primordial inhomogeneity in hot and dense matter which could be realized in non-central heavy-ion collisions. Although the Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) interferometry is commonly used to infer the system size, the cluster size should be detected if substructures emerge in space. We demonstrate that a signal peak in the HBT two-particle correlation stands at the relative momentum corresponding to the spatial scale of pseudo one-dimensional modulation. We assess detectability using the data prepared by an event generator (AMPT model) with clustering implemented in the particle distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a method to compute the gravitational form factor $D(Q^2)$ in holographic QCD by exploiting the remarkable correspondence between semi-classical light-front QCD and semi-classical field theories in wrapped spacetime in 5D. The use of light-front holography bridges physics at large $Q^2$ as attained in light-front QCD and physics at small $Q^2$ where the coupling to scalar and tensor fields, i.e. glueballs, are dominant. As an application, we compute the $D$-term for the pion, and compare the results with recent lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Light-by-Light Scattering at Next-to-Leading Order in QCD and QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent experimental observation of Light-by-Light (LbL) scattering at the Large Hadron Collider has revived interest in this fundamental process, and especially of the accurate prediction of its cross-section, which we present here for the first time at Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) in both QCD and QED. We compare two radically different computational approaches, both exact in the fermion mass dependence, thus offering a strong cross-check of our results. The first approach is a fully analytic method to calculate compact and well-organized two-loop helicity amplitudes. The second one is entirely numerical and leverages the Local Unitarity construction. Our two calculations agree with each other and conclude that including the exact fermion mass contribution typically increases the size of the NLO corrections. Moreover, we find that the exact result converges slowly to the massless limit of the high-energy regime, thus emphasizing the importance of including the full mass dependence at NLO. We also compare our results with the ATLAS measurement of LbL in ultra-peripheral lead-lead collisions, and find that the inclusion of exact NLO corrections reduces, but does not eliminate, the existing tension with theoretical predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Green's functions $G_n=\langle\phi^n\rangle$ and their self-consistent equations admit analytic continuations to complex $n$. The indeterminacy of bootstrap problems can be resolved by the principle of minimal singularity. We use the harmonic oscillator to illustrate various aspects of the bootstrap analysis, such as the large $n$ expansion, matching conditions, exact quantization condition, and high energy asymptotic behavior. For the Hermitian quartic and non-Hermitian cubic oscillators, we revisit the $\phi^n$ trajectories at non-integer $n$ by the standard wave function formulation. The results are in agreement with the minimally singular solutions. Using the matching procedure, we obtain accurate solutions for anharmonic oscillators with higher powers. In particular, the existence of $G_n$ with non-integer $n$ allows us to bootstrap the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant oscillators with non-integer powers.</description>

      <title>Neural Simulation-Based Inference of the Neutron Star Equation of State directly from Telescope Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a unique opportunity to study strongly interacting matter under extreme density conditions. The intricacies of matter inside neutron stars and their equation of state are not directly visible, but determine bulk properties, such as mass and radius, which affect the star's thermal X-ray emissions. However, the telescope spectra of these emissions are also affected by the stellar distance, hydrogen column, and effective surface temperature, which are not always well-constrained. Uncertainties on these nuisance parameters must be accounted for when making a robust estimation of the equation of state. In this study, we develop a novel methodology that, for the first time, can infer the full posterior distribution of both the equation of state and nuisance parameters directly from telescope observations. This method relies on the use of neural likelihood estimation, in which normalizing flows use samples of simulated telescope data to learn the likelihood of the neutron star spectra as a function of these parameters, coupled with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to efficiently sample from the corresponding posterior distribution. Our approach surpasses the accuracy of previous methods, improves the interpretability of the results by providing access to the full posterior distribution, and naturally scales to a growing number of neutron star observations expected in the coming years.</description>
