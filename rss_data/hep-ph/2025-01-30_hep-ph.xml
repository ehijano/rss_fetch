      <title>Energy Correlators Beyond Angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy correlators are theoretically simple and physically intuitive observables that bridge experimental and theoretical particle physics. They have for example enabled the most precise jet substructure determination of the strong coupling constant to date, and recent proposals suggest that they may be used to precisely determine of the top quark mass with calculable, small theoretical uncertainties. However, existing energy correlators all measure correlations in angles between particles, from which other observables such as mass must be inferred through potentially complicated procedures. In this work, we generalize energy correlators to enable straightforward measurements of non-angular correlations, which we call Energy Weighted Observable Correlations (EWOCs). To enforce collinear safety, EWOCs quantify correlations between subjets rather than particles. The subjet radius can be tuned to control both the physical scales probed by EWOCs and their sensitivity to non-perturbative physics. We focus on the phenomenologically relevant example of the mass EWOC, which measures mass correlations between pairs of subjets, in the task of extracting mass scales from jets. In jet substructure determinations of the mass of a hadronically-decaying W boson, we show that the mass EWOC outperforms the angle-based energy correlator, and performs comparably to the soft-drop groomed jet mass. As a first exploration of the theoretical properties of EWOCs, we also calculate the mass EWOC on light-quark jets and compare to results obtained with Pythia.</description>

      <title>QCD Theory meets Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel technique to incorporate precision calculations from quantum chromodynamics into fully differential particle-level Monte-Carlo simulations. By minimizing an information-theoretic quantity subject to constraints, we achieve consistency with the theory input and its estimated systematic uncertainties. Our method can be applied to arbitrary observables known from precision calculations, including multiple observables simultaneously. It generates strictly positive weights, thus offering a clear path to statistically powerful and theoretically precise computations for current and future collider experiments. As a proof of concept, we apply our technique to event-shape observables at electron-positron colliders, leveraging existing precision calculations of thrust. Our analysis highlights the importance of logarithmic moments of event shapes, which have not been previously studied in the collider physics literature.</description>

      <title>A universal bound on the duration of a kination era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that primordial adiabatic curvature fluctuations generate an instability of the scalar field sourcing a kination era. We demonstrate that the generated higher Fourier modes constitute a radiation-like component dominating over the kination background after about $11$ e-folds of cosmic expansion. Current constraints on the extra number of neutrino flavors $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ thus imply the observational bound of approximately 10 e-folds, representing the most stringent bound to date on the stiffness of the equation of state of the pre-Big-Bang-Nucleosynthesis universe.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Moduli and Non-perturbative Production of Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological moduli generically come to dominate the energy density of the early universe, and thereby trigger an early matter dominated era. Such non-standard cosmological histories are expected to have profound effects on the evolution and production of axion cold dark matter and dark radiation, as well as their prospects for detection. We consider moduli-axion couplings and investigate the early history of the coupled system, considering closely the evolution of the homogeneous modulus field, the back-reaction from the axion, and the energy densities of the two fields. A particular point of interest is the enhancement of axion production from modulus decay, due to tachyonic and parametric resonant instabilities, and the implications of such production on the cosmological moduli problem, axion dark radiation, and the available parameter space for axion dark matter. Using an effective field theory approach, WKB-based semi-analytical analysis, and detailed numerical estimates of the co-evolution of the system, we evaluate the expected decay efficiency of the modulus to axions. The effects of higher-order operators are studied and implications for UV-complete frameworks such as the Large Volume Scenarios in Type IIB string theory are considered in detail.</description>

      <title>Freezing-in the Pure Dark Axion Portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $Z_2$ symmetry under which "dark'' and "visible'' fields transform differently can further seclude already dark particles. In a dark sector consisting of an axion-like particle and a dark photon the dominant interaction can then be via a dark photon-axion portal to the ordinary photon. If the axion is lighter than the dark photon it naturally emerges as a viable dark matter candidate. We explore its freeze-in production both in a standard high reheating temperature and weak coupling as well as a low reheating temperature and strong coupling regime. Cosmological constraints are taken into account to identify viable regions in parameter space. For the strong freeze-in regime, we highlight the possibility of probing it at B-factories. We also briefly discuss a potential misalignment contribution to the dark matter density and delineate under which conditions it can be neglected.</description>

      <title>Two-body charmed baryon nonleptonic weak decays with decuplet baryon involving SU(3) breaking effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the singly charmed baryon two-body decays of $\mathbf{B}_c \rightarrow \mathbf{B}_D P$ under $SU(3)_{F}$ flavor symmetry, where ${\bf B}_{c}$ refers to anti-triplet singly charmed baryons, and ${\bf B}_{D}$ and $P$ denote decuplet baryons and pseudoscalar mesons, respectively. Compared to the literature, we adopt a concise and reasonable treatment of the $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry breaking, by considering the final-state mass dependence of partial waves. With 4 real parameters in total and 9 experimental data points, we achieve a minimal $\chi^2/\text{d.o.f.} $ value of $ 1.46$, providing a satisfactory explanation to the experiment results. We evaluate the branching ratios and Lee-Yang parameters suggesting the absence of the strong phase in $\mathbf{B}_c \rightarrow \mathbf{B}_D P$, along with an unusual positive decay asymmetry $\alpha\,(\Xi_{c}^{0}\rightarrow \Omega^{-}K^{+})$. The predicted results of large $SU(3)_{F}$ breaking effects in $\mathbf{B}_c \rightarrow \mathbf{B}_D P$ can be verified in the further research by the experiments at BESIII, Belle-II and LHCb.</description>

      <title>Exploring Dimuon Higgs Decay in an Extended Scotogenic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dimuon Higgs decay $h \to \mu^+\mu^-$ in the context of an extended Scotogenic model. The model introduces a singlet complex scalar in addition to the standard Scotogenic scalar doublet and singlet fermions, charged under a dark $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. By exploring the one-loop contributions, we show that the model allows for sizable deviations in the Higgs dimuon decay rate, quantified by the quotient $R_{\mu\mu} = \text{Br}(h \to \mu^+\mu^-)/\text{Br}(h \to \mu^+\mu^-)_{\text{SM}}$. Crucially, these deviations comply with experimental limits, including those on $\text{Br}(\mu^{+} \to e^{+}\gamma)$ and $\text{Br}(h \to \gamma\gamma)$. Such deviations can be tested and constrained by future precision measurements at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Transverse momentum distributions at large-$x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the collinear matching of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distributions at large values of $x$, computing and resumming the leading large-$x$ asymptotics for matching coefficients. The large-$x$ resummation is done directly within TMD distributions, ensuring the process-independence of the result. The derived resummation formulas are valid for all TMD distributions (except the pretzelosity). Their application improves perturbative convergence, provides practical estimation for unknown higher-order contributions, and sets restrictions for the nonperturbative part of models. Using the known anomalous dimensions, resummation can reach N$^3$LL, often exceeding the accuracy of known coefficient functions.</description>

      <title>The highest energy cosmic rays from superheavy dark matter particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is commonly accepted that high energy cosmic rays up to $10^{19}$ eV can be produced in catastrophic astrophysical processes. However the source of a few observed events with higher energies remains mysterious. We propose that they may originate from decay or annihilation of ultra heavy particles of dark matter. Such particles naturally appear in some models of modified gravity related to Starobinsky inflation.</description>

      <title>Charge diffusion in second-order relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics with momentum-dependent relaxation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores charge diffusion in relativistic hydrodynamics using kinetic theory with a modified collision kernel that incorporates the momentum dependence of the particle relaxation time. Starting from the Boltzmann equation within the extended relaxation time approximation (ERTA), we derive second-order evolution equations for the dissipative charge current and calculate the associated transport coefficients. The sensitivity of transport coefficients to the particle momentum dependence of the collision time scale of the microscopic interactions in the hot QCD medium is analyzed. For a conformal charge-conserved system, we compare the ERTA-modified transport coefficients for particle diffusion with exact results derived from scalar field theory. With an appropriate parameterization of the relaxation time, we demonstrate the consistency of our analysis and assess the degree of agreement of the results with the exact solutions. The relaxation times for the shear and number diffusion modes are seen to be distinct in general when the momentum dependence of the relaxation time is taken into consideration.</description>

      <title>Light Higgs in the Georgi Machacek Model: neutral or charged?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC, as well as the LEP and Tevatron, observed the existence of a light SM-like Higgs boson with mass about 95 GeV. These experiments also record the evidences of a light charged Higgs boson with mass less than the top-quark mass. The Georgi-Machacek (GM) model consists of six charged Higgs, one CP-odd and one CP-even Higgs besides the SM Higgs and the SM-like Higgs bosons. Considering the theoretical constraints along with the $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV Higgs signal strengths, this paper shows that the presence of the 95 GeV SM-like Higgs boson disfavours the presence of the other eight low-mass (below $160$ GeV) Higgs. This also triggers a high triplet vev above $40$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Updated constraints on triplet vev in the Georgi Machacek model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Georgi-Machacek model containing singly as well as doubly charged Higgs bosons besides more than one neutral Higgs bosons preserves the custodial symmetry at the tree level. In addition to the doublet vacuum expectation value (vev) $v_1$ this model has one triplet vev $v_2$, which was most strongly bounded from the above as a function of the custodial triplet mass $m_3$ previously by the $b \rightarrow s \gamma$ data. The observed data from the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC for $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV for the channels $p p \rightarrow t \bar{t}$, $t \rightarrow H^+ b$, $H^+ \rightarrow c\bar{s}$, $\tau^+ \nu_{\tau}$ for the low mass charged Higgs set new limits on the triplet vev as a function of light charged Higgs boson afterward. Subsequent ATLAS data for the decay $H^{\pm} \rightarrow \tau^{\pm} \nu_{\tau}$ updates the limit on $v_2$ from the above as a function of $m_3$. The present above limits on $v_2$ is now updated to $6.3 - 13.1$ GeV from the previous value of $7.8 - 17.4$ GeV for the light custodial triplet mass $m_3$ ranging from $130$ to $160$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Multi-Lepton Jets from Quadruple $Z'$ via the Higgs Decay at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate multi-lepton jet events from the decay of the 125 GeV Higgs boson ($h$) into quadruple new gauge bosons $(Z')$ at the LHC. Such an exotic decay is realized via the process of $h \to \phi \phi \to Z'Z'Z'Z'$ with new scalar boson $\phi$ in models with an additional $U(1)$ gauge symmetry. Charged leptons coming from the $Z'$ decay tend to be observed as lepton-jets rather than isolated leptons when the masses of $Z'$ and $\phi$ are smaller than ${\cal O}$(10) GeV, because of the highly-boosted effects. Performing the signal and background analyses, we find that the branching ratio of $h \to 4Z'$ is maximally constrained to be smaller than of order $10^{-6}$ ($10^{-7}$) by using the muonic-lepton jets assuming the integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$ (3000 fb$^{-1}$) at LHC. For lighter $Z'$ ($&lt; 2m_\mu$), we can use the electronic-lepton jets instead of the muon-jets, by which the upper limit on the branching ratio is obtained to be of order $10^{-6}$-$10^{-5}$. These bounds can be converted into the constraint on model parameters such as a mixing angle between $h$ and $\phi$. It is shown that stronger bounds on the mixing angle are obtained in the dark photon case as compared with the previous constraints given by flavor experiments and the Higgs decay $h \to Z'Z'$ in the mass range of $m_{Z'}\lesssim 10$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Heavy-hadron production based on $k_t$-factorization with scale-dependent fragmentation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of heavy-hadron production, including $D$ and $B$ mesons, heavy baryons, and the $B_c$ meson. Our calculations are based on the $k_t$-factorization and scale-dependent fragmentation functions, completing the program of implementing this formalism within a variable-flavor-number scheme, as initiated in Ref. Phys.Rev.D 104 (2021) 9. Special emphasis is placed on the gluon-to-heavy-hadron contribution, which improves the description of data at small transverse momenta. Finally, we explore and compare different factorization schemes. We achieve the non-trivial task of providing a reasonable description of all the data considered in this study with a factorization scheme fixed once and for all.</description>

      <title>Bottom quark forward-backward asymmetry at the future electron-positron collider FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) prediction for the \PZ-boson pole $b$-quark forward-backward (FB) asymmetry is: $(A_{FB}^{0,b})_{th} = 0.1030 \pm 0.0002$. The LEP electron-positron collider measured instead $A_{FB}^{0,b} = 0.0992 \pm 0.0016$, value which presents the largest discrepancy with any of the SM predictions as of today. All the $A_{FB}^b$ measurements performed at LEP suffered however of an important statistical uncertainty and of different sources of systematic uncertainties. This study shows that the proposed high-luminosity electron-positron collider FCC-ee, collecting orders of magnitude more data at the \PZ-pole than LEP, will significantly reduce the statistical uncertainties on the measurement of $A_{FB}^{0,b}$, thus allowing us to shed further light on this tension</description>

Abstract: The next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) pQCD predictions for both the decay width and the transition form factor in the $\eta_c\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ process, based on nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD), deviate from precise experimental measurements. These significant discrepancies have cast doubt on the applicability of NRQCD to charmonium processes. In this paper, we analyze the $\eta_c\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ process by applying the Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC), a systematic method for eliminating renormalization scheme and scale ambiguities. The PMC renormalization scales are determined by absorbing the non-conformal $\beta$ terms which govern the behavior of the QCD running coupling via the Renormalization Group Equation. We obtain the PMC scale $Q_\star=4.49\,m_c$ for the $\eta_c\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ decay width. The resulting value for $\Gamma_{\eta_c\rightarrow \gamma\gamma}$ is in good agreement with the Particle Data Group's reported value of $\Gamma_{\eta_c\rightarrow \gamma\gamma}=5.1\pm0.4$ keV. Moreover, the transition form factor obtained using the PMC is also in good agreement with precise experimental measurements. The application of the PMC provides a rigorous solution for the $\eta_c\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ puzzle and supports the applicability of NRQCD to charmonium processes.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of true muonium observation in Belle-II existing dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: True muonium ($\mu^+\mu^-$) is one of the cleanest bound states, being composed only of leptons, along with true tauonium and positronium. Unlike the latter, true muonium and true tauonium have not been observed so far. This article shows that the spin-0 state of true muonium (para-TM), decaying into two photons, can be observed at a discovery level of significance in the dataset already collected by the Belle-II experiment at the $\Upsilon (4S)$ peak, with certain assumptions on systematic uncertainties. Para-TM is produced via photon-photon fusion, and its observation is based on the detection of the photon pair resulting from its decay, on top of the continuum background due predominantly to light-by-light scattering. Trigger, acceptance and isolation cuts, along with calorimeter resolution and reconstruction efficiency, are taken into account during the Monte Carlo simulation of both signal and background. In order to separate signal and background, a machine learning method, based on extremely randomized trees, is trained on simulated events. Finally, the expected statistical significance of TM observation is evaluated, taking into account systematic uncertainties in a parametric fashion.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of the Critical Endpoint in 2+1-Flavor System from Holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian holographic model constructed by integrating the equation of state and baryon number susceptibility at zero chemical potential from lattice QCD. The model incorporates error estimates derived from lattice data. With this model, we systematically investigate the thermodynamic properties of the 2+1-flavor QCD system. Using Bayesian Inference, we perform precise calibration of the model parameters and determined the critical endpoint (CEP) position under the maximum a posterior (MAP) estimation to be $(T^{c},\mu_{B}^{c})=(0.0859\;\mathrm{GeV},0.742\;\mathrm{GeV})$. Additionally, we predict the CEP positions within 68\% and 95\% confidence levels, yielding $(T^{c},\; \mu_{B}^{c})_{68\%}$=$(0.0820\text{-}0.0889, 0.71\text{-}0.77)\;\mathrm{GeV}$ and $(T^{c},\; \mu_{B}^{c})_{95\%}$=$(0.0816\text{-}0.0898,\; 0.71\text{-}0.79)\;\mathrm{GeV}$, respectively. Moreover, to validate the reliability and predictive power of our approach, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between our predictions and potential CEP locations proposed by other theoretical models. This work not only establishes a novel Bayesian framework for holographic modeling but also provides valuable insights and theoretical support for exploring phase transitions in strongly-interacting matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Implications of the first CONUS+ measurement of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CONUS+ collaboration has reported their first observation of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS).The experiment uses reactor electron antineutrinos and germanium detectors with recoil thresholds as low as $160~\mathrm{eV_{ee}}$. With an exposure of $347$ kg $\times$ d, the measurement was made with a statistical significance of $3.7 \sigma$. We explore several physics implications of this observation, both within the Standard Model and in the context of new physics. We focus on a determination of the weak mixing angle, non-standard and generalized neutrino interactions both with heavy and light mediators, neutrino magnetic moments, and the up-scattering of neutrinos into sterile fermions through the sterile dipole portal and new mediators. Our results highlight the r\^ole of reactor-based CE$\nu$NS experiments in probing a vast array of neutrino properties and new physics models.</description>

      <title>Direct Search signal of two-component Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do we know if the dark sector consists of more than one dark matter (DM) component is an important question, for which the answer is not very definite. In this article we study such a possibility in context of direct DM search. It was pointed out earlier in a model independent analysis that a kink in the nuclear recoil energy spectrum may indicate to the presence of two DM components. However, realising one such model was difficult due to experimental constraints. Here we propose and study a model containing a vector boson DM and a scalar DM, aided by a light scalar mediator, where a kink in the nuclear recoil spectrum arises after addressing individual relic densities, direct search limits, collider constraints and theoretical limits. We find out the allowed parameter space of the model and those regions likely to show such distinctive signal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adapt the Worldline Formalism to obtain resummed expressions for the effective action and the heat kernel of a quantum scalar field coupled to a Yukawa background. The resummation includes all the invariants built from powers, first derivatives and second derivatives of the latter. Using such results, we compute the instability of the vacuum computing the vacuum persistence amplitude and the corresponding Schwinger pair production probability. We show that the inclusion of an additional, rapidly varying background can greatly enhance the production of pairs.</description>

      <title>Relativistic chiral nuclear forces: status and prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding nuclear structure, reactions, and the properties of neutron stars from \textit{ab initio} calculations from the nucleon degrees of freedom has always been a primary goal of nuclear physics, in which the microscopic nuclear force serves as the fundamental input. So far, the Weinberg chiral nuclear force, first proposed by the Nobel laureate Weinberg, has become the \textit{de facto} standard input for nuclear \textit{ab initio} studies. However, compared to their non-relativistic counterparts, relativistic \textit{ab initio} calculations, which describe better nuclear observables, have only begun. The lack of modern relativistic nucleon-nucleon interactions is an important issue restricting their development. In this work, we briefly review the development and status of the Weinberg chiral nuclear force, as well as its limitations. We further present a concise introduction to the relativistic chiral nuclear force, show its description of the scattering phase shifts and observables such as differential cross sections, and demonstrate its unique features. Additionally, we show that the relativistic framework could be naturally extended to the antinucleon-nucleon interaction.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$(1405) in the flavor SU(3) limit using a separable potential in the HAL QCD method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the HAL QCD method, we investigate S-wave meson-baryon interactions in singlet and two octet channels in the flavor SU(3) limit, where the chiral unitary model predicts that a combination of bound-state poles in these channels corresponds to $\Lambda(1405)$. To avoid the singular behavior of the leading-order potentials of these channels in the derivative expansion, we instead employ a separable potential in the time-dependent HAL QCD method. To calculate all-to-all propagators in the three-point correlation functions including $\Lambda$-baryon source operators with zero momentum, we employ the conventional stochastic estimation combined with the covariant approximation averaging. Separable potentials both in the singlet and octet channels show attraction without singular behavior. Our results of the corresponding phase shifts indicate that the attractive interaction in the singlet channel is stronger than that in the octet. Binding energies are consistent with the estimates from the two-point correlation function within one (two) sigma for the singlet (octet) channel, and this ordering of binding energies is consistent with the mass hierarchy suggested by the chiral unitary model.</description>

      <title>Resolving the critical bubble in SU(8) deconfinement transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly coupled confining models with a first order phase transition present an interesting DM candidate. Near the critical temperature these models are strongly non-perturbative, and the critical bubble nucleation rate has so far only been estimated via approximative methods. As a model of a strong first order deconfinement transition, we simulate 4D SU(8) pure gauge model with multicanonical Monte Carlo. We demonstrate that resolving the critical bubble is possible in a strongly coupled model. We calculate the free energy of a critical bubble, which gives a rough upper limit for the nucleation rate. For the parameter points we investigated, the thin-wall approximation for the critial bubble free energy is off by a factor of 2, overestimating the rate at least by a factor of $e^{10}$.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Effects of Mass Dependence in Spontaneous Collapse Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) model predicts a quadratic mass scaling of its effects but a linear scaling might be more natural according to some Poissonian spontaneous collapse models. Here, we first generalize the CSL master equation so that its mass dependence is a generic function of the mass and show that two key properties, namely compoundation invariance and the decoupling of center-of-mass motion from internal motion, remain valid. Then, by focusing on mass dependence as a power of the mass, we derive approximate formulas for the dynamics of single particles, rigid bodies, and radiation emission. Finally, we explore how the existing lower and upper bounds for the standard CSL translate to this generalized version, finding that a higher mass dependence is unlikely, while a lower one significantly broadens the range of allowed parameters.</description>

Abstract: The four-gluon one-particle irreducible Green function contributes to various quantities with phenomenological relevance. An example where the four-gluon plays a role is the determination of the gluon propagator, a basic building block for QCD, using continuum methods. This four leg Green function is poorly known and we are only starting to grasp its non-perturbative structure. Here, we report on the computation of the one-particle irreducible four-gluon Green function, in the Landau gauge, with lattice simulations. Besides stating the problems associated with the computation, several form factors that characterise this Green function are measured.</description>

      <title>A Two-Step Procedure to Detect Cosmological Gravitational Wave Backgrounds with Next-Generation Terrestrial Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds are an exciting science target for next-generation ground-based detectors, as they encode invaluable information about the primordial Universe. However, any such background is expected to be obscured by the astrophysical foreground from compact-binary coalescences. We propose a novel framework to detect a cosmological gravitational-wave background in the presence of binary black holes and binary neutron star signals with next-generation ground-based detectors, including Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. Our procedure involves first removing all the individually resolved binary black hole signals by notching them out in the time-frequency domain. Then, we perform joint Bayesian inference on the individually resolved binary neutron star signals, the unresolved binary neutron star foreground, and the cosmological background. For a flat cosmological background, we find that we can claim detection at $5\,\sigma$ level when $\Omega_\mathrm{ref}\geqslant 2.7\times 10^{-12}/\sqrt{T_\mathrm{obs}/\mathrm{yr}}$, where $T_\mathrm{obs}$ is the observation time (in years), which is within a factor of $\lesssim2$ from the sensitivity reached in absence of these astrophysical foregrounds.</description>

      <title>Single versus multifield scalar potentials from string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the properties of string effective theories with scalar field(s) and a scalar potential. We first claim that in most examples known, such theories are multifield, with at least 2 non-compact field directions; the few counter-examples appear to be very specific and isolated. Such a systematic multifield situation has important implications for cosmology. Characterising properties of the scalar potential $V$ is also more delicate in a multifield setting. We provide several examples of string effective theories with $V&gt;0$, where the latter admits an asymptotically flat direction along an off-shell field trajectory: in other words, there exists a limit $\varphi \rightarrow \infty$ for which $\frac{|\partial_{\varphi} V|}{V} \rightarrow 0$. It is thus meaningless to look for a lower bound to this single field quantity in a multifield setting; the complete gradient $\nabla V$ is then better suited. Restricting to on-shell trajectories, this question remains open, especially when following the steepest descent or more generally a gradient flow evolution. Interestingly, single field statements in multifield theories seem less problematic for $V&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>Inequivalence between the Euclidean and Lorentzian versions of the type IIB matrix model from Lefschetz thimble calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The type IIB matrix model is conjectured to describe superstring theory nonperturbatively in terms of ten $N \times N$ bosonic traceless Hermitian matrices $A_\mu$ ($\mu=0, \ldots , 9$), whose eigenvalues correspond to $(9+1)$-dimensional space-time. Quite often, this model has been investigated in its Euclidean version, which is well defined although the ${\rm SO}(9,1)$ Lorentz symmetry of the original model is replaced by the ${\rm SO}(10)$ rotational symmetry. Recently, a well-defined model respecting the Lorentz symmetry has been proposed by gauge-fixing the Lorentz symmetry nonperturbatively using the Faddeev-Popov procedure. Here we investigate the two models by Monte Carlo simulations, overcoming the severe sign problem by the Lefschetz thimble method, in the case of matrix size $N=2$ omitting fermionic contributions. We add a quadratic term $\gamma \, \mathrm{tr} (A_\mu A^\mu)$ in the action and calculate the expectation values of rotationally symmetric (or Lorentz symmetric) observables as a function of the coefficient $\gamma$. Our results exhibit striking differences between the two models around $\gamma=0$ and in the $\gamma&gt;0$ region, associated with the appearance of different saddle points, clearly demonstrating their inequivalence against naive expectations from quantum field theory.</description>

Abstract: We present a lattice-QCD calculation of the masses and decay constants of the positive-parity heavy-strange mesons $D^*_{s0}$, $D_{s1}$, $B^*_{s0}$, and $B_{s1}$. The calculations are performed with domain-wall fermions for the light and strange quarks and an anisotropic clover action for the charm and bottom quarks. We use seven different RBC/UKQCD ensembles with pion masses ranging from a near-physical 139 MeV up to 431 MeV. We consider two different analysis types, with or without two-meson operators at the source. We observe the expected below-threshold ground states. The fits without the two-meson operators appear to be more stable, but may overestimate the ground-state energies, while preliminary fits with two-meson operators at the source only appear to underestimate the ground-state energies.</description>

Abstract: Using the expansion of Zubarev's density operator, we develop a linear response approach to study various spin physics in a locally equilibrated medium, particularly focusing on various polarization phenomena in heavy-ion collisions. Specifically, we connect familiar correlation functions and diagrammatic methods to the Zubarev formalism, enabling the use of established techniques like the Matsubara/imaginary time formalism to facilitate calculations. For a spin-1/2 particle, we re-derive its vector polarization using this Zubarev response approach, which exactly reproduces with our previous results based on Luttinger's method. For a spin-1 particle, we calculate the vector polarization and find the expected contributions from vorticity, temperature gradients, and shear, which are identical to those for spin-1/2 particles except for a factor of 4/3 as expected. For the tensor polarization and spin alignment of a spin-1 boson, we explicitly prove that the non-dissipative contribution is zero at leading order in gradients, and briefly reiterate our previous findings for the dissipative contribution with further discussions on several concerns. Additionally, we discuss several relevant subtleties and questions, including an alternative derivation for Zubarev response approach, the covariance issues of different spin density matrix definitions, a further explanation of slow and fast modes, the mode selection scheme, etc. We also discuss skeleton expansions, higher-order contributions, and non-perturbative methods, particularly their potential connection to lattice field theory. In summary, this work discusses the foundations and subtleties of Zubarev response approach, with specific examples from spin physics in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

Abstract: We study the sensitivity to longitudinal vector boson scattering at a 27, 50 and 100 TeV $pp$ collider using events containing two leptonically-decaying same-electric-charge $W$ bosons produced in association with two jets. Additionally, expected limits are set on doubly charged Higgs bosons produced via vector boson fusion processes and decaying to same-sign $W$ boson pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We here report on the progress of the HHH Workshop, that took place in Dubrovnik in July 2023. After the discovery of a particle that complies with the properties of the Higgs boson of the Standard Model, all Standard Model (SM) parameters are in principle determined. However, in order to verify or falsify the model, the full form of the potential has to be determined. This includes the measurement of the triple and quartic scalar couplings. We here report on ongoing progress of measurements for multi-scalar final states, with an emphasis on three SM-like scalar bosons at 125 GeV, but also mentioning other options. We discuss both experimental progress and challenges as well as theoretical studies and models that can enhance such rates with respect to the SM predictions</description>

      <title>Dual symmetries of dense isotopically and chirally asymmetric QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, the dual symmetries of dense quark matter phase diagram found in some massless three- and two-color NJL models in the mean field approximation have been shown to exist at a more fundamental level as a dual transformations of fields and chemical potentials leaving the Lagrangian invariant. As a result, the corresponding dual symmetries of the full phase diagram can be shown without any approximation. And it has been shown not only in the NJL models, but also in framework of two- and three-color massless QCD itself. This is quite interesting, since one might say that it is not very common to show something completely non-perturbatively in QCD.</description>

      <title>Exploring Particle Production and Thermal-Like Behavior through Quantum Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown a potential correlation between the entanglement of initial state partons in elementary particle collisions, as conceptualized by contemporary quantum and particle theory, and the final state multiplicity distribution of hadrons produced in experiments like those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It has been proposed that this relation between states can be demonstrated in a measurement of entropy. By showing equality between entanglement entropy in the initial state and thermodynamic entropy in the final state, we hope to demonstrate that not only is entanglement the driving mechanism behind matter generation, but also the thermal-like behavior seen in high energy particle collisions.</description>

      <title>Probing third-generation New Physics with $K\to \pi \nu\bar\nu$ and $B\to K^{(*)} \nu\bar\nu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent observation of the $K^+ \to \pi^+ \nu\bar\nu$ decay by NA62 is an important milestone in precision flavor physics. Together with evidence of $B^+ \to K^+\nu\bar\nu$ reported by Belle-II, they are the only FCNC decays involving third-family leptons where a precision close to the SM expectation has been reached. We study the implications of these recent results in the context of a new physics scenario aligned to the third generation, with an approximate $U(2)^5$ flavor symmetry acting on the light families. We find that the slight excess observed in both channels supports the hypothesis of non-standard TeV dynamics of this type, as also hinted at by other $B$-meson decays, consistently with bounds from colliders and electroweak observables. We further discuss how future improvements in precision could affect this picture, highlighting the discovery potential in these di-neutrino modes.</description>

      <title>NLO SMEFT Electroweak Corrections to Higgs Decays to 4 Leptons in the Narrow Width Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some of the most precise measurements of Higgs boson couplings are from the Higgs decays to 4 leptons, where deviations from the Standard Model predictions can be quantified in the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). In this work, we present a complete next-to-leading order (NLO) SMEFT electroweak calculation of the rate for $H\rightarrow \ell^+\ell^- Z$ which we combine with the NLO SMEFT result for $Z\rightarrow\ell^+\ell^-$ to obtain the NLO rate for the $H\rightarrow$ 4 lepton process in the narrow width approximation. The NLO calculation provides sensitivity to a wide range of SMEFT operators that do not contribute to the rate at lowest order and demonstrates the importance of including correlations between the effects of different operators when extracting limits on SMEFT parameters. We show that the extraction of the Higgs tri-linear coupling from the decay $H\rightarrow \ell^+ \ell^- Z, \ Z\rightarrow \ell^+\ell^-$ in the narrow width approximation strongly depends on the contributions of other operators that first occur at NLO.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory and inelastic dark matter results from XENON1T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we expand on the XENON1T nuclear recoil searches to study the individual signals of dark matter interactions from operators up to dimension-eight in a Chiral Effective Field Theory (ChEFT) and a model of inelastic dark matter (iDM). We analyze data from two science runs of the XENON1T detector totaling 1\,tonne$\times$year exposure. For these analyses, we extended the region of interest from [4.9, 40.9]$\,$keV$_{\text{NR}}$ to [4.9, 54.4]$\,$keV$_{\text{NR}}$ to enhance our sensitivity for signals that peak at nonzero energies. We show that the data is consistent with the background-only hypothesis, with a small background over-fluctuation observed peaking between 20 and 50$\,$keV$_{\text{NR}}$, resulting in a maximum local discovery significance of 1.7\,$\sigma$ for the Vector$\otimes$Vector$_{\text{strange}}$ ($VV_s$) ChEFT channel for a dark matter particle of 70$\,$GeV/c$^2$, and $1.8\,\sigma$ for an iDM particle of 50$\,$GeV/c$^2$ with a mass splitting of 100$\,$keV/c$^2$. For each model, we report 90\,\% confidence level (CL) upper limits. We also report upper limits on three benchmark models of dark matter interaction using ChEFT where we investigate the effect of isospin-breaking interactions. We observe rate-driven cancellations in regions of the isospin-breaking couplings, leading to up to 6 orders of magnitude weaker upper limits with respect to the isospin-conserving case.</description>

      <title>Domain wall interpretation of the PTA signal confronting black hole overproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17841v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations have detected a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nano-Hz frequencies, with Domain Wall networks (DWs) proposed as potential sources. To be cosmologically viable, they must annihilate before dominating the universe energy budget, thus generating a SGWB. While sub-horizon DWs shrink and decay rapidly, causality requires DWs with super-horizon size to continue growing until they reach the Hubble horizon. Those entering the latest can be heavier than a Hubble patch and collapse into Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). We conduct a Bayesian analysis of the PTA signal, interpreting it as an outcome of SGWB from DW networks, with a prior ensuring no PBH overproduction. Our findings indicate that DWs result in the production of solar-mass PBHs. The binary mergers occurring within these PBHs generate a second SGWB in the kilo-Hz domain which could be observable in on-going or planned Earth-based interferometers.</description>

      <title>Dwarf galaxies imply dark matter is heavier than $\mathbf{2.2 \times 10^{-21}} \, \mathbf{eV}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is widely established that a lower bound on the dark matter particle mass, $m$, can be obtained by demanding that the de Broglie wavelength in a given galaxy must be smaller than the virial radius of the galaxy, leading to $m\gtrsim 10^{-22}\text{ eV}$ when applied to typical dwarf galaxies. This lower limit has never been derived precisely or rigorously. We use stellar kinematical data for the Milky Way satellite galaxy Leo II to self-consistently reconstruct a statistical ensemble of dark matter wavefunctions and corresponding density profiles. By comparison to a data-driven, model-independent reconstruction, and using a variant of the maximum mean discrepancy as a statistical measure, we determine that a self-consistent description of dark matter in the local Universe requires $m&gt;2.2 \times 10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}\;\mathrm{(CL&gt;95\%)}$. This lower limit is free of any assumptions pertaining to cosmology, microphysics (including spin), or dynamics of dark matter, and only assumes that it is predominantly composed of a single bosonic particle species.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a semi-empirical formula (SEF) for calculating the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) for two-neutrino double-beta decay. The SEF's dependence on the proton and neutron numbers, the pairing, isospin, and deformation properties of the initial and final nuclei is inspired by the insights offered by nuclear many-body methods and trends in experimental data. Compared with the previous phenomenological and nuclear models, the SEF yields the best agreement with the experimental NMEs. Its stability and predictive power are cross-validated, and predictions are provided for nuclear systems of experimental interest.</description>

      <title>The Second-Level Preheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes two levels of preheating for the inflaton that is non-minimally coupled with gravity. The first level, later named by the quadratic regime, corresponds to the matter-dominated era and is responsible for draining the inflaton's energy density. The second level, which we will call the quartic regime, corresponds to the radiation-dominated era and is responsible for the reheating of the universe. We investigate the behavior of non-renormalizable higher dimension operators in both the quadratic and quartic regimes. In the quadratic regime, the preheating is also efficient, even though it is less than the lower dimension. On the other hand, the non-renormalizable higher dimension operators in the quartic regime are extremely inefficient. In our work, we also introduce a simple mechanism controlled by the characteristic momentum $\alpha$ to suppress the particle production during preheating. Additionally, we emphasized the significance of the small momentum of the particles produced during preheating for the abundance of primordial black holes. This result supports the efficient preheating in the quadratic regime. Finally, we evaluate two modes of the reheating temperature, which differ based on the preheating efficiency during the quadratic regime.</description>

      <title>Neutrino masses from large-scale structures: future sensitivity and theory dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the incoming years, cosmological surveys aim at measuring the sum of neutrino masses $\Sigma m_\nu$, complementing the determination of their mass ordering from laboratory experiments. In order to assess the full potential of large-scale structures (LSS), we employ state-of-the-art predictions from the effective field theory of LSS (EFTofLSS) at one loop to perform Fisher forecasts on the sensitivity (combining power spectrum and bispectrum) of ongoing and future surveys (DESI, MegaMapper) in combination with CMB measurements (Planck, Litebird and Stage-4). We find that the 1$\sigma$ sensitivity on $\Sigma m_\nu$ is expected to be 15 meV with Planck+DESI, and 7 meV with S4+MegaMapper, where $\sim 10\%$ and $30\%$ of the constraints are brought by the one-loop bispectrum respectively. To understand how robust are these bounds, we explore how they are relaxed when considering extensions to the standard model, dubbed `new physics'. We find that the shift induced on $\Sigma m_\nu$ by a $1\sigma$ shift on new physics parameters (we consider extra relativistic species, neutrino self-interactions, curvature or a time-evolving electron mass) could be $\mathcal O(10)$ meV for Planck+DESI, but it will be suppressed down to $\mathcal O(1)$ meV in S4+MegaMapper. Our study highlights the quantitative impact of including the bispectrum at one loop in the EFTofLSS, and the robustness of the sensitivity to $\Sigma m_\nu$ against potential new physics thanks to the synergy of cosmological probes.</description>

Abstract: Neutrino quantum kinetics is a rapidly evolving field in computational astrophysics, with a primary focus on collective neutrino oscillations in core-collapse supernovae and post-merger phases of binary neutron star mergers. In recent years, there has been considerable debate concerning resolution dependence in numerical simulations. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive resolution study in both angular- and spatial directions by using two independent schemes of quantum kinetic neutrino transport: finite volume and pseudospectral methods. We complement our discussion by linear stability analysis including inhomogeneous modes. Our result suggests that decreasing spatial resolutions underestimates the growth of flavor instability, and then leads to wrong asymptotic states of flavor conversions, which potentially has a critical impact on astrophysical consequences. We further delve into numerical results of low resolution simulations, that reveals the underlying mechanism responsible for numerical artifacts caused by insufficient resolutions. This study settles the debate on requirements of resolutions and serves as a guideline for numerical modeling of quantum kinetic neutrino transport.</description>

      <title>Impact of light sterile neutrinos on cosmological large scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos with masses on the $\mathrm{eV}$ scale are promising candidates to account for the origin of neutrino mass and the reactor neutrino anomalies. The mixing between sterile and active neutrinos in the early universe could result in a large abundance of relic sterile neutrinos, which depends on not only their physical mass $m_{\rm phy}$ but also their degree of thermalization, characterized by the extra effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Using neutrino-involved N-body simulations, we investigate the effects of sterile neutrinos on the matter power spectrum, halo pairwise velocity, and halo mass and velocity functions. We find that the presence of sterile neutrinos suppress the matter power spectrum and halo mass and velocity functions, but enhance the halo pairwise velocity. We also provide fitting formulae to quantify these effects.</description>
