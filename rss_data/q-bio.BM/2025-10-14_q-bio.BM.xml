      <title>A Hybrid Computational Intelligence Framework with Metaheuristic Optimization for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a leading cause of preventable adverse events, often complicating treatment and increasing healthcare costs. At the same time, knowing which drugs do not interact is equally important, as such knowledge supports safer prescriptions and better patient outcomes. In this study, we propose an interpretable and efficient framework that blends modern machine learning with domain knowledge to improve DDI prediction. Our approach combines two complementary molecular embeddings - Mol2Vec, which captures fragment-level structural patterns, and SMILES-BERT, which learns contextual chemical features - together with a leakage-free, rule-based clinical score (RBScore) that injects pharmacological knowledge without relying on interaction labels. A lightweight neural classifier is then optimized using a novel three-stage metaheuristic strategy (RSmpl-ACO-PSO), which balances global exploration and local refinement for stable performance. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the model achieves high predictive accuracy (ROC-AUC 0.911, PR-AUC 0.867 on DrugBank) and generalizes well to a clinically relevant Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus cohort. Beyond raw performance, studies show how embedding fusion, RBScore, and the optimizer each contribute to precision and robustness. Together, these results highlight a practical pathway for building reliable, interpretable, and computationally efficient models that can support safer drug therapies and clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models frequently suffer miscalibration, wherein class probabilities and other statistics of the sampling distribution deviate from desired values. We frame calibration as a constrained optimization problem and seek the closest model in Kullback-Leibler divergence satisfying calibration constraints. To address the intractability of imposing these constraints exactly, we introduce two surrogate objectives for fine-tuning: (1) the relax loss, which replaces the constraint with a miscalibration penalty, and (2) the reward loss, which converts calibration into a reward fine-tuning problem. We demonstrate that these approaches substantially reduce calibration error across hundreds of simultaneous constraints and models with up to one billion parameters, spanning applications in protein design, image generation, and language modeling.</description>

      <title>Protein as a Second Language for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deciphering the function of unseen protein sequences is a fundamental challenge with broad scientific impact, yet most existing methods depend on task-specific adapters or large-scale supervised fine-tuning. We introduce the "Protein-as-Second-Language" framework, which reformulates amino-acid sequences as sentences in a novel symbolic language that large language models can interpret through contextual exemplars. Our approach adaptively constructs sequence-question-answer triples that reveal functional cues in a zero-shot setting, without any further training. To support this process, we curate a bilingual corpus of 79,926 protein-QA instances spanning attribute prediction, descriptive understanding, and extended reasoning. Empirically, our method delivers consistent gains across diverse open-source LLMs and GPT-4, achieving up to 17.2% ROUGE-L improvement (average +7%) and even surpassing fine-tuned protein-specific language models. These results highlight that generic LLMs, when guided with protein-as-language cues, can outperform domain-specialized models, offering a scalable pathway for protein understanding in foundation models.</description>

      <title>RiboFlow: Conditional De Novo RNA Co-Design via Synergistic Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ribonucleic acid (RNA) binds to molecules to achieve specific biological functions. While generative models are advancing biomolecule design, existing methods for designing RNA that target specific ligands face limitations in capturing RNA's conformational flexibility, ensuring structural validity, and overcoming data scarcity. To address these challenges, we introduce RiboFlow, a synergistic flow matching model to co-design RNA structures and sequences based on target molecules. By integrating RNA backbone frames, torsion angles, and sequence features in an unified architecture, RiboFlow explicitly models RNA's dynamic conformations while enforcing sequence-structure consistency to improve validity. Additionally, we curate RiboBind, a large-scale dataset of RNA-molecule interactions, to resolve the scarcity of high-quality structural data. Extensive experiments reveal that RiboFlow not only outperforms state-of-the-art RNA design methods by a large margin but also showcases controllable capabilities for achieving high binding affinity to target ligands. Our work bridges critical gaps in controllable RNA design, offering a framework for structure-aware, data-efficient generation.</description>

      <title>AbBiBench: A Benchmark for Antibody Binding Affinity Maturation and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike previous strategies that evaluate antibodies in isolation, typically by comparing them to natural sequences with metrics such as amino acid recovery rate or structural RMSD, AbBiBench instead treats the antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as the fundamental unit. It evaluates an antibody design's binding potential by measuring how well a protein model scores the full Ab-Ag complex. We first curate, standardize, and share more than 184,500 experimental measurements of antibody mutants across 14 antibodies and 9 antigens-including influenza, lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, Ang2, and SARS-CoV-2-covering both heavy-chain and light-chain mutations. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 15 protein models including masked language models, autoregressive language models, inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph models by comparing the correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity values. Additionally, to demonstrate AbBiBench's generative utility, we apply it to antibody F045-092 in order to introduce binding to influenza H1N1. We sample new antibody variants with the top-performing models, rank them by the structural integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex, and assess them with in vitro ELISA binding assays. Our findings show that structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified, biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of more effective, function-aware antibody design models.</description>

      <title>Superior Molecular Representations from Intermediate Encoder Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pretrained molecular encoders have become indispensable in computational chemistry for tasks such as property prediction and molecular generation. However, the standard practice of relying solely on final-layer embeddings for downstream tasks may discard valuable information. In this work, we first analyze the information flow in five diverse molecular encoders and find that intermediate layers retain more general-purpose features, whereas the final-layer specializes and compresses information. We then perform an empirical layer-wise evaluation across 22 property prediction tasks. We find that using frozen embeddings from optimal intermediate layers improves downstream performance by an average of 5.4%, up to 28.6%, compared to the final-layer. Furthermore, finetuning encoders truncated at intermediate depths achieves even greater average improvements of 8.5%, with increases as high as 40.8%, obtaining new state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks. These findings highlight the importance of exploring the full representational depth of molecular encoders to achieve substantial performance improvements and computational efficiency. The code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Engineering Supercomputing Platforms for Biomolecular Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A range of computational biology software (GROMACS, AMBER, NAMD, LAMMPS, OpenMM, Psi4 and RELION) was benchmarked on a representative selection of HPC hardware, including AMD EPYC 7742 CPU nodes, NVIDIA V100 and AMD MI250X GPU nodes, and an NVIDIA GH200 testbed. The raw performance, power efficiency and data storage requirements of the software was evaluated for each HPC facility, along with qualitative factors such as the user experience and software environment. It was found that the diversity of methods used within computational biology means that there is no single HPC hardware that can optimally run every type of HPC job, and that diverse hardware is the only way to properly support all methods. New hardware, such as AMD GPUs and Nvidia AI chips, are mostly compatible with existing methods, but are also more labour-intensive to support. GPUs offer the most efficient way to run most computational biology tasks, though some tasks still require CPUs. A fast HPC node running molecular dynamics can produce around 10GB of data per day, however, most facilities and research institutions lack short-term and long-term means to store this data. Finally, as the HPC landscape has become more complex, deploying software and keeping HPC systems online has become more difficult. This situation could be improved through hiring/training in DevOps practices, expanding the consortium model to provide greater support to HPC system administrators, and implementing build frameworks/containerisation/virtualisation tools to allow users to configure their own software environment, rather than relying on centralised software installations.</description>

      <title>Quantification of protein homodimer affinity using native mass spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological processes rely on finely tuned homo- and heteromeric interactions between (biomacro)molecules. The strength of an interaction, typically given by the dissociation constant (KD), plays a crucial role in basic research and must be monitored throughout the development of drugs and agrochemicals. An ideal method for KD determination is applicable to various analytes with a large range of affinities, tolerates complex matrix compositions, does not require labeling, and simultaneously provides information on the structural integrity of the binding partners. Native mass spectrometry meets these criteria but typically struggles with homooligomeric complexes due to overlapping mass signals. To overcome this, we resolve monomer/dimer contributions to overlapping MS-peaks by separately analyzing the charge state distribution of each oligomeric species via sample dilution and covalent crosslinking. Following this approach, we show that quantitative Laser-Induced Liquid Bead Ion Desorption mass spectrometry (qLILBID-MS) accurately captures the affinities of Bovine Serum Albumin and chemically induced dimers of Tryparedoxin, an oxidoreductase from human pathogenic Trypanosoma brucei parasites, with various molecular glues and homodimer affinities. Conveniently, qLILBID-MS requires a fraction of sample used by other methods such as isothermal titration calorimetry and yields previously inaccessible protein homodimer KDs in the high micromolar range, which allowed us to monitor the gradual decrease in homodimer affinity via mutation of crucial dimer interface contacts. Overall, qLILBID-MS is a sensitive, robust, fast, scalable, and cost-effective alternative to quantify protein/protein interactions that can accelerate contemporary drug discovery workflows, e.g. the efficient screening for proximity inducing molecules like proteolysis targeting chimera and molecular glues.</description>
