      <title>Desarrollo de competencias STEM mediante la programaci\'on de modelos de auto-organizaci\'on</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents an educational proposal based on the computational implementation of a model of interaction between particles of different types, as a tool for the development of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) skills. The mathematical formulation of the model, the equations governing particle interaction, the interaction matrix that governs collective behavior, and a complete pseudocode of the simulation algorithm are detailed. The article discusses how this interdisciplinary project enables students to apply and connect knowledge from physics, mathematics, programming, and systems thinking, fostering skills such as computational thinking, mathematical modeling, and understanding of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Neuroqueering Physics Literacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neurodivergent people experience the world, conceptualize scientific concepts, and engage with meaning-making differently than their neurotypical peers. When these differences are actualized in an institutional setting, such as higher education, conflict can arise which has a disabling effect on them. One such way this conflict can arise is through defining and subsequent assessment of scientific literacy, as we define scientific literacy through a neurotypical lens. There is much literature on how to better teach neurodivergent students to succeed in a neurotypical-normative scientific environment, however very little research exists which examines what neurodivergent differences in learning look like from these students' perspectives. I here present a case study of five neurodivergent physicists as a part of a broader study on neurodiversity in physics, explaining why it is imperative to redefine scientific literacy and reorient it to a neuroqueer standpoint.</description>
