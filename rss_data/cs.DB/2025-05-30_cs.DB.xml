      <title>TailorSQL: An NL2SQL System Tailored to Your Query Workload</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NL2SQL (natural language to SQL) translates natural language questions into SQL queries, thereby making structured data accessible to non-technical users, serving as the foundation for intelligent data applications. State-of-the-art NL2SQL techniques typically perform translation by retrieving database-specific information, such as the database schema, and invoking a pre-trained large language model (LLM) using the question and retrieved information to generate the SQL query.
  However, existing NL2SQL techniques miss a key opportunity which is present in real-world settings: NL2SQL is typically applied on existing databases which have already served many SQL queries in the past. The past query workload implicitly contains information which is helpful for accurate NL2SQL translation and is not apparent from the database schema alone, such as common join paths and the semantics of obscurely-named tables and columns. We introduce TailorSQL, a NL2SQL system that takes advantage of information in the past query workload to improve both the accuracy and latency of translating natural language questions into SQL. By specializing to a given workload, TailorSQL achieves up to 2$\times$ improvement in execution accuracy on standardized benchmarks.</description>

      <title>LINEAGEX: A Column Lineage Extraction System for SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As enterprise data grows in size and complexity, column-level data lineage, which records the creation, transformation, and reference of each column in the warehouse, has been the key to effective data governance that assists tasks like data quality monitoring, storage refactoring, and workflow migration. Unfortunately, existing systems introduce overheads by integration with query execution or fail to achieve satisfying accuracy for column lineage. In this paper, we demonstrate LINEAGEX, a lightweight Python library that infers column level lineage from SQL queries and visualizes it through an interactive interface. LINEAGEX achieves high coverage and accuracy for column lineage extraction by intelligently traversing query parse trees and handling ambiguities. The demonstration walks through use cases of building lineage graphs and troubleshooting data quality issues. LINEAGEX is open sourced at https://github.com/sfu-db/lineagex and our video demonstration is at https://youtu.be/5LaBBDDitlw</description>

      <title>KVzip: Query-Agnostic KV Cache Compression with Context Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) cache context as key-value (KV) pairs during inference. As context length grows, KV cache sizes expand, leading to substantial memory overhead and increased attention latency. This paper introduces KVzip, a query-agnostic KV cache eviction method enabling effective reuse of compressed KV caches across diverse queries. KVzip quantifies the importance of a KV pair using the underlying LLM to reconstruct original contexts from cached KV pairs, subsequently evicting pairs with lower importance. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that KVzip reduces KV cache size by 3-4$\times$ and FlashAttention decoding latency by approximately 2$\times$, with negligible performance loss in question-answering, retrieval, reasoning, and code comprehension tasks. Evaluations include various models such as LLaMA3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-14B, and Gemma3-12B, with context lengths reaching up to 170K tokens. KVzip significantly outperforms existing query-aware KV eviction methods, which suffer from performance degradation even at a 90% cache budget ratio under multi-query scenarios.</description>

      <title>Towards Explainable Sequential Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper offers a hybrid explainable temporal data processing pipeline, DataFul Explainable MultivariatE coRrelatIonal Temporal Artificial inTElligence (EMeriTAte+DF), bridging numerical-driven temporal data classification with an event-based one through verified artificial intelligence principles, enabling human-explainable results. This was possible through a preliminary a posteriori explainable phase describing the numerical input data in terms of concurrent constituents with numerical payloads. This further required extending the event-based literature to design specification mining algorithms supporting concurrent constituents. Our previous and current solutions outperform state-of-the-art solutions for multivariate time series classifications, thus showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Verify-in-the-Graph: Entity Disambiguation Enhancement for Complex Claim Verification with Interactive Graph Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Claim verification is a long-standing and challenging task that demands not only high accuracy but also explainability of the verification process. This task becomes an emerging research issue in the era of large language models (LLMs) since real-world claims are often complex, featuring intricate semantic structures or obfuscated entities. Traditional approaches typically address this by decomposing claims into sub-claims and querying a knowledge base to resolve hidden or ambiguous entities. However, the absence of effective disambiguation strategies for these entities can compromise the entire verification process. To address these challenges, we propose Verify-in-the-Graph (VeGraph), a novel framework leveraging the reasoning and comprehension abilities of LLM agents. VeGraph operates in three phases: (1) Graph Representation - an input claim is decomposed into structured triplets, forming a graph-based representation that integrates both structured and unstructured information; (2) Entity Disambiguation -VeGraph iteratively interacts with the knowledge base to resolve ambiguous entities within the graph for deeper sub-claim verification; and (3) Verification - remaining triplets are verified to complete the fact-checking process. Experiments using Meta-Llama-3-70B (instruct version) show that VeGraph achieves competitive performance compared to baselines on two benchmarks HoVer and FEVEROUS, effectively addressing claim verification challenges. Our source code and data are available for further exploitation.</description>

      <title>Query, Don't Train: Privacy-Preserving Tabular Prediction from EHR Data via SQL Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain richly structured, longitudinal data essential for predictive modeling, yet stringent privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) often restrict access to individual-level records. We introduce Query, Don't Train (QDT): a structured-data foundation-model interface enabling tabular inference via LLM-generated SQL over EHRs. Instead of training on or accessing individual-level examples, QDT uses a large language model (LLM) as a schema-aware query planner to generate privacy-compliant SQL queries from a natural language task description and a test-time input. The model then extracts summary-level population statistics through these SQL queries and the LLM performs, chain-of-thought reasoning over the results to make predictions. This inference-time-only approach (1) eliminates the need for supervised model training or direct data access, (2) ensures interpretability through symbolic, auditable queries, (3) naturally handles missing features without imputation or preprocessing, and (4) effectively manages high-dimensional numerical data to enhance analytical capabilities. We validate QDT on the task of 30-day hospital readmission prediction for Type 2 diabetes patients using a MIMIC-style EHR cohort, achieving F1 = 0.70, which outperforms TabPFN (F1 = 0.68). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of LLM-driven, privacy-preserving structured prediction using only schema metadata and aggregate statistics - offering a scalable, interpretable, and regulation-compliant alternative to conventional foundation-model pipelines.</description>

      <title>KBQA-o1: Agentic Knowledge Base Question Answering with Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural language questions with a large-scale structured knowledge base (KB). Despite advancements with large language models (LLMs), KBQA still faces challenges in weak KB awareness, imbalance between effectiveness and efficiency, and high reliance on annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose KBQA-o1, a novel agentic KBQA method with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It introduces a ReAct-based agent process for stepwise logical form generation with KB environment exploration. Moreover, it employs MCTS, a heuristic search method driven by policy and reward models, to balance agentic exploration's performance and search space. With heuristic exploration, KBQA-o1 generates high-quality annotations for further improvement by incremental fine-tuning. Experimental results show that KBQA-o1 outperforms previous low-resource KBQA methods with limited annotated data, boosting Llama-3.1-8B model's GrailQA F1 performance to 78.5% compared to 48.5% of the previous sota method with GPT-3.5-turbo. Our code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Agent-UniRAG: A Trainable Open-Source LLM Agent Framework for Unified Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for unified retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems using the recent emerging large language model (LLM) agent concept. Specifically, Agent LLM, which utilizes LLM as fundamental controllers, has become a promising approach to enable the interpretability of RAG tasks, especially for complex reasoning question-answering systems (e.g., multi-hop queries). Nonetheless, previous works mainly focus on solving RAG systems with either single-hop or multi-hop approaches separately, which limits the application of those approaches to real-world applications. In this study, we propose a trainable agent framework called Agent-UniRAG for unified retrieval-augmented LLM systems, which enhances the effectiveness and interpretability of RAG systems. The main idea is to design an LLM agent framework to solve RAG tasks step-by-step based on the complexity of the inputs, simultaneously including single-hop and multi-hop queries in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we introduce SynAgent-RAG, a synthetic dataset to enable the proposed agent framework for small open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama-3-8B). The results show comparable performances with closed-source and larger open-source LLMs across various RAG benchmarks. Our source code and dataset are publicly available for further exploitation.</description>
