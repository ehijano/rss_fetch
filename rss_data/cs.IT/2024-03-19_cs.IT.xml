      <title>Near-Field Channel Modeling for Electromagnetic Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic information theory (EIT) is one of the important topics for 6G communication due to its potential to reveal the performance limit of wireless communication systems. For EIT, the research foundation is reasonable and accurate channel modeling. Existing channel modeling works for EIT in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenario focus on far-field modeling, which can not accurately capture the characteristics of the channel in near-field. In this paper, we propose the near-field channel model for EIT based on electromagnetic scattering theory. We model the channel by using non-stationary Gaussian random fields and derive the analytical expression of the correlation function of the fields. Furthermore, we analyze the characteristics of the proposed channel model, e.g., the sparsity of the model in wavenumber domain. Based on the sparsity of the model, we design a channel estimation scheme for near-field scenario. Numerical analysis verifies the correctness of the proposed scheme and shows that it can outperform existing schemes like least square (LS) and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP).</description>

      <title>Towards a Theory of Pragmatic Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subject generally known as ``information theory'' has nothing to say about how much meaning is conveyed by the information. Accordingly, we fill this gap with the first rigorously justifiable, quantitative definition of ``pragmatic information'' as the amount of information that becomes meaningful because it is used in making a decision. We posit that such information updates a ``state of the world'' random variable, $\omega$, that informs the decision. The pragmatic information of a single message is then defined as the Kulbach-Leibler divergence between the a priori and updated probability distributions of $\omega$, and the pragmatic information of a message ensemble is defined as the expected value of the pragmatic information values of the ensemble's component messages. We justify these definitions by showing, first, that the pragmatic information of a single message is the expected difference between the shortest binary encoding of $\omega$ under the {\it a priori} and updated probability distributions, and, second, that the average of the pragmatic values of individual messages, when sampled a large number of times from the ensemble, approaches its expected value.
  The resulting pragmatic information formulas have many hoped-for properties, such as non-negativity and additivity for independent decisions and ``pragmatically independent'' messages. We also sketch two applications of these formulas: The first is the single play of a slot machine, a.k.a. a ``one armed bandit'', with an unknown probability of payout; the second being the reformulation of the efficient market hypothesis of financial economics as the claim that the pragmatic information content of all available data about a given security is zero.</description>

      <title>Sparsity-Constrained Community-Based Group Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the sparsity-constrained community-based group testing problem, where the population follows a community structure. In particular, the community consists of $F$ families, each with $M$ members. A number $k_f$ out of the $F$ families are infected, and a family is said to be infected if $k_m$ out of its $M$ members are infected. Furthermore, the sparsity constraint allows at most $\rho_T$ individuals to be grouped in each test. For this sparsity-constrained community model, we propose a probabilistic group testing algorithm that can identify the infected population with a vanishing probability of error and we provide an upper-bound on the number of tests. When $k_m = \Theta(M)$ and $M \gg \log(FM)$, our bound outperforms the existing sparsity-constrained group testing results trivially applied to the community model. If the sparsity constraint is relaxed, our achievable bound reduces to existing bounds for community-based group testing. Moreover, our scheme can also be applied to the classical dilution model, where it outperforms existing noise-level-independent schemes in the literature.</description>

      <title>On the Salient Limitations of `On the Salient Limitations of the Methods of Assembly Theory and their Classification of Molecular Biosignatures'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assembly Theory (AT) is a theory that explains how to determine if a complex object is the product of evolution. Here we explain why attempts to compare AT to compression algorithms, ref 1, does not help identify if the object is the product of selection or not. Specifically, we show why aims to perform benchmark comparisons of different compression schemes to compare the performance of Molecular Assembly Indices against standard compression schemes in determining living vs. non-living samples fails to classify the data correctly. In their approach, Uthamacumaran et al., ref 1, compress data from Marshall et al.2 describing the experimental basis for assembly theory and evaluate the difference in the resulting distributions of data. After several computational experiments Uthamacumaran et al., ref 1, conclude that other compression techniques obtain better results in the problem of detecting life and non-life that of assembly pathways. Here we explain why the approach presented by Uthamacumaran et al.1 appears to be lacking, and why it is not to reproduce their analysis with the information given.</description>

      <title>WMMSE-Based Rate Maximization for RIS-Assisted MU-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology, given its ability to favorably modify wireless communication environments, will play a pivotal role in the evolution of future communication systems. This paper proposes rate maximization techniques for both single-user and multiuser MIMO systems, based on the well-known weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) criterion. Using a suitable weight matrix, the WMMSE algorithm tackles an equivalent weighted mean square error (WMSE) minimization problem to achieve the sum-rate maximization. By considering a more practical RIS system model that employs a tensor-based representation enforced by the electromagnetic behavior exhibited by the RIS panel, we detail both the sum-rate maximizing and WMSE minimizing strategies for RIS phase shift optimization by deriving the closed-form gradient of the WMSE and the sum-rate with respect to the RIS phase shift vector. Our simulations reveal that the proposed rate maximization technique, rooted in the WMMSE algorithm, exhibits superior performance when compared to other benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Sparse Estimation for XL-MIMO with Unified LoS/NLoS Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale antenna array (ELAA) is promising as one of the key ingredients for the sixth generation (6G) of wireless communications. The electromagnetic propagation of spherical wavefronts introduces an additional distance-dependent dimension beyond conventional beamspace. In this paper, we first present one concise closed-form channel formulation for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO). All line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths, far-field and near-field scenarios, and XL-MIMO and XL-MISO channels are unified under the framework, where additional Vandermonde windowing matrix is exclusively considered for LoS path. Under this framework, we further propose one low-complexity unified LoS/NLoS orthogonal matching pursuit (XL-UOMP) algorithm for XL-MIMO channel estimation. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm on both estimation accuracy and pilot consumption.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Reconfigurable Antenna MIMO Systems with Coherent Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable antenna multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a promising technology for upcoming 6G communication systems. In this paper, we deal with the problem of configuration selection for reconfigurable antenna MIMO by leveraging Coherent Ising Machines (CIMs). By adopting the CIM as a heuristic solver for the Ising problem, the optimal antenna configuration that maximizes the received signal-to-noise ratio is investigated. A mathematical framework that converts the selection problem into a CIM-compatible unconstrained quadratic formulation is presented. Numerical studies show that the proposed CIM-based design outperforms classical counterparts and achieves near-optimal performance (similar to exponentially complex exhaustive searching) while ensuring polynomial complexity.</description>

      <title>Self-Orthogonal Codes from Vectorial Dual-Bent Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-orthogonal codes are a significant class of linear codes in coding theory and have attracted a lot of attention. In \cite{HLL2023Te,LH2023Se}, $p$-ary self-orthogonal codes were constructed by using $p$-ary weakly regular bent functions, where $p$ is an odd prime. In \cite{WH2023Se}, two classes of non-degenerate quadratic forms were used to construct $q$-ary self-orthogonal codes, where $q$ is a power of a prime. In this paper, we construct new families of $q$-ary self-orthogonal codes using vectorial dual-bent functions. Some classes of at least almost optimal linear codes are obtained from the dual codes of the constructed self-orthogonal codes. In some cases, we completely determine the weight distributions of the constructed self-orthogonal codes. From the view of vectorial dual-bent functions, we illustrate that the works on constructing self-orthogonal codes from $p$-ary weakly regular bent functions \cite{HLL2023Te,LH2023Se} and non-degenerate quadratic forms with $q$ being odd \cite{WH2023Se} can be obtained by our results. We partially answer an open problem on determining the weight distribution of a class of self-orthogonal codes given in \cite{LH2023Se}. As applications, we construct new infinite families of at least almost optimal $q$-ary linear complementary dual codes (for short, LCD codes) and quantum codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we use maximum entropy methods to derive several theorems in probabilistic number theory, including a version of the Hardy-Ramanujan Theorem. We also provide a theoretical argument explaining the experimental observations of Y.-H. He about the learnability of primes, and posit that the Erd\H{o}s-Kac law would very unlikely be discovered by current machine learning techniques. Numerical experiments that we perform corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Knowledge and Data Dual-Driven Channel Estimation and Feedback for Ultra-Massive MIMO Systems under Hybrid Field Beam Squint Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acquiring accurate channel state information (CSI) at an access point (AP) is challenging for wideband millimeter wave (mmWave) ultra-massive multiple-input and multiple-output (UMMIMO) systems, due to the high-dimensional channel matrices, hybrid near- and far- field channel feature, beam squint effects, and imperfect hardware constraints, such as low-resolution analog-to-digital converters, and in-phase and quadrature imbalance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient downlink channel estimation (CE) and CSI feedback approach based on knowledge and data dual-driven deep learning (DL) networks. Specifically, we first propose a data-driven residual neural network de-quantizer (ResNet-DQ) to pre-process the received pilot signals at user equipment (UEs), where the noise and distortion brought by imperfect hardware can be mitigated. A knowledge-driven generalized multiple measurement vector learned approximate message passing (GMMV-LAMP) network is then developed to jointly estimate the channels by exploiting the approximately same physical angle shared by different subcarriers. In particular, two wideband redundant dictionaries (WRDs) are proposed such that the measurement matrices of the GMMV-LAMP network can accommodate the far-field and near-field beam squint effect, respectively. Finally, we propose an encoder at the UEs and a decoder at the AP by a data-driven CSI residual network (CSI-ResNet) to compress the CSI matrix into a low-dimensional quantized bit vector for feedback, thereby reducing the feedback overhead substantially. Simulation results show that the proposed knowledge and data dual-driven approach outperforms conventional downlink CE and CSI feedback methods, especially in the case of low signal-to-noise ratios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the wideband modeling and beamforming design of beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), which generalizes and goes beyond conventional RIS with diagonal phase shift matrices to achieve enhanced channel gain. Specifically, we investigate the response of BD-RIS in wideband systems by going back to its hardware circuit realizations. We propose a novel wideband model which has simple expressions while capturing the response variations of BD-RIS for signals with different frequencies. With this wideband model, we propose a BD-RIS design algorithm for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system to maximize the average rate over all subcarriers. Finally, we provide simulation results to evaluate the performance of the proposed design and show the importance of wideband modeling for BD-RIS.</description>

      <title>A New Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Aided Electromagnetic Stealth Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic wave absorbing material (EWAM) plays an essential role in manufacturing stealth aircraft, which can achieve the electromagnetic stealth (ES) by reducing the strength of the signal reflected back to the radar system. However, the stealth performance is limited by the coating thickness, incident wave angles, and working frequencies. To tackle these limitations, we propose a new intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided ES system where an IRS is deployed at the target to synergize with EWAM for effectively mitigating the echo signal and thus reducing the radar detection probability. Considering the monotonic relationship between the detection probability and the received signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) at the radar, we formulate an optimization problem that minimizes the SNR under the reflection constraint of each IRS element, and a semi-closed-form solution is derived by using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed IRS-aided ES system compared to various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Private Information Retrieval from Locally Repairable Databases with Colluding Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02938</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.02938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider information-theoretical private information retrieval (PIR) from a coded database with colluding servers. We target, for the first time, locally repairable storage codes (LRCs). We consider any number of local groups $ g $, locality $ r $, local distance $ \delta $ and dimension $ k $. Our main contribution is a PIR scheme for maximally recoverable (MR) LRCs based on linearized Reed--Solomon codes, which achieve the smallest field sizes among MR-LRCs for many parameter regimes. In our scheme, nodes are identified with codeword symbols and servers are identified with local groups of nodes. Only locally non-redundant information is downloaded from each server, that is, only $ r $ nodes (out of $ r+\delta-1 $) are downloaded per server. The PIR scheme achieves the (download) rate $ R = (N - k - rt + 1)/N $, where $ N = gr $ is the length of the MDS code obtained after removing the local parities, and for any $ t $ colluding servers such that $ k + rt \leq N $. For an unbounded number of stored files, the obtained rate is strictly larger than those of known PIR schemes that work for any MDS code. Finally, the obtained PIR scheme can also be adapted when communication between the user and each server is performed via linear network coding, achieving the same rate as previous PIR schemes for this scenario but with polynomial finite field sizes, instead of exponential. Our rates are equal to those of PIR schemes for Reed--Solomon codes, but Reed--Solomon codes are incompatible with the MR-LRC property or linear network coding, thus our PIR scheme is less restrictive in its applications.</description>

      <title>Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding Over Cooperative Relay Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) scheme for image transmission over a half-duplex cooperative relay channel. Specifically, we apply DeepJSCC to two basic modes of cooperative communications, namely amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF). In DeepJSCC-AF, the relay simply amplifies and forwards its received signal. In DeepJSCC-DF, on the other hand, the relay first reconstructs the transmitted image and then re-encodes it before forwarding. Considering the excessive computation overhead of DeepJSCC-DF for recovering the image at the relay, we propose an alternative scheme, called DeepJSCC-PF, in which the relay processes and forwards its received signal without necessarily recovering the image. Simulation results show that the proposed DeepJSCC-AF, DF, and PF schemes are superior to the digital baselines with BPG compression with polar codes and provides a graceful performance degradation with deteriorating channel quality. Further investigation shows that the PSNR gain of DeepJSCC-DF/PF over DeepJSCC-AF improves as the channel condition between the source and relay improves. Moreover, DeepJSCC-PF scheme achieves a similar performance to DeepJSCC-DF with lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Holographic MIMO Communications: What is the benefit of closely spaced antennas?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holographic MIMO refers to a (possibly large) array with a large number of individually controlled and densely deployed antennas. The objective of this paper is to provide further insight into the use of closely spaced antennas in the uplink and downlink of a multi-user Holographic MIMO system. To this end, we utilize multiport communication theory, which ensures physically consistent uplink and downlink models. We first consider a simple uplink scenario with two side-by-side half-wavelength dipoles, two users, and single-path line-of-sight propagation, and show both analytically and numerically that the array gain and average spectral efficiency strongly depend on the directions from which the signals are received and on the array matching network used. The numerical results are then used to extend the analysis to more practical scenarios involving larger arrays of dipoles (arranged in a uniform linear array) and a larger number of users. The case where the antennas are densely packed in a space-constrained factor form is also considered. It is found that the spectral efficiency increases with decreasing antenna spacing only for arrays of moderate size, e.g. in the order of a few wavelengths. In comparison, larger arrays with closely spaced antennas show only marginal improvements in spectral efficiency compared to half-wavelength arrays.</description>

      <title>A Fast and Provable Algorithm for Sparse Phase Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the sparse phase retrieval problem, which seeks to recover a sparse signal from a limited set of magnitude-only measurements. In contrast to prevalent sparse phase retrieval algorithms that primarily use first-order methods, we propose an innovative second-order algorithm that employs a Newton-type method with hard thresholding. This algorithm overcomes the linear convergence limitations of first-order methods while preserving their hallmark per-iteration computational efficiency. We provide theoretical guarantees that our algorithm converges to the $s$-sparse ground truth signal $\mathbf{x}^{\natural} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ (up to a global sign) at a quadratic convergence rate after at most $O(\log (\Vert\mathbf{x}^{\natural} \Vert /x_{\min}^{\natural}))$ iterations, using $\Omega(s^2\log n)$ Gaussian random samples. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm achieves a significantly faster convergence rate than state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>SplitMAC: Wireless Split Learning over Multiple Access Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel split learning (SL) framework, referred to as SplitMAC, which reduces the latency of SL by leveraging simultaneous uplink transmission over multiple access channels. The key strategy is to divide devices into multiple groups and allow the devices within the same group to simultaneously transmit their smashed data and device-side models over the multiple access channels. The optimization problem of device grouping to minimize SL latency is formulated, and the benefit of device grouping in reducing the uplink latency of SL is theoretically derived. By examining a two-device grouping case, two asymptotically-optimal algorithms are devised for device grouping in low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios, respectively, while providing proofs of their optimality. By merging these algorithms, a near-optimal device grouping algorithm is proposed to cover a wide range of SNR. Our SL framework is also extended to consider practical fading channels and to support a general group size. Simulation results demonstrate that our SL framework with the proposed device grouping algorithm is superior to existing SL frameworks in reducing SL latency.</description>

      <title>Complex-Valued Neural Network based Federated Learning for Multi-user Indoor Positioning Performance Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, the use of channel state information (CSI) for indoor positioning is studied. In the considered model, a server equipped with several antennas sends pilot signals to users, while each user uses the received pilot signals to estimate channel states for user positioning. To this end, we formulate the positioning problem as an optimization problem aiming to minimize the gap between the estimated positions and the ground truth positions of users. To solve this problem, we design a complex-valued neural network (CVNN) model based federated learning (FL) algorithm. Compared to standard real-valued centralized machine learning (ML) methods, our proposed algorithm has two main advantages. First, our proposed algorithm can directly process complex-valued CSI data without data transformation. Second, our proposed algorithm is a distributed ML method that does not require users to send their CSI data to the server. Since the output of our proposed algorithm is complex-valued which consists of the real and imaginary parts, we study the use of the CVNN to implement two learning tasks. First, the proposed algorithm directly outputs the estimated positions of a user. Here, the real and imaginary parts of an output neuron represent the 2D coordinates of the user. Second, the proposed method can output two CSI features (i.e., line-of-sight/non-line-of-sight transmission link classification and time of arrival (TOA) prediction) which can be used in traditional positioning algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that our designed CVNN based FL can reduce the mean positioning error between the estimated position and the actual position by up to 36%, compared to a RVNN based FL which requires to transform CSI data into real-valued data.</description>

      <title>Smart Resource Allocation at mmWave/THz Frequencies with Cooperative Rate-Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose algorithms to minimize the energy consumption in millimeter wave/terahertz multi-user downlink communication systems. To ensure coverage in blockage-vulnerable high frequency systems, we consider cooperative rate-splitting (CRS) and transmission over multiple time blocks, where via CRS, multiple users cooperate to assist a blocked user. Moreover, we show that transmission over multiple time blocks provides benefits through smart resource allocation. We first propose a communication framework named improved distinct extraction-based CRS (iDeCRS) that utilizes the benefits of rate-splitting. With our transmission framework, we derive a performance benchmark assuming genie channel state information (CSI), i.e., the channels of the present and future time blocks are known, denoted as GENIE. Using the results from GENIE, we derive a novel efficiency constrained optimization (ECO) algorithm assuming instantaneous CSI. In addition, a simple but effective even data transmission (EDT) algorithm that promotes steady transmission along the time blocks is proposed. Simulation results show that ECO and EDT have satisfactory performances compared to GENIE. The results also show that ECO outperforms EDT when many users are cooperating, and vise versa.</description>

      <title>A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Autonomous Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a prospective wireless technology that enhances wireless channel quality. An RIS is often equipped with passive array of elements and provides cost and power-efficient solutions for coverage extension of wireless communication systems. Without any radio frequency (RF) chains or computing resources, however, the RIS requires control information to be sent to it from an external unit, e.g., a base station (BS). The control information can be delivered by wired or wireless channels, and the BS must be aware of the RIS and the RIS-related channel conditions in order to effectively configure its behavior. Recent works have introduced hybrid RIS structures possessing a few active elements that can sense and digitally process received data. Here, we propose the operation of an entirely autonomous RIS that operates without a control link between the RIS and BS. Using a few sensing elements, the autonomous RIS employs a deep Q network (DQN) based on reinforcement learning in order to enhance the sum rate of the network. Our results illustrate the potential of deploying autonomous RISs in wireless networks with essentially no network overhead.</description>

      <title>Approximation and bounding techniques for the Fisher-Rao distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fisher-Rao distance between two probability distributions of a statistical model is defined as the Riemannian geodesic distance induced by the Fisher information metric. In order to calculate the Fisher-Rao distance in closed-form, we need (1) to elicit a formula for the Fisher-Rao geodesics, and (2) to integrate the Fisher length element along those geodesics. We consider several numerically robust approximation and bounding techniques for the Fisher-Rao distances: First, we report generic upper bounds on Fisher-Rao distances based on closed-form 1D Fisher-Rao distances of submodels. Second, we describe several generic approximation schemes depending on whether the Fisher-Rao geodesics or pregeodesics are available in closed-form or not. In particular, we obtain a generic method to guarantee an arbitrarily small additive error on the approximation provided that Fisher-Rao pregeodesics and tight lower and upper bounds are available. Third, we consider the case of Fisher metrics being Hessian metrics, and report generic tight upper bounds on the Fisher-Rao distances using techniques of information geometry. Uniparametric and biparametric statistical models always have Fisher Hessian metrics, and in general a simple test allows to check whether the Fisher information matrix yields a Hessian metric or not. Fourth, we consider elliptical distribution families and show how to apply the above techniques to these models. We also propose two new distances based either on the Fisher-Rao lengths of curves serving as proxies of Fisher-Rao geodesics, or based on the Birkhoff/Hilbert projective cone distance. Last, we consider an alternative group-theoretic approach for statistical transformation models based on the notion of maximal invariant which yields insights on the structures of the Fisher-Rao distance formula which may be used fruitfully in applications.</description>

      <title>Full-Duplex MU-MIMO Systems with Coarse Quantization: How Many Bits Do We Need?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates full-duplex (FD) multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) system design with coarse quantization. We first analyze the impact of self-interference (SI) on quantization in FD single-input single-output systems. The analysis elucidates that the minimum required number of analog-to-digital converter (ADC) bits is logarithmically proportional to the ratio of total received power to the received power of desired signals. Motivated by this, we design a FD MIMO beamforming method that effectively manages the SI. Dividing a spectral efficiency maximization beamforming problem into two sub-problems for alternating optimization, we address the first by optimizing the precoder: obtaining a generalized eigenvalue problem from the first-order optimality condition, where the principal eigenvector is the optimal stationary solution, and adopting a power iteration method to identify this eigenvector. Subsequently, a quantization-aware minimum mean square error combiner is computed for the derived precoder. Through numerical studies, we observe that the proposed beamformer reduces the minimum required number of ADC bits for achieving higher spectral efficiency than that of half-duplex (HD) systems, compared to FD benchmarks. The overall analysis shows that, unlike with quantized HD systems, more than 6 bits are required for the ADC to fully realize the potential of the quantized FD system.</description>

      <title>Non-Coherent Over-the-Air Decentralized Gradient Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.10777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Gradient Descent (DGD) is a popular algorithm used to solve decentralized optimization problems in diverse domains such as remote sensing, distributed inference, multi-agent coordination, and federated learning. Yet, executing DGD over wireless systems affected by noise, fading and limited bandwidth presents challenges, requiring scheduling of transmissions to mitigate interference and the acquisition of topology and channel state information -- complex tasks in wireless decentralized systems. This paper proposes a DGD algorithm tailored to wireless systems. Unlike existing approaches, it operates without inter-agent coordination, topology information, or channel state information. Its core is a Non-Coherent Over-The-Air (NCOTA) consensus scheme, exploiting a noisy energy superposition property of wireless channels. With a randomized transmission strategy to accommodate half-duplex operation, transmitters map local optimization signals to energy levels across subcarriers in an OFDM frame, and transmit concurrently without coordination. It is shown that received energies form a noisy consensus signal, whose fluctuations are mitigated via a consensus stepsize. NCOTA-DGD leverages the channel pathloss for consensus formation, without explicit knowledge of the mixing weights. It is shown that, for the class of strongly-convex problems, the expected squared distance between the local and globally optimum models vanishes with rate $\mathcal O(1/\sqrt{k})$ after $k$ iterations, with a proper design of decreasing stepsizes. Extensions address a broad class of fading models and frequency-selective channels. Numerical results on an image classification task depict faster convergence vis-\`a-vis running time than state-of-the-art schemes, especially in densely deployed networks.</description>

      <title>Information decomposition in complex systems via machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the fundamental steps toward understanding a complex system is identifying variation at the scale of the system's components that is most relevant to behavior on a macroscopic scale. Mutual information provides a natural means of linking variation across scales of a system due to its independence of functional relationship between observables. However, characterizing the manner in which information is distributed across a set of observables is computationally challenging and generally infeasible beyond a handful of measurements. Here we propose a practical and general methodology that uses machine learning to decompose the information contained in a set of measurements by jointly optimizing a lossy compression of each measurement. Guided by the distributed information bottleneck as a learning objective, the information decomposition identifies the variation in the measurements of the system state most relevant to specified macroscale behavior. We focus our analysis on two paradigmatic complex systems: a Boolean circuit and an amorphous material undergoing plastic deformation. In both examples, the large amount of entropy of the system state is decomposed, bit by bit, in terms of what is most related to macroscale behavior. The identification of meaningful variation in data, with the full generality brought by information theory, is made practical for studying the connection between micro- and macroscale structure in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Language Modeling Is Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has long been established that predictive models can be transformed into lossless compressors and vice versa. Incidentally, in recent years, the machine learning community has focused on training increasingly large and powerful self-supervised (language) models. Since these large language models exhibit impressive predictive capabilities, they are well-positioned to be strong compressors. In this work, we advocate for viewing the prediction problem through the lens of compression and evaluate the compression capabilities of large (foundation) models. We show that large language models are powerful general-purpose predictors and that the compression viewpoint provides novel insights into scaling laws, tokenization, and in-context learning. For example, Chinchilla 70B, while trained primarily on text, compresses ImageNet patches to 43.4% and LibriSpeech samples to 16.4% of their raw size, beating domain-specific compressors like PNG (58.5%) or FLAC (30.3%), respectively. Finally, we show that the prediction-compression equivalence allows us to use any compressor (like gzip) to build a conditional generative model.</description>

Abstract: We discuss single-shot decoding of quantum Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes with faulty syndrome measurements. We state the problem as a joint source-channel coding problem. By adding redundant rows to the code's parity-check matrix we obtain an additional syndrome error correcting code which addresses faulty syndrome measurements. Thereby, the redundant rows are chosen to obtain good syndrome error correcting capabilities while keeping the stabilizer weights low. Optimal joint decoding rules are derived which, though too complex for general codes, can be evaluated for short quantum codes.</description>
