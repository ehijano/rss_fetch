      <title>Forecasting Bitcoin volatility spikes from whale transactions and CryptoQuant data using Synthesizer Transformer models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile compared to traditional financial markets. Hence, forecasting its volatility is crucial for risk management. In this paper, we investigate CryptoQuant data (e.g. on-chain analytics, exchange and miner data) and whale-alert tweets, and explore their relationship to Bitcoin's next-day volatility, with a focus on extreme volatility spikes. We propose a deep learning Synthesizer Transformer model for forecasting volatility. Our results show that the model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models when forecasting extreme volatility spikes for Bitcoin using CryptoQuant data as well as whale-alert tweets. We analysed our model with the Captum XAI library to investigate which features are most important. We also backtested our prediction results with different baseline trading strategies and the results show that we are able to minimize drawdown while keeping steady profits. Our findings underscore that the proposed method is a useful tool for forecasting extreme volatility movements in the Bitcoin market.</description>

      <title>Interconnected Markets: Exploring the Dynamic Relationship Between BRICS Stock Markets and Cryptocurrency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study uses data from the BRICS stock market index, cryptocurrencies, and investor sentiment indicators from January 6, 2015, to June 29, 2023. BRICS nations emerge as pivotal representatives of emerging economies. This study employs a time-varying parameter vector autoregression model to unravel the intricate interdependence between traditional stock assets and the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies. The analysis investigates spillover effects between BRICS stock markets and cryptocurrencies, revealing increasing interconnectedness during highly uncertain events like COVID-19, but no significant impact on major US stock market indices.</description>

      <title>A Multi-step Approach for Minimizing Risk in Decentralized Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized Exchanges are becoming even more predominant in today's finance. Driven by the need to study this phenomenon from an academic perspective, the SIAG/FME Code Quest 2023 was announced. Specifically, participating teams were asked to implement, in Python, the basic functions of an Automated Market Maker and a liquidity provision strategy in an Automated Market Maker to minimize the Conditional Value at Risk, a critical measure of investment risk. As the competition's winning team, we highlight our approach in this work. In particular, as the dependence of the final return on the initial wealth distribution is highly non-linear, we cannot use standard ad-hoc approaches. Additionally, classical minimization techniques would require a significant computational load due to the cost of the target function. For these reasons, we propose a three-step approach. In the first step, the target function is approximated by a Kernel Ridge Regression. Then, the approximating function is minimized. In the final step, the previously discovered minimum is utilized as the starting point for directly optimizing the desired target function. By using this procedure, we can both reduce the computational complexity and increase the accuracy of the solution. Finally, the overall computational load is further reduced thanks to an algorithmic trick concerning the returns simulation and the usage of Cython.</description>
