      <title>Shock selection in reaction--diffusion equations with partially negative diffusivity using nonlinear regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a general reaction--nonlinear-diffusion equation with a region of negative diffusivity, and show how a nonlinear regularisation selects a shock position. Negative diffusivity can model population aggregation, but leads to shock-fronted solutions for population density. In general the shock position is non-unique. Previous studies have defined shock selection criteria such as the equal area rule, and shown how these arise from specific regularisations to the reaction--diffusion equation. In this work, we show that a nonlinear regularisation leads to travelling wave solutions where the shock is selected according to a modified equal area rule. Adjusting the nonlinearity in the regularisation moves the shock location. We focus on attaining shocks that conserve diffusivity across the shock, and demonstrate that this condition yields the longest possible shock length. Using geometric singular perturbation theory, we prove the existence of shock-fronted travelling wave solutions with continuous diffusivity, show how to construct them, and demonstrate that they correspond to a unique wave speed. Numerical solutions align with theoretical predictions for shock position and wave speed, confirming that a single regularisation term can vary the shock position and attain shocks with continuous diffusivity.</description>

      <title>The discrete octonionic Stokes' formula revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous work [arXiv:2211.02945] we made an attempt to set up a discrete octonionic Stokes' formula. Due to an algebraic property that we have not considered in that attempt, the formula however turned out to involve an associator term in addition to a change of sign that we already observed earlier. This associator term has an impact on the final result. In this paper we carefully revise this discrete Stokes formula taking into account this additional term. In fact the result that we now obtain is much more in line with the results that one has in the continuous setting.</description>

      <title>Proof of the Stokes conjecture for compressible gravity water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1880, Stokes examined an incompressible irrotational periodic traveling water wave under the influence of gravity and conjectured the existence of an extreme wave with a corner of $120^{\circ}$ at the crest. The first rigorous proof of the conjecture was given by Amick, Fraenkel and Toland, as well as by Plotnikov independently via the Nekrasov integral equation. In the early 2010s, Weiss and Varvarucva revisited the conjecture by applying a new geometric method, which provided an affirmative answer to the conjecture without requiring structural assumptions such as the isolation of the stagnation points, the symmetry and the monotonicity of the free surface that were necessary in the previous works.
  The main purpose of this paper is to establish the validity of the Stokes conjecture in the context of compressible gravity water waves. More precisely, we prove that a sharp crest forms near each stagnation point of a compressible gravity water wave with an included angle of $120^{\circ}$, which gives a first proof to the compressible counterpart of the classical conjecture by Stokes in 1880.
  The central aspect of our approach is the discovery of a new monotonicity formula for quasilinear free boundary problems of the Bernoulli-type. Another observation is the introduction of a new nonlinear frequency formula, along with a compensated compactness argument for the compressible Euler system. The developed monotonicity formula enables us to do blow-up analysis at each stagnation point and helps us obtain the singular profile of the free surface near each stagnation points. The degenerate stagnation points can be further analyzed with the help of the compensated compactness argument using the frequency formula.</description>

      <title>Global analytic solutions of a pseudospherical Novikov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a Novikov equation, recently shown to describe pseudospherical surfaces, to extend some recent results of regularity of its solutions. By making use of the global well-posedness in Sobolev spaces, for analytic initial data in Gevrey spaces we prove some new estimates for the solution in order to use the Kato-Masuda Theorem and obtain a lower bound for the radius of spatial analyticity. After that, we use embeddings between spaces to then conclude that the unique solution is, in fact, globally analytic in both variables. Finally, the global analyticity of the solution is used to prove that it endows a certain strip with a global analytic metric associated to pseudospherical surfaces obtained in previous results in the literature.</description>

      <title>A shape derivative algorithm for reconstructing elastic dislocations in geophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of determining an elastic dislocation that models a seismic fault in the quasi-static regime of aseismic, creeping faults, from displacement measurements made at the surface of Earth. We derive both a distributed as well as a boundary shape derivative that encodes the change in a misfit functional between the measured and the computed surface displacement under infinitesimal movements of the dislocation and infinitesimal changes in the slip vector, which gives the displacement jump across the dislocation. We employ the shape derivative in an iterative reconstruction algorithm. We present some numerical test of the reconstruction algorithm in a simplified 2D setting.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness for the defocusing 3D quadratic NLS in the sharp critical space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the global well-posedness of defocusing 3D quadratic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation \begin{align*} i\partial_t u + \frac12\Delta u = |u| u, \end{align*} in its sharp critical weighted space $\mathcal F \dot H_x^{1/2}$ for radial data.
  Killip, Masaki, Murphy, and Visan [2017, NoDEA] have proved its global well-posedness and scattering, if the $\mathcal F \dot H_x^{1/2}$-norm of the solution is bounded in the maximal lifespan. Now, we remove this a priori assumption for the global well-posedness statement in the radial case.
  Our method is based on the almost conservation of pseudo conformal energy. This energy scales like $\dot H_x^{-1}$, which is supercritical. We are still able to derive the global well-posedness using this monotone quantity. The main observation is that we can establish the local solution in supercritical weighted space when the initial time is away from the origin.</description>

      <title>Calmed Ohmic Heating for the 2D Magnetohydrodynamic-Boussinesq System: Global Well-posedness and Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When an electric current runs through a fluid, it generates heat via a process known as ``Ohmic heating'' or ``Joule heating.'' While this phenomenon, and its quantification known as Joule's Law, is the first studied example of heat generation via an electric field, many difficulties still remain in understanding its consequences. In particular, a magnetic fluid naturally generates an electric field via Amp\`ere's law, which heats the fluid via Joule's law. This heat in turn gives rise to convective effects in the fluid, creating complicated dynamical behavior. This has been modeled (in other works) by including an Ohmic heating term in the Magnetohydrodynamic-Boussinessq (MHD-B) equation. However, the structure of this term causes major analytical difficulties, and basic questions of well-posedness remain open problems, even in the two-dimensional case. Moreover, standard approaches to finding a globally well-posed approximate model, such as filtering or adding high-order diffusion, are not enough to handle the Ohmic heating term. In this work, we present a different approach that we call ``calming'', which reduces the effective algebraic degree of the Ohmic heating term in a controlled manner. We show that this new model is globally well-posed, and moreover, its solutions converge to solutions of the MHD-B system with the Ohmic heating term (assuming that solutions to the original equation exist), making it the first globally well-posed approximate model for the MHD-B equation with Ohmic heating.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider an energy-critical complex Ginzburg-Landau equation in the exterior of a smooth compact strictly convex obstacle. We prove the global well-posedness of energy-critical complex Ginzburg-Landau equation in an exterior domain by the concentration-compactness/rigidity theorem method. As corollaries of our main result, we establish both the existence of global weak solutions to energy-critical defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations and the global well-posedness theory for energy-critical semi-linear heat equation in exterior domains.</description>

Abstract: The article is about an elliptic problem defined on a {\it stratified Lie group}. Both sub- and superlinear cases are considered whose solutions are guaranteed to exist in light of the interplay between the nonlinearities and the weak $L^1$ datum. The existence of infinitely many solutions is proved for suitable values of $\lambda,p,q$ by using the Symmetric Mountain Pass Theorem.</description>

      <title>Existence results for mixed local and nonlocal elliptic equations involving singularity and nonregular data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence of weak, veryweak and duality solutions to a class of elliptic problems involving singularity and measure data which is given by: $-\Delta u+(-\Delta)^s u = \frac{f(x)}{u^\gamma} +\mu$ in $\Omega$ with the zero Dirichlet boundary data $u=0$ in $\mathbb R^N \setminus \Omega$. The existence of weak solutions is obtained by approximating a sequence of problems for $0&lt;\gamma\leq1$ and $\gamma&gt;1$. We employ Schauder's fixed point theorem and embeddings of Marcinkiewicz spaces. The novelty of our work is that we prove the existence of a duality solution and its equivalence with weak solutions to the problem $\mathcal{L}u=\mu$. Moreover, we prove a veryweak maximum principle and a Kato-type inequality for the mixed local-nonlocal operator $\mathcal{L}=-\Delta +(-\Delta)^s$, which are crucial tools to guarantee the existence of veryweak solutions to the problem. Using a Kato-type inequality, maximum principle together with sub-super solution method, we prove the existence of veryweak solution for $0&lt;\gamma&lt;1$. Our work extends the studies due to Oliva and Petitta [ESAIM Control Optim. Calc. Var., 22(1):289--308, 2016.] and Petitta [Adv. Nonlinear Stud., 16(1):115--124, 2016.] for the mixed local-nonlocal operator.</description>

      <title>Parabolic Muckenhoupt Weights Characterized by Parabolic Fractional Maximal and Integral Operators with Time Lag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, motivated by the regularity theory of the solutions of doubly nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations the authors introduce the off-diagonal two-weight version of the parabolic Muckenhoupt class with time lag. Then the authors introduce the uncentered parabolic fractional maximal operator with time lag and characterize its two-weighted boundedness (including the endpoint case) via these weights under an extra mild assumption (which is not necessary for one-weight case). The most novelty of this article exists in that the authors further introduce a new parabolic shaped domain and its corresponding parabolic fractional integral with time lag and, moreover, applying the aforementioned two-weighted boundedness of the uncentered parabolic fractional maximal operator with time lag, the authors characterize the (two-)weighted boundedness (including the endpoint case) of these parabolic fractional integrals in terms of the off-diagonal (two-weight) parabolic Muckenhoupt class with time lag; as applications, the authors further establish a parabolic weighted Sobolev embedding and a priori estimate for the solution of the heat equation. The key tools to achieve these include the parabolic Calder\'on--Zygmund-type decomposition, the chaining argument, and the parabolic Welland inequality which is obtained by making the utmost of the geometrical relation between the parabolic shaped domain and the parabolic rectangle.</description>

      <title>A review on asymptotic stability of solitary waves in nonlinear dispersive problems in dimension one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review asymptotic stability of solitary waves for nonlinear dispersive equations set on the line. Our focus is threefold: first, the nonlinear Schrodinger equation; second, the notion of full asymptotic stability (which states that perturbations of a solitary wave decompose globally into a solitary wave and a decaying solution); and third, spectral methods. Besides this focus, we summarize the state of the art in a broader context, including nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations, the notion of local asymptotic stability, and virial methods.</description>

      <title>On the Stein-Weiss inequalities and higher-order Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type inequalities: sharp constants, symmetry of extremal functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first classify all radially symmetry solutions of the following weighted fourth-order equation
  \begin{equation*}
  \Delta(|x|^{-\gamma}\Delta u)=|x|^\gamma u^{\frac{N+4+3\gamma}{N-4-\gamma}},\quad u\geq 0 \quad \mbox{in}\quad \mathbb{R}^N,
  \end{equation*} where $N\geq 5$, $-2&lt;\gamma&lt;0$. Then we derive the sharp Stein-Weiss inequality and standard second-order Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality with radially symmetry extremal functions. Moreover, by using standard spherical decomposition, we derive a sharp weighted Rellich-Sobolev inequality. Furthermore, we establish the sharp second-order Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type inequalities with two variables which have radially symmetry extremal functions. Finally, we derive the weak form Hardy-Rellich inequalities with sharp constants.</description>

      <title>On the regularity of area minimizing currents at boundaries with arbitrary multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an area-minimizing integral $m$-current $T$, within a submanifold $\Sigma \in C^{3,\kappa}$ of $\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$, with arbitrary boundary multiplicity $\partial T = Q[\![\Gamma]\!]$, where $\Gamma\subset\Sigma$ of class $C^{3,\kappa}$. We prove that the set of density $Q/2$ boundary singular points of $T$ is $\mathcal{H}^{m-3}$-rectifiable. This result generalizes Allard's boundary regularity theorem to a higher multiplicity setting.
  In particular, if $\Gamma$ is a closed manifold which lies at the boundary of a uniformly convex set $\Omega$ and $\Sigma=\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$ the whole boundary singular set is $\mathcal{H}^{m-3}$ -rectifiable.
  As a structural consequence of our regularity theory, we show that the boundary regular set, without any assumptions on the density, is open and dense in $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Nonstrictly hyperbolic systems and their application to study of Euler-Poisson equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study inhomogeneous non-strictly hyperbolic systems of two equations, which are a formal generalization of the transformed one-dimensional Euler-Poisson equations. For such systems, a complete classification of the behavior of the solution is carried out depending on the right side. In particular, criteria for the formation of singularities in the solution of the Cauchy problem in terms of initial data are found. Also we determine the domains of attraction of equilibria of the extended system for derivatives. We prove the existence of solutions in the form of simple waves. The results obtained are applied to study the main model cases of the Euler-Poisson equations.</description>

      <title>Homoclinic solutions for nonlocal equations and applications to the theory of atom dislocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence of homoclinic solutions for suitable systems of nonlocal equations whose forcing term is of gradient type.
  The elliptic operator under consideration is the fractional Laplacian and the potentials that we take into account are of two types: the first one is a spatially homogeneous function with a strict local maximum at the origin, the second one is a spatially inhomogeneous potential satisfying the Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz condition coupled to a quadratic term with spatially dependent growth at infinity.
  The existence of these special solutions has interesting consequences for the theory of atomic edge dislocations in crystals according to the Peierls-Nabarro model and its generalization to fractional equations.
  Specifically, for the first type of potentials, the results obtained give the existence of a crystal configuration with atoms located at both extrema in an unstable rest position, up to an arbitrarily small modification of the structural potential and a "pinch" of a particle at any given position.
  For the second type of potentials, the results obtained also entail the existence of a crystal configuration reaching an equilibrium at infinity, up to an arbitrarily small superquadratic perturbation of the classical Peierls-Nabarro potential.</description>

      <title>Uniform Energy Bound for Maxwell-Higgs Equations on Reissner-Nordstr\"om Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the uniform energy bound for the Maxwell-Higgs system in the exterior region of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes. By employing an integrated local energy decay (ILED) estimate in combination with the Sobolev embedding theorem on a compact Riemannian manifold, we derived $L^\infty$ bounds for the fields. These results were then used to obtain a bound for the conformal energy of the system using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and Hardy-type inequalities.</description>

      <title>Large time behavior for solutions to the anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations in a 3D half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the large time behavior of the solution to the anisotropic Navier--Stokes equations in a $3$D half-space. Investigating the precise anisotropic nature of linearized solutions, we obtain the optimal decay estimates for the nonlinear global solutions in anisotropic Lebesgue norms. In particular, we reveal the enhanced dissipation mechanism for the third component of velocity field. We notice that, in contrast to the whole space case, some difficulties arises on the $L^1(\mathbb{R}^3_+)$-estimates of the solution due to the nonlocal operators appearing in the linear solution formula. To overcome this, we introduce suitable Besov type spaces and employ the Littlewood--Paley analysis on the tangential space.</description>

      <title>Gehring's Lemma for kinetic Fokker-Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we establish a "Gehring lemma" for a real   function satisfying a reverse H\"older inequality on all "kinetic cylinders" contained in a large one: it asserts that  the integrability degree of the function improves under such an assumption. The kinetic cylinders are derived from the   non-commutative group of invariances of the Kolmogorov   equation. Our contributions here are (1) the extension of   Gehring's Lemma to this kinetic (hypoelliptic) scaling used to generate the cylinders, (2) the localisation of the lemma in  this hypoelliptic context (using ideas from the elliptic  theory), (3) the streamlining of a short and quantitative   proof. We then use this lemma to establish that the velocity  gradient of weak solutions to linear kinetic equations of   Fokker-Planck type with rough coefficients have Lebesgue   integrability strictly greater than two, while the natural energy estimate merely ensures that it is square   integrable. Our argument here is new but relies on Poincar\'e-type inequalities established in previous works.</description>

      <title>Kermack-McKendrick type models for epidemics with nonlocal aggregation terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an approach to model spatial heterogeneity in SIR-type models for the spread of epidemics via \emph{nonlocal aggregation terms}. More precisely, we first consider an SIR model with spatial movements driven by nonlocal aggregation terms, in which the inter-compartment and intra-compartment interaction terms are distinct, and modelled through smooth interaction kernels. For the Cauchy problem of said model we provide a full well-posedness theory on $\R^2$ for $L^1\cap L^\infty \cap H^1$ initial conditions. The existence part is achieved by considering an approximated model with artificial linear diffusion, for which existence and uniqueness is proven via Duhamel's principle and Banach fixed point, and by providing suitable uniform estimates on the approximated solution in order to pass to the limit via classical compactness techniques. To prove uniqueness, we use classical $L^2$-stability which relies on the $H^1$-regularity of the solution. In the second part of the paper we provide a brief, general discussion on the steady states for these type of models, and display a specific example of non-trivial steady states for an SIS model with aggregations (driven by a single repulsive-attractive potential), the existence of which is determined by a threshold condition for a suitable "space-dependent" basic reproduction rate.</description>

      <title>The energy-critical stochastic Zakharov system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is devoted to the stochastic Zakharov system in dimension four, which is the energy-critical dimension. First, we prove local well-posedness in the energy space $H^1\times L^2$ up to the maximal existence time and a blow-up alternative. Second, we prove that for large data solutions exist globally as long as energy and wave mass are below the ground state threshold. Third, we prove a regularization by noise phenomenon: the probability of global existence and scattering goes to one if the strength of the (non-conservative) noise goes to infinity. The proof is based on the refined rescaling approach and a new functional framework, where both Fourier restriction and local smoothing norms are used as well as a (uniform) double endpoint Strichartz and local smoothing inequality for the Schr\"odinger equation with certain rough and time dependent lower order perturbations.</description>

      <title>Unbounded Yudovich Solutions of the Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we will study unbounded solutions of the 2D incompressible Euler equations. One of the motivating factors for this is that the usual functional framework for the Euler equations (e.g. based on finite energy conditions, such as $L^2$) does not respect some of the symmetries of the problem, such as Galileo invariance.
  Our main result, global existence and uniqueness of solutions for initial data with square-root growth $O(|x|^{\frac{1}{2} - \epsilon})$ and bounded vorticity, is based on two key ingredients. Firstly an integral decomposition of the pressure, and secondly examining local energy balance leading to solution estimates in local Morrey type spaces. We also prove continuity of the initial data to solution map by a substantial adaptation of Yudovich's uniqueness argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the solvability of the magnetohydrostatic equations with Grad-Rubin boundary conditions in general domains. Earlier results for this problem were obtained in the recent years by D. Alonso-Or\'an and J. L. L. Vel\'azquez, where particularly simple geometries were considered. In this article we develop a theory that allows to solve these boundary value problems for a larger class of domains. We will give precise applications to more physically relevant situations, like the case of the space between two circumferences or spheres and domains close to them.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of tangent cones to area minimizing currents at boundaries with arbitrary multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an area minimizing current $T$ in a $C^2$ submanifold $\Sigma$ of $\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$, with arbitrary integer boundary multiplicity $\partial T = Q [\![ \Gamma ]\!]$ where $\Gamma$ is a $C^2$ submanifold of $\Sigma$. We show that at every density $Q/2$ boundary point the tangent cone to $T$ is unique and there is a power rate of convergence to the unique tangent cone.
  In particular, if $\Gamma$ is a closed manifold which lies at the boundary of a uniformly convex set $\Omega$ and $\Sigma=\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$ then $T$ has a unique tangent cone at every boundary point.
  As a structural consequence of the uniqueness of the tangent cone, we obtain a decomposition theorem which is the starting point of the boundary regularity theory we develop in another paper in collaboration with Reinaldo Resende. The regularity theory we obtain generalizes Allard's boundary regularity theorem to a higher multiplicity setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the behavior of an isentropic gas in a narrow pipe with periodically-varying cross-sectional area. Using multiple-scale perturbation theory, we derive homogenized effective equations, which take the form of a constant-coefficient system of evolution equations, including dispersive higher-order derivative terms. We provide an approximate Riemann solver for the variable-cross-section isentropic gas equations, and compare numerical solutions of the original system with those of the homogenized system. We observe that the resulting solutions take the form of solitary waves, rather than shock waves, under fairly general conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we consider a fractional p-Kirchhoff equation in the entire space R^N featuring doubly nonlinearities, involving a generalized nonlocal Choquard subcritical term together with a local critical Sobolev term; the problem also includes a Hardy-type term; additionaly, all terms have critical singular weights. Our result improve upon previous work in the following ways: we focus our attention on the existence of a nontrivial weak solution for fractional p-Kirchhoff equation in the entire space R^N. The possibility of a slower growth in the nonlinearity makes it more difficult to establish a compactness condition; to do so, we use the Cerami condition. The crucial points in our argument are the uniform boundedness of the convolution part and the lack of compactness of the Sobolev embeddings.</description>

We give an application of it to derive sharp gradient estimates for complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations.

      <description>arXiv:2410.04750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct growing mode solutions to the uncharged and charged Klein-Gordon equations on the sub-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om--anti-de-Sitter (AdS) spacetime under reflecting (Dirichlet or Neumann) boundary conditions. Our result applies to a range of Klein-Gordon masses above the so-called Breitenlohner-Freedman bound, notably including the conformal mass case. The mode instability of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om--AdS spacetime for some black hole parameters is in sharp contrast to the Schwarzschild-AdS spacetime, where the solution to the Klein-Gordon equation is known to decay in time. Contrary to other mode instability results on the Kerr and Kerr-AdS spacetimes, our growing mode solutions of the uncharged and weakly charged Klein-Gordon equation exist independently of the occurrence or absence of superradiance. We discover a novel mechanism leading to a growing mode solution, namely, a near-extremal instability for the Klein-Gordon equation. Our result seems to be the first rigorous mathematical realization of this instability.</description>

Abstract: We construct one-parameter families of static spherically symmetric asymptotically anti-de Sitter black hole solutions $(\mathcal{M},g_{\epsilon},\phi_{\epsilon})$ to the Einstein-Maxwell-(charged) Klein-Gordon equations. Each family bifurcates off a sub-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS spacetime $(\mathcal{M},g_{0},\phi_{0}\equiv0)$. For a co-dimensional one set of black hole parameters, we show that Dirichlet (respectively Neumann) boundary conditions can be imposed for the scalar field. The construction provides a counter-example to a version of the no-hair conjecture in the context of a negative cosmological constant. Our result is based on our companion work [W. Zheng, \emph{Exponentially-growing Mode Instability on the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-Anti-de-Sitter black holes}], in which the existence of linear hair and growing mode solutions have been established. In the charged scalar field case, our result provides the first rigorous mathematical construction of the so-called holographic superconductors, which are of particular significance in high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Stability of the heat flow under convergence in concentration and consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend to the framework of convergence in concentration virtually all the results concerning stability of Sobolev functions and differential operators known to be in place under the stronger measured-Gromov-Hausdorff convergence. These include, in particular:
  i) A general $\Gamma$--$\varlimsup$ inequality for the Cheeger energy,
  ii) Convergence of the heat flow under a uniform ${\sf CD}(K,\infty)$ condition on the spaces.
  As we will show, building on ideas developed for mGH-convergence, out of this latter result we can obtain clean stability statements for differential, flows of vector fields, Hessian, eigenvalues of the Laplacian and related objects in presence of uniform lower Ricci bounds. At the technical level, one of the tools we develop to establish these results is the notion of convergence of maps between metric measure spaces converging in concentration. Previous results in the field concerned the stability of the ${\sf CD}$ (Funano-Shioya '13) and ${\sf RCD}$ (Ozawa-Yokota '19) conditions. The latter was obtained proving $\Gamma$-convergence for the Cheeger energies. This is not sufficient to pass to the limit in the heat flow; one of the byproducts of our work is the improvement of this to Mosco-convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.10031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liouville systems on Riemann surfaces are instrumental in modeling species growth and particle dynamics in biology and physics. Previously, we established a priori estimates for parameters across regions defined by critical hyper-surfaces. Here, we extend this by giving a priori estimates when parameters are critically positioned. This involves thoroughly characterizing bubble interaction, a key challenge in Liouville systems. During blowup events, we ascertain the exact heights of bubbling solutions about each blowup point, the integrals of each component, and the blowup points' positions. Moreover, as the parameter $\rho$ approaches a critical hyper-surface, we identify a pivotal leading term vital for numerous applications.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial global solutions to some quasilinear wave equations in three space dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.12870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we seek to construct nontrivial global solutions to some quasilinear wave equations in three space dimensions. We first present a conditional result on the construction of nontrivial global solutions to a general system of quasilinear wave equations. Assuming that a global solution to the geometric reduced system exists and satisfies several well-chosen pointwise estimates, we find a matching exact global solution to the original wave equations. Such a conditional result is then applied to two types of equations which are of great interest. One is John's counterexamples $\Box u=u_t^2$ or $\Box u=u_t u_{tt}$, and the other is the 3D compressible Euler equations with no vorticity. We explicitly construct global solutions to the corresponding geometric reduced systems and show that these global solutions satisfy the required pointwise bounds. As a result, there exists a large family of nontrivial global solutions to these two types of equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.15008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear focusing Klein-Gordon equation in $1 + 1$ dimensions and the global space-time dynamics of solutions near the unstable soliton. Our main result is a proof of optimal decay, and local decay, for even perturbations of the static soliton originating from well-prepared initial data belonging to a subset of the stable manifold constructed in Bates-Jones (Dynamics reported, 1989) and Kowalczyk-Martel-Mu\~noz (J. Eur. Math. Soc., 2021). Our results complement those of Kowalczyk-Martel-Mu\~noz (J. Eur. Math. Soc., 2021) and confirm numerical results of Bizon-Chmaj-Szpak (J. Math. Phys., 2011) when considering nonlinearities $u^p$ with $p \geq 4$. In particular, we provide new information both local and global in space about asymptotically stable perturbations of the soliton under localization assumptions on the data.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of phase transitions associated to a large family of Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev interpolation inequalities on the sphere depending on one parameter.

Abstract: We study time averages for the norm of solutions to kinetic Fokker--Planck equations associated with general Hamiltonians. We provide fully explicit and constructive decay estimates for systems subject to a confining potential, allowing fat-tail, sub-exponential and (super-)exponential local equilibria, which also include the classic Maxwellian case. The key step in our estimates is a modified Poincar\'e inequality, obtained via a Lions--Poincar\'e inequality and an averaging lemma.</description>

      <title>Nondegeneracy of positive bubble solutions for generalized energy-critical Hartree equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show the nondegeneracy of positive bubble solutions for generalized energy-critical Hartree equations (NLH) \begin{equation*}
  -{\Delta u}\sts{x}
  -{\bm\alpha}\sts{N,\lambda}
  \int_{\R^N}
  { \frac{ u^{p}\sts{y}}{\pabs{\,x-y\,}{\lambda}} }\diff{y}\,
  u^{p-1}\sts{x}
  =0,\quad x\in \R^N \end{equation*} where $N\geq 3$, $0&lt;\lambda&lt;N$, $p=\frac{2N-\lambda}{N-2}$ and ${\bm\alpha}\sts{N,\lambda}$ is a normalized constant such that $ u(x)=\left(1+|x|^2\right)^{-\frac{N-2}{2} }$ is a bubble solution of the equation \eqref{NLH}. It solves an open nondegeneracy problem in \cite{MWX:Hartree, GMYZ2022cvpde} and generalizes the partial nondegeneracy results in \cite{DY2019dcds, GWY2020na, LTX2021} to the full range $0&lt;\lambda&lt;N$. The key observation is that by use of the stereographic projection $\mathcal{S}$, the weighted pushforward map $\mathcal{S}_*$ is one-to-one map between the null space of the linearized operator and the spherical harmonic function subspace $\mathcal{H}_1^{N+1}$ of degree one.</description>

Our approach is based on duality techniques \`a la Evans and a careful study of advection-diffusion equations. The optimality of the results is discussed by several examples.</description>

      <title>Incompressible Limit of Compressible Ideal MHD Flows inside a Perfectly Conducting Wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01142v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the incompressible limit of compressible ideal magnetohydrodynamic(MHD) flows in a reference domain where the magnetic field is tangential to the boundary. Unlike the case of transversal magnetic fields, the linearized problem of our case is not well-posed in standard Sobolev space $H^m~(m\geq 2)$, while the incompressible problem is still well-posed in $H^m$. The key observation to overcome the difficulty is a hidden structure contributed by Lorentz force in the vorticity analysis, which reveals that one should trade one normal derivative for two tangential derivatives together with a gain of Mach number weight $\varepsilon^2$. Thus, the energy functional should be defined by using suitable anisotropic Sobolev spaces. The weights of Mach number should be carefully chosen according to the number of tangential derivatives, such that the energy estimates are uniform in Mach number. Besides, part of the proof is similar to the study of compressible water waves, so our result opens the possibility to study the incompressible limit of free-boundary problems in ideal MHD.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking of extremals for the high order Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07568v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we give the first result about the precise symmetry and symmetry breaking regions of extremal functions for weighted second-order inequalities. Firstly, based on the work of C.-S. Lin [Comm. Partial Differential Equations, 1986], a new second-order Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type inequality will be established, i.e.,
  \begin{equation*}
  \int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|x|^{-\beta}|\mathrm{div} (|x|^{\alpha}\nabla u)|^2 \mathrm{d}x
  \geq \mathcal{S}\left(\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}
  |x|^{\beta}|u|^{p^*_{\alpha,\beta}} \mathrm{d}x\right)^{\frac{2}{p^*_{\alpha,\beta}}},\quad \mbox{for all}\ u\in C^\infty_0(\mathbb{R}^N),
  \end{equation*}
  for some constant $\mathcal{S}=\mathcal{S}(N,\alpha,\beta)&gt;0$, where
  \begin{align*}
  N\geq 5,\quad \alpha&gt;2-N,\quad \alpha-2&lt;\beta\leq \frac{N}{N-2}\alpha,\quad p^*_{\alpha,\beta}=\frac{2(N+\beta)}{N-4+2\alpha-\beta}.
  \end{align*}
  We obtain a symmetry breaking conclusion: when $\alpha&gt;0$ and $\beta_{\mathrm{FS}}(\alpha)&lt;\beta&lt; \frac{N}{N-2}\alpha$ where $\beta_{\mathrm{FS}}(\alpha):=
  -N+\sqrt{N^2+\alpha^2+2(N-2)\alpha}$, then the extremal function for the best constant $\mathcal{S}$, if it exists, is nonradial. Furthermore, we give a symmetry result when $\beta=\frac{N}{N-2}\alpha$ and $2-N&lt;\alpha&lt;0$...</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove a uniqueness result for the Calder\'{o}n problem for the quasilinear conductivity equation on a bounded domain $\R^2$. The proof of the result is based on the higher order linearization method, which reduces the problem to showing density of products of solutions to the linearized equation and their gradients. In contrast to the higher dimensional case, the proof involves delicate analysis of the correction terms of Bukhgeim type complex geometric solutions (CGOs), which have only limited decay. To prove our results, we construct suitable families of CGOs whose phase functions have and do not have critical points. We also combine stationary phase analysis with $L^p$ estimates for the correction terms of the CGOs.</description>

      <title>Weighted isoperimetric ratios and extension problems for fractional conformal Laplacians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a novel connection between the weighted isoperimetric problems and the weighted Poisson integrals of the extension problems for nonlocal elliptic operators.
  We first derive sharp inequalities for the weighted Poisson integrals associated with degenerate elliptic equations on the half-space and the unit ball, and classify their extremizers. The equations arise from the Caffarelli-Silvestre extension for the fractional Laplacian on the Euclidean space and its conformal transformation via the M\"obius transformation.
  We next interpret the above sharp inequalities in a conformal geometric viewpoint. For this aim, we formulate a variational problem involving a weighted isoperimetric ratio on a smooth metric measure space induced by a conformally compact Einstein (CCE) manifold. Then, we prove that the variational problem is closely linked to the Chang-Gonz\'alez extension for a fractional conformal Laplacian on the conformal infinity of the CCE manifold, and is reduced to the sharp inequality if the CCE manifold is either the Poincar\'e half-space or ball model. We also find a criterion that ensures the existence of a smooth extremizer of the variational problem, and present a relevant conjecture.</description>

      <title>A note on the $L^p$-Sobolev inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The usual Sobolev inequality in $\mathbb{R}^N$, asserts that $\|\nabla u\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^N)} \geq \mathcal{S}\|u\|_{L^{p^*}(\mathbb{R}^N)}$ for $1&lt;p&lt;N$ and $p^*=\frac{pN}{N-p}$, with $\mathcal{S}$ being the sharp constant. Based on a recent work of Figalli and Zhang [Duke Math. J., 2022], a weak norm remainder term of Sobolev inequality in bounded domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is established, i.e., for $\frac{2N}{N+1}&lt;p&lt;N$ there is $\mathcal{C}&gt;0$ such that \[ \|\nabla u\|^p_{L^p(\Omega)}
  -\mathcal{S}^p\|u\|^p_{L^{p^*}(\Omega)} \geq \mathcal{C}\|u\|_{L^{\bar{p}}_w(\Omega)}^{\max\{p,2\}}\|\nabla u\|^{p-\max\{2,p\}}_{L^p(\Omega)},\quad \mbox{for all}\ u\in C^\infty_0(\Omega)\setminus\{0\}, \] where $\bar{p}=p^*(p-1)/p$, and $\|\cdot\|_{L^{\bar{p}}_w(\Omega)}$ denotes the weak $L^{\bar{p}}$-norm. This result answers the long-standing open problem raised by Bianchi and Egnell [J. Funct. Anal., 1991]. Moreover, we establish a sharp upper bound of Sobolev inequality in $\mathbb{R}^N$.</description>

      <title>The Neumann problem of special Lagrangian type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Neumann problem for special Lagrangian type equations with critical and supercritical phases. These equations naturally generalize the special Lagrangian equation and the k-Hessian equation. By establishing uniform a priori estimates up to the second order, we obtain the existence result using the continuity method. The new technical aspect is our direct proof of boundary double normal derivative estimates. In particular, we directly prove the double normal estimates for the 2-Hessian equation in dimension 3. Moreover, we solve the classical Neumann problem by proving the uniform gradient estimate.</description>

      <title>Pointwise bounds on Dirichlet Green's functions for a singular drift term plus Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show optimal upper and lower pointwise estimates for the Green's function for elliptic operators that are the sum of a Laplacian term and a singular drift term that behaves like the inverse distance to the boundary, in not necessarily bounded chord-arc domains in $\R^{n}$ with $n\geq 3$. We assume the Dirichlet problem is solvable for such an operator, and also do not make any assumptions on the divergence of the drift term. Adopting standards arguments, while assuming the Bourgain estimate on the elliptic measure, this also shows doubling of the corresponding elliptic measure, in the chord-arc domains.</description>

      <title>Gradient ascent method for fully nonlinear parabolic differential equations with convex nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a generic numerical schemes for fully nonlinear parabolic PDEs on the full domain, where the nonlinearity is convex on the Hessian of the solution. The main idea behind this paper is reduction of a fully nonlinear problem to a class of simpler semilinear ones parameterized by the diffusion term. The contribution of this paper is to provide a directional maximum principle with respect to the diffusion coefficient for semilinear problems, which specifies how to modify the diffusion coefficient to approach to the solution of the fully nonlinear problem. While the objects of the study, diffusion coefficient, is infinite dimensional, the maximum direction of increase can be found explicitly. This also provides a numerical gradient ascent method for the fully nonlinear problem. To establish a proof-of-concept, we test our method in a numerical experiment on the fully nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for portfolio optimization under stochastic volatility model.</description>

      <title>Pointwise estimates for the fundamental solutions of higher order Schr\"{o}dinger equations in odd dimensions II: high dimensional case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, for any odd $n$ and any integer $m\geq1$ with $n&gt;4m$, we study the fundamental solution of the higher order Schr\"{o}dinger equation \begin{equation*} \mathrm{i}\partial_tu(x,t)=((-\Delta)^m+V(x))u(x,t),\quad t\in \mathbb{R},\,\,x\in \mathbb{R}^n, \end{equation*} where $V$ is a real-valued $C^{\frac{n+1}{2}-2m}$ potential with certain decay. Let $P_{ac}(H)$ denote the projection onto the absolutely continuous spectrum space of $H=(-\Delta)^m+V$, and assume that $H$ has no positive embedded eigenvalue. Our main result says that $e^{-\mathrm{i}tH}P_{ac}(H)$ has integral kernel $K(t,x,y)$ satisfying \begin{equation*} |K(t, x,y)|\le C(1+|t|)^{-(\frac{n}{2m}-\sigma)}(1+|t|^{-\frac{n}{2 m}})\left(1+|t|^{-\frac{1}{2 m}}|x-y|\right)^{-\frac{n(m-1)}{2 m-1}},\quad t\neq0,\,x,y\in\mathbb{R}^n, \end{equation*} where $\sigma=2$ if $0$ is an eigenvalue of $H$, and $\sigma=0$ otherwise. A similar result for smoothing operators $H^\frac{\alpha}{2m}e^{-\mathrm{i}tH}P_{ac}(H)$ is also given. The regularity condition $V\in C^{\frac{n+1}{2}-2m}$ is optimal in the second order case, and it also seems optimal when $m&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of excited states to $-\Delta u+u-u^3=0$ in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.08356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the uniqueness of several excited states to the ODE $\ddot y(t) + \frac{2}{t} \dot y(t) + f(y(t)) = 0$, $y(0) = b$, and $\dot y(0) = 0$ for the model nonlinearity $f(y) = y^3 - y$. The $n$-th excited state is a solution with exactly $n$ zeros and which tends to $0$ as $t \to \infty$. These represent all smooth radial nonzero solutions to the PDE $\Delta u + f(u)= 0$ in $H^1$. We interpret the ODE as a damped oscillator governed by a double-well potential, and the result is proved via rigorous numerical analysis of the energy and variation of the solutions. More specifically, the problem of uniqueness can be formulated entirely in terms of inequalities on the solutions and their variation, and these inequalities can be verified numerically.</description>

Abstract: We prove that a self-similar Cantor set in $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$ has a fractal uncertainty principle if and only if it does not contain a pair of orthogonal lines. The key ingredient in our proof is a quantitative form of Lang's conjecture in number theory due to Ruppert and Beukers &amp; Smyth. Our theorem answers a question of Dyatlov and has applications to open quantum maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Regularity Structures B-series which are used for describing solutions of singular stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). We define composition and substitutions of these B-series and as in the context of B-series for ordinary differential equations, these operations can be rewritten via products and Hopf algebras which have been used for building up renormalised models. These models provide a suitable topology for solving singular SPDEs. This new construction sheds a new light on these products and open interesting perspectives for the study of singular SPDEs in connection with B-series.</description>

      <title>Long time behaviour of the solution of Maxwell's equations in dissipative generalized Lorentz materials (II) A modal approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work concerns the analysis of electromagnetic dispersive media modelled by generalized Lorentz models. More precisely, this paper is the second of two articles dedicated to the long time behaviour of solutions of Maxwell's equations in dissipative Lorentz media, via the long time decay rate of the electromagnetic energy for the corresponding Cauchy problem. In opposition to the frequency dependent Lyapunov functions approach used in [Cassier, Joly, Rosas Mart\'inez, Z. Angew. Math. Phys. 74 (2023), 115], we develop a method based on the spectral analysis of the underlying non-self-adjoint operator of the model. Although more involved, this approach is closer to physics, as it uses the dispersion relation of the model, and has the advantage to provide more precise and more optimal results, leading to distinguish the notion of weak and strong dissipation.</description>

      <title>Algorithm for globally identifiable reparametrizations of ODEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural global parameter identifiability indicates whether one can determine a parameter's value in an ODE model from given inputs and outputs. If a given model has parameters for which there is exactly one value, such parameters are called globally identifiable. Given an ODE model involving not globally identifiable parameters, first we transform the system into one with locally identifiable parameters. As a main contribution of this paper, then we present a procedure for replacing, if possible, the ODE model with an equivalent one that has globally identifiable parameters. We first derive this as an algorithm for one-dimensional ODE models and then reuse this approach for higher-dimensional models.</description>

      <title>Perturbations in PDE-constrained optimal control decay exponentially in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For linear-quadratic optimal control problems (OCPs) governed by elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), we investigate the impact of perturbations on optimal solutions. Local perturbations may occur, e.g., due to discretization of the optimality system or {disturbed} problem data. Whereas these perturbations may exhibit global effects in the uncontrolled case, we prove that the ramifications are exponentially damped in space under stabilizability and detectability conditions. To this end, we prove a bound on the optimality condition's solution operator that is uniform in the domain size. Then, this uniformity is used in a scaling argument to show the exponential decay of perturbations in space. We numerically validate and illustrate our results by solving OCPs involving Helmholtz, Poisson, and advection-diffusion-reaction equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of small solitary waves for one-dimensional lattices of particles that each repel every other particle with a force that decays as a power of distance. For force exponents $\alpha+1$ with $\frac43&lt;\alpha&lt;3$, we employ fixed-point arguments to find near-sonic solitary waves having scaled velocity profiles close to non-degenerate solitary-wave profiles of fractional KdV or generalized Benjamin-Ono equations. These equations were recently found to approximately govern unidirectional long-wave motions in these lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a frictionless system coupled to an external Markovian environment. The quantum and classical evolution of such systems are described by the Lindblad and the Fokker-Planck equation respectively. We show that when such a system is given by an at most quadratically growing Hamiltonian and at most linearly growing real jump functions, the quantum and classical evolutions remain close on time scales much longer than Ehrenfest time. In particular, we show that the evolution of a density matrix by the Lindblad equation is close in trace norm to the quantization of the corresponding evolution by the Fokker-Planck equation. Such agreement improves upon recent results [arXiv:2403.09345, arXiv:2306.13717, arXiv:2307.05326], which proved long time agreement in weaker norms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a numerical method for simulation of incompressible viscous flows by integrating the technology of random vortex method with the core idea of Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Specifically, we utilize the filtering method in LES, interpreted as spatial averaging, along with the integral representation theorem for parabolic equations, to achieve a closure scheme which may be used for calculating solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. This approach circumvents the challenge associated with handling the non-locally integrable 3-dimensional integral kernel in the random vortex method and facilitates the computation of numerical solutions for flow systems via Monte-Carlo method. Numerical simulations are carried out for both laminar and turbulent flows, demonstrating the validity and effectiveness of the method.</description>
