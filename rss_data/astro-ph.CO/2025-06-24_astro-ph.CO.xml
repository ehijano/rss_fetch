      <title>Mapping the gas density with the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and patchy screening effects: a self-consistent comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The secondary anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide a wealth of astrophysical and cosmological information. Pairing measurements of the CMB temperature map obtained by DR5 of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) with the large-scale structure imaging survey conducted by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, DECaLS DR9, we investigate two effects that are sensitive to the gas density $\tau$: kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) and `patchy screening' (also known as `anisotropic screening'). In particular, we measure the stacked profiles around Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) at a mean redshift of $z \approx 0.7$. We detect the kSZ signal at 7.2$\sigma$, and we find a signal at $\sim 4.1\sigma$ for the patchy screening estimator, which is in excess relative to the kSZ signal. We attribute this excess to contamination from CMB lensing. We demonstrate the effect of lensing using $N$-body simulations, and we show that the screening signal is dominated by it. Accounting for lensing, our measurement places a 95\% upper bound on the optical depth of the Extended DESI LRG sample of $\tau &lt;$ 2.5 $10^{-4}$ for a mean value of the sample of $\tau \approx$ 1.6 $10^{-4}$. Furthermore, via hydro simulations, we show that the underlying optical depth signal measured by both effects (after removing the CMB lensing contribution) is in perfect agreement when adopting either a Compensated Aperture Photometry (CAP) filter or a high-pass filter. Consistent with previous measurements, we see evidence for excess baryonic feedback around DESI LRGs in the patchy screening measurement. Provided both effects are measured with high signal-to-noise, one can measure the amplitude ratio between them, which is proportional to the root-mean-square velocity of the host halo sample, and place constraints on velocity-sensitive models such as modified gravity and phantom dark energy.</description>

      <title>Time-frequency Imprints of Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals in Confusion Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting individual extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) is a major science goal of future space-based gravitational wave observatories such as Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and TianQin. However, matched-filtering can be challenging as waveform templates are required to be accurate over tens of thousands of orbits. We introduce the time-frequency spectrum as an alternative observable that can be exploited to reveal the chirping of EMRIs at the population level. We analytically calculate this spectrum and its correlators for parameterized populations of slowly chirping sources on quasi-circular orbits, assuming a simplified model of the antenna response for a proof of concept. We then exploit this observable to distinguish between Galactic white dwarf binaries and a possible EMRI population, and quantify the precision at which EMRI population parameters can be determined through a Fisher analysis. We explore several scenarios of EMRI populations and find that this new method may allow us to determine EMRI population parameters at an accuracy level of several percent. Since white dwarf binaries have much longer chirping timescales than the EMRIs do, EMRI population properties can still be determined even if their stochastic gravitational wave background has a power spectrum two orders of magnitude weaker than that of the Galactic white dwarf binaries.</description>

      <title>Consistent Initial Conditions for Early Modified Gravity in Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise initial conditions (ICs) are crucial for accurate computation in cosmological perturbation theory. We derive the consistent ICs for Horndeski theory in the Effective Field Theory (EFT) approach, assuming constant EFT functions at early times. We implement the ICs into the public Boltzmann code \texttt{EFTCAMB}, and demonstrate that the expected early-time behavior of perturbations and Weyl potential can be obtained with theory-consistent MG ICs. We identify significant deviations when comparing Cosmic Microwave Background angular power spectra in MG models obtained with consistent MG ICs versus inconsistent GR ICs. Our findings underline the importance of using accurate, theory-consistent MG ICs to ensure robust cosmological constraints on early MG models.</description>

      <title>Association between optically identified galaxy clusters and the underlying dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clusters of galaxies trace massive dark matter halos in the Universe, but they can include multiple halos projected along lines of sight. We study the halos contributing to clusters using the Cardinal simulation, which mimics the Dark Energy Survey data. We use the red-sequence-based cluster finding algorithm redMaPPer as a case study. For each cluster, we identify the halos hosting its member galaxies, and we define the main halo as the one contributing the most to the cluster's richness ($\lambda$, the estimated number of member galaxies). At $z=0.3$, for clusters with $\lambda &gt; 60$, the main halo typically contributes to $92\%$ of the richness, and this fraction drops to $67\%$ for $\lambda \approx 20$. Defining "clean" clusters as those with $\geq50\%$ of the richness contributed by the main halo, we find that $100\%$ of the $\lambda &gt; 60$ clusters are clean, while $73\%$ of the $\lambda \approx 20$ clusters are clean. Three halos can usually account for more than $80\%$ of the richness of a cluster. The main halos associated with redMaPPer clusters have a completeness ranging from $98\%$ at virial mass $10^{14.6}~h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ to $64\%$ at $10^{14}~h^{-1}M_{\odot}$. In addition, we compare the inferred cluster centers with true halo centers, finding that $30\%$ of the clusters are miscentered with a mean offset $40\%$ of the cluster radii, in agreement with recent X-ray studies. These systematics worsen as redshift increases, but we expect that upcoming surveys extending to longer wavelengths will improve the cluster finding at high redshifts. Our results affirm the robustness of the redMaPPer algorithm and provide a framework for benchmarking other cluster-finding strategies.</description>

      <title>Transient star B/R ratio and star formation in $z\gtrsim 1$ lensed galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extreme magnification from galaxy clusters and microlenses therein allows the detection of individual, luminous stars in lensed galaxies as transient events, and hence provides a valuable window into the high mass stellar population in $z&gt;1$ galaxies. As these bright stars can only be formed at specific ages, the relative abundance of transient events at blue (B) and red (R) optical wavelengths ($B/R$ ratio) can provide insights into the star formation history of lensed galaxies. Here, we forward model the transient detection rates in an idealized mock scenario to find that the $B/R$ ratio of strongly lensed $z&gt;1$ galaxies decreases quickly with increasing age. This ratio has comparatively low sensitivity to metallicity and dust attenuation, with no significant dependency on the stellar initial mass function. As a proof-of-concept, we show that a simple starburst cannot simultaneously fit the $B/R$ and spectral energy distribution of the ``Warhol'' arc ($z = 0.94$), indicating a more complex (recent) star formation history. Although limited only to lensed higher redshift galaxies in cluster fields, this result shows that the transient $B/R$ ratio could be used as an additional, complementary constraint on the star formation history of higher redshift galaxies in future works.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Distance Duality Relation with DESI DR2 and Transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cosmic Distance Duality Relation (CDDR), a fundamental assumption in modern cosmology, posits a direct link between angular diameter distance and luminosity distance. This study presents a comprehensive, model-independent, and data-driven test of the CDDR using a combination of cosmological observations, including Supernovae (SN), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Hubble parameter ($H(z)$) measurements. We employ both Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and a novel Compressed Point (CPI) method for reconstructing the CDDR, alongside four distinct parameterizations for potential deviations. Nuisance parameters, such as the supernova absolute magnitude and BAO scale, are rigorously handled via both joint numerical fitting (Method I) and analytic marginalization (Method II). Our findings reveal that while direct reconstruction of the CDDR exhibits no significant deviation (less than 1-$\sigma$) under specific prior assumptions, a notable departure emerges when the SH0ES prior is incorporated, suggesting a systematic influence from the Hubble constant tension. Independently, our parameterized analysis corroborates the consistency of CDDR and confirms the equivalence of the two constraint methodologies. We also find no significant evidence for cosmic opacity. A comparative assessment of reconstruction techniques indicates that GPR generally yields higher precision. These results emphasize the critical role of prior choices and statistical methods in CDDR analyses, providing valuable insights into fundamental cosmological principles and the ongoing Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Holographic dark energy models in $f(Q,T)$ gravity and cosmic constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new model that combines holographic dark energy with modified gravity $f(Q,T)$ to explore a possible explanation for the accelerated expansion of the universe. We incorporate the holographic principle into non-metric gravity with non-minimal matter coupling and introduce the Barrow holographic dark energy model to account for a tighter corrections, allowing for a more generalized discussion. Furthermore, we perform parameter estimation using the latest observational data, including Type Ia supernova, BAO and Hubble parameter direct measurements. Our results show that the model provides a theoretical framework to describe late-time cosmic evolution and the universe's accelerated expansion. Despite the additional complexity introduced, the model offers a viable approach for investigating dark energy within modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Radiatively Corrected Starobinsky Inflation and Primordial Gravitational Waves in Light of ACT Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonminimal coupling between the inflaton and the Ricci scalar plays a crucial role in shaping the predictions of single-field inflationary models. While a quartic potential with such coupling represents one of the simplest realizations compatible with cosmological observations, it generically receives important radiative corrections when the inflaton interacts with other fields, particularly those involved in the reheating process. In this work, we focus on radiative corrections arising from bosonic scalar couplings and study their impact on inflationary dynamics within the nonminimally coupled quartic potential framework. We demonstrate that bosonic corrections, unlike fermionic ones, yield predictions more compatible with the latest constraints from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6, especially when combined with Planck and BICEP/Keck data. We begin with a general model involving a gauge-singlet real scalar inflaton coupled to a complex scalar field, which could be the Standard Model Higgs or a GUT Higgs. As a concrete realization, we also investigate the case where the inflaton serves as a dark matter candidate through a Higgs portal interaction while highlighting its potential to generate observable levels of primordial gravitational waves. Notably, the nonminimally coupled inflation model studied here is field-theoretically equivalent to the Starobinsky model, and the inclusion of quantum corrections from scalar fields leads to characteristic imprints in the $(n_s, r)$ plane, allowing for refined constraints on scalar couplings from current and future observations.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Dark-Matter Spikes and the Final-Parsec Problem: Bayesian constraints from the NANOGrav 15-Year Gravitational-Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A self-interacting dark-matter (SIDM) density spike around merging supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may be able to supply the dynamical friction needed to shrink binaries from $\sim 1\, \mathrm{pc}$ to $\sim 10^{-2} \,\mathrm{pc}$, thereby resolving the long-standing ``final-parsec problem.'' Embedding the binary-halo system in a cosmological population model, we evolve the inspiral under the combined influence of gravitational-wave (GW) emission and SIDM drag, compute the resulting nanohertz GW background, and confront it with the NANOGrav 15 year pulsar-timing data. A six-parameter Bayesian analysis, performed with a Gaussian-process-accelerated Markov chain Monte Carlo, yields posterior constraints on the cross-section per unit mass and maximum circular velocity values that were consistent with independent galaxy-rotation and cluster-lensing limits. Within this parameter space, the SIDM spike remains intact, supplies sufficient friction to overcome the stellar depletion barrier, and produces a characteristic-strain spectrum that matches the NANOGrav signal as well as phenomenological astrophysical models.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Pitfalls of CPL Parametrization at High Redshifts: A Critical Assessment of the $\omega_{0}$$\omega_a$CDM Model with DESI DR2 BAO Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We critically assess the w0waCDM model, employing the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, w(z) = w0 + wa * z / (1 + z), using Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI Data Release 2 (DR2). While DESI BAO data broadly align with the standard LambdaCDM model, giving Omega_m = 0.3, our Markov Chain Monte Carlo fits show notable variation in best-fit values and degeneracy directions for w0waCDM across combinations of BAO observables (DV/rd, DM/rd, DH/rd, and DM/DH).
  When constrained solely by DESI BAO data, the w0waCDM model shows internal inconsistencies. Unlike LambdaCDM and wCDM, which fit all observables consistently, w0waCDM predicts lower values for rd-dependent observables and higher values for DM/DH. This conflict, including unphysical parameter compensation at high redshift, reflects limitations of the CPL form, especially its behavior at high redshift. The model compensates for poor individual fits by inflating Omega_m and driving wa to large negative values.
  Our findings suggest that DESI DR2 BAO data alone do not robustly constrain w0waCDM due to degeneracies and CPL limitations. These issues affect both rd-based and ratio observables like DM/DH. We recommend applying dynamical dark energy parametrizations directly to DV, DM, and DH measurements to better constrain wa across redshifts.</description>

      <title>NIKA2 Cosmological Legacy Survey: Blind detection of galaxy clusters in the COSMOS field via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) Clusters of galaxies, formed in the latest stages of structure formation, are unique cosmological probes. With the advent of large CMB surveys like those from the Planck satellite, the ACT and SPT telescopes, we now have access to a large number of galaxy clusters detected at millimeter wavelengths via the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. Nevertheless, it is interesting to complement them with high-angular-resolution (tens of arcseconds) observations to target the lowest-mass and highest-redshift clusters. This is the case of observations with the NIKA2 camera, which is installed on the IRAM 30--m telescope in Pico Veleta, Spain. We used the existing 150 GHz (2 mm) data from the NIKA2 Cosmological Legacy Survey (N2CLS) Large Program to blindly search for galaxy clusters in the well-known COSMOS field, across a 877 arcmin$^2$ region centered on (R.A., Dec.)$_{J2000}$ = (10h00m28.81s, +02d17m30.44s). We first developed a dedicated data reduction pipeline to construct NIKA2 maps at 2 mm. We then used a matched-filter algorithm to extract cluster candidates assuming a universal pressure profile to model the expected cluster tSZ signal. We computed the purity and completeness of the sample by applying the previous algorithm to simulated maps of the sky signal in the COSMOS field. We find a total of 16 cluster candidates at S/N &gt; 4, from which eight have either an optical or X-ray cluster (or group of galaxies) counterpart. This is the first blind detection of clusters of galaxies at mm wavelengths at 18" angular resolution. From this analysis, we confirm that NIKA2 and the IRAM 30--m telescope should be sensitive to low-mass clusters at intermediate and high redshift, complementing current and planned large tSZ-based cluster surveys.</description>

      <title>Comparison of $R_h=ct$ and $\Lambda$CDM using DESI DR1 measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use DESI DR1 BAO measurements of the ratio of tranvserse comoving distance to Hubble distance in order to test the compatibility of $R_h=ct$ over flat $\Lambda$CDM. For this purpose, we used Bayesian model selection to evaluate the efficacy of these models given the observed data. When we consider the BAO measurements up to redshift of 1.3, both models are equally favored. However, when we consider the Lyman-$\alpha$ QSO measurement at redshift of 2.33, we find Bayes factors of greater than 100 for flat $\Lambda$CDM over $R_h=ct$ using two different priors for $\Omega_m$, indicating that $\Lambda$CDM is decisively favored over $R_h=ct$. The same is the case when we combine all the measurements. Therefore, the DESI DRI measurements rule out $R_h=ct$ cosmology, albeit this is driven by the Lyman-$\alpha$ QSO measurement at $z=2.33$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An excess of soft X-ray emission (0.2-1 keV) above the contribution from the hot intra-cluster medium (ICM) has been detected in a number of galaxy clusters, including the Coma cluster. The physical origin of this emitting medium above hot ICM has not yet been determined, especially whether it be thermal or non-thermal. We aim to investigate which gas phase and gas structure more accurately reproduce the soft excess radiation from the cluster core to the outskirts, using simulations. By using the simulation TNG300, we predict the radial profile of thermodynamic properties and the Soft-X-ray surface brightness of 138 clusters within 5 $R_{200}$. Their X-ray emission is simulated for the hot ICM gas phase, the entire Warm-Hot medium, the diffuse and low-density Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM). Inside clusters, the soft excess appears to be produced by substructures of the WARM gas phase which host dense warm clumps (i.e, the Warm Circum-Galactic Medium, WCGM), and in fact the inner soft excess is strongly correlated with substructure and WCGM mass fractions. Outside of the virial radius, the fraction of WHIM gas that is mostly inside filaments connected to clusters boosts the soft X-ray excess. The more diffuse the gas is, the higher the soft X-ray excess beyond the virial region. The thermal emission of WARM gas phase, in the form of WCGM clumps and WHIM diffuse filaments, reproduces well the soft excess emission that was observed up to the virial radius in Coma and in the inner regions of other massive clusters. Moreover, our analysis suggests that soft X-ray excess is a proxy of cluster dynamical state, with larger excess being observed in the most unrelaxed clusters.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Sign-Reversal: Non-Parametric Reconstruction of Interacting Dark Energy with DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A direct interaction between dark energy and dark matter provides a natural and important extension to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We perform a non-parametric reconstruction of the vacuum energy ($w=-1$) interacting with cold dark matter using the cosmological data from DESI DR2, Planck CMB, and three SNIa samples (PP, DESY5, and Union3). By discretizing the coupling function $\beta(z)$ into 20 redshift bins and assuming a Gaussian smoothness prior, we reconstruct $\beta(z)$ without assuming any specific parameterization. The mean reconstructed $\beta(z)$ changes sign during cosmic evolution, indicating an energy transfer from cold dark matter to dark energy at early times and a reverse flow at late times. At high redshifts, $\beta(z)$ shows a $\sim 2\sigma$ deviation from $\Lambda$CDM. At low redshifts, the results depend on the SNIa sample: CMB+DESI and CMB+DESI+PP yield $\beta(z)$ consistent with zero within $2\sigma$, while CMB+DESI+DESY5 and CMB+DESI+Union3 prefer negative $\beta$ at $\sim2\sigma$. Both $\chi^2$ tests and Bayesian analyses favor the $\beta(z)$ model, with CMB+DESI DR2+DESY5 showing the most significant support through the largest improvement in goodness of fit ($\Delta\chi^2_{\rm MAP}=-17.76$) and strongest Bayesian evidence ($\ln\mathcal{B} = 5.98 \pm 0.69$). Principal component analysis reveals that the data effectively constrain three additional degrees of freedom in the $\beta(z)$ model, accounting for most of the improvement in goodness of fit. Our results demonstrate that the dynamical dark energy preference in current data can be equally well explained by such a sign-reversal interacting dark energy, highlighting the need for future observations to break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Flash Ionization of the Early Universe by Pop III.1 Supermassive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pop III.1 theory for supermassive black hole (SMBH) formation predicts that a substantial fraction of the early universe was ionized by supermassive stars at redshifts $z\sim20-30$, an era we refer to as ``The Flash''. This is followed by recombination to a mainly neutral state within a few tens of Myr. Here we discuss the implication of this ionization for the scattering optical depth of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), $\tau$. We find a fiducial contribution of $\tau_{\rm PopIII.1}\sim0.04$. Combining this with the contribution to reionization by standard galaxy populations at $z\lesssim 10$ with $\tau_{\rm gal}\simeq0.06$, yields a total of $\tau\simeq0.10$. As noted recently by several authors, such a value can help resolve apparent ``problems'' faced by $\Lambda$CDM of negative neutrino masses and dynamical dark energy that have been implied by recent Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).</description>

      <title>FuGa3D: Fast full-sky analysis of Galaxy catalogs in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present FuGa3D, a code for fast computation of correlation functions and power spectra for galaxy survey observables, including galaxy clustering and cosmic shear. We define the redshift-space correlation function (RCF) as the correlation function defined in the parameter space of two redshifts and an angular separation angle. Assuming that there is no preferred direction in the sky, these parameters fully define the relative position of two galaxies, independently of the assumed cosmological model. Once the RCF is constructed, it is easy to compute derived correlation metrics, such as the real-space clustering correlation function and its multipoles. We further define the redshift-space power spectrum as the harmonic counterpart of the RCF, and show that it can be computed efficiently using the discrete galaxy coordinates. We validate the code with simulated mock catalogs. Computing the RCF and the two-point correlation function at 1.5 Mpc (3 Mpc) resolution for a MICE simulation with 46 million galaxies, took 47 node-min for clustering only, and 7.3 node-hours with shear analysis included.</description>

      <title>A field-level reaction for screened modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a field-level reaction framework to emulate the nonlinear effects of screened modified gravity on the cosmic web. This approach is designed to enable field-level inference with data from Stage IV cosmological surveys. Building on the reaction method, which models the nonlinear matter power spectrum in modified gravity as corrections to a "pseudo" $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we extend the method to full field-level predictions by applying it to the output of $N$-body simulations, including both positions and velocities. We focus on modifications to gravity that are scale-independent at the linear level, allowing us to isolate and emulate nonlinear deviations, particularly screening effects. Our neural network predicts the field-level correction ("reaction") to a pseudo$\Lambda$CDM simulation whose linear clustering matches that of the target. The emulator achieves sub-percent accuracy across a broad range of summary statistics, including 0.4\% agreement in the matter power spectrum at scales $k &lt; 1$ Mpc$/h$, and 2\% accuracy in redshift-space distortion multipoles at $k &lt; 0.3$ Mpc$/h$. We also validate the emulator against $N$-body simulations with increased force resolution and time steps, confirming the robustness of its performance. These results demonstrate that our framework is a practical and reliable tool for incorporating screened modified gravity models into field-level cosmological inference, enabling stringent tests of extra fundamental forces at cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in a holographic superfluid model with non-linear terms beyond the probe limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the holographic s-wave superfluid model with 4th and 6th power self-interaction terms $\lambda |\psi|^4$ and $\tau |\psi|^6$ with considering the full back-reaction of the matter fields on the metric in the 3+1 dimensional bulk. The self-interaction terms are good at controlling the condensate to realize various phase transitions, such as the zeroth-order, first-order, and second-order phase transitions within the single condensate s-wave superfluid model. Therefore, in this work, we are able to investigate the influence of the back-reaction strength on the various phase transitions, including the zeroth and first order phase transitions. In addition, we confirm that the influence of the 4th and 6th power terms on the superfluid phase transition in the case of finite back-reaction are qualitative the same as in the probe limit, thus present universality. We also plot the special value $\lambda_s$ of the parameter $\lambda$ at different back-reaction strength, below which the condensate grows to an opposite direction and is important in controlling the order of the superfluid phase transitions. Comparing the influence of the back-reaction parameter and that of the higher-order nonlinear coefficients, we see that the back-reaction strength brings in both the effective couplings similar to the 4th power and 6th power terms.</description>

      <title>Identifying Anomalous DESI Galaxy Spectra with a Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tens of millions of spectra being captured by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) provide tremendous discovery potential. In this work we show how Machine Learning, in particular Variational Autoencoders (VAE), can detect anomalies in a sample of approximately 200,000 DESI spectra comprising galaxies, quasars and stars. We demonstrate that the VAE can compress the dimensionality of a spectrum by a factor of 100, while still retaining enough information to accurately reconstruct spectral features. We then detect anomalous spectra as those with high reconstruction error and those which are isolated in the VAE latent representation. The anomalies identified fall into two categories: spectra with artefacts and spectra with unique physical features. Awareness of the former can help to improve the DESI spectroscopic pipeline; whilst the latter can lead to the identification of new and unusual objects. To further curate the list of outliers, we use the Astronomaly package which employs Active Learning to provide personalised outlier recommendations for visual inspection. In this work we also explore the VAE latent space, finding that different object classes and subclasses are separated despite being unlabelled. We demonstrate the interpretability of this latent space by identifying tracks within it that correspond to various spectral characteristics. For example, we find tracks that correspond to increasing star formation and increase in broad emission lines along the Balmer series. In upcoming work we hope to apply the methods presented here to search for both systematics and astrophysically interesting objects in much larger datasets of DESI spectra.</description>

      <title>Standardizing a larger, higher-quality, homogeneous sample of reverberation-mapped H$\beta$ active galactic nuclei using the broad-line region radius-luminosity relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a high-quality, homogeneous sample of 157 H$\beta$ reverberation-mapped active galactic nuclei (RM AGNs) spanning redshifts $0.00308 \leq z \leq 0.8429$, which is approximately 3.8 times larger than the previously available high-quality homogeneous sample. Using the broad-line region radius$-$luminosity relation ($R-L$), which involves the broad H$\beta$ line time delay and the monochromatic luminosity at 5100\,\AA\,, we show that the sample is standardizable by using six spatially flat and nonflat cosmological models. The inferred cosmological model parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ uncertainties with those from better established baryon acoustic oscillation and Hubble parameter measurements, with the exception of two nonflat models that are ruled out by other data. The $R-L$ relation slope is found to be flatter ($\gamma=0.428 \pm 0.025$ in the flat $\Lambda$CDM model) than the slope expected from a simple photoionization model as well as the slope found previously for the smaller homogeneous sample. In addition, we find a mild dependence of H$\beta$ $R-L$ relation parameters as well as its intrinsic scatter on the Eddington ratio by comparing the $R-L$ relations for low- and high-accreting equal-sized subsamples. A future analysis of a larger homogeneous sample containing a broader range of luminosities and Eddington ratios is necessary to confirm the standardizability of H$\beta$ AGNs.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves as Complementary Probe of Dark Matter Indirect Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel cosmological probe of dark matter (DM) through inflationary primordial gravitational wave (GW) measurements highlighting its complementarity with traditional indirect detection. In scenarios like early matter domination (EMD), the thermal DM relic is diluted and then replenished via non-thermal production, leaving characteristic imprints on the primordial GW spectrum, inducing frequency-dependent suppressions in the GW amplitudes. By analysing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and employing Fisher forecast, we show that upcoming GW experiments have good potential to probe the DM parameter space involving its mass and annihilation cross-section. We show, for instance, LISA will be sensitive to DM mass range $[2\times 10^2-10^5]$ GeV. Furthermore, we identify a significant overlap of the GW missions' sensitivity reaches with the projected reach of future indirect searches like CTA with gamma rays, ANTARES, KM3NeT with neutrinos. In those overlapping regions of interests, we forecast on the GW experiments to estimate the precision of measurements. We show, for instance, that DM mass of $10^5$ GeV with an annihilation cross-section of $10^{-24}~{\rm cm}^3{\rm /s}$, and a mass of $10^4$ GeV with an annihilation cross-section of $2\times10^{-25}~{\rm cm}^3{\rm /s}$, lie within the projections of CTA. We find that whilst the former can be probed by ET with $\sim 1\%$ uncertainties, the latter can be probed by $\mu$-ARES with $\sim 7 \%$ uncertainties. Similarly, DM mass of $10^5$ GeV, with cross-section $10^{-23}~{\rm cm}^3{\rm /s}$ lies within the projection of ANTARES and KM3NeT, which can be probed by ET with $\sim 1\%$ uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Outflowing shocked gas dominates the NIR H$_2$ emission from the dual AGN NGC6240</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [Abridged] We present a multi-line study of the kinematics of the molecular and ionised gas phases in the central 2 kpc of NGC6240, based on JWST/NIRSpec and ALMA observations. We devised a new spectral-line fitting approach to de-blend rotating and non-rotating gas components, which is better tailored to the extreme feedback mechanisms at work in NGC6240. We find that ~65% of the Pa$\alpha$, H$_2$, and [FeII] line fluxes within the NIRSpec field of view arise from gas components that are kinematically decoupled from the stars. The NIR H$_2$ lines show the most deviation from the stars, with peak emission between the two rotating stellar structures. The PAH 3.3$\mu$m feature does not follow the NIR H$_2$ morphology, indicating that the latter does not trace PDRs. In the non-rotating gas components, we identify a biconical wind launched from the northern AGN, expanding along the minor axis of stellar rotation. This wind is dominated by ionised gas and, although it entrains some H$_2$, it does not show a H$_2$/PAH enhancement, suggesting either high UV irradiation or expansion along a relatively gas-free path. Furthermore, we find bright non-rotating gas emission between the two AGN and around the southern AGN, which we interpret as due to an outflow launched from the southern nucleus, coinciding with the molecular outflow previously studied in cold (sub-)millimeter tracers. The strong H$_2$/PAH enhancement measured in this region, coextensive with high velocity redshifted gas ($v\sim900$ km s$^{-1}$), suggests that the shocks responsible for the high H$_2$/PAH ratios are due to the outflow rather than to the collision of media during the merger. Our results show that the bulk of the NIR line emission in NGC6240 is decoupled from the stars, and that most of the warm H$_2$ is shock-excited and embedded in a powerful outflow, where it coexists with colder molecular gas.</description>

      <title>Dark Bondi Accretion Aided by Baryons and the Origin of JWST Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravothermal core collapse of self-interacting dark matter halos provides a compelling mechanism for seeding supermassive black holes in the early Universe. In this scenario, a small fraction of a halo, approximately $1\%$ of its mass, collapses into a dense core, which could further evolve into a black hole. We demonstrate that this process can account for the origin of JWST little red dots (LRDs) observed at redshifts $z\sim4-11$, where black holes with masses of $10^7{\rm\,M_\odot}$ can form within $500{\rm\,Myr}$ after the formation of host halos with masses of $10^{9}{\rm\,M_\odot}$. Even if the initial collapse region triggering general-relativistic instability has a mass on the order of one solar mass, the resulting seed can grow into an intermediate-mass black hole via Eddington accretion of baryonic gas. Subsequently, it can continue to grow into a supermassive black hole through dark Bondi accretion of dark matter particles. In this scenario, the majority of the black hole's mass originates from dark matter accretion rather than baryonic matter, naturally explaining the overmassive feature of LRDs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The false vacuum decay rate is of important meaning in understanding the Universe, such as the symmetry breaking process in the early universe and the age of our universe, which is conventionally calculated with the saddle-point approximation in the field theory. Utilizing the extension of the Wigner function in quantum field theory, we numerically calculate the decay rate of the false vacuum through path integral. We study the decay rate for the thermal fluctuation scenarios and its dependence on the potential shape, and found that the false vacuum decay occurs following an exponentially decay rate, and the speed of vacuum decay decreases when the initial energy of the system decreases and the potential height increase. The discrepancy between the simulation results and the theoretical prediction of finite temperature effective field theory is observed.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed the contribution of extragalactic DWD to the astrophysical SGWB could be detectable in the mHz regime by LISA. Conversely, the presence of this SGWB could hamper the detection of cosmological SGWB, which are one of the key targets of GW astronomy. We aim to confirm the spectrum of the extragalactic DWD SGWB and estimate its detectability with LISA under different assumptions. We also aim at understanding the main uncertainties in the spectrum and estimate if the signal could be anisotropic. We use population synthesis code COSMIC with several assumptions on binary evolution and initial conditions. We incorporate a specific treatment to account for the mass transfer and tidal torques after DWDs formation. Our study is in global agreement with previous studies, although we find a lower contribution at high frequencies, due to a different treatment of mass transfer in stellar binaries. We find that the uncertainties in the amplitude are dominated by the SFR model, and to a lesser degree by the binary evolution model. The inclusion of tidal effects and mass transfer episodes in DWDs can change the amplitude of the estimated SGWB up to a factor 3 at the highest frequencies. For all the models, we find that this SGWB could be potentially observable by LISA after 4 years. Under the hypothesis of an homogeneous Universe beyond 200Mpc, anisotropies associated to the astrophysical population of DWDs will likely not be detectable. We provide fits of this SGWB under different assumptions to be used by the community. We demonstrate variability in SGWB predictions, emphasizing uncertainties due to different astrophysical assumptions. We highlight the importance of determining the position of the knee in the SGWB spectrum, as it provides insights on mass transfer models. The prediction of this SGWB is of critical importance for LISA in the context of observing other SGWB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most recent data release from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) reveals a larger value of the scalar spectral tilt $n_s$, ruling out a broad class of inflationary attractors. In this paper, we consider inflationary models including the power law potential, the hilltop model, the polynomial $\alpha$-attractor and exponential $\alpha-$attractor, with non-minimally derivative coupling in the high friction limit, and show how the models can fit ACT data. We also derive constraints on the model parameters using the latest ACT data.</description>

      <title>Search for dark-matter axions beyond the quantum limit: the Cosmological Axion Sarov Haloscope (CASH) proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Firmly established in astrophysical observations, dark matter evades direct detection in experiments. Axions and axion-like particles are among the leading dark-matter candidates, and numerous attempts to detect them in laboratories have been performed. Here, we propose to advance these efforts substantially, extending the sensitivity for dark-matter axions in the mass range $(38-54)~\mu$eV down to the axion-photon couplings $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\lesssim \left(10^{-14}-10^{-15}\right)$ GeV$^{-1}$, motivated by generic models of Quantum Chromodynamics axion. Single-photon detectors operating at ultra-low temperatures are key elements of the experiment. The projected sensitivity will be reached in one year of data taking with magnetic field of $(1-10)$ T, making Cosmological Axion Sarov Haloscope (CASH) the most sensitive haloscope in this mass range.</description>

      <title>The gravitational wave echoes from the black hole with three-form fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study of massless three-form black hole, where the three-form fields are higher $p$-form gauge fields with $p=3$. These give rise to the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (Sch-dS)-like solution through an effective cosmological constant represented by $a_1$. We analyze this solution under gravitational perturbations and find that it exhibits a single-peak potential. For this case, no echoes are produced. Furthermore, we consider the massive case of the three-form fields by introducing a Stueckelberg field to restore gauge invariance and to investigate its effect on GWs at late times. In this case, the potential exhibits a double-peak structure, with the modified potential appearing beside the gravitational perturbation potential. We also examine the impact of the relevant parameters as well as the influence of the parameter $c_0$, which arises from the equation of motion of the Stueckelberg field. For a large value of $a_1$, the two peaks of the potentials are close together, while $c_0$ affects the amplitude and decay rate of the time-domain waveform, resulting in no echoes. For small values of $a_1$, the peaks of the potentials are widely separated and $c_0$ influences both the phase and the amplitude of the echoes. In addition, the quasinormal frequencies of the black hole are also calculated using both the WKB and Prony methods. As results, these provide a potential avenue for testing deviations from GR and probing possible signatures of quantum gravity through future GWs observations.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of machine learning techniques for feature selection and classification of Fast Radio Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients of extragalactic origin, exhibiting a wide range of physical and observational properties. Distinguishing between repeating and non-repeating FRBs remains a key challenge in understanding their nature. In this work, we apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to classify FRBs based on both primary observables from the CHIME catalog and physically motivated derived features. We evaluate three hybrid pipelines combining dimensionality reduction with clustering: PCA + k-means, t-SNE + HDBSCAN, and t-SNE + Spectral Clustering. To identify optimal hyperparameters, we implement a comprehensive grid search using a custom scoring function that prioritizes recall while penalizing excessive cluster fragmentation and noise. Feature relevance is assessed using principal component loadings, mutual information with the known repeater label, and permutation-based F\textsubscript{2} score sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that the derived features including redshift, luminosity, and spectral properties, such as the spectral index and the spectral running, significantly enhance the classification performance. Finally, we identify a set of FRBs currently labeled as non-repeaters that consistently cluster with known repeaters across all methods, highlighting promising candidates for future follow-up observations and reinforcing the utility of unsupervised approaches in FRB population studies.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: A search for late-time anisotropic screening of the Cosmic Microwave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the formation of the first stars, most of the gas in the Universe has been ionized. Spatial variations in the density of this ionized gas generate cosmic microwave background anisotropies via Thomson scattering, a process known as the ``anisotropic screening'' effect. We propose and implement for the first time a new estimator to cross-correlate unWISE galaxies and anisotropic screening, as measured by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and Planck satellite. We do not significantly detect the effect; the null hypothesis is consistent with the data at 1.7 $\sigma$ (resp. 0.016 $\sigma$) for the blue (resp. green) unWISE sample. We obtain an upper limit on the integrated optical depth within a 6 arcmin disk to be $\bar{\tau}&lt; 0.033$ arcmin$^2$ at 95\% confidence for the blue sample and $\bar{\tau}&lt; 0.057$ arcmin$^2$ for the green sample. Future measurements with Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 should detect this effect significantly. Complementary to the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, this probe of the gas distribution around halos will inform models of feedback in galaxy formation and baryonic effects in galaxy lensing.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints from the cross-correlation of DESI Luminous Red Galaxies with CMB lensing from Planck PR4 and ACT DR6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We infer the growth of large scale structure over the redshift range $0.4\lesssim z \lesssim 1$ from the cross-correlation of spectroscopically calibrated Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) selected from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) legacy imaging survey with CMB lensing maps reconstructed from the latest Planck and ACT data. We adopt a hybrid effective field theory (HEFT) model that robustly regulates the cosmological information obtainable from smaller scales, such that our cosmological constraints are reliably derived from the (predominantly) linear regime. We perform an extensive set of bandpower- and parameter-level systematics checks to ensure the robustness of our results and to characterize the uniformity of the LRG sample. We demonstrate that our results are stable to a wide range of modeling assumptions, finding excellent agreement with a linear theory analysis performed on a restricted range of scales. From a tomographic analysis of the four LRG photometric redshift bins we find that the rate of structure growth is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM with an overall amplitude that is $\simeq5-7\%$ lower than predicted by primary CMB measurements with modest $(\sim2\sigma)$ statistical significance. From the combined analysis of all four bins and their cross-correlations with Planck we obtain $S_8 = 0.765\pm0.023$, which is less discrepant with primary CMB measurements than previous DESI LRG cross Planck CMB lensing results. From the cross-correlation with ACT we obtain $S_8 = 0.790^{+0.024}_{-0.027}$, while when jointly analyzing Planck and ACT we find $S_8 = 0.775^{+0.019}_{-0.022}$ from our data alone and $\sigma_8 = 0.772^{+0.020}_{-0.023}$ with the addition of BAO data. These constraints are consistent with the latest Planck primary CMB analyses at the $\simeq 1.6-2.2\sigma$ level, and are in excellent agreement with galaxy lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Constraining cosmology with thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich maps: Minkowski functionals, peaks, minima, and moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (tSZ) is a sensitive probe of cosmology, as it traces the abundance of galaxy clusters and groups in the late-time Universe. Upcoming cosmic microwave background experiments such as the Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4 will provide low-noise and high-resolution component-separated tSZ maps covering a large sky fraction. The tSZ signal is highly non-Gaussian; therefore, higher-order statistics are needed to optimally extract information from these maps. In this work, we study the cosmological constraining power of several tSZ statistics -- Minkowski functionals (MFs), peaks, minima, and moments -- that have yielded promising results in capturing non-Gaussian information from other cosmological data. Using a large suite of halo-model-based tSZ simulations with varying $\Omega_{c}$ and $\sigma_{8}$ (154 cosmologies and over $800, 000$ maps, each $10.5\times10.5$ deg$^{2}$), we show that by combining these observables, we can achieve $\approx 29\times$ tighter constraints compared to using the tSZ power spectrum alone in an idealized noiseless case, with the MFs dominating the constraints. We show that much of the MF constraining power arises from halos below the detection threshold of cluster surveys, suggesting promising synergies with cluster-count analyses. Finally, we demonstrate that these statistics have the potential to deliver tight constraints even in the presence of noise. For example, using post-component-separation tSZ noise expected for SO, we obtain $\approx1.6\times$ and $\approx1.8\times$ tighter constraints than the power spectrum with MFs and all statistics combined, respectively. We show that the constraints from MFs approach the noiseless case for white-noise levels $\lesssim 1 \,\, \mu$K-arcmin.</description>

      <title>Fr\'echet Vectors as sensitive tools for blind tests of CMB anomalies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological data collected on a sphere, such as CMB anisotropies, are typically represented by the spherical harmonic coefficients, denoted as $a_{\ell m}$. The angular power spectrum, or $C_\ell$, serves as the fundamental estimator of the variance in this data. Alternatively, spherical data and their variance can also be characterized using Multipole Vectors (MVs) and the Fr\'echet variance. The vectors that minimize this variance, known as Fr\'echet Vectors (FVs), define the center of mass of points on a compact space, and are excellent indicators of statistical correlations between different multipoles. We demonstrate this using both simulations and real data. Through simulations, we show that FVs enable a blind detection and reconstruction of the location associated with a mock Cold Spot anomaly introduced in an otherwise isotropic sky. Applying these tools to the 2018 Planck maps, we implement several improvements on previous null tests of Gaussianity and statistical isotropy, down to arc-minute scales. Planck's MVs appear consistent with these hypotheses at scales $2 \leq\ell \leq 1500$ when the common mask is applied, whereas the same test using the FVs rejects them with significances between 5.3 and 8.2$\sigma$. The inclusion of anisotropic noise simulations render the FVs marginally consistent ($\geq 2\sigma$) with the null hypotheses at the same scales, but still rejects them at $3.5-3.7\sigma$ when we consider scales above $\ell=1500$, where the signal-to-noise is small. Limitations of the noise and/or foregrounds modeling may account for these deviations from the null hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Accelerating HI density predictions during the Epoch of Reionization using a GPR-based emulator on N-body simulations</title>

Abstract: Building fast and accurate ways to model the distribution of neutral hydrogen during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is essential for interpreting upcoming 21 cm observations. A key component of semi-numerical models of reionization is the collapse fraction field $f_{\text{coll}}(\mathbf{x})$, which represents the fraction of mass within dark matter halos at each location. Using high-dynamic range N-body simulations to obtain this is computationally prohibitive and semi-analytical approaches, while being fast, end up compromising on accuracy. In this work, we bridge the gap by developing a machine learning model that can generate $f_{\text{coll}}$ maps by sampling from the full distribution of $f_{\text{coll}}$ conditioned on the dark matter density contrast $\delta$. The conditional distribution functions and the input density field to the model are taken from low-dynamic range N-body simulations that are more efficient to run. We evaluate the performance of our ML model by comparing its predictions to a high-dynamic range N-body simulation. Using these $f_{\text{coll}}$ maps, we compute the HI and HII maps through a semi-numerical code for reionization. We are able to recover the large-scale HI density field power spectra $(k \lesssim 1\ h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1})$ at the $\lesssim10\%$ level, while the HII density field is reproduced with errors well below 10% across all scales. Compared to existing semi-analytical prescriptions, our approach offers significantly improved accuracy in generating the collapse fraction field, providing a robust and efficient alternative for modeling reionization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wide-angle and relativistic corrections to the Newtonian and flat-sky approximations are important for accurate modeling of the galaxy power spectrum of next-generation galaxy surveys. In addition to Doppler and Sachs-Wolfe relativistic corrections, we include the effects of lensing convergence, time delay and integrated Sachs-Wolfe. We investigate the impact of these corrections on measurements of the local primordial non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$, using two futuristic spectroscopic galaxy surveys, planned for SKAO2 and MegaMapper. In addition to the monopole, we include the quadrupole of the galaxy Fourier power spectrum. The quadrupole is much more sensitive to the corrections than the monopole. The combination with the quadrupole improves the precision on $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ by $\sim {{45}}\%$ and $\sim {{63}}\%$ for SKAO2 and MegaMapper respectively. {Neglecting the wide-angle and relativistic corrections produces a shift in $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ which is very sensitive to the magnification bias and the redshift evolution of the comoving number density. In the case of SKAO2, the shift in $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ is negligible -- since the contributions to the shift from integrated and non-integrated effects nearly cancel. For MegaMapper, there is only partial cancellation of integrated and non-integrated effects and the shift is $\sim {0.6} \, \sigma$.} We point out that some of the approximations made in the wide-angle and relativistic corrections may artificially suppress the shift in $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$.</description>

Abstract: In models of warm dark matter, there is an appreciable population of high momentum particles in the early universe, which free stream out of primordial over/under densities, thereby prohibiting the growth of structure on small length scales. The distance that a dark matter particle travels without obstruction, known as the free streaming length, depends on the particle's mass and momentum, but also on the cosmological expansion rate. In this way, measurements of the linear matter power spectrum serve to probe warm dark matter as well as the cosmological expansion history. In this work, we focus on ultra-light wave wave dark matter (WWDM) characterized by a typical comoving momentum $q_\ast$ and mass $m$. We first derive constraints on the WWDM parameter space $(q_\ast, m)$ using Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations due to a combination of the free-streaming effect and the white-noise effect. We next assess how the free streaming of WWDM is affected by three modified expansion histories: early matter domination, early dark energy, and very early dark energy.</description>

      <title>Prospects for probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes with the Hongmeng mission using the 21 cm global spectrum at cosmic dawn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes remains a pivotal challenge in modern cosmology. Exotic energy injections from dark matter annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking evaporation can alter the thermal and ionization histories of the early universe, leaving distinctive imprints on the 21 cm global spectrum. We assess the potential of the upcoming space project, the Hongmeng mission, to probe dark matter particles and PBHs using the 21 cm global spectrum. Under ideal conditions with 1000 hours of integration time and negligible foreground residuals, the Hongmeng project can reach sensitivities to dark matter annihilation cross sections and decay lifetimes to $\langle \sigma v \rangle \sim 10^{-28}\,\mathrm{cm^3\,s^{-1}}$ and $\tau \sim 10^{28}\,\mathrm{s}$, respectively, for dark matter particles with a mass of $10\,\mathrm{GeV}$. It can also probe PBHs with masses of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ and abundances as low as $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \simeq 10^{-6}$. These results indicate that the Hongmeng mission can improve current constraints on dark matter annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking radiation by nearly two orders of magnitude. Moreover, the Hongmeng mission surpasses current limits on sub-GeV dark matter probing and enables the probing of Hawking radiation from PBHs with masses above $10^{17}\,\mathrm{g}$, which remain undetectable through conventional cosmological means. Overall, the upcoming Hongmeng project holds great promise for advancing the investigation of both dark matter and PBHs, potentially deepening our understanding of the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Validation of reconstructed power spectra from simulated filtered maps for the Small Aperture Telescope survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a transfer function-based method to estimate angular power spectra from filtered maps for cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys. This is especially relevant for experiments targeting the faint primordial gravitational wave signatures in CMB polarisation at large scales, such as the Simons Observatory (SO) small aperture telescopes. While timestreams can be filtered to mitigate the contamination from low-frequency noise, usual methods that calculate the mode coupling at individual multipoles can be challenging for experiments covering large sky areas or reaching few-arcminute resolution. The method we present here, although approximate, is more practical and faster for larger data volumes. We validate it through the use of simulated observations approximating the first year of SO data, going from half-wave plate-modulated timestreams to maps, and using simulations to estimate the mixing of polarisation modes induced by an example of time-domain filtering. We show its performance through an example null test and with an end-to-end pipeline that performs inference on cosmological parameters, including the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. The performance demonstration uses simulated observations at multiple frequency bands. We find that the method can recover unbiased parameters for our simulated noise levels.</description>

      <title>Constraining circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves with CMB</title>

Abstract: Circular polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) offers a promising probe of the parity-violating physics of the early universe. In this paper, we propose a novel method to constrain the primordial circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves (GW) in the GHz range. An efficient conversion of gravitons to photons in a transverse cosmological magnetic field at the epoch of last scattering can generate excess chiral photons if the GW background is chiral in nature. This excess radiation distorts the CMB thermal black-body spectrum, which can be estimated by measuring the V-Stokes parameter in the CMB polarization. Using current upper limits on the angular power spectrum of circular polarization $C_l^{VV}$ from the CLASS, MIPOL, and SPIDER experiments, we obtain the most stringent constraints on the characteristic strain and circular polarization of the isotropic background of stochastic GWs at ${40\,\rm GHz}$ and ${150\,\rm GHz}$, respectively. Our work, therefore, provides an interesting possibility to constrain the circular polarization of high-frequency GWs using the V-mode polarization measurements of CMB.</description>

      <title>Sparsity covariance: a source of uncertainty when estimating correlation functions with a discrete sample of observations in the sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological observables rely heavily on summary statistics such as two-point correlation functions. In many practical cases (e.g. the weak-lensing cosmic shear), those correlation functions are estimated from a finite, discrete sample of measurements that are randomly distributed in the sky. The result then inevitably depends on the sample at hand, regardless of any experimental noise. This sample dependence is a source of uncertainty for cosmological observables which I call sparsity covariance. This article proposes a mathematical definition and a generic method to compute sparsity covariance. It is then applied to the concrete case of cosmic shear, showing that sparsity covariance mostly enhances shape noise, whose amplitude is determined by the apparent ellipticity of galaxies rather than their intrinsic ellipticity. In general, sparsity covariance is non-negligible when the signal-to-noise ratio of individual measurements in the sample is comparable to, or larger than, unity.</description>

      <title>Detecting galaxy-21-cm cross-correlation during reionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmic 21-cm signal promises to revolutionize studies of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Radio interferometers are aiming for a preliminary, low signal-to-noise (S/N) detection of the 21-cm power spectrum. Cross-correlating 21-cm with galaxies will be especially useful in these efforts, providing both a sanity check for initial 21-cm detection claims and potentially increasing the S/N due to uncorrelated residual systematics. Here we self-consistently simulate large-scale (1 Gpc) galaxy and 21-cm fields, computing their cross-power spectra for various choices of instruments as well as survey properties. We use 1080h observations with SKA-low AA* and HERA-350 as our benchmark 21-cm observations. We create mock Lyman alpha narrow-band, slitless and slit spectroscopic surveys, using benchmarks from instruments such as Subaru HyperSupremeCam, Roman grism, VLT MOONS, ELT MOSAIC, and JWST NIRCam. We forecast the resulting S/N of the galaxy-21-cm cross power spectrum, varying the galaxy survey area, depth and level of 21-cm foreground contamination for each pair of instruments. We find that the highest S/N is achievable through slitless, wide-area spectroscopic surveys, with the proposed Roman HLS survey resulting in a 55$\sigma$ detection of the cross power with 21-cm as observed with SKA-low AA* for our fiducial model. Narrow-band dropout surveys are unlikely to result in a detectable cross-power, due to their poor redshift localization. Slit spectroscopy can provide a high S/N detection of the cross power for SKA-low AA* observations. Specifically, the planned MOONRISE survey with MOONS on the VLT can result in a 3$\sigma$ detection, while a survey of comparable observing time using MOSAIC on the ELT can result in a 4$\sigma$ detection. Our results can be used to guide survey strategies, facilitating the detection of the galaxy-21-cm cross power spectrum.</description>

      <title>LiteBIRD Science Goals and Forecasts: constraining isotropic cosmic birefringence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic birefringence (CB) is the rotation of the photons' linear polarisation plane during propagation. Such an effect is a tracer of parity-violating extensions of standard electromagnetism and would probe the existence of a new cosmological field acting as dark matter or dark energy. It has become customary to employ cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarised data to probe such a phenomenon. Recent analyses on Planck and WMAP data provide a hint of detection of the isotropic CB angle with an amplitude of around $0.3^\circ$ at the level of $2.4$ to $3.6\sigma$. In this work, we explore the LiteBIRD capabilities in constraining such an effect, accounting for the impact of the more relevant systematic effects, namely foreground emission and instrumental polarisation angles. We build five semi-independent pipelines and test these against four different simulation sets with increasing complexity in terms of non-idealities. All the pipelines are shown to be robust and capable of returning the expected values of the CB angle within statistical fluctuations for all the cases considered. We find that the uncertainties in the CB estimates increase with more complex simulations. However, the trend is less pronounced for pipelines that account for the instrumental polarisation angles. For the most complex case analysed, we find that LiteBIRD will be able to detect a CB angle of $0.3^\circ$ with a statistical significance ranging from $5$ to $13 \, \sigma$, depending on the pipeline employed, where the latter uncertainty corresponds to a total error budget of the order of $0.02^\circ$.</description>

      <title>Diversifying halo structures in two-component self-interacting dark matter models via mass segregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), through gravothermal evolution driven by elastic self-scatterings, offers a compelling explanation for the observed diversity of inner halo densities. In this work, we investigate SIDM dynamics in a two-component dark matter model with mass ratios of order unity, motivated by an asymmetric dark matter framework that naturally evades constraints from relic abundance and mediator decay, while enabling strong, velocity-dependent self-interactions. We show that cross-component scatterings significantly enhance mass segregation, driving the formation of dense, core collapsed-like halos. This effect couples naturally to SIDM-induced diversity, introducing a new mechanism for generating structural variations beyond those arising from gravothermal evolution alone. Our results reveal a novel mechanism for reconciling SIDM with small-scale observational tensions by enabling shifts in central densities while preserving the flexibility to generate diverse halo structures. We further highlight that halo structural diversity may serve as a diagnostic of dark sector composition, opening a new observational window into the particle nature of SIDM.</description>

      <title>Cosmology in Extended Parameter Space with DESI Data Release 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations: A 2$\sigma$+ Detection of Nonzero Neutrino Masses with an Update on Dynamical Dark Energy and Lensing Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain constraints in a 12 parameter cosmological model using the recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release (DR) 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data, combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra (Planck Public Release, PR, 4) and lensing (Planck PR4 + Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release (DR) 6) data, uncalibrated Type Ia Supernovae (SNe) data from Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 5 (DESY5) samples, and Weak Lensing (WL: DES Year 1) data. The cosmological model consists of six $\Lambda$CDM parameters, and additionally, the dynamical dark energy parameters ($w_0$, $w_a$), the sum of neutrino masses ($\sum m_{\nu}$), the effective number of non-photon radiation species ($N_{\rm eff}$), the scaling of the lensing amplitude ($A_{\rm lens}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha_s$). Our major findings are the following: i) With CMB+BAO+DESY5+WL, we obtain the first 2$\sigma$+ detection of a nonzero $\sum m_{\nu} = 0.19^{+0.15}_{-0.18}$ eV (95%). Replacing DESY5 with Pantheon+ still yields a $\sim$1.9$\sigma$ detection. ii) The cosmological constant lies at the edge of the 95% contour with CMB+BAO+Pantheon+, but is excluded at 2$\sigma$+ with DESY5, leaving evidence for dynamical dark energy dataset-dependent and inconclusive. iii) With CMB+BAO+SNe+WL, $A_{\rm lens} = 1$ is excluded at $&gt;2\sigma$, while it remains consistent with unity without WL data - suggesting that the existence of lensing anomaly with Planck PR4 likelihoods may depend on non-CMB datasets. iv) The Hubble tension persists at 3.6-4.2$\sigma$ with CMB+BAO+SNe; WL data has minimal impact.</description>

      <title>Bracketing the soliton-halo relation of ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In theories of ultralight dark matter, solitons form in the inner regions of galactic halos. The observational implications of these depend on the soliton mass. Various relations between the mass of the soliton and properties of the halo have been proposed. We analyze the implications of these relations, and test them with a suite of numerical simulations. The relation of Schive et al. 2014 is equivalent to $(E/M)_{\rm sol}=(E/M)_{\rm halo}$ where $E_{\rm sol (halo)}$ and $M_{\rm sol (halo)}$ are the energy and mass of the soliton (halo). If the halo is approximately virialized, this relation is parametrically similar to the evaporation/growth threshold of Chan et al. 2022, and it thus gives a rough lower bound on the soliton mass. A different relation has been proposed by Mocz et al. 2017, which is equivalent to $E_{\rm sol}=E_{\rm halo}$, so is an upper bound on the soliton mass provided the halo energy can be estimated reliably. Our simulations provide evidence for this picture, and are in broad consistency with the literature, in particular after accounting for ambiguities in the definition of $E_{\rm halo}$ at finite volume.</description>

      <title>JWST lens model for A370: A very low dark matter fraction for a brightest cluster galaxy and lensing properties for the Dragon arc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new lens model for the $z=0.375$ galaxy cluster Abell 370 based on previously spectroscopically confirmed lensed galaxies and new lensed systems identified in JWST data, including recent data from the MAGNIF program. Based on the best models able to reproduce two radial arcs near the BCGs, we compare the stellar mass to the total mass from the lens model and find that the fraction of dark matter in the south BCG is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM while in the north BCG we find a very small amount of dark matter, more consistent with alternative models to $\Lambda$CDM. We discuss possible causes for this and conclude that additional data is needed to clarify the situation. We study the lensing properties, magnification, time delay and strength of the critical curve, along the Dragon arc, where previous studies have reported tens of alleged microlensing events from supergiant stars at $z=0.7251$. The new lens model is able to reproduce the distribution of microlensing events with great accuracy. Some of the microlensing events may be reinterpreted as long-period Cepheid in future observations. We consider this possibility and study in more detail the challenges for such detection from intervening microlenses.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of dark energy and late-time cosmic expansion using the Weighted Function Regression method</title>

Abstract: Recent data from multiple supernova catalogs and DESI, when combined with CMB, suggest a non-trivial evolution of dark energy (DE) at the $2.5-4\sigma$ CL. This evidence is typically quantified using the CPL parametrization of the DE equation-of-state parameter which corresponds to a first-order Taylor expansion around $a = 1$. However, this truncation is to some extent arbitrary and may bias our interpretation of the data, potentially leading us to mistake spurious features of the best-fit CPL model for genuine physical properties of DE. In this work, we apply the Weighted Function Regression (WFR) method to eliminate the subjectivity associated with the choice of truncation order. We assign Bayesian weights to the various orders and compute weighted posterior distributions of the quantities of interest. Using this model-agnostic approach, we reconstruct some of the most relevant background quantities, examining the robustness of our results against variations in the CMB and SNIa likelihoods. Furthermore, we extend our analysis by allowing for negative DE. Our results corroborate previous indications of dynamical DE, now confirmed for the first time using the WFR method. The combined analysis of CMB, BAO, and SNIa data favors a DE component that transitions from phantom to quintessence at redshift $z_{\rm cross}\sim 0.4$. The probability of phantom crossing lies between 96.21% and 99.97%, depending on the SNIa data set used, and hence a simple monotonic evolution of the DE density is excluded at the $\sim 2-4\sigma$ CL. Moreover, we find no significant evidence for a negative dark energy density below $z\sim 2.5-3$. Our reconstructions do not address the Hubble tension, yielding values of $H_0$ consistent with the Planck/$\Lambda$CDM range. If SH0ES measurements are not affected by systematic biases, the evidence for dynamical dark energy may need to be reassessed. [abridged]</description>

      <title>Do assumptions about the central density of subhaloes affect dark matter annihilation and lensing calculations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subhalo models play a critical role in dark matter annihilation predictions and galaxy-galaxy lensing studies; however, the internal structure of subhaloes remains highly uncertain. In particular, a growing body of evidence suggests that the central density of cuspy dark matter subhaloes is conserved in minor mergers, whereas empirical models of subhalo evolution -- calibrated using limited-resolution simulations -- often assume a drop in the central density. To assess the impact of these assumptions, we systematically explore how a wide range of initial mass profiles and tidal evolution prescriptions influence annihilation and lensing calculations, including the physically motivated Energy Truncation model, which explicitly preserves the central density of subhaloes. We find that annihilation calculations are very sensitive to the assumed inner density profile, and different models can produce more than an order of magnitude difference in the annihilation rate of individual subhaloes, and a factor of $\sim5$ in the total annihilation rate expected in the Milky Way. Since the innermost parts of haloes will always be difficult to resolve in simulations, we conclude that developing a theoretical understanding of subhalo evolution is crucial to be able to make accurate predictions of the dark matter annihilation signal. On the other hand, while the shear and convergence profiles used in galaxy-galaxy lensing are sensitive to the initial profile assumed (e.g., NFW versus Einasto), they are otherwise well-approximated by a simple stripping model in which the original profile is sharply truncated at a tidal radius.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Dark Matter Less-complex Wormhole Structures in Higher-Order Curvature Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter wormhole solutions coupled with anisotropic matter distribution are explored in higher-order curvature gravity. We derive the shape function for fuzzy wormholes and explore their possible stability. We study the embedding diagrams of the active gravitational mass associated with fuzzy dark matter wormholes by taking a certain shape function. Aiming to highlight the role of higher-order curvature gravity in the modeling of less complex fuzzy wormhole structures, we evaluate the complexity factor, the conservation equation, and null energy conditions. Our study reinforces more importance of uniformly distributed pressure effects throughout the less complex region than the emergence of energy density homogeneity in the stability of fuzzy wormholes. It is shown that the active gravitational mass of the fuzzy wormhole structures varies inversely with the radial distance, thereby suggesting the breaching of energy conditions at some arena of the Einasto index. Furthermore, it is revealed that stable fuzzy dark matter wormhole structures exist in nature in the surroundings of cold dark matter halos and galactic bulges. The important physics understood from our analysis is that in higher-order curvature gravity, feasible geometries of fuzzy dark matter wormholes exist naturally in the environments of different galactic haloes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Tails from Soft Theorem: A Short Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If a set of massive objects collide in space and the fragments disperse, possibly forming black holes, then this process will emit gravitational waves. Computing the detailed gravitational wave-form associated with this process is a complicated problem, not only due to the non-linearity of gravity but also due to the fact that during the collision and subsequent fragmentation the objects could undergo complicated non-gravitational interactions. Nevertheless the classical soft graviton theorem determines the power law fall-off of the wave-form at late and early times, including logarithmic corrections, in terms of only the momenta of the incoming and outgoing objects without any reference to what transpired during the collision. In this short review I shall explain the results and very briefly outline the derivation of these results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review is an up-to-date account of the use of numerical relativity to study dynamical, strong-gravity environments in a cosmological context. First, we provide a gentle introduction into the use of numerical relativity in solving cosmological spacetimes, aimed at both cosmologists and numerical relativists. Second, we survey the present body of work, focusing on general relativistic simulations, organised according to the cosmological history -- from cosmogenesis, through the early hot Big Bang, to the late-time evolution of universe. We discuss the present state-of-the-art, and suggest directions in which future work can be fruitfully pursued.</description>

      <title>Co-precession of a curved jet and compact accretion disk in M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observational constraints on the configuration of the black hole (BH)-accretion disk-jet system are crucial to understanding BH spin, accretion disk physics, and jet formation. The recently reported variation in the M87 jet position angle (PA) provides a novel avenue to explore these long-standing issues. The observed $\sim$ 11-year periodicity, spanning over two cycles, is consistent with the Lense-Thirring (LT) precession of a compact, tilted accretion disk. However, how such a compact region decouples from the larger-scale accretion flow remains an open question in current numerical simulations. The jet precession challenges the traditional view of a strictly collimated jet, revealing a subtle curvature in the jet's inner regions that dynamically links the jet to the spinning BH and successfully accounts for its unexpectedly wide inner projected profile. While continued long-term observations are needed to distinguish coherent precession from stochastic fluctuations in the disk or jet orientation, these results open a new window for probing BH systems through coordinated multi-scale observations and follow-on theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Echoes from beyond: Detecting gravitational-wave quantum imprints with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We assess the prospects for detecting gravitational wave echoes arising due to the quantum nature of black hole horizons with LISA. In a recent proposal, Bekenstein's black hole area quantization is connected to a discrete absorption spectrum for black holes in the context of gravitational radiation. Consequently, for incoming radiation at the black hole horizon, not all frequencies are absorbed, raising the possibility that the unabsorbed radiation is reflected, producing an echo-like signal closely following the binary coalescence waveform. In this work, we further develop this proposal by introducing a robust, phenomenologically motivated model for black hole reflectivity. Using this model, we calculate the resulting echoes for an ensemble of Numerical Relativity waveforms and examine their detectability with the LISA space-based interferometer. Our analysis demonstrates promising detection prospects and shows that, upon detection, LISA provides a direct probe of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. In addition, we find that the information extractable from LISA data offers valuable constraints on a wide range of quantum gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Rays Masquerading as Hot CGM Gas: An Inverse-Compton Origin for Diffuse X-ray Emission in the Circumgalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations have argued that Milky Way (MW), Andromeda, and lower-mass galaxies exhibit extended soft X-ray diffuse halos to radii $R\gtrsim100\,$kpc in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). If interpreted as thermal emission, the shallow surface brightness profiles $S_{X}\propto R^{-1}$ are difficult to explain and contradict other observations. We show that such halos instead arise from inverse Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons with GeV cosmic ray (CR) electrons. GeV electrons have ~Gyr lifetimes and escape the galaxy, forming a shallow extended profile out to $\gtrsim100\,$kpc, where IC off the CMB should produce soft, thermal-like X-ray spectra peaked at ~keV. The observed keV halo luminosities and brightness profiles agree well with those expected for CRs observed in the local interstellar medium (LISM) escaping the galaxy, with energetics consistent with known CRs from SNe and/or AGN, around galaxies with stellar masses $M_{\ast}\lesssim2\times 10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$. At higher masses observed X-ray luminosities are larger than predicted from IC and should be dominated by hot gas. In the MW+M31, the same models of escaping CRs reproduce gamma-ray observations if we assume an LISM-like proton-to-electron ratio and CR-pressure-dominated halo. In all other halos, the radio and $\gamma$-ray brightness is below detectable limits. If true, the observations provide qualitatively new constraints on CGM and CR physics: X-ray brightness directly traces the CR lepton energy density in the CGM. This agrees with LISM values within 10 kpc, which following the profile expected for escaping CRs in the CGM. The inferred CR pressure is a major part of the MW CGM pressure budget. X-ray surface brightness and luminosity allows one to further determine the CGM diffusivity at radii $\sim10-1000\,$kpc. These also agree with LISM values at small radii but increase in the CGM.</description>

      <title>Black hole solutions in the revised Deser-Woodard nonlocal theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the revised Deser-Woodard model of nonlocal gravity by reformulating the related field equations within a suitable tetrad frame. This transformation significantly simplifies the treatment of the ensuing differential problem while preserving the characteristics of the original gravitational theory. We then focus on static and spherically symmetric spacetimes in vacuum. Hence, we demonstrate that the gravitational theory under study admits a class of black hole solutions characterized by an inverse power-law correction to the Schwarzschild $g_{tt}$ metric function and a first-order perturbation of the $g_{rr}$ Schwarzschild component. Then, through a stepwise methodology, we analytically solve the full dynamics of the theory, finally leading to the reconstruction of the nonlocal distortion function, within which the new black hole solutions arise. Furthermore, we analyze the geometric properties of the obtained solutions and quantify the deviations from the Schwarzschild prediction. This work provides new insights into compact object configurations and advances our understanding of nonlocal gravity theories in the strong-field regime at astrophysical scales.</description>

Abstract: Assuming that (1) the universe underwent a post-inflationary accelerated expansion phase driven by a fluid with equation of state $P=w\rho$ and $-1&lt;w&lt;-1/3$, that (2) the cosmic horizon in an accelerating, quasi-de Sitter universe has a temperature inversely proportional to the proper size of the horizon, and that (3) we are static observers, we calculate the frozen-in density of a stable particle of mass $m$ produced by the cosmic horizon that does not undergo any number-changing processes in the late universe. We find that, as a function of the equation of state and the temperature when radiation domination starts and the quasi-de Sitter phase ends, the mass of the dark matter producing the observed cosmological abundance via this mechanism ranges from 10 keV up to close to the Planck scale.</description>

      <title>A Redshift Survey of the Coma Cluster (A1656): Understanding the Nature of Subhalos in the Weak-lensing Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the physical properties of weak-lensing subhalos in the Coma cluster of galaxies using data from galaxy redshift surveys. The data include 12989 galaxies with measured spectroscopic redshifts (2184 from our MMT/Hectospec observation and 10807 from the literature). The $r$-band magnitude limit at which the differential spectroscopic completeness drops below 50% is 20.2 mag, which is spatially uniform in a region of 4.5 deg$^{2}$ where the weak-lensing map of Okabe et al. (2014) exists. We identify 1337 member galaxies in this field and use them to understand the nature of 32 subhalos detected in the weak-lensing analysis. We use Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) in the line-of-sight velocity domain to measure the mean velocity, the velocity dispersion, and the number of subhalo galaxies by mitigating the contamination from the interloping galaxies. Using subhalo properties calculated with GMM, we find no significant difference in the redshift space distribution between the cluster member galaxies and subhalos. We find that the weak-lensing mass shows strong correlations with the number of subhalo member galaxies, velocity dispersion, and dynamical mass of subhalos with power-law slopes of $0.54^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$, $0.93^{+0.35}_{-0.32}$, and $0.50^{+0.31}_{-0.18}$, respectively. The slope of the mass--velocity dispersion relation of the weak-lensing subhalos appears shallower than that of the galaxy clusters, galaxy groups, and individual galaxies. These results suggest that the combination of redshift surveys with weak-lensing maps can be a powerful tool for better understanding the nature of subhalos in clusters.</description>

      <title>Analogue of Chern-Simons invariant in non-metricity gravity and axion cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a pseudo-scalar quantity, which is an analogue of the Chern-Simons invariant, in the framework of non-metricity gravity. By considering the coupling between the pseudo-scalar quantity and the axion, we give scenarios which may solve the problems of the axion misalignment, the $S_8$ problem, and the beginning of inflation. When the phase transition associated with the spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry of the electroweak theory or grand unified theories (GUTs) occurs, the pseudo-scalar quantity has a non-trivial value, which induces the misalignment of the axion field and axion particles are produced. If the gradient of the potential is small, the $S_8$ problem might be solved. We also propose a mechanism which induces inflation by the misalignment of the axion field generated by the phase transition of the GUTs.</description>

      <title>Could Planck Star Remnants be Dark Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the end state of gravitational collapse under quantum gravity effects and propose that Planck Star Remnants (PSR), formed via nonsingular bounces, could serve as viable dark matter candidates. Within the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology, we model the collapse of a homogeneous matter distribution and show that the classical singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce at the Planck density. By analytically matching the Friedmann Lemaitre Robertson Walker (FLRW) interior to an exterior Schwarzschild spacetime using the Israel junction conditions, we demonstrate that the bounce remains causally hidden from external observers, avoiding any observable re-expansion. This naturally leads to the formation of stable, non-radiating PSR, whose radius coincides with the Schwarzschild radius when the black hole mass approaches the Planck mass as a result of Hawking evaporation. We suggest that such remnants may originate from evaporating primordial black holes in the early universe, and estimate the relic abundance needed for PSR to account for the observed dark matter density. We also discuss some crucial differences between PSR and previous proposals of Planck mass relics. The scenario is shown to be consistent with existing astrophysical and cosmological constraints, offering a unified framework connecting quantum gravitational collapse, and the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The suppression of cosmological structure at small scales is a key signature of dark matter (DM) produced via freeze-in in the low-mass regime. We present a comprehensive analysis of its impact, incorporating recent constraints from Milky Way satellite counts, strong gravitational lensing with JWST data, and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. We adopt a general strategy to translate existing warm dark matter (WDM) bounds into lower mass limits for a broad class of DM candidates characterized by quasi-thermal phase space distributions. The benefits of this approach include computational efficiency and the ability to explore a wide range of models. We derive model-independent bounds for DM produced via two-body decays, scatterings, and three-body decays, and apply the framework to concrete scenarios such as the Higgs portal, sterile neutrinos, axion-like particles, and the dark photon portal. Results from specific models confirm the validity of the model-independent analysis.</description>
