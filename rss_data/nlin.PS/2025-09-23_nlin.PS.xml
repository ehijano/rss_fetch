      <title>One- and two-dimensional solitons under the action of the inverted cubic-quintic nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The usual cubic-quintic (CQ) nonlinearity is proved to sustain one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) broad (flat-top) solitons. In this work, we demonstrate that 1D and 2D soliton families can be supported, in the semi-infinite bandgap (SIBG), by the interplay of a lattice potential and the nonlinearity including self-defocusing cubic and self-focusing quintic terms, with the sign combination inverted with respect to the usual CQ nonlinearity. The families include fundamental and dipole solitons in 1D, and fundamental, quadrupole, and vortex solitons in 2D. The power, shapes, and stability of the solitons are reported. The results are strongly affected by the positions of the solitons in SIBG, the families being unstable very close to or very far from the SIBG's edge. The inverted CQ nonlinearity, considered in this work, sustains sharp 1D and 2D stable solitons, which can be naturally used as bit pixels in photonic data-processing applications.</description>

      <title>Coarsening dynamics for spiral and nonspiral waves in active Potts models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the domain-growth dynamics of $q$-state active Potts models ($q = 3$--$8$) under the cyclically symmetric conditions using Monte Carlo simulations on square and hexagonal lattices. By imposing active cyclic flipping of states, finite-length waves emerge in the long-term limit. This study focuses on coarsening dynamics from an initially random mixture of states to these moving-domain states. When spiral waves appear in the final state, the correlation length follows the Lifshitz--Allen--Cahn (LAC) law ($\propto t^{1/2}$) until saturation is observed at the characteristic wavelength. By contrast, in the case of nonspiral waves, the growth rate is raised prior to the saturation, leading to a transient increase in the coarsening exponent. Moreover, the mean cluster size exhibits a similar form of transient increase under most of the conditions. In factorized symmetry modes at $q=6$, domains composed of two or three states similarly follow the LAC law. Finally, this study confirmed that the choice of lattice type (square or hexagonal) and update scheme (Metropolis or Glauber) does not alter the dynamic behavior.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium flow: From Snapshots to Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific data, from cellular snapshots in biology to celestial distributions in cosmology, often consists of static patterns from underlying dynamical systems. These snapshots, while lacking temporal ordering, implicitly encode the processes that preserve them. This work investigates how strongly such a distribution constrains its underlying dynamics and how to recover them. We introduce the Equilibrium flow method, a framework that learns continuous dynamics that preserve a given pattern distribution. Our method successfully identifies plausible dynamics for 2-D systems and recovers the signature chaotic behavior of the Lorenz attractor. For high-dimensional Turing patterns from the Gray-Scott model, we develop an efficient, training-free variant that achieves high fidelity to the ground truth, validated both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our analysis reveals the solution space is constrained not only by the data but also by the learning model's inductive biases. This capability extends beyond recovering known systems, enabling a new paradigm of inverse design for Artificial Life. By specifying a target pattern distribution, we can discover the local interaction rules that preserve it, leading to the spontaneous emergence of complex behaviors, such as life-like flocking, attraction, and repulsion patterns, from simple, user-defined snapshots.</description>

      <title>Chimera states on m-directed hypergraphs</title>

Abstract: Chimera states are synchronization patterns in which coherent and incoherent regions coexist in systems of identical oscillators. This elusive phenomenon has attracted a lot of interest and has been widely analyzed, revealing several types of dynamical states. Most studies involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each oscillator exerts and receives the same interaction from neighboring ones, modeled thus via symmetric networks. However, real-world systems often have non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body) interactions. From previous studies, it is known that chimera states are more elusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while easier to be found when the latter are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In this work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal higher-order structures, called m-directed hypergraphs, and we show that, not only the higher-order topology allows the emergence of chimera states despite the nonreciprocal coupling, but also that chimera states can emerge because of the directionality. Finally, we compare the latter results with the ones resulting from non-reciprocal pairwise interactions: their elusiveness confirms that the observed phenomenon is thus due to the presence of higher-order interactions. The nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through phase reduction theory.</description>

      <title>Diverse patterns of pebbles on sand on Mars and Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On Mars, fields of sand dunes contrast with the general cratered, rocky terrain commonly seen from orbit. Near the equator, in Gale Crater, images from the rover, Curiosity, also reveal order on smaller scales: ripples on dunes, and ground patterns in scattered sites. The patterns include relatively inconspicuous forms: evenly spaced pebble-size rocks (termed clasts) on meter-scale domains of wind-blown sand. Here, we examine quantitatively several such domains on both Mars and Earth. The domains are significantly more orderly than expected by chance. Moreover, many are hyperuniform, a self-organized state recently recognized in diverse active materials and biological systems but that appears novel for planetary surfaces. We use numerical simulations to examine how diverse clast distributions, ranging from random and hyperuniform dispersions to distinct alignments, can emerge spontaneously from clast displacements induced by gravity, combined with the wind-driven evolution of the surface, sand transport, and ripple migration. This paper highlights easily overlooked self-organized patterns beyond distinct geometric patterns on at least two planets, and the simulations help understand the information coded in clast domains. Moreover, our methods and findings potentially have quantitatively implications for studies of issues of global significance on Earth, including dust emission from vast areas into the atmosphere.</description>
