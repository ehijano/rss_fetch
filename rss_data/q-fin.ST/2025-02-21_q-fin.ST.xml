      <title>Causality Analysis of COVID-19 Induced Crashes in Stock and Commodity Markets: A Topological Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a comprehensive causality analysis of the US stock and commodity markets during the COVID-19 crash. The dynamics of different sectors are also compared. We use Topological Data Analysis (TDA) on multidimensional time-series to identify crashes in stock and commodity markets. The Wasserstein Distance WD shows distinct spikes signaling the crash for both stock and commodity markets. We then compare the persistence diagrams of stock and commodity markets using the WD metric. A significant spike in the $WD$ between stock and commodity markets is observed during the crisis, suggesting significant topological differences between the markets. Similar spikes are observed between the sectors of the US market as well. Spikes obtained may be due to either a difference in the magnitude of crashes in the two markets (or sectors), or from the temporal lag between the two markets suggesting information flow. We study the Granger-causality between stock and commodity markets and also between different sectors. The results show a bidirectional Granger-causality between commodity and stock during the crash period, demonstrating the greater interdependence of financial markets during the crash. However, the overall analysis shows that the causal direction is from stock to commodity. A pairwise Granger-causal analysis between US sectors is also conducted. There is a significant increase in the interdependence between the sectors during the crash period. TDA combined with Granger-causality effectively analyzes the interdependence and sensitivity of different markets and sectors.</description>

      <title>Modelling the term-structure of default risk under IFRS 9 within a multistate regression framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lifetime behaviour of loans is notoriously difficult to model, which can compromise a bank's financial reserves against future losses, if modelled poorly. Therefore, we present a data-driven comparative study amongst three techniques in modelling a series of default risk estimates over the lifetime of each loan, i.e., its term-structure. The behaviour of loans can be described using a nonstationary and time-dependent semi-Markov model, though we model its elements using a multistate regression-based approach. As such, the transition probabilities are explicitly modelled as a function of a rich set of input variables, including macroeconomic and loan-level inputs. Our modelling techniques are deliberately chosen in ascending order of complexity: 1) a Markov chain; 2) beta regression; and 3) multinomial logistic regression. Using residential mortgage data, our results show that each successive model outperforms the previous, likely as a result of greater sophistication. This finding required devising a novel suite of simple model diagnostics, which can itself be reused in assessing sampling representativeness and the performance of other modelling techniques. These contributions surely advance the current practice within banking when conducting multistate modelling. Consequently, we believe that the estimation of loss reserves will be more timeous and accurate under IFRS 9.</description>
