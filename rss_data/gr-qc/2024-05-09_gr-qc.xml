      <title>Modified gravity/entropic gravity correspondence due to graviton mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some time ago, it has been suggested that gravitons can acquire mass in the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking of diffeomorphisms through the condensation of scalar fields [Chamseddine and Mukhanov, JHEP, 2010]. Taking this possibility into account, in the present paper, first we show how the graviton mass intricately reshapes the gravitational potential akin to a Yukawa-like potential at large distances. Notably, this long-range force modifies the Newton's law in large distances and might explain the phenomena of dark matter. The most important finding in the present paper is the derivation of a modified Newtons law of gravity by modifying the Verlindes entropic force relation due to the graviton contribution. The graviton contribution to the entropy basically measures the correlation of graviton and matter fields which then reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy at the horizon. This result shows the dual description of gravity: in the language of quantum information and entropy the gravity can be viewed as an entropic force, however in terms of particles and fields, it can be viewed as a longe range force. Further we have recovered the corrected Einstein field equations as well as the $\Lambda$CDM where dark matter emerges as an apparent effect.</description>

      <title>The impact of plasma on the relaxation of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our universe is permeated with interstellar plasma, which prevents propagation of low-frequency electromagnetic waves. Here, we show that two dramatic consequences arise out of such suppression; (i) if plasma permeates the light ring of a black hole, electromagnetic modes are screened entirely from the gravitational-wave signal, changing the black hole spectroscopy paradigm; (ii) if a near vacuum cavity is formed close to a charged black hole, as expected for near equal-mass mergers, ringdown "echoes" are excited. The amplitude of such echoes decays slowly and could thus serve as a silver bullet for plasmas near charged black holes.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariant perturbations of static spatially compact LRS II spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework to describe completely general first-order perturbations of static, spatially compact, and locally rotationally symmetric class II spacetimes within the theory of general relativity. The perturbation variables are by construction covariant and identification gauge invariant and encompass the geometry and the thermodynamics of the fluid sources. The new equations are then applied to the study of isotropic, adiabatic perturbations. We discuss how the choice of frame in which perturbations are described can significantly simplify the mathematical analysis of the problem and show that it is possible to change frames directly from the linear level equations. We find explicitly that the case of isotropic, adiabatic perturbations can be reduced to a singular Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem, and lower bounds for the values of the eigenfrequencies can be derived. These results lay the theoretical groundwork to analytically describe linear, isotropic, and adiabatic perturbations of static, spherically symmetric spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Non-singular black hole by gravitational decoupling and some thermodynamic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational decoupling allows to obtain new solutions of general relativity. In this paper, we obtain new solutions of the Einstein field equations which describe non-singular black holes. We consider Hayward and Bardeen regular black holes as seed spacetimes and apply gravitational decoupling to obtain a new non-singular solution. We show that anisotropic energy-momentum tensor can spoil the regularity condition in the centre of a black hole. We solve the Einstein field equation and obtain new solutions that possess a de Sitter core and have Schwarzschild behaviour in infinity. We also analyse the thermodynamic properties of the obtained solutions.</description>

      <title>Transverse expansion of the metric at null hypersurfaces I. Uniqueness and application to Killing horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first in a series of two papers where we analyze the transverse expansion of the metric on a general null hypersurface. In this paper we obtain general geometric identities relating the transverse derivatives of the ambient Ricci tensor and the transverse expansion of the metric at the null hypersurface. We also explore the case where the hypersurface exhibits a generalized symmetry generator, namely a privileged vector field in the ambient space which, at the hypersurface, is null and tangent (including the possibility of zeroes). This covers the Killing, homothetic, or conformal horizon cases, and, more generally, any situation where detailed information on the deformation tensor of the symmetry generator is available. Our approach is entirely covariant, independent on any field equations, and does not make any assumptions regarding the topology or dimension of the null hypersurface. As an application we prove that the full transverse expansion of the spacetime metric at a non-degenerate Killing horizon (also allowing for bifurcation surfaces) is uniquely determined in terms of abstract data on the horizon and the tower of derivatives of the ambient Ricci tensor at the horizon. In particular, the transverse expansion of the metric in $\Lambda$-vacuum spacetimes admitting a non-degenerate horizon is uniquely determined in terms of abstract data at the horizon.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Timing Noise from Brownian Motion of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) reported a signal at nanohertz frequencies consistent with a stochastic gravitational wave background. Here, I show that the Brownian motion of the Sun as a result of its random gravitational interactions with the cluster of thousands of unmodeled Main-belt asteroids of radii &lt;20km, not included in the Solar system ephemeris, introduces correlated timing noise for pulsars with the magnitude and frequencies of the reported signal.</description>

      <title>The irreducible mass of a regular rotating black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents an analysis of regular rotating black hole solutions within the framework of Teleparallel Equivalent to General Relativity (TEGR). The study evaluates the total energy and derives an analytical expression for the irreducible mass of a regular black hole. The results reveal the significance of these regular black holes as approximations of real astrophysical objects. The investigation explores the behavior of the total energy for different surfaces and its value at spatial infinity. Additionally, the article addresses the instability of the inner horizon and examines the inertial acceleration of an observer inside the inner horizon.</description>

      <title>A review of wormhole stabilization in f(R) gravity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been proven that in standard Einstein gravity, exotic matter (i.e. matter violating the point-wise and averaged weak and null energy conditions) is required to stabilize traversable wormholes. Quantum field theory permits these violations due to the quantum coherent effects found in any quantum field [1]. Even reasonable classical scalar fields violate the energy conditions. In the case of the Casimir effect and squeezed vacuum states, these violations have been experimentally proven. It is advantageous to investigate methods of minimizing the use of exotic matter. One such area of interest is extended theories of Einstein gravity. It has been claimed that in some extended theories, stable traversable wormholes solutions can be found without the use of exotic matter. There are many extended theories of gravity and in this review paper we first explore f(R) theories and then explore some wormhole solutions in f(R) theories including Lovelock gravity.</description>

      <title>Geodesic motion of particles in the vicinity of the $\kappa$-deformed Schwarzchild Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the geodesic motion of a test particle around the Schwarzchild black hole in a $\kappa$-deformed space-time. We compute a modified Lagrangian to obtain the $\kappa$-deformed effective potential and find the particle trajectories based on the constants of motion. For the same value of angular momentum, we obtain a significant deformation in the orbits of the particles due to the non-commutativity of the $\kappa$-deformed space-time. The deformation parameter becomes more significant for higher values of the angular momentum. The radius of the individual trajectories become smaller and their velocities decrease compared to the commutative case. The radius of the innermost stable circular orbit ($r_{ISCO}$) is also found using the modified effective potential. Though the equations get modified due to the non-commutativity of the $\kappa$-deformed space-time, the $r_{ISCO}$ remains the same. We then study a large number of freely streaming particles moving in this $\kappa$-deformed space-time and analyze the movement of these particles around the black hole due to the non-commutativity of the space-time. We concentrate on particles with different angular momentum moving around the black hole. We find that the motion of the particles are modified due to the non-commutativity of the space-time. The particles move slower along their respective trajectories in the deformed space-time. So, they remain closer to the black hole for a longer period of time, indicating that the accretion of freely streaming particles around the black hole would be modified by the non-commutativity of the space-time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we analyse a dynamical wormhole solution with two fluids system (one isotropic and homogeneous and the other being inhomogeneous and anisotropic in nature) as the matter at the throat. We choose two different forms of Equation of State(EoS) and investigate two solutions of the wormhole geometry. The properties to ensure existence and traversability has been analysed. Also, the model of the dynamic wormhole has been examined for a possibility of the Emergent Universe(EU) model in cosmological context. Finally, for the dynamical wormholes so obtained, Null Energy Condition(NEC) has been examined near the throat.</description>

      <title>Detecting environmental effects in gravitational waves from binaries perturbed by periodic forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the gravitational wave (GW) emission of sources perturbed by periodic dynamical forces which do not cause secular evolution in the orbital elements. We construct a corresponding post-Newtonian waveform model and provide estimates for the detectability of the resulting GW phase perturbations, for both space-based and future ground-based detectors. We validate our results by performing a set of Bayesian parameter recovery experiments with post-Newtonian waveforms. We find that, in stark contrast to the more commonly studied secular dephasing, periodic phase perturbations do not suffer from degeneracies with any of the tested vacuum binary parameters. We discuss the applications of our findings to a range of possible astrophysical scenarios, finding that such periodic perturbations may be detectable for massive black hole binaries embedded in circum-binary discs, extreme mass-ratio inspirals in accretion discs, as well as stellar-mass compact objects perturbed by tidal fields. We argue that modelling conservative sub-orbital dynamics opens up a promising new avenue to detect environmental effects in binary sources of GWs that should be included in state-of-the-art waveform templates.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fluctuations in the Interior of Black Holes and Backreactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the propagation of the quantum field perturbations in the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole. The interior of the black hole is like an anisotropic cosmological background which expands in one extended direction while contracting in azimuthal directions. Solving the quantum mode functions approximately, we calculate the expectation values of physical quantities such as the energy density $\langle \rho \rangle$ and pressure $\langle P\rangle$ as measured by an observer in the interior of the black hole. We employ a combination of the $\zeta$ function regularization and dimensional regularization schemes to regularize the UV divergences in the energy momentum tensor associated to these quantum perturbations. By solving the Einstein field equations, we calculate the quantum backreactions induced in the background geometry. We speculate that the effects of quantum fluctuations in the interior of the black hole can be measured by the exterior observer.</description>

      <title>A meta inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency test of general relativity with gravitational wave signals from compact binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences is a promising tool to test the validity of general relativity (GR) in a highly dynamical strong-field regime. There are now a variety of tests of GR performed on the observed compact binary signals. In this paper, we propose a new test of GR that compares the results of these individual tests. This meta inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency test (IMRCT) involves inferring the final mass and spin of the remnant black hole obtained from the analyses of two different tests of GR and checking for consistency. If there is a deviation from GR, we expect that different tests of GR will recover different values for the final mass and spin, in general. We check the performance of the meta IMRCT using a standard set of null tests used in various gravitational-wave analyses: the original IMRCT, parameterized phasing tests (TIGER and FTI) and the modified dispersion test. However, the meta IMRCT is applicable to any tests of GR that infer the initial masses and spins or the final mass and spin, including ones that are applied to binary neutron star or neutron star--black hole signals. We apply the meta IMRCT to simulated quasi-circular GR and non-GR binary black hole (BBH) signals as well as to eccentric BBH signals in GR (analyzed with quasicircular waveforms). We find that the meta IMRCT gives consistency with GR for the quasi-circular GR signals and picks up a deviation from GR in the other cases, as do other tests. In some cases, the meta IMRCT finds a significant GR deviation for a given pair of tests (and specific testing parameters) while the individual tests do not, showing that it is more sensitive than the individual tests to certain types of deviations. In addition, we also apply this test to a few selected real compact binary signals and find them consistent with GR.</description>

      <title>Scalar Perturbations in Nonsingular Universes from Interacting Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the stability of scalar perturbations in nonsingular models which emerge from an interacting vacuum component. The analysis developed in this paper relies on two phenomenological choices for the energy exchange between a nonrelativistic fluid and a vacuum component. In both scenarios it can be shown that closed models may furnish nonsingular orbits of physical interest in phase space once a decelerated past era is connected to a graceful exit to late-time acceleration. Regarding such configurations as background spacetimes we introduce scalar perturbations in order to examine the stability of these models in a high energy domain. We explicitly show that the vacuum perturbation is not an independent variable and diverges as dynamics approaches the bounce. This feature assigns a rather unstable signature to the dynamics making the choices for the energy transfer ill defined at least for nonsingular configurations at the bounce scale.</description>

      <title>Wormhole restrictions from quantum energy inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wormhole solutions, bridges that connect different parts of spacetime, were proposed early in the history of General Relativity. Soon after, it was shown that all wormholes violate classical energy conditions, non-negativity constraints on contractions of the stress-energy tensor. Since these are violated by quantum fields, it was believed that wormholes can be constructed in the context of semiclassical gravity. But negative energies in quantum field theory are not without restriction: quantum energy inequalities (QEIs) control renormalized negative energies averaged over a geodesic. Thus, QEIs provide restrictions on the construction of wormholes. This work is a review of the relevant literature, focusing on results where QEIs restrict traversable wormholes. Both 'short' and 'long' (without causality violations) wormhole solutions in the context of semiclassical gravity are examined. A new result is presented on constraints on the Maldacena, Milekhin and Popov 'long' wormhole from the recently derived doubled smeared null energy condition.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures of departures from classical black hole scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a general investigation into gravitational wave signatures of modifications to scattering of gravitational radiation from black holes. Such modifications may be present due to the quantum dynamics that makes black holes consistent with quantum mechanics, or in other models for departures from classical black hole behavior. We propose a parameterization of the corrections to scattering as a physically meaningful, model-independent, and practical bridge between theoretical and observational aspects of the problem; this parameterization can incorporate different models in the literature. We then describe how these corrections influence the gravitational wave signal, e.g. of a body orbiting a much more massive black hole. In particular, they generically change the rate of energy emission; this effect can be leveraged over many orbits of inspiral to enhance the sensitivity to small corrections, as has been noticed in simple models. We provide preliminary estimates of the sensitivity of future gravitational wave observations to these corrections, and outline further work to be done to connect both to a more fundamental theory of quantum black holes, and to realistic observational situations.</description>

Abstract: We study the interplay of the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture (TCC) and the swampland distance conjecture (SDC) in the context of multifield dark energy in a curved field space. In this scenario, the phase of accelerated expansion is realized as non-geodesic motion in a highly-curved field space, reminiscent of models developed in the context of inflation. The model features a stable attractor solution with near constant equation of state $w\simeq -1$, and predicts that the current era of accelerated expansion is eternal. The latter implies an eventual conflict with the TCC, which holds that the duration of any epoch of cosmic acceleration is bounded by the requirement that the large-scale observable universe is blind to Planck-scale early universe physics. This tension can be resolved by an interplay with the distance conjecture: for suitable parameter values, the apparent violation of the TCC occurs well after the fields have traversed a Planckian distance. The SDC then predicts a breakdown of the effective field theory (EFT) before the TCC can be violated. We derive the constraints on the model arising from the SDC+TCC and the de Sitter conjecture. We demonstrate that the model can be consistent with both swampland conjectures and observational data from Planck 2018 and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.</description>

      <title>A Space/Time Interchange Symmetry of Rotating AdS Black Holes in General Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the previously known local inversion symmetry of the five-dimensional Kerr-AdS metric that relates the over-rotating black hole to the under-rotating one and reinterpret it as an interchanging symmetry between time and the longitudinal angular coordinates. We generalize this to all $D$ dimensions, including $D=4$, thereby enlarging the trivial linear $\mathbb Z_N$ symmetry of the $N=\lfloor(D-1)/2\rfloor$ longitudinal angular coordinates to the nonlinearly realized $\mathbb Z_{N+1}$ symmetry that involves time.</description>

Abstract: Modern inference schemes for the neutron star equation of state (EoS) require large numbers of stellar models constructed with different EoS, and these stellar models must capture all the behavior of stable stars. I introduce termination conditions for sequences of stellar models for cold, non-rotating neutron stars that are guaranteed to identify all stable stellar configurations up to arbitrarily large central pressures along with an efficient algorithm to build accurate interpolators for macroscopic properties. I explore the behavior of stars with both high- and low-central pressures. Interestingly, I find that EoS with monotonically increasing sound-speed can produce multiple stable branches (twin stars) and that large phase transitions at high densities can produce stable branches at nearly any mass scale, including sub-solar masses, while still supporting stars with $M &gt; 2\,M_\odot$. I conclude with some speculation about the astrophysical implications of this behavior.</description>

      <title>Locally Scale Invariant Chern-Simons Actions in 3+1 Dimensions and Their Emergence From 4+2 Dimensional 2T-Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traditional Chern-Simons (CS) terms in 3+1 dimensions that modify General Relativity (GR), Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), typically lack scale invariance. However, a locally scale invariant and geodesically complete framework for the Standard Model (SM) coupled to GR was previously constructed by employing a tailored form of local scale (Weyl) symmetry. This refined SM+GR model closely resembles the conventional SM in subatomic realms where gravitational effects are negligible. Nevertheless, it offers an intriguing prediction: the emergence of new physics beyond the traditional SM and GR near spacetime singularities, characterized by intense gravity and substantial deviations in the Higgs field. In this study, we expand upon the enhanced SM+GR by incorporating Weyl invariant CS terms for gravity, QCD, and QED in 3+1 dimensions, thereby integrating CS contributions within the locally scale-invariant and geodesically complete paradigm. Additionally, we establish a holographic correspondence between the new CS terms in 3+1 dimensions and novel 4+2 dimensional CS-type actions within 2T-physics. We demonstrate that the Weyl transformation in 3+1 dimensions arises from 4+2 general coordinate transformations, which unify the hidden extra 1+1 large (not curled up) dimensions with the evident 3+1 dimensions. By leveraging the newfound local conformal symmetry, the augmented and geodesically complete SM+GR+CS introduces innovative tools and perspectives for exploring classical field theory aspects of black hole and cosmological singularities in 3+1 dimensions, while the 4+2 dimensional connection unveils deeper facets of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Constraints on primordial black holes from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBH) can efficiently form black hole binaries in the early universe. We update the resulting constraints on PBH abundance using data from the third observational run (O3) of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. To capture a wide range of PBH scenarios, we consider a variety of mass functions, including critical collapse in the QCD epoch in the presence of non-Gaussianities. Applying hierarchical Bayesian analysis to a population binaries consisting of primordial and astrophysical black holes, we find that, in every scenario, the PBHs can make up at most $f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-3}$ of dark matter in the mass range $1-200~M_\odot$. The shape and strength of the constraints are insensitive to the type of non-Gaussianities, the modifications to the mass function during the QCD epoch, or the modelling of the astrophysical PBH population.</description>

      <title>Scattering for the Wave Equation on de Sitter Space in All Even Spatial Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any $n\geq4$ even, we establish a complete scattering theory for the linear wave equation on the $(n+1)$-dimensional de Sitter space. We prove the existence and uniqueness of scattering states, and asymptotic completeness. Moreover, we construct the scattering map taking asymptotic data at past infinity $\mathscr{I}^-$ to asymptotic data at future infinity $\mathscr{I}^+$. Identifying $\mathscr{I}^-$ and $\mathscr{I}^+$ with $S^n,$ we prove that the scattering map is a Banach space isomorphism on $H^{s+n}(S^n)\times H^{s}(S^n),$ for any $s\geq1.$
  The main analysis is carried out at the level of the model equation obtained by differentiating the linear wave equation $\frac{n}{2}$ times in the time variable. The main result of the paper follows from proving a scattering theory for this equation. In particular, for the model equation we construct a scattering isomorphism from asymptotic data in $H^{s+\frac{1}{2}}(S^n)\times H^s(S^n)\times H^s(S^n)$ to Cauchy initial data in $H^{s+\frac{1}{2}}(S^n)\times H^{s+\frac{1}{2}}(S^n)\times H^{s-\frac{1}{2}}(S^n)$.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Spacetime With Multipole Moments: The Minimal Size Conjecture, Black Hole Shadow, and Gravitational Wave Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explicitly construct the vacuum solution of Einstein's equations with prescribed multipole moments. By observing the behavior of the multipole spacetime metric at small distances, we conjecture that for a sufficiently large multipole moment, there is a minimal size below which no object in nature can support such a moment. The examples we have investigated suggest that such minimal size scales as $(M_n)^{1/(n+1)}$ (instead of $(M_n/M)^{1/n}$), where $M$ is the mass and $M_n$ is the $n$th order multipole moment. With the metric of the "multipole spacetime", we analyze the shape of black hole shadow for various multipole moments and discuss the prospects of constraining the moments from shadow observations. In addition, we discuss the shift of gravitational wave phase with respect to those of the Kerr spacetime, for a test particle moving around an object with this set of multipole moments. These phase shifts are required for the program of mapping out the spacetime multipole moments based on gravitational wave observations of extreme mass-ratio inspirals.</description>

Abstract: We revisit gravitational wave (GW) memory as the key to measuring spacetime symmetries, extending beyond its traditional role in GW searches. In particular, we show how these symmetries may be probed via displacement and spin memory observations, respectively. We further find that the Einstein Telescope's (ET) sensitivity enables constraining the strain amplitude of a displacement memory to 2% and that of spin memory to 22%. Finally, we point out that neglecting memory could lead to an overestimation of measurement uncertainties for parameters of binary black hole (BBH) mergers by about 10% in ET.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Time Crystals from Gauss-Bonnet Gravity in Four Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate various cosmological aspects of a 4-Dimensional Gauss-Bonnet Lagrangian, which is integrated into the Einstein Lagrangian with an arbitrary sign, using the Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. We consider a general potential term, $V(a)$, that depends on the scale factor $a$, and we analyze several scenarios by investigating the critical points of the dynamical equations and stability conditions to understand how the universe's behavior is affected by the Gauss-Bonnet term. Our research suggests that choosing the negative sign, this integration allows for the spontaneous breaking of time reflection symmetry. This can lead to the generation of a bounce universe even with a normal matter sector, marking a significant departure from traditional theories. Furthermore, we examine the possibility of a time-crystal universe, showing that under certain circumstances, the theory might give rise to cyclic universes.</description>

      <title>Superradiant clouds may be relevant for close compact object binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bosonic fields (within suitable mass range) may be collectively generated by rotating black holes through the black hole superradiance process. The resulting black hole is surrounded by a ``cloud" of particles whose wave function populates the superradiant energy level of the black hole. For comparable mass ratio binary black hole systems, it has been suggested that these clouds often deplete at large binary separations because of level mixing effects. As a result, these clouds may not be dynamically relevant for black hole and neutron star binaries that enter the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA and LISA detection frequency band. In this work, we point out that the common envelope process during a compact binary evolution may bring the binary to $\sim 0.01$AU in hundreds to thousands of years, so that depletion caused by certain level mixings are no longer important. We derive a relevant regime of binary parameters where the clouds are still present for binary entering the LISA band, and show that common envelop process does enlarge such parameter regime. When the binary separation further decreases due to gravitational wave radiation, we discuss the impact of possible cloud mass transfer between the binary objects.</description>

      <title>Polytropic stellar structure in 5$\mathcal{D}$ Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polytropic stars are useful tools to learn about stellar structure without the complexity of comprehensive stellar models. These models rely on a certain power-law correlation between the star's pressure and density. This paper proposes a polytropic star model to investigate some new features in the context of $5\mathcal{D}$ Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity using the Finch-Skea {\em ansatz} [{\em M. R. Finch and J. E. Skea, Classical and Quantum Gravity 6, 467 (1989)}]. Analytical results are better described by graphical representations of the physical parameters for various values of Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $\alpha$. The solution for a specific compact object, EXO 1785 - 248, with radius $\mathfrak{R} = 8.849_{-0.04}^{+0.04}$ km and mass $\mathcal{M} = 1.3 \pm 0.02~\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$, is shown here. We analyze the essential physical attributes of the star, which reveal the influence of the coupling parameter $\alpha$ on the values of the parameters. Ultimately, we have concluded that our current model is realistic because it satisfies all the physical criteria for an acceptable model.</description>

Abstract: We introduce Sinyukov-like tensors, a special kind of conformal Killing tensors. In Robertson-Walker space-times, they have the perfect-fluid form and are the candidate for the dark term of the newly proposed Conformal Killing Gravity, by Harada. We study the Friedmann equations: in addition to ordinary matter they contain a dark term and a Lambda term that parametrize di Sinyukov-like tensor. The expression for H(z) is tested on cosmological data based on cosmic chronometers CC or including baryon acoustic oscillations BAO. There is a large incertitude in Omega_Lambda and Omega_dark that may become negative, but their sum is close to Omega_Lambda of Lambda-CDM. We solve the equation for the evolution, in linear approximation, of the density contrast in matter-dominated universe. The main result is that the presence of the dark sector and the Lambda term gives no significative deviation from Lambda-CDM and ordinary GR results for the overdensity growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare two different numerical methods to integrate in time spatially delocalized initial densities using the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation system as the evolution law. The basic equation is a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with an auto-gravitating potential created by the wave function density itself. The latter is determined as a solution of Poisson's equation modelling, e.g., non-relativistic gravity. For reasons of complexity, we treat a one-dimensional version of the problem whose numerical integration is still challenging because of the extreme long-range forces (being constant in the asymptotic limit). Both of our methods, a Strang splitting scheme and a basis function approach using B-splines, are compared in numerical convergence and effectivity. Overall, our Strang-splitting evolution compares favourably with the B-spline method. In particular, by using an adaptive time-stepper rather large one-dimensional boxes can be treated. These results give hope for extensions to two spatial dimensions for not too small boxes and large evolution times necessary for describing, for instance, dark matter formation over cosmologically relevant scales.</description>

      <title>Signatures of quantum geometry from exponential corrections to the black hole entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been recently shown in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125 (2020) 041302] that microstate counting carried out for quantum states residing on the horizon of a black hole leads to a correction of the form $\exp(-A/4l_p^2)$ in the Bekenstein-Hawking form of the black hole entropy. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to obtain the possible form of the spacetime geometry from the entropy of the black hole for a given horizon radius. The uniqueness of this solution for a given energy-momentum tensor has also been discussed. Remarkably, the black hole geometry reconstructed has striking similarities to that of noncommutative-inspired Schwarzschild black holes [Phys. Lett. B 632 (2006) 547]. We also obtain the matter density functions using Einstein field equations for the geometries we reconstruct from the thermodynamics of black holes. These also have similarities to that of the matter density function of a noncommutative-inspired Schwarzschild black hole. The conformal structure of the metric is briefly discussed and the Penrose-Carter diagram is drawn. We then compute the Komar energy and the Smarr formula for the effective black hole geometry and compare it with that of the noncommutative-inspired Schwarzschild black hole. We also discuss some astrophysical implications of the solutions. Finally, we propose a set of quantum Einstein vacuum field equations, as a solution of which we obtain one of the spacetime solutions obtained in this work. We then show a direct connection between the quantum Einstein vacuum field equations and the first law of black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Uncertainty Principle from the Regularized Self-Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Schr\"odinger--Newton equation to calculate the regularized self-energy of the particle using a regular self-gravitational and electrostatic potential derived in the string T-duality. The particle mass $M$ is no longer concentrated into a point but it is diluted and described by a quantum-corrected smeared energy density resulting in corrections to the energy of the particle which is interpreted as a regularized self-energy. We extend our results and find corrections to the relativistic particles using the Klein-Gordon, Proca, and Dirac equations. An important finding is that we extract a form of generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) from the corrected energy. The form of GUP is shown to depend on the nature of particles; namely, for bosons (spin $0$ and spin $1$) we obtain a quadratic form of GUP, while for fermions (spin $1/2$) we obtain a linear form of GUP. The correlation we found between spin and GUP may offer insights into investigating quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model in curved space-time with torsion in the leading order of the $1/N$ expansion. The effective potential of the torsion sector is calculated using the new technique based on the nonlocal part of anomaly-induced action which was recently found to produce the effective potential in the low-energy limit. The spontaneous symmetry breaking caused by the change of the torsion term is found, confirming the statements known from the existing literature. Furthermore, the gap equation is calculated as a function of curvature and torsion. Finally, the behavior of the effective four fermions coupling constant as a function of the torsion is discussed.</description>

      <title>Binary Supermassive Black Holes Orbiting Dark Matter Solitons: From the Dual AGN in UGC4211 to NanoHertz Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore orbital implications of the Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) binary in UGC4211 for the energy spectrum of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), measured with pulsar timing. The SMBH binary in UGC4211 has a projected separation of $\sim 230\,$pc and relative velocity of $\sim 150\,$km/s along the line of sight. It orbits with a disk of gas and stars, with a total mass $\sim 1.7 \times 10^9 M_\odot$ that is several times larger than the combined SMBHs plus the observed gas and stars. The unseen mass can be naturally explained by a soliton of wave dark matter present within the SMBH orbit. Such a scenario is encouraging as during galaxy merger, the two precursor galactic solitons are expected to combine to generate a new soliton and hence bind the two initial SMBHs efficiently. Generalizing this scenario to the cosmological population of SMBH binaries, we show the SGWB spectrum produced by late-stage inspiraling is modified preferentially at low frequency by the presence of soliton. Finally, we demonstrate that the NANOGrav and EPTA data can be well-fit in this scenario, favoring $\{m_a, f_a\} \sim \{10^{-21.7} {\rm eV}, 10^{15.5} {\rm GeV}\}$ and $\{10^{-20.5} {\rm eV}, 10^{16.8} {\rm GeV}\}$ respectively when the UGC4211 data and the constraints from dwarf galaxies are also combined.</description>

      <title>Relic Gravitational Waves from the Chiral Plasma Instability in the Standard Cosmological Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09385v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the primordial plasma, at temperatures above the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking, the presence of chiral asymmetries is expected to induce the development of helical hypermagnetic fields through the phenomenon of chiral plasma instability. It results in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence due to the high conductivity and low viscosity and sources gravitational waves that survive in the universe today as a stochastic polarized gravitational wave background. In this article, we show that this scenario only relies on Standard Model physics, and therefore the observable signatures, namely the relic magnetic field and gravitational background, are linked to a single parameter controlling the initial chiral asymmetry. We estimate the magnetic field and gravitational wave spectra, and validate these estimates with 3D numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric smooth distributions of M2-branes as AdS solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the singularities of certain distributions of M2-branes can be removed by adding a Wilson loop around a compact direction along the brane. The holographic coordinate naturally ends up before the singularity and the resulting spacetime provides an AdS soliton configuration, albeit possibly supersymmetric. We study the phase space diagram of these M2-branes distributions endowed with Wilson loops and show that different distributions are interconnected, providing a rich structure of phase transitions at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Scalar perturbations from inflation in the presence of gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how Abelian-gauge-field production during inflation affects scalar perturbations in the case when the gauge field interacts with the inflaton directly (by means of generic kinetic and axial couplings) and via gravity. The homogeneous background solution is defined by self-consistently taking into account the backreaction of the gauge field on the evolution of the inflaton and the scale factor. For the perturbations on top of this background, all possible scalar contributions coming from the inflaton, the metric, and the gauge field are considered. We derive a second-order differential equation for the curvature perturbation, $\zeta$, capturing the impact of the gauge field, both on the background dynamics and on the evolution of scalar perturbations. The latter is described by a source term in the $\zeta$-equation, which is quadratic in the gauge-field operators and leads to non-Gaussianities in the curvature perturbations. We derive general expressions for the induced scalar power spectrum and bispectrum. Finally, we apply our formalism to the well-known case of axion inflation without backreaction. Numerical results show that, in this example, the effect of including metric perturbations is small for values of the gauge-field production parameter $\xi&gt; 3$. This is in agreement with the previous results in the literature. However, in the region of smaller values, $\xi\lesssim 2$, our new results exhibit order-of-unity deviations when compared to previous results.</description>
