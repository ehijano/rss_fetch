      <title>Robust Charge-Density Wave Correlations in Optimally-Doped YBa2Cu3Oy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge-density wave (CDW) order is a key property of high-Tc cuprates, but its boundaries in the phase diagram and potential connections to other phases remain controversial. We report nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements in the prototypical cuprate YBa2Cu3Oy demonstrating that short-range static CDW order remains robust at optimal doping (p=0.165), exhibiting a strength and temperature dependence in the normal state similar to those observed at p=0.11 in the underdoped regime. For an overdoped sample with p=0.184, we detect no static CDW down to T=Tc, though weak CDW order plausibly emerges below Tc. More broadly, we argue that both quenched disorder and competition with superconductivity influence the apparent boundary of the CDW phase, likely causing an underestimation of its intrinsic extent in doping. These findings challenge the view that the CDW phase boundary lies below p*=0.19, widely regarded as the critical doping where the pseudogap phase ends in YBa2Cu3Oy.</description>

      <title>Superconducting properties of ultrapure niobium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of determination of critical magnetic fields, magnetization curves and critical currents of niobium samples of different purity are presented. It is shown that ultrapure niobium near Tc is a superconductor of the first type and becomes a superconductor of the second type with decreasing temperature due to the temperature dependence of the Ginzburg-Landau parameters. The dependence of the hysteresis of the magnetization curves of massive samples on the surface state is investigated. A comparison of the superconducting parameters with the parameters of the electron spectrum of niobium is carried out. The dependence of the critical current of niobium wires on the longitudinal magnetic field agrees with the assumption of a force-free current distribution.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Superconducting Pairing Symmetries in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$: from the Perspective of Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has attracted significant attention due to its remarkably high $T_{c}$ and unconventional pairing mechanism. High-pressure experiments have demonstrated that the emergence of the superconducting phase is associated with a transition to a higher-symmetry structure. Motivated by this observation, we investigate superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure from the perspectives of symmetry and topology. Based on a bilayer two-orbital model with Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals, we systematically examine all symmetry-allowed multi-orbital superconducting pairings at the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean-field level, including terms up to next-nearest neighbors. By solving the self-consistent gap equations and analyzing the BdG condensation energies, we find that the $A_{1g}$ pairing channel is the most probable one. The dominant pairing is $s_{\pm}$-wave, originating from the intra-orbital interaction of the bilayer Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ orbital, while the subdominant pairing is $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave, arising from the inter-orbital interactions between the $d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals. Furthermore, we implement the theory of symmetry indicator to reveal the topological characteristics of each pairing channel, demonstrating that the pairing symmetries can be identified by their distinct topological features.</description>

      <title>Infinite symmetry prevents disorder-induced localization in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that 2D gapped many-body quantum states are constrained by an infinite-dimensional symmetry which renders them transparent to weak disorder. This prevents disorder-induced localization when interactions are strong enough to open a gap. Using purely algebraic methods we derive all possible quantum states near the superconductor-to-insulator (SIT) transition and we compute the meson spectrum of superinsulators.</description>

      <title>Superconducting gaps revealed by STM measurements on La2PrNi2O7 thin films at ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in nickelate systems has generated tremendous interests in the field of superconductivity. The superconducting transition temperature above 80 K in La3Ni2O7 under pressure and the coexisting spin excitations certainly categorize the nickelate superconductors as unconventional. The core issue to understand the superconductivity mechanism is about the superconducting gap and its symmetry. By using the substrate of SrLaAlO4(00l), we have successfully synthesized the superconducting thin film of La2PrNi2O7 with Tc(onset) = 41.5 K. Superconducting tunneling spectra are successfully measured on the terraces after we remove the surface layer and expose the superconducting layer by using the tip-excavation technique. The spectrum shows a two-gap structure with Delta1 = 19 meV, Delta2 = 6 meV, and fittings based on the Dynes model indicate that the dominant gap should have an anisotropic s-wave structure, and the pure d-wave model fails to fit the data. Thus, our data put the priority in selecting the s+- among the two arguable pairing models: s+- and d-wave. Assuming the dominant interlayer superconducting gap, we obtain its magnitude to be Delta(perp) = 13 meV, while the intralayer gap Delta(para) is about 6 meV. Our results shed new light in understanding the mystery of superconductivity in bilayer nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Superconducting diode effect in a meso-wedge geometry with Abrikosov vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the behavior of a superconducting meso-wedge geometry in 3+1 dimensions (three spatial dimensions plus time) subjected to external transport currents at its boundaries and surfaces, as well as external fields applied along the $\hat{z}$-direction. The transport currents are included as two opposite polarities, $\textbf{J}&gt;0$ and $\textbf{J}&lt;0$. Using the generalized time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory and considering the order parameter $\kappa$, we focus on two scenarios: a fixed external magnetic field with variable $\kappa$, and fixed $\kappa$ with variable external magnetic field. As a result, under both scenarios, we analyze the voltage-current characteristics of the superconducting meso-wedge, finding that the critical currents differ between polarities, demonstrating the system's non-reciprocity. We further examine the efficiency of the diode as a function of $\kappa$ and the external magnetic field applied. Furthermore, our observations reveal that the current polarity strongly influences the vortex configuration, the parameter $\kappa$, and the applied magnetic field. In particular, the formation of Abrikosov-type vortices exhibits pronounced inhomogeneity depending on the direction of the transport currents. This underscores that the diode effect in the superconducting meso-wedge is intimately associated with the anisotropic nucleation of Abrikosov vortices. Notably, the emergence of polarity-dependent vortex patterns can serve as a distinctive hallmark of the diode effect in these superconducting systems.</description>

      <title>Flux Trapping Characterization for Superconducting Electronics Using a Cryogenic Widefield NV-Diamond Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic flux trapping is a significant hurdle limiting reliability and scalability of superconducting electronics, yet tools for imaging flux vortices remain slow or insensitive. We present a cryogenic widefield NV-diamond magnetic microscope capable of rapid, micron-scale imaging of flux trapping in superconducting devices. Using this technique, we measure vortex expulsion fields in Nb thin films and patterned strips, revealing a crossover in expulsion behavior between $10$ and $20~\mu$m strip widths. The observed scaling agrees with theoretical models and suggests the influence of film defects on vortex expulsion dynamics. This instrument enables high-throughput magnetic characterization of superconducting materials and circuits, providing new insight for flux mitigation strategies in scalable superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Nematicity in iron pnictides: phase competition and emergent symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phase diagram of iron-based superconductors contains a host of electronic orders, which are intimately connected with their superconductivity. Here we analyze the fluctuations of one type of nematic order in another. Our analysis leads to an emergent U(1) symmetry at a first-order transition between a nematic phase and a $C_4$-symmetric charge-ordered phase. We characterize the continuous symmetry in terms of a certain hidden Lie algebra that links the different orders. This emergent symmetry leads to a Goldstone mode at the transition and causes softening of excitations in the nematic and charge sectors near the transition. The underlying physics bears a resemblance to the anisotropic XZ spin model, with the nematic order and charge $C_4$ order parameters playing the roles of the $x$ and $z$ components of the magnetization vector, respectively. We provide the experimental evidence in support of the proposed effects, and discuss the general implications of our results for the physics of iron-based superconductors and other correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Holon metal, charge-density-wave and chiral superconductor from doping fractional Chern insulator and SU(3)$_1$ chiral spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiment observed a superconductor proximate to the $\nu_h=-\frac{2}{3}=-1+\frac{1}{3}$ fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) insulator in twisted MoTe$_2$. One critical question is whether the normal state is a Fermi liquid with large Fermi surface, or a strongly correlated metallic state with small carrier density. In this work we develop a theory of possible phases from doping the $\nu=-\frac{2}{3}$ fractional Chern insulator (FCI). We also point out that the problem is dual to doping a SU(3)$_1$ chiral spin liquid(CSL) if we assume that the spin gap is finite. For both problems, a natural phase upon doping is a holon metal with three small Fermi pockets. The pocket is formed by a spinless charge $-e$ holon in the doped CSL case and a charge $-e/3$ fractionalized hole in the doped FCI case. The holon metal is likely unstable to pairing due to gauge field fluctuations, leading to a charge density wave (CDW) metal, but may be stabilized by magnetic field and shows an unusual quantum oscillation period. Two different chiral superconductors are possible, emerging from the CDW metal phase or directly from the holon metal. We note that a superconductor directly from anyon gas seems unlikely if the cheapest anyon is the elementary one with $e/3$ charge.</description>

      <title>Resonant interlayer coupling in NbSe$_2$-graphite epitaxial moir{\'e} superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir{\'e} heterostructures, created by stacking two-dimensional (2D) materials together with a finite lattice mismatch or rotational twist, represent a new frontier of designer quantum materials. Typically, however, this requires the painstaking manual assembly of heterostructures formed from exfoliated materials. Here, we observe clear spectroscopic signatures of moir{\'e} lattice formation in epitaxial heterostructures of monolayer (ML) NbSe$_2$ grown on graphite substrates. Our angle-resolved photoemission measurements and theoretical calculations of the resulting electronic structure reveal moir{\'e} replicas of the graphite $\pi$ states forming pairs of interlocking Dirac cones. Interestingly, these intersect the NbSe$_2$ Fermi surface at the $\mathbf{k}$-space locations where NbSe$_2$'s charge-density wave (CDW) gap is maximal in the bulk. This provides a natural route to understand the lack of CDW enhancement for ML-NbSe$_2$/graphene as compared to a more than four-fold enhancement for NbSe$_2$ on insulating support substrates, and opens new prospects for using moir{\'e} engineering for controlling the collective states of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Loop current order on the kagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent discoveries in kagome materials have unveiled their capacity to harbor exotic quantum states, including intriguing charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity. Notably, accumulating experimental evidence suggests time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking within the CDW, hinting at the long-pursued loop current order (LCO). Despite extensive research efforts, achieving its model realization and understanding the mechanism through unbiased many-body simulations have remained both elusive and challenging.In this work, we develop a microscopic model for LCO on the spinless kagome lattice with non-local interactions, utilizing unbiased functional renormalization group calculations to explore ordering tendencies across all two-particle scattering channels. At the van Hove filling, we identify sublattice interference to suppress onsite CDW order, leaving LCO, charge bond and nematic CDW state as the main competitors. Remarkably, a $2\times2$ LCO emerges as the many-body ground state over a significant parameter space with strong second nearest-neighbor repulsion, stemming from the unique interplay between sublattice characters and lattice geometry. The resulting electronic model with LCO bears similarities to the Haldane model and culminates in a quantum anomalous Hall state. We also discuss potential experimental implications for kagome metals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A relativistic action for scalar condensate-fermion mixture is considered where both the scalar boson and the fermion fields are coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field. The dynamics of the gauge field is governed by a linear combination of the Maxwell term, and the Lorentz invariant $\mathbf{E\cdot B}$ term with a constant coefficient $\theta$. We obtain an effective action describing an emergent fermion-fermion interaction and fermion-vortex tube interaction by using the particle-string duality, and find that the $\theta$ term can significantly affect the interaction of fermions and vortices. We also perform a dimensional reduction to show a $\theta$ dependent flux attachment to the itinerant fermions.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the quantum geometric tensor, which is comprised of the Berry curvature and quantum metric, in a generalized Dirac two-band system with non-integer dispersion $E(\mathbf{k})\sim k^{\alpha}$. Our analysis reveals that this type of dispersion introduces significant and novel effects on quantum band geometry. We calculate the Berry curvature and observe its redistribution in momentum space as \(\alpha\) varies. Notably, despite this redistribution, the change in Chern number across topological transitions remains quantized as an integer, even for non-integer \(\alpha\). We illustrate the physical implications of this redistribution by computing the orbital magnetization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Berry curvature and quantum metric peak along the regions of momentum space where the energy band exhibits high curvature. While it is well-established that Berry curvature becomes highly concentrated at the band touching points, our findings indicate that they can also accumulate at sharp band corners, away from these band touching points. We further show that while the Berry curvature develops Dirac delta-like peaks away from $\mathbf{k}=0$, the Berry monopole, corresponding to the topological charge, remains located at the origin.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity-enhanced magnetic field noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the stray magnetic field noise outside a two-dimensional superconductor. Our considerations are motivated by recent experiments, which observed an enhancement in the magnetic field noise below the superconducting critical temperature based on the relaxation of diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers. Such enhancement is not captured by the standard two-fluid model for the superconducting state, recently proposed to explain such NV relaxometry experiments. Instead, we show that a microscopic BCS theory captures such an enhancement, and we compare with a similar theory and phenomenon, known as the Hebel-Schlicter peak (or coherence peak), observed in the relaxation of nuclear spins in the material. The primary difference is that the NV probes long-wavelength magnetic noise outside the sample, while the nuclear spin probes local hyperfine noise inside the sample. Accordingly, the noise probed by the NV depends on its height and can probe, in pristine samples, the superfluid coherence length. Finally, we discuss potential avenues for NVs to probe unconventional superconductivity via deviations from the above BCS theory.</description>

      <title>Impurity strength-temperature phase diagram with phase crystals and competing time-reversal symmetry breaking states in nodal $d$-wave superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase crystals are a class of nonuniform superconducting ground states characterized by spontaneous phase gradients of the superconducting order parameter. These phase gradients nonlocally drive periodic currents and magnetic fields, thus breaking both time-reversal symmetry and continuous translational symmetry. The phase crystal instability is generally triggered by negative and inhomogeneous superfluid stiffness. Several scenarios have been identified that can realize phase crystals, especially flat bands at specific edges of unconventional nodal superconductors. Motivated by omnipresent disorder in all materials, we employ the ${t}$-matrix approach within the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity to study the emergence of phase crystals at edges of a nodal $d$-wave superconductor. We quantify the full phase diagram as a function of the impurity scattering energy and the temperature, with full self-consistency in the impurity self energies, the superconducting order parameter, and the vector potential. We find that the phase crystal survives even up to $\sim 40-50\%$ of the superconducting critical impurity strength in both the Born and unitary scattering limits. Finally, we show how mesoscopic finite-size effects induce a competition with a state still breaking time-reversal symmetry but with translationally invariant edge currents.</description>

      <title>Interlayer interactions in $\text{La}_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ under pressure: from $s^{\pm}$ to $d_{xy}$-wave superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of \emph{interlayer} interaction terms in the competition between different superconducting gap symmetries in the bilayer nickelate $\text{La}_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ under high pressure. We study a two-layer, two-orbital electron model that encompasses both intra- and interlayer Coulomb interaction terms within the matrix random-phase approximation. We find that interlayer interactions favor a $d_{xy}$-wave superconducting pairing symmetry over the $s^{\pm}$-wave symmetry, which has been found to prevail when interlayer interactions are disregarded. Moreover, our findings indicate that interlayer interactions enhance the interorbital pairing, incorporating contributions from all three electron pockets, arising from both $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital character, resulting in nodes within the gap function (not present in the $s^{\pm}$-wave state) and consequently favoring the $d_{xy}$-wave pairing.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms driving robust high-temperature superconductivity in complex metal hydrides under moderate pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of near-room-temperature superconductivity in compressed hydrides has sparked intensive research efforts to identify superconducting hydrides stable at low or even ambient pressures. Herein, we demonstrate a new mechanism for achieving robust superconductivity in complex metal hydrides under moderate pressure, using Li3IrH9 as a paradigmatic example. This compound displays unique electronic structural characteristics where the broadening and overlap between antibonding electronic bands of [IrH8]2- and adjacent H- orbitals not only drive the intrinsic metallicity of the hydrogen sublattice, generating hydrogen-dominated electronic states at the Fermi level, but also soften hydrogen-related optical phonon modes, inducing strong electron-phonon coupling that remains robust even under high-pressures. First-principles calculations predict that Li3IrH9 maintains thermodynamic stability at 100 GPa while exhibiting a consistently high Tc exceeding 100 K across a broad pressure range (8-150 GPa). Through high-throughput computational screening, we have identified a new superconducting family based on this structural prototype, including Li3RhH9 (Tc = 124 K at 20 GPa) and Li3CoH9 (Tc = 80 K at 10 GPa). This work provides a new platform and original theoretical insights for the development of complex metal hydride superconductors that exhibit robust high-temperature superconductivity and promising practical applications.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Altered Superconductivity</title>

Abstract: Is it feasible to alter the ground state properties of a material by engineering its electromagnetic environment? Inspired by theoretical predictions, experimental realizations of such cavity-controlled properties without optical excitation are beginning to emerge. Here, we devised and implemented a novel platform to realize cavity-altered materials. Single crystals of hyperbolic van der Waals (vdW) compounds provide a resonant electromagnetic environment with enhanced density of photonic states and superior quality factor. We interfaced hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with the molecular superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br ($\kappa$-ET). The frequencies of infrared (IR) hyperbolic modes of hBN match the IR-active carbon-carbon stretching molecular resonance of ($\kappa$-ET) implicated in superconductivity. Nano-optical data supported by first-principles molecular Langevin dynamics simulations confirm resonant coupling between the hBN hyperbolic cavity modes and the carbon-carbon stretching mode in ($\kappa$-ET). Meissner effect measurements via magnetic force microscopy demonstrate a strong suppression of superfluid density near the hBN/($\kappa$-ET) interface. Non-resonant control heterostructures, including RuCl$_3$/($\kappa$-ET) and hBN/$\text{Bi}_2\text{Sr}_2\text{CaCu}_2\text{O}_{8+x}$, do not display the superfluid suppression. These observations suggest that hBN/($\kappa$-ET) realizes a cavity-altered superconducting ground state. This work highlights the potential of dark cavities devoid of external photons for engineering electronic ground-state properties of materials using IR-active phonons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions constructed from superconductor-semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures have been used to realize a variety of voltage-tunable superconducting quantum devices, including qubits and parametric amplifiers. To date theoretical descriptions of these systems have been restricted to small quantum fluctuations of the junction phase, making them inapplicable to many experiments. In this work we relax this, employing a path-integral formulation where the phase quantum dynamics is obtained self-consistently from an underlying many-body formalism. Our method recovers previously-known results for small phase fluctuations, and predicts new effects outside of that limit: (i) system capacitances undergo a gate-voltage-dependent renormalization; and (ii) an additional charge offset appears for asymmetric junctions. Our main results can be summarized in terms of a single-particle Hamiltonian, which can be directly compared to that of an ordinary Josephson junction. This more general theory could be a first step towards designing new quantum devices that go qualitatively beyond voltage-tunable variants of previously-known circuits.</description>

      <title>Spin-Splitting Magnetoresistance in Altermagnetic RuO2 Thin Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered altermagnets, featured by the exotic correlation of magnetic exchange interaction and alternating crystal environments, have offered exciting cutting-edge opportunities for spintronics. Nevertheless, the altermagnetism of RuO2, one of the earliest-discovered altermagnets, is currently under intense debate. Here we try to resolve this controversy by demonstrating an altermagnetic spin-splitting magnetoresistance (SSMR) effect that is driven by a spin current associated with the giant nonrelativistic spin splitting of an altermagnet. Compared to the spin Hall magnetoresistance induced by a conventional relativistic spin current, the SSMR is characterized by unusual angular dependence with a phase-shift feature underpinned by the Neel-vector orientation and pronounced temperature dependence caused by its susceptibility to electron scattering. Through systematical investigations on the magnetoresistance of (101)-RuO2/Co bilayers, we disentangle a sizable SSMR and hence unveil a Neel vector along [001] direction. Our work not only demonstrates a simple electric avenue to probing the Neel vector of altermagnets, but also indicates long-range magnetic order in thin films of RuO2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of finite-size fermionic projected entangled pair states, in conjunction with variational Monte Carlo, to perform accurate simulations of the ground-state of the 2D Hubbard model. Using bond dimensions of up to $D=28$, we show that we can surpass state-of-the-art DMRG energies that use up to $m=32000$ SU(2) multiplets on 8-leg ladders. We further apply our methodology to $10\times 16$, $12\times 16$ and $16 \times 16$ lattices at $1/8$ hole doping and observe the dimensional crossover between stripe orientations. Our work shows the power of finite-size fermionic tensor networks to resolve the physics of the 2D Hubbard model and related problems.</description>

      <title>Identifying Materials-Level Sources of Performance Variation in Superconducting Transmon Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Superconducting Materials and Systems (SQMS) Center, a DOE National Quantum Information Science Research Center, has conducted a comprehensive and coordinated study using superconducting transmon qubit chips with known performance metrics to identify the underlying materials-level sources of device-to-device performance variation. Following qubit coherence measurements, these qubits of varying base superconducting metals and substrates have been examined with various nondestructive and invasive material characterization techniques at Northwestern University, Ames National Laboratory, and Fermilab as part of a blind study. We find trends in variations of the depth of the etched substrate trench, the thickness of the surface oxide, and the geometry of the sidewall, which when combined, lead to correlations with the T$_1$ lifetime across different devices. In addition, we provide a list of features that varied from device to device, for which the impact on performance requires further studies. Finally, we identify two low-temperature characterization techniques that may potentially serve as proxy tools for qubit measurements. These insights provide materials-oriented solutions to not only reduce performance variations across neighboring devices, but also to engineer and fabricate devices with optimal geometries to achieve performance metrics beyond the state-of-the-art values.</description>
