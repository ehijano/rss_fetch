      <title>Accurate Interpolation of Ambient Noise Empirical Green's Functions by Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model and Implicit Neural Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical Green's functions (EGFs) extracted from seismic ambient noise have been widely used to image Earth's interior structures, and the resolution of EGF-based tomography depends on the spatial density of seismic stations. However, due to cost and logistical constraints, it is often difficult to deploy dense seismic networks suitable for high-resolution tomography. While reliable interpolation of EGFs at unsampled locations could enhance tomographic resolution, the task remains inherently challenging and underexplored due to the dispersive nature of EGFs. In this study, we introduce DIER (diffusion-assisted implicit EGF representation), a self-supervised learning framework that integrates implicit neural representation with denoising diffusion probabilistic models to achieve high-fidelity EGF interpolation. In DIER, the diffusion process is conditioned on station coordinates to guide the transformation from random noise into EGF waveforms, which allows flexible reconstruction of five-dimensional EGF fields without labeled data or synthetic waveforms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DIER through continent-scale EGF interpolation across the United States. The results show that DIER significantly outperforms the conventional radial basis function-based interpolation approach by generating EGFs with markedly improved phase alignment and dispersion characteristics. Surface wave tomography using the phase velocities derived from the interpolated EGFs also closely matches a reference model constructed from data acquired by a much denser seismic network. Our findings suggest that DIER provides a promising and cost-effective approach toward high-resolution ambient noise tomography in regions with sparse station coverage.</description>

      <title>Setting up the physical principles of resilience in a model of the Earth System</title>

Abstract: Resilience is a property of social, ecological, social-ecological and biophysical systems. It describes the capacity of a system to cope with, adapt to and innovate in response to a changing surrounding. Given the current climate change crisis, ensuring conditions for a sustainable future for the habitability on the planet is fundamentally dependent on Earth System (ES) resilience. It is thus particularly relevant to establish a model that captures and frames resilience of the ES, most particularly in physical terms that can be influenced by human policy\footnote{See page 4 for examples of strategies}. In this work we propose that resilience can serve as a theoretical foundation when unpacking and describing metastable states of equilibrium and energy dissipation in any dynamic description of the variables that characterise the ES. Since the impact of the human activities can be suitably gauged by the planetary boundaries (PBs) and the planet's temperature is the net result of the multiple PB variables, such as $\text{CO}_2$ concentration and radiative forcing, atmospheric aerosol loading, atmospheric ozone depletion, etc, then resilience features arise once conditions to avoid an ES runaway to a state where the average temperature is much higher than the current one. Our model shows that this runaway can be prevented by the presence of metastable states and dynamic friction built out of the interaction among the PB variables once suitable conditions are satisfied. In this work these conditions are specified. As humanity moves away from Holocene conditions, we argue that resilience features arising from metastable states might be crucial for the ES to follow sustainable trajectories in the Anthropocene that prevent it run into a much hotter potential equilibrium state.</description>

      <title>WaveDiffusion: Joint Latent Diffusion for Physically Consistent Seismic and Velocity Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09002v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a critical technique in subsurface imaging, aiming to reconstruct high-resolution subsurface properties from surface measurements. Acoustic FWI involves two physical modalities, seismic waveforms and velocity maps, which are governed by the acoustic wave equation. Prior works primarily focus on the inverse problem, modeling the relationship between seismic and velocity as an image-to-image translation task. In this work, we study their relationship from a generative perspective. Our aim is to explore and characterize the latent space structure, and identify latent vectors that generate seismic-velocity pairs consistent with the governing partial differential equation (PDE). Specifically, we model seismic and velocity data jointly from a shared latent space via a diffusion process. In experiments, we find that diffusion progressively refines arbitrary latent vectors into ones that yield approximately physics-consistent seismic-velocity pairs, even without explicit physics constraints. This provides empirical evidence of PDE-consistency in latent diffusion, where sampling is biased toward PDE-valid solutions. In latent space, satisfying the acoustic wave equation can be approximated through sampling and gradient descent. We formalize this physics-consistent latent modeling task and quantify it through extensive experiments. On large-scale OpenFWI benchmarks, our approach produces high-fidelity, diverse, and physically consistent seismic-velocity pairs, demonstrating the potential of a data-driven latent diffusion for physically consistent generation in a complex scientific domain.</description>

      <title>Dense 3D Displacement Estimation for Landslide Monitoring via Fusion of TLS Point Clouds and Embedded RGB Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Landslide monitoring is essential for understanding geohazards and mitigating associated risks. Existing point cloud-based methods, however, typically rely on either geometric or radiometric information and often yield sparse or non-3D displacement estimates. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical partitioning-based coarse-to-fine approach that integrates 3D point clouds and co-registered RGB images to estimate dense 3D displacement vector fields. Patch-level matches are constructed using both 3D geometry and 2D image features, refined via geometric consistency checks, and followed by rigid transformation estimation per match. Experimental results on two real-world landslide datasets demonstrate that the proposed method produces 3D displacement estimates with high spatial coverage (79% and 97%) and accuracy. Deviations in displacement magnitude with respect to external measurements (total station or GNSS observations) are 0.15 m and 0.25 m on the two datasets, respectively, and only 0.07 m and 0.20 m compared to manually derived references, all below the mean scan resolutions (0.08 m and 0.30 m). Compared with the state-of-the-art method F2S3, the proposed approach improves spatial coverage while maintaining comparable accuracy. The proposed approach offers a practical and adaptable solution for TLS-based landslide monitoring and is extensible to other types of point clouds and monitoring tasks. The example data and source code are publicly available at https://github.com/gseg-ethz/fusion4landslide.</description>
