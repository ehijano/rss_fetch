      <title>Algebraic exponentiation and action representability for V-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the category of V-groups, where V is a cartesian quantale, so in particular the category of preordered groups, is locally algebraically cartesian closed with respect to the class of points underlying the product V-category structure. We obtain this by observing that such points correspond to (V-Cat)-enriched functors from a V-group, seen as a one-object V-category, to the category V-Grp of V-groups. Moreover, we show that the actions corresponding to points underlying the product V-category structure are representable.</description>

      <title>On the Centre of Strong Graded Monads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of 'centre' for pomonoid-graded strong monads which generalizes some previous work that describes the centre of (not graded) strong monads. We show that, whenever the centre exists, this determines a pomonoid-graded commutative submonad of the original one. We also discuss how this relates to duoidally-graded strong monads.</description>

      <title>Profinite Cosheaves Valued in Pro-regular Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the category of profinite cosheaves valued in a pro-regular category (satisfying mild assumptions) is itself a pro-regular category. As a corollary, we extend Wilkes's cosheaf-bundle equivalence from profinite modules to profinite groups.</description>

      <title>Virtual double categories of split two-sided 2-fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces and studies split two-sided 2-fibrations and locally discrete split two-sided 2-fibrations, using a formal categorical approach. We generalise Street's notion of split two-sided fibration internal to a 2-category to one internal to a sesquicategory. Given a sesquicategory we construct a virtual double category whose horizontal (loose) morphisms are its internal split two-sided fibrations. Specialising to the sesquicategory of lax natural transformations we obtain the virtual double category of split two-sided 2-fibrations, which we study in detail. We then restrict to the sub-virtual double category of locally discrete split two-sided 2-fibrations and show that therein the usual Yoneda 2-functors satisfy a double-categorical formal notion of Yoneda morphism, which formally captures universal properties similar to those satisfied by the morphisms comprising a Yoneda structure on a 2-category. As a consequence we obtain a 'two-sided Grothendieck correspondence' of locally discrete split two-sided 2-fibrations $A \nrightarrow B$ and 2-functors $B \to Cat^{A^{op}}$. Restricting to $A = 1$, the terminal 2-category, we improve Buckley and Lambert's 'Grothendieck correspondence' for locally discrete split op-2-fibrations by extending the sense in which it is functorial.</description>

      <title>Condensed Sets and the Solovay Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exhibit a geometric morphism from the Grothendieck topos representing the Solovay model to the $\kappa$-pyknotic sets of Barwick-Haine and Clausen-Scholze. We then use the properties of this morphism and automatic continuity in the Solovay model to prove Clausen-Scholze's resolution of the Whitehead problem for discrete condensed abelian groups. We also exhibit an analogous internal $Ext$ computation between locally compact abelian groups in the Solovay model.</description>

      <title>Acyclic complexes of FP-injective modules over Ding-Chen rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for combining two cotorsion pairs to obtain an abelian model structure and we apply it to construct and study a new model structure on left $R$-modules over a left coherent ring $R$. Its class of fibrant objects is generated by the weakly Ding injective $R$-modules, a class of modules recently studied by Iacob. We give several characterizations of the fibrant modules, one being that they are the cycle modules of certain acyclic complexes of FP-injective (i.e., absolutely pure) $R$-modules. In the case that $R$ is a Ding-Chen ring, we show that they are precisely the modules appearing as cycles of acyclic complexes of FP-injectives. This leads to a new description of the stable module category of a Ding-Chen ring $R$, by way of modules we call Gorenstein FP-pro-injective. These are modules that appear as a cycle module of a totally acyclic complex of FP-projective-injective modules. As a completely separate application of the new model category method, we show that all complete cotorsion pairs, even non-hereditary ones, lift to abelian models for the derived category of a ring.</description>

      <title>A homotopical Dold-Kan correspondence for Joyal's category $\Theta$ and other test categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for any test category $A$, in the sense of Grothendieck, satisfying a compatibility condition between homology equivalences and weak equivalences of presheaves, the homotopy category of abelian presheaves on $A$ is equivalent to the non-negative derived category of abelian groups. This provides a homotopical generalization of the Dold-Kan correspondence for presheaves of abelian groups over a wide range of test categories. This equivalence of homotopy categories comes from a Quillen equivalence for a model structure on abelian presheaves that we introduce under these conditions. We then show that this result applies to Joyal's category $\Theta$.</description>

      <title>Geometric differentiation of simplicial manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete geometric solution to the differentiation problem for simplicial manifolds, extending classical Lie theory and subsuming existing homotopical and formal approaches within a unified framework. First, we establish a normal form theorem setting a system of compatible tubular neighborhoods. Building on this description, we identify a differentiating ideal in the algebra of cochains, prove that the quotient is semi-free, and interpret it as the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of the thus defined higher Lie algebroid. As an application, we introduce a higher version of the van Est map and prove a van Est isomorphism theorem in cohomology, under natural connectivity assumptions. Finally, we identify the algebraic mechanism underlying geometric differentiation as a monoidal refinement of the dual Dold-Kan correspondence, providing a conceptual explanation of the construction and relating it to earlier homotopical and functor-of-points approaches.</description>
