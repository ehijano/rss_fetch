      <title>Integrability and exact large deviations of the weakly-asymmetric exclusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weakly asymmetric exclusion process (WASEP) in one dimension is a paradigmatic system of interacting particles described by the macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) in the presence of driving. We consider an initial condition with densities $\rho_1,\rho_2$ on either side of the origin, so that for $\rho_1=\rho_2$ the gas is stationary. Starting from the microscopic description, we obtain exact formulae for the cumulant generating functions, and large deviation rate functions of the time-integrated current and the position of a tracer. As the asymmetry/driving is increased, these describe the crossover between the symmetric exclusion process (SSEP) and the weak noise regime of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation: we recover the two limits and describe the crossover from the WASEP cubic tail to the $5/2$ and $3/2$ KPZ tail exponents. Finally, we show that the MFT of the WASEP is classically integrable, by exhibiting the explicit Lax pairs, which are obtained through a novel mapping between the MFT of the WASEP and a complex extension of the classical anisotropic Landau-Lifshitz spin chain. This shows integrability of all MFTs of asymmetric models with quadratic mobility as well as their dual versions.</description>

      <title>Driven Critical Dynamics in Tricitical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism, describing driven dynamics across critical points based on the adiabatic-impulse scenario (AIS), have attracted broad attentions. However, the driven dynamics in tricritical point with two independent relevant directions has not been adequately studied. Here, we employ time dependent variational principle to study the driven critical dynamics at a one-dimensional supersymmetric Ising tricritical point. For the relevant direction along the Ising critical line, the AIS apparently breaks down. Nevertheless, we find that the critical dynamics can still be described by the KZ scaling in which the driving rate has the dimension of $r=z+1/\nu_\mu$ with $z$ and $\nu_\mu$ being the dynamic exponent and correlation length exponent in this direction, respectively. For driven dynamics along other direction, the driving rate has the dimension $r=z+1/\nu_p$ with $\nu_p$ being the other correlation length exponent. Our work brings new fundamental perspective into the nonequilibrium critical dynamics near the tricritical point, which could be realized in programmable quantum processors in Rydberg atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic analysis of diverse percolation transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work extends the thermodynamic analysis of random bond percolation to explosive and hybrid percolation models. We show that this thermodynamic analysis is well applicable to both explosive and hybrid percolation models by using the critical exponents $\alpha$ and $\delta$ obtained from scaling relations with previously measured values of $\beta$ and $\gamma$ within the error range. As a result, Rushbrooke inequality holds as an equality, $\alpha + 2\beta + \gamma = 2$, in both explosive and hybrid percolation models, where $\alpha &gt; 0$ leads to the divergence of specific heats at the critical points. Remarkably, entropy clearly reveals a continuous decrease even in a finite-sized explosive percolation model, unlike the order parameter. In contrast, entropy decreases discontinuously during a discontinuous transition in a hybrid percolation model, resembling the heat outflow during discontinuous transitions in thermal systems.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group analysis of a continuous model with self-organized criticality: Effects of randomly moving environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a strongly anisotropic self-organized critical system coupled to an isotropic random fluid environment. The former is described by a continuous (coarse-grained) model due to Hwa and Kardar. The latter is modeled by the Navier--Stokes equation with a random stirring force of a rather general form that includes, in particular, the overall shaking of the system and a non-local part with power-law spectrum $\sim k^{4-d-y}$ that describes, in the limiting case $y \to 4$, a turbulent fluid. The full problem of the two coupled stochastic equations is represented as a field theoretic model which is shown to be multiplicatively renormalizable and logarithmic at $d=4$. Due to the interplay between isotropic and anisotropic interactions, the corresponding renormalization group (RG) equations reveal a rich pattern of possible infrared (large scales, long times) regimes of asymptotic behaviour of various Green's functions. The attractors of the RG equations in the five-dimensional space of coupling parameters include a two-dimensional surface of Gaussian (free) fixed points, a single fixed point that corresponds to the plain advection by the turbulent fluid (the Hwa--Kardar self-interaction is irrelevant) and a one-dimensional curve of fixed points that corresponds to the case where the Hwa--Kardar nonlinearity and the uniform stirring are simultaneously relevant. The character of attractiveness is determined by the exponent $y$ and the dimension of space $d$; the most interesting case $d=3$ and $y \to 4$ is described by the single fixed point. The corresponding critical dimensions of the frequency and the basic fields are found exactly.</description>

      <title>Quantifying dissipation in flocking dynamics: When tracking internal states matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning self-propelled particles undergo a nonequilibrium flocking transition from apolar to polar phases as their interactions become stronger. We propose a thermodynamically consistent lattice model, in which the internal state of the particles biases their diffusion, to capture such a transition. Changes of internal states and jumps between lattice sites obey local detailed balance with respect to the same interaction energy. We unveil a crossover between two regimes: for weak interactions, the dissipation is maximal, and partial inference (namely, based on discarding the dynamics of internal states) leads to a severe underestimation; for strong interactions, the dissipation is reduced, and partial inference captures most of the dissipation. Finally, we reveal that the macroscopic dissipation, evaluated at the hydrodynamic level, coincides with the microscopic dissipation upon coarse-graining. We argue that this correspondence stems from a generic mapping of active lattice models with local detailed balance into a specific class of non-ideal reaction-diffusion systems.</description>

      <title>Entropy production rate in thermodynamically consistent flocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entropy production rate (EPR) of aligning self-propelled particles which undergo a flocking transition towards a polarized collective motion. In our thermodynamically consistent lattice model, individual self-propulsion is the exclusive source of irreversibility. We derive the fluctuating hydrodynamics for large system sizes using a controlled coarse-graining: our procedure entails an exact correspondence between the EPR evaluated at the hydrodynamic and particle-based levels. We reveal that EPR is maximal when the system adopts a homogeneous configuration, either apolar or polar, and reduced in the non-homogeneous state where a polar band travels in a apolar background due to strong spatial EPR modulations. By analyzing the latter we also show that asymmetric energetic exchanges occur at the trailing and leading edges, which we map into a thermodynamic cycle in density-polarization space. Finally, we demonstrate that the regime of weak self-propulsion features a singular scaling of EPR, and a non-analyticity of the travelling band profiles.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous diffusion in an harmonic potential: the role of the interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion in heterogeneous energy and diffusivity landscapes is widespread in biological systems. However, solving the Langevin equation in such environments introduces ambiguity due to the interpretation parameter $\alpha$, which depends on the underlying physics and can take values in the range $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$. The typical interpretations are It\^o ($\alpha=0$), Stratonovich ($\alpha=1/2$), and H\"anggi-Klimontovich ($\alpha=1$). Here, we analyse the motion of a particle in an harmonic potential -- modelled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process -- with diffusivity that varies in space. Our focus is on two-phase systems with a discontinuity in environmental properties at $x=0$. We derive the probability density of the particle position for the process, and consider two paradigmatic situations. In the first one, the damping coefficient remains constant, and fluctuation-dissipation relations are not satisfied. In the second one, these relations are enforced, leading to a position-dependent damping coefficient. In both cases, we provide solutions as a function of the interpretation parameter $\alpha$, with particular attention to the It\^o, Stratonovich, and H\"anggi-Klimontovich interpretations, revealing fundamentally different behaviours, in particular with respect to an interface located at the potential minimum.</description>

      <title>Revisiting vestigial order in nematic superconductors: gauge-field mechanisms and model constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility that nematicity induced by electron pairing could persist above the superconducting transition temperature represents a form of composite order, sometimes referred to as a vestigial nematic phase. However, it remains debated whether--and under what conditions--such a phase can emerge in realistic models of nematic superconductors. Recent analytical work [1] concluded that vestigial nematic phases and related mechanisms do not arise in commonly used models proposed, for example, for Bi2Se3-based candidates. To address this question, we perform large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of a three-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau model of a nematic superconductor. Consistent with the findings of Ref.[1], our numerical results confirm that the commonly considered models do not exhibit vestigial nematic phases or nematic-fluctuation-induced charge-4e superconductivity. In the second part of the study, we investigate a different class of models and show that, under restrictive conditions, vestigial nematic order can be stabilized by an alternative mechanism: intercomponent coupling mediated by a gauge field or the effects of strong correlations.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum simulation of a nonadditive relaxation dynamics in a qubit coupled to a finite-temperature bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an application of the variational quantum simulation (VQS) framework to capture finite-temperature open-system dynamics on near-term quantum hardware. By embedding the generalized amplitude-damping channel into the VQS algorithm, we modeled the energy exchange with a thermal bath through its Lindblad representation and thereby simulated realistic dissipative effects. To explore a wide range of activation behaviors, we introduce a nonadditive relaxation-time model using a generalized form of the Arrhenius law, based on the phenomenological parameter q. We compare our method on a driven qubit subject to both static and composite time-dependent fields, comparing population evolution and trace distance errors against exact solutions. Our results demonstrate that (i) VQS accurately maps the effective nonunitary generator under generalized amplitude damping, (ii) smoother drive envelopes induced by nonaddtive parameters suppress high frequency components and yield lower simulation errors, and (iii) the variational manifold exhibits dynamical selectivity, maintaining mapping fidelity even as the exact solution's sensitivity to q increases.

      <title>Measuring the mechanical properties of asymmetric membranes in computer simulations -- new methods and insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Monte Carlo simulations of an ultra coarse-grained lipid bilayer with different number of lipids on both leaflets. In the simulations, we employ a new method for measuring the elastic parameters of the membrane, including the area per lipid, area elasticity modulus, and bending rigidity. The method also allows to measure the spontaneous curvature and non-local bending modulus, which are not accessible by standard computer simulations with periodic boundary conditions. For membranes with lipid densities much smaller than the liquid to gel transition density, $\rho_g$, we find a very good agreement between the simulation results and the theory expressing the bilayer elastic free energy as the sum of quadratic free energies in the strains associated with the area density and the local curvature of the monolayers. The theory fails when the lipid area density (in the symmetric reference case) is only slightly smaller than $\rho_g$. Increasing the degree of asymmetry and changing the density of the condensed leaflet to a value larger than $\rho_g$, causes the layer to phase separate between regions with distinct densities which, in turn, may also induce density variations in the dilated liquid layer. Moreover, the phase separation may also trigger local curvature variations along the membrane, which can be attributed to the disparity between the values of the elastic parameters of the coexisting bilayer segments that are mechanically coupled. This mechanism leading to density-curvature variations and instabilities may play a role in cellular processes occurring in liquid-ordered raft domains that are surrounded by the disordered liquid matrix of the cell.</description>

      <title>Dislocation Glides in Monolayered Granular Media: Effect of Lattice Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent study demonstrated that granular crystals containing a single dislocation exhibit dislocation glide analogous to that observed in atomic-scale crystals, resulting in plastic deformation at yield stresses several orders of magnitude lower than those of dislocation-free crystals. The yielding behavior strongly depends on the interparticle friction coefficient $\mu$: dislocation glide occurs for friction coefficients below a critical value $\mu_c$, while crystalline order deteriorates above $\mu_c$. In this work, we use discrete element method simulations to systematically investigate how the lattice constant, which determines the interparticle spacing and is a fundamental parameter in microscopic crystalline solids, and the friction coefficient $\mu$ influence the yielding behavior in monolayered granular crystals with dislocation. By decreasing the lattice constant, we find an increase in the critical friction coefficient $\mu_c$, allowing dislocation glide to persist at higher friction values. Furthermore, we observe a linear scaling of yield stress with normal stress, except at extremely low friction coefficients.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e on Gibbs and on Probability in Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reviews a paper from 1906 by J. Henri Poincar\'e on statistical mechanics with a background in his earlier work and notable connections to J. Willard Gibbs. Poincar\'e's paper presents important ideas that are still relevant for understanding the need for probability in statistical mechanics. Poincar\'e understands the foundations of statistical mechanics as a many-body problem in analytical mechanics (reflecting his 1890 monograph on The Three-Body Problem and the Equations of Dynamics) and possibly influenced by Gibbs independent development published in chapters in his 1902 book, Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics. This dynamical systems approach of Poincar\'e and Gibbs provides great flexibility including applications to many systems besides gasses. This foundation benefits from close connections to Poincar\'e's earlier work. Notably, Poincar\'e had shown (e.g. in his study of non-linear oscillators) that Hamiltonian dynamical systems display sensitivity to initial conditions separating stable and unstable trajectories. In the first context it precludes proving the stability of orbits in the solar system, here it compels the use of ensembles of systems for which the probability is ontic and frequentist and does not have an a priori value. Poincar\'e's key concepts relating to uncertain initial conditions, and fine- and coarse-grained entropy are presented for the readers' consideration. Poincar\'e and Gibbs clearly both wanted to say something about irreversibility, but came up short.</description>

      <title>Neural Thermodynamics I: Entropic Forces in Deep and Universal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, explaining and understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.</description>

Abstract: The token-based Brownian circuit harnesses the Brownian motion of particles for computation. The conservative join (CJoin) is a circuit element that synchronizes two Brownian particles, and its realization using repelling particles, such as magnetic skyrmions or electrons, is key to building the Brownian circuit. Here, a theoretical implementation of the CJoin using a simple quantum dot circuit is proposed, incorporating an internal state-a double quantum dot that functions as a one-bit memory, storing the direction of two-particle transfer. A periodic reset protocol is introduced, allowing the CJoin to emit particles in a specific direction. The stochastic thermodynamics under periodic resets identifies the thermodynamic cost as the work done for resets minus the entropy reduction due to resets, with its lower bound remaining within a few multiples of $k_{\rm B} T$ at temperature $T$. Applying the speed limit relation to a subsystem in bipartite dynamics, the number of emitted particles is shown to be relatively tightly bounded from above by an expression involving the subsystem's irreversible entropy production rate and dynamical activity rate.</description>

      <title>From Quantum Indistinguishability to Classical Distinguishability: Statistics and Measurement of Two-Particle Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme to probe the quantum statistics of two identical particles. The transition between the quantum and classical statistics of two identical particles is described by the particles having identical multiple internal energy levels. We show that effective distinguishability emerges as the thermal energy increases with respect to the energy level spacing, and the mesoscopic regime bridges quantum indistinguishability and classical distinguishability. A realistic experimental approach is proposed using a two-particle interferometer, where the particles reach statistical equilibrium before the two-particle distribution is measured. The unitarity of the scattering/separation process ensures the preservation of the equilibrium distribution and allows a direct measurement of the two-particle statistical distribution. Our results show the transition between quantum and classical behavior of the two-particle distribution, which can be directly probed by a realistic experiment.</description>

      <title>Tricritical Kibble-Zurek Scaling in Rydberg Atom Ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism is being actively explored on quantum simulation platforms. In this work, we study the KZ scaling around tricritical phase transition points, with Rydberg atom ladders as a concrete incarnation. The criticality is of Ising and Potts type for two- and three-leg ladders, respectively. When slowly ramping across or near the tricritical point from the disordered phase to the ordered phase, we obtain universal power-law scaling in agreement with conventional KZ predictions. We study a "tangential" KZ ramping that both begins and ends in the disordered phase, a novel protocol enabled by the two-dimensional phase diagram. The tangential KZ directly reveals subleading critical exponents of the critical point. Finally, we explore the regime of intermediate-speed ramping and find a dynamical analog of the celebrated Zamolodchikov's c-theorem. Practically, our work provides an immediately relevant protocol for current experiments to pinpoint the elusive tricritical points. More broadly, tangential and intermediate-speed rampings go beyond the conventional KZ paradigm and introduce new insights into critical quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Energy Dissipation in Cyclic Strain of Amorphous Solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the response of amorphous materials to oscillatory strain is traditionally performed with many repeated cycles. We argue that it pays to consider carefully just one cycle (and may be a second), to reveal the rich physics that characterizes cyclic strain. The response can be conservative or dissipative, with a sharp transition between these options as a function of preparation parameters, accompanied by symmetry breaking and the onset of screening. We choose an example for which the mesoscopic theory can be solved exactly, and the microscopic physics can be revealed by numerical simulations. The mechanism of energy dissipation (when it exists) is explored in detail, shedding light on the reason why repeated cycles exhibit ever decreasing dissipation per cycle, which is often consistent with a universal law.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kinetic Uncertainty Relations in Mesoscopic Conductors at Strong Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic Uncertainty Relations (KURs) establish quantum transport precision limits by linking signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to the system's dynamical activity, valid in the weak-coupling regime where particle-like transport dominates. At strong coupling, quantum coherence challenges the validity of KURs and questions the meaning of the concept of activity itself. Here, we introduce a generalized dynamical activity valid at arbitrary coupling and derive a steady-state quantum KUR (QKUR) expressed in terms of this generalized activity. Explicit expressions are obtained within Green's function and Landauer-B\"uttiker formalisms. This QKUR ensures that uncertainty relations are valid across all coupling strengths, offering a general framework for out-of-equilibrium quantum transport precision analysis. We illustrate these concepts for paradigmatic quantum-coherent mesoscopic devices: a single quantum channel pinched by a quantum point contact and open single- and double-quantum dot systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose periodic driving protocols to realize discrete time crystals (DTCs) in a spin-s central spin model. Interestingly, we identify parameter regimes, where eternal period-doubling and higher-order(HO)-DTCs can be realized, even for finite-sized systems. We have determined the dependence of the DTC order on the number of satellite spins and the central spin value, s. Intriguingly, we find that certain classes of HO-DTCs produce a series of maximally entangled Bell cat and super-cat states during their dynamical evolution. Finally, we demonstrate that the HO-DTCs can be employed for quantum-enhanced multiparameter sensing at the Heisenberg limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hysteresis and metastable states are typical features associated with ergodicity breaking in the first-order phase transition. We explore the scaling relations of nonequilibrium thermodynamics in finite-time first-order phase transitions. Using the Curie-Weiss model as an example, for large systems we find the excess work scales as $v^{2/3}$ when the magnetic field is quenched at a finite rate $v$ across the phase transition. We further reveal a crossover in the scaling of the excess work from $v^{2/3}$ to $v$ when downsizing the system. Our study elucidates the interplay between the finite-time dynamics and the finite-size effect, which leads to different scaling behaviors of the excess work with or without ergodicity breaking.</description>

Abstract: The transition probability for a one-dimensional discrete symmetric random walk under a reflecting barrier was once given by the method of images. [S. Chandrasekhar, Rev. Mod. Phys. 15, 1 (1943).] However, several inconsistencies have been reported when the method of images is applied in cases where a reflecting barrier is considered, even after the exact solution has been obtained. Here, we explicitly show that the method of images becomes applicable if the image position is shifted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find that the density operator of non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of XXZ spin chain with strong ``sink and source" boundary dissipation, can be described in terms of quasiparticles, with renormalized -- dissipatively dressed -- dispersion relation. The spectrum of the NESS is then fully accounted for by Bethe ansatz equations for an associated coherent system. The dissipative dressing generates an extra singularity in the dispersion relation, which strongly modifies the NESS spectrum with respect to the spectrum of the corresponding coherent model. In particular, this leads to a dissipation-assisted entropy reduction, due to the suppression -- in the NESS spectrum -- of plain wave-type Bethe states in favor of Bethe states localized at the boundaries.</description>

      <title>Stochastic resetting prevails over sharp restart for broad target distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resetting has been shown to reduce the completion time for a stochastic process, such as the first passage time for a diffusive searcher to find a target. The time between two consecutive resetting events is drawn from a waiting time distribution $\psi(t)$, which defines the resetting protocol. Previously, it has been shown that deterministic resetting process with a constant time period, referred to as sharp restart, can minimize the mean first passage time to a fixed target. Here we consider the more realistic problem of a target positioned at a random distance $R$ from the resetting site, selected from a given target distribution $P_T(R)$. We introduce the notion of a conjugate target distribution to a given waiting time distribution. The conjugate target distribution, $P_T^*(R)$, is that $P_T(R)$ for which $\psi(t)$ extremizes the mean time to locate the target. In the case of diffusion we derive an explicit expression for $P^*_T(R)$ conjugate to a given $\psi(t)$ which holds in arbitrary spatial dimension. Our results show that stochastic resetting prevails over sharp restart for target distributions with exponential or heavier tails.</description>

      <title>Systematic analysis of critical exponents in continuous dynamical phase transitions of weak noise theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical phase transitions are nonequilibrium counterparts of thermodynamic phase transitions and share many similarities with their equilibrium analogs. In continuous phase transitions, critical exponents play a key role in characterizing the physics near criticality. This study aims to systematically analyze the set of possible critical exponents in weak noise statistical field theories in 1+1 dimensions, focusing on cases with a single fluctuating field. To achieve this, we develop and apply the Gaussian fluctuation method, avoiding reliance on constructing a Landau theory based on system symmetries. Our analysis reveals that the critical exponents can be categorized into a limited set of distinct cases, suggesting a constrained universality in weak noise-induced dynamical phase transitions. We illustrate our findings in two examples: short-time large deviations of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, and the weakly asymmetric exclusion process on a ring within the framework of the macroscopic fluctuation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the Ising models with transverse and longitudinal fields on the hypercubic lattices with dimensions higher than one have no local conserved quantities other than the Hamiltonian. This holds for any value of the longitudinal field, including zero, as far as the transverse field and the Ising interactions are nonzero. The conserved quantity considered here is ``local'' in a very weak sense: it can be written as a linear combination of operators whose side lengths of the supports in one direction do not exceed half the system size, while the side lengths in the other directions are arbitrary. We also prove that the above result holds even in the ladder system. Our results extend the recently developed technique of the proof of absence of local conserved quantities in one-dimensional systems to higher dimensions and to the ladder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work is aimed at investigating the behavior of Morse fluids in the immediate vicinity of the critical point within the framework of a cell model. This region is of both fundamental and practical importance, yet presents analytical challenges due to the significant influence of order parameter fluctuations. An analytical procedure is developed to construct the upper part of the liquid-gas coexistence curve and calculate its diameter, incorporating the non-Gaussian (quartic) distribution of fluctuations. An explicit expression is derived for the temperature-dependent analytical term appearing in the expression for the rectilinear diameter. The numerical evaluation of the relevant quantities is carried out using Morse potential parameters representative of sodium. The coexistence curve is constructed both with and without the inclusion of the analytical temperature-dependent term in the calculation. A specific condition is identified under which the agreement between the presented binodal branches and Monte Carlo simulation data from other study, extrapolated to the immediate vicinity of the critical point, is improved. It is shown that better agreement is achieved when the analytical term is included in the calculation of the liquid branch and omitted in the gas branch. The proposed analytical approach may provide useful insight for the theoretical study of critical phenomena in more complex fluid systems.</description>

Abstract: The economic shocks that followed the COVID-19 pandemic have brought to light the difficulty, both for academics and policy makers, of describing and predicting the dynamics of inflation. This paper offers an alternative modelling approach. We study the 2020-2023 period within the well-studied Mark-0 Agent-Based Model, in which economic agents act and react according to plausible behavioural rules. We include a mechanism through which trust of economic agents in the Central Bank can de-anchor. We investigate the influence of regulatory policies on inflationary dynamics resulting from three exogenous shocks, calibrated on those that followed the COVID-19 pandemic: a production/consumption shock due to COVID-related lockdowns, a supply-chain shock, and an energy price shock exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. By exploring the impact of these shocks under different assumptions about monetary policy efficacy and transmission channels, we review various explanations for the resurgence of inflation in the United States, including demand-pull, cost-push, and profit-driven factors. Our main results are four-fold: (i) without appropriate fiscal policy, the shocked economy can take years to recover, or even tip over into a deep recession; {(ii) the success of monetary policy in curbing inflation is primarily due to expectation anchoring, rather than to the direct economic impact of interest rate hikes; (iii) however, strong inflation anchoring is detrimental to consumption and unemployment, leading to a narrow window of ``optimal'' policy responses due to the trade-off between inflation and unemployment;} (iv) the two most sensitive model parameters are those describing wage and price indexation. The results of our study have implications for Central Bank decision-making, and offers an easy-to-use tool that may help anticipate the consequences of different monetary and fiscal policies.</description>

Abstract: Traditional measures of entropy, like the Von Neumann entropy, while fundamental in quantum information theory, are insufficient when interpreted as thermodynamic entropy due to their invariance under unitary transformations, which contradicts observed entropy increases in isolated systems. Recognizing this limitations of existing measures for thermodynamic entropy, recent research has focused on observational entropy (OE) as a promising alternative, offering practical applicability and theoretical insights. In this work, we extend the scope of observational entropy by generalizing it to a parameterized version called $\alpha$-Observational entropy ($\alpha$-OE). $\alpha$-OE is expressed in terms of the Petz-R\'{e}nyi relative entropy between the states on which a quantum-to-classical channel is applied. The $\alpha$-OE reduces to OE under $\alpha\rightarrow 1$. We prove various properties of the $\alpha$-OE, which are the generalization of the properties of OE, including the monotonically increasing of $\alpha$-OE as a function of refinement of coarse-graining. We further explore the role of $\alpha$-OE in thermodynamic contexts, particularly for the entropy production in open and closed quantum systems and its relation with the Helmholtz free energy.</description>

Abstract: This paper reviews the history of the conformal extension of Galilean symmetry, now called Schr\"odinger symmetry. In the physics literature, its discovery is commonly attributed to Jackiw, Niederer and Hagen (1972). However, Schr\"odinger symmetry has a much older ancestry: the associated conserved quantities were known to Jacobi in 1842/43 and its euclidean counterpart was discovered by Sophus Lie in 1881 in his studies of the heat equation. A convenient way to study Schr\"odinger symmetry is provided by a non-relativistic Kaluza-Klein-type "Bargmann" framework, first proposed by Eisenhart (1929), but then forgotten and re-discovered by Duval {\it et al.} only in 1984. Representations of Schr\"odinger symmetry differ by the value $z=2$ of the dynamical exponent from the value $z=1$ found in representations of relativistic conformal invariance. For generic values of $z$, whole families of new algebras exist, which for $z=2/\ell$ include the $\ell$-conformal galilean algebras. We also review the non-relativistic limit of conformal algebras and that this limit leads to the $1$-conformal galilean algebra and not to the Schr\"odinger algebra. The latter can be recovered in the Bargmann framework through reduction. A distinctive feature of Galilean and Schr\"odinger symmetries are the Bargmann super-selection rules, algebraically related to a central extension. An empirical consequence of this was known as "mass conservation" already to Lavoisier. As an illustration of these concepts, some applications to physical ageing in simple model systems are reviewed.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Universality in Neural Network Dynamics with Generalized Structured Input Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00642v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bridging the gap between the practical performance of deep learning and its theoretical foundations often involves analyzing neural networks through stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Expanding on previous research that focused on modeling structured inputs under a simple Gaussian setting, we analyze the behavior of a deep learning system trained on inputs modeled as Gaussian mixtures to better simulate more general structured inputs. Through empirical analysis and theoretical investigation, we demonstrate that under certain standardization schemes, the deep learning model converges toward Gaussian setting behavior, even when the input data follow more complex or real-world distributions. This finding exhibits a form of universality in which diverse structured distributions yield results consistent with Gaussian assumptions, which can support the theoretical understanding of deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and energetic constraints on transition probabilities of small-scale quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00981v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the transition probabilities of a two-point measurement on a quantum system, initially prepared in a thermal state. We find two independent constraints on the difference between transition probabilities when the system is prepared at different temperatures, which both turn out to be particularly restrictive when the measured quantum system is small. These bounds take the form of a thermodynamic and of an energetic constraint, as they are associated with the dissipated heat and with the absorbed energy required to increase or to reduce the temperature of the system. The derived constraints apply to arbitrary system Hamiltonians, including interactions or non-linear energy spectra. We show the relevance of these constraints for the special case where transitions are induced by energy or particle exchange in weakly coupled bipartite systems out of equilibrium. This example is of interest for a wide range of experimentally relevant systems, from molecular junctions to coupled cavities, and can be tested by, for instance, measuring the out-of-equilibrium tunneling current and its noise.</description>

      <title>Quantum Groups as Global Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24142v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum field theories which have quantum groups as global internal symmetries. We show that in such theories operators are generically non-local, and should be thought as living at the ends of topological lines. We describe the general constraints of the quantum group symmetry, given by Ward identities, that correlation functions of the theory should satisfy. We also show that generators of the symmetry can be represented by topological lines with some novel properties. We then discuss a particular example of $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetric CFT, which we solve using the bootstrap techniques and relying on the symmetry. We finally show strong evidence that for a special value of $q$ a subsector of this theory reproduces the fermionic formulation of the Ising model. This suggests that a quantum group can act on local operators as well, however, it generically transforms them into non-local ones.</description>

      <title>Bethe Ansatz, Quantum Circuits, and the F-basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bethe Ansatz is a method for constructing exact eigenstates of quantum-integrable spin chains. Recently, deterministic quantum algorithms, referred to as "algebraic Bethe circuits", have been developed to prepare Bethe states for the spin-1/2 XXZ model. These circuits represent a unitary formulation of the standard algebraic Bethe Ansatz, expressed using matrix-product states that act on both the spin chain and an auxiliary space. In this work, we systematize these previous results, and show that algebraic Bethe circuits can be derived by a change of basis in the auxiliary space. The new basis, identical to the "F-basis" known from the theory of quantum-integrable models, generates the linear superposition of plane waves that is characteristic of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz. We explain this connection, highlighting that certain properties of the F-basis (namely, the exchange symmetry of the spins) are crucial for the construction of algebraic Bethe circuits. We demonstrate our approach by presenting new quantum circuits for the inhomogeneous spin-1/2 XXZ model.</description>

      <title>Vibrational similarities in jamming-unjamming of polycrystalline and disordered granular packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the vibrational properties of polycrystalline monodisperse and disordered bidisperse granular packings during jamming and unjamming using discrete element method simulations. Both systems deviate from Debye scaling at low frequencies $(\omega)$, but only bidisperse packings exhibit a low-$\omega$ plateau. The low $\omega$ exponent ($\alpha$) in bidisperse packings evolves smoothly from zero (plateau) to near one (Debye scaling) with increasing packing fraction, whereas in polycrystalline packings, it changes discontinuously near jamming/unjamming, due to the nature of the contact network rearrangements. Despite structural modifications during the compression-decompression cycle, the exponent remains unchanged at the same distance from jamming density, regardless of the history. Nonaffine displacements and contact orientational order further confirm that structural features that impact low-$\omega$ vibrational states and, hence, mechanical properties are largely restored upon decompression, reinforcing vibrational similarities between jamming and unjamming states.</description>

      <title>Observation of Brownian Motion of a Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the experimental observation of classical Brownian motion in momentum space by a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of Rubidium atoms prepared in a hexagonal optical lattice. Upon suddenly increasing the effective atomic mass, the BEC as a whole behaves as a classical rigid body with its center-of-mass receiving random momentum kicks by a Langevin force arising from atom loss and interactions with the surrounding thermal cloud. Physically, this amounts to selective heating of the BEC center-of-mass degree of freedom by a sudden quench, while with regard to the relative coordinates, the BEC is stablized by repulsive atomic interactions, and its internal dynamics is suppressed by forced evaporative cooling induced by atom loss. A phenomenological theory is developed that well explains the experimental data quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Heat Transport in Ionic Liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heat transfer in liquids is a very challenging problem as it combines the competing effect of high frequency oscillations, which dominate liquid heat capacity, and diffusive motion, which enables transport macroscopic flow. This issue is compounded by the relatively junior state of dynamical theories of liquid thermodynamics. Nevertheless, molten salts are playing an increasingly important role in industrial and energy applications and there is a pressing need to understand the mechanisms behind their irreversible transport processes. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the heat transport of three different molten salts: LiCl, KCl, and the eutectic point of their mixture. While all simulations consider the properties of the liquid within the frame of its centre of mass, we calculate different susceptibilities which implicitly include and explicitly exclude the heat carried by partial mass currents within this frame. We find that, while the heat advected by partial mass currents in the mixture increases with increasing temperature, the heat transferred by collective vibrational motion (phonons) decreases with increasing temperature. This causes a maximum in the heat conductance with temperature in the mixtures only - in pure salts each contribution decreases monotonically with temperature. We attribute this anomaly to the extra freedom afforded to ionic motion in mixtures - in pure salts the motion of cations and anions is bound due to conservation of linear momentum. In mixtures, a coherent but diffusive collective motion is enabled by the release of Li ions from this condition by the introduction of a third species. We tentatively ascribe this coherent collective motion to the ``diffusive" phonons that have been used to explain a similar anomaly in the thermal conductivity of solids.</description>

      <title>Exploring dynamical quantum phase transition from pure states to mixed states through extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in both pure and mixed states within the extended SSH model framework, focusing on the SSH-3 and SSH-4 variants, which differ in symmetry properties. The SSH-3 model, characterized by a chiral-like point symmetry rather than true chiral symmetry, supports robust localized edge states tied to its topological nature. Our results show that for pure states, DQPTs occur after quenches crossing the topological transition, even when the energy band gap remains open. For mixed states, DQPT behavior aligns with pure states at low temperatures but undergoes significant changes at higher temperatures, including the emergence of multiple critical times. In contrast, the SSH-4 model, which possesses chiral symmetry, features four distinct energy spectrum configurations. We find that pure-state DQPTs arise only when the quench starts from a gapless initial state and crosses the critical topological point. At finite temperature, mixed-state DQPTs persist at low temperatures only if the corresponding pure-state quench induces DQPTs, but they disappear at elevated temperatures. These findings elucidate the interplay between symmetry, topology, and temperature in governing DQPTs within generalized SSH models.</description>

      <title>Additional jamming transition in 2D bidisperse granular packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a jamming diagram for 2D bidisperse granular systems, capturing two distinct jamming transitions. The first occurs as large particles form a jammed structure, while the second, emerging at a critical small-particle concentration, $X_{\mathrm{S}}^{*} \approx 0.21$, and size ratio, $\delta^{*} \approx 0.25$, involves small particles jamming into the voids of the existing large-particle structure upon further compression. Below this threshold, small particles fill voids within the large-particle network, increasing packing density. Beyond this point, excess small particles disrupt efficient packing, resulting in looser structures. \jp{These results, consistent with previous 3D studies, demonstrate that the second transition occurs at a well-defined point in the $(X_{\mathrm{S}}, \delta)$ plane, independent of dimensionality, likely driven by the geometric saturation of available space around particles, void closure, and structural arrangement.</description>

Abstract: We study the diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements of observables in the eigenstates of the extended spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain, which exhibits the non-Abelian SU(2) symmetry. We explore integrable and nonintegrable regimes, and consider observables that preserve the SU(2) symmetry of the Hamiltonian as well as observables that break it. We study in detail the low-frequency behavior of the off-diagonal matrix elements at and away from integrability. In the nonintegrable regime, we test the non-Abelian eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, paying special attention to the effect of the spin, which is the distinctive conserved quantity introduced by the SU(2) symmetry.</description>

      <title>Plastic deformation as a phase transition: a combinatorial model of plastic flow in copper single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuum models of plasticity fail to capture the richness of microstructural evolution because the continuum is a homogeneous construction. The present study shows that an alternative way is available at the mesoscale in the form of truly discrete constructions and in the discrete exterior calculus. A pre-existing continuum mean-field model with two parameters is rewritten in the language of the latter to model the properties of a network of plastic slip events in a perfect copper single crystal under uniaxial tension. The behaviour of the system is simulated in a triangular 2D mesh in 3D space employing a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Phases of distinct character emerge and both first-order and second-order phase transitions are observed. The phases represent arrangements of the plastic slip network with different combinations of collinear, coplanar, non-collinear and non-coplanar active slip systems. Furthermore, some of these phases can be interpreted as representing crystallographic phenomena like activation of secondary slip systems, strain localisation and fracture or amorphisation. The first-order transitions mostly occur as functions of the applied stress, while the second-order transitions occur exclusively as functions of the mean-field coupling parameter. The former are reminiscent of transitions in other statistical-mechanical models, while the latter find parallels in experimental observations.</description>
