      <title>Flexible Intelligent Metasurface for Reconfiguring Radio Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible intelligent metasurface (FIM) technology holds immense potential for increasing the spectral efficiency and energy efficiency of wireless networks. In contrast to traditional rigid reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), an FIM consists of an array of elements, each capable of independently tuning electromagnetic signals, while flexibly adjusting its position along the direction perpendicular to the surface. In contrast to traditional rigid metasurfaces, FIM is capable of morphing its surface shape to attain better channel conditions. In this paper, we investigate the single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication systems aided by a transmissive FIM. In the SISO scenario, we jointly optimize the FIM phase shift matrix and surface shape to maximize the end-to-end channel gain. First, we derive the optimal phase-shift matrix for each tentative FIM surface shape to decompose the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem into multiple one-dimensional subproblems. Then, we utilize the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the multi-interval gradient descent (MIGD) method for updating the FIM's surface shape to maximize the channel gain. In the MISO scenario, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming, the FIM surface shape, and the phase shift matrix to maximize the channel gain. To tackle this complex problem with multiple highly coupled variables, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that FIM significantly improves channel gain compared to traditional RIS and exhibits good adaptability to multipath channels.</description>

      <title>Time-Frequency Filtering Meets Graph Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the problem of identifying different signal components from a time-frequency representation can be equivalently phrased as a graph clustering problem: given a graph $G=(V,E)$ one aims to identify `clusters', subgraphs that are strongly connected and have relatively few connections between them. The graph clustering problem is well studied, we show how these ideas can suggest (many) new ways to identify signal components. Numerical experiments illustrate the ideas.</description>

      <title>Rate Maximization for UAV-assisted ISAC System with Fluid Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter investigates the joint sensing problem between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and base stations (BS) in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems with fluid antennas (FA). In this system, the BS enhances its sensing performance through the UAV's perception system. We aim to maximize the communication rate between the BS and UAV while guaranteeing the joint system's sensing capability. By establishing a communication-sensing model with convex optimization properties, we decompose the problem and apply convex optimization to progressively solve key variables. An iterative algorithm employing an alternating optimization approach is subsequently developed to determine the optimal solution, significantly reducing the solution complexity. Simulation results validate the algorithm's effectiveness in balancing system performance.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Model-Free Reinforcement Learning for Optimizing Secure Multi-Party Computation Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we explore the application of model-free reinforcement learning in optimizing secure multiparty computation (SMPC) protocols. SMPC is a crucial tool for performing computations on private data without the need to disclose it, holding significant importance in various domains, including information security and privacy. However, the efficiency of current protocols is often suboptimal due to computational and communicational complexities. Our proposed approach leverages model-free reinforcement learning algorithms to enhance the performance of these protocols. We have designed a reinforcement learning model capable of dynamically learning and adapting optimal strategies for secure computations. Our experimental results demonstrate that employing this method leads to a substantial reduction in execution time and communication costs of the protocols. These achievements highlight the high potential of reinforcement learning in improving the efficiency of secure multiparty computation protocols, providing an effective solution to the existing challenges in this field.</description>

      <title>Wideband dynamic metasurface antenna performance with practical design characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMA) provide low-power beamforming through reconfigurable radiative slots. Each slot has a tunable component that consumes low power compared to typical analog components like phase shifters. This makes DMAs a potential candidate to minimize the power consumption of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna arrays. In this paper, we investigate the use of DMAs in a wideband communication setting with practical DMA design characteristics. We develop approximations for the DMA beamforming gain that account for the effects of waveguide attenuation, element frequency-selectivity, and limited reconfigurability of the tunable components as a function of the signal bandwidth. The approximations allow for key insights into the wideband performance of DMAs in terms of different design variables. We develop a simple successive beamforming algorithm to improve the wideband performance of DMAs by sequentially configuring each DMA element. Simulation results for a line-of-sight (LOS) wideband system show the accuracy of the approximations with the simulated DMA model in terms of spectral efficiency. We also find that the proposed successive beamforming algorithm increases the overall spectral efficiency of the DMA-based wideband system compared with a baseline DMA beamforming method.</description>

      <title>Accelerating vRAN and O-RAN with SIMD: Architectural Perspectives and Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of radio access networks (RANs) toward virtualization and openness creates new opportunities for flexible, cost-effective, and high-performance deployments. Achieving real-time and energy-efficient baseband processing on commercial off-the-shelf platforms, however, remains a critical challenge. This article explores how single instruction multiple data (SIMD) architectures can accelerate RAN workloads. We first outline why key physical-layer functions, such as channel estimation, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection, and forward error correction, are well aligned with SIMD's data-level parallelism. We then present practical design guidelines and prototype results, showing significant improvements in throughput and energy efficiency compared to conventional CPU-only processing, while retaining programmability and ease of integration. Finally, we discuss open challenges in workload balancing and hardware heterogeneity, and highlight the role of SIMD as an enabling technology for flexible, efficient, and sustainable 6G-ready RANs.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analysis of Target Parameter Estimation Using Passive Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A passive radar system uses one or more so-called Illuminators of Opportunity (IO) to detect and localize targets. In such systems, a reference channel is often used at each receiving node to capture the transmitted IO signal, while targets are detected using the main surveillance channel. The purpose of the present contribution is to analyze a method for estimating the target parameters in such a system. Specifically, we quantify the additional error contribution due to not knowing the transmitted IO waveform perfectly. A sufficient condition for this error to be negligible as compared to errors due to clutter and noise in the surveillance channel is then given.</description>

      <title>Over-The-Air Phase Calibration of Spaceborne Phased Array for LEO Satellite Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To avoid the unpredictable phase deviations of the spaceborne phased array (SPA), this paper considers the over-the-air (OTA) phase calibration of the SPA for the low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications, where the phase deviations of the SPA and the unknown channel are jointly estimated with multiple transmissions of the pilots. Moreover, the Cramer Rao Bound (CRB) is derived, and the optimization of beam patterns is also presented to lower the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the OTA calibration. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed OTA phase calibration algorithm as the RMSEs of the phase estimates closely approach the corresponding CRB, and the beam pattern optimization scheme is also validated for more than 4dB gain of SNR over the randomly generated beam patterns.</description>

      <title>Towards Precise Channel Knowledge Map: Exploiting Environmental Information from 2D Visuals to 3D Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The substantial communication resources consumed by conventional pilot-based channel sounding impose an unsustainable overhead, presenting a critical scalability challenge for the future 6G networks characterized by massive channel dimensions, ultra-wide bandwidth, and dense user deployments. As a generalization of radio map, channel knowledge map (CKM) offers a paradigm shift, enabling access to location-tagged channel information without exhaustive measurements. To fully utilize the power of CKM, this work highlights the necessity of leveraging three-dimensional (3D) environmental information, beyond conventional two-dimensional (2D) visual representations, to construct high-precision CKMs. Specifically, we present a novel framework that integrates 3D point clouds into CKM construction through a hybrid model- and data-driven approach, with extensive case studies in real-world scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate the potential for constructing precise CKMs based on 3D environments enhanced with semantic understanding, together with their applications in the next-generation wireless communications. We also release a real-world dataset of measured channel paired with high-resolution 3D environmental data to support future research and validation.</description>

      <title>Channel Charting based Fast Beam Tracking Design and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the beyond fifth-generation (B5G) and upcoming sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication systems, millimeter (mmWave) wave technology is a promising solution for offering additional bandwidth resources and mitigating spectrum congestion. Beam tracking is an essential procedure for providing reliable communication services in the mmWave communication system, with the challenge of providing consistent and accurate tracking performance. In this study, we introduce a low-overhead beam tracking algorithm based on channel charting, which significantly reduces beam scanning times during the tracking process. By projecting the beam information to the channel chart, the beam tracking problem is transformed into the acquisition of the beam cluster in the channel chart. Leveraging contrastive learning, the proposed channel chart projects high-dimensional channel state information into a low-dimensional feature space that preserves spatial proximities. Using a dynamic candidate beam acquisition strategy, the complexity of our beam tracking algorithm is significantly reduced. The proposed algorithm significantly reduces scanning complexity while maintaining high prediction accuracy, achieving an accuracy of 98.27\% in simulation environments. Compared to existing methods, the proposed method can reduce beam scanning times by up to 55.9\%. In addition, we also performed field tests, and the measured results demonstrated excellent communication quality during mobility.</description>

      <title>Attitude and Heading Estimation in Symmetrical Inertial Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attitude and heading reference systems (AHRS) play a central role in autonomous navigation systems on land, air and maritime platforms. AHRS utilize inertial sensor measurements to estimate platform orientation. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in multiple inertial measurement units (MIMU) arrays to improve navigation accuracy and robustness. A particularly challenging MIMU implementation is the gyro-free (GF) configuration, in which angular velocity is derived solely from accelerometer measurements. While the GF configurations have multiple benefits, including outlier detection and in angular acceleration measurements, their main drawbacks are inherent instability and an increased divergence rate. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel symmetrical MIMU formulation, in which the IMUs are arranged in symmetric diagonal pairs to decouple linear and rotational acceleration components. To this end, we derive the theoretical foundations for the symmetrical MIMU formulation of the GF equations, develop a nonlinear least squares estimation process, and integrate statistical hypothesis testing into an AHRS error-state extended Kalman filter. We validate our approach using real-world datasets containing 85 minutes of navigation data recorded on both airborne and land platforms. Our results demonstrated a 30\% average reduction in attitude estimation errors, rotation detection accuracy exceeding 95\% improvement, and significantly improved stability compared to a standard GF implementation. These results enable reliable GF navigation in applications where gyroscopes are unavailable, unreliable, or energy-constrained. Common examples include miniature platforms, computational-constraint platforms, and long-endurance marine platforms.</description>

      <title>Estimating Fair Graphs from Graph-Stationary Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We estimate fair graphs from graph-stationary nodal observations such that connections are not biased with respect to sensitive attributes. Edges in real-world graphs often exhibit preferences for connecting certain pairs of groups. Biased connections can not only exacerbate but even induce unfair treatment for downstream graph-based tasks. We therefore consider group and individual fairness for graphs corresponding to group- and node-level definitions, respectively. To evaluate the fairness of a given graph, we provide multiple bias metrics, including novel measurements in the spectral domain. Furthermore, we propose Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp), an optimization-based method with two variants for estimating fair graphs from stationary graph signals, a general model for graph data subsuming many existing ones. One variant of FairSpecTemp exploits commutativity properties of graph stationarity while directly constraining bias, while the other implicitly encourages fair estimates by restricting bias in the graph spectrum and is thus more flexible. Our methods enjoy high probability performance bounds, yielding a conditional tradeoff between fairness and accuracy. In particular, our analysis reveals that accuracy need not be sacrificed to recover fair graphs. We evaluate FairSpecTemp on synthetic and real-world data sets to illustrate its effectiveness and highlight the advantages of both variants of FairSpecTemp.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Indirect Structural Health Monitoring of Rail Infrastructure with Attention-Driven Detection and Localization of Transient Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indirect structural health monitoring (iSHM) for broken rail detection using onboard sensors presents a cost-effective paradigm for railway track assessment, yet reliably detecting small, transient anomalies (2-10 cm) remains a significant challenge due to complex vehicle dynamics, signal noise, and the scarcity of labeled data limiting supervised approaches. This study addresses these issues through unsupervised deep learning. We introduce an incremental synthetic data benchmark designed to systematically evaluate model robustness against progressively complex challenges like speed variations, multi-channel inputs, and realistic noise patterns encountered in iSHM. Using this benchmark, we evaluate several established unsupervised models alongside our proposed Attention-Focused Transformer. Our model employs a self-attention mechanism, trained via reconstruction but innovatively deriving anomaly scores primarily from deviations in learned attention weights, aiming for both effectiveness and computational efficiency. Benchmarking results reveal that while transformer-based models generally outperform others, all tested models exhibit significant vulnerability to high-frequency localized noise, identifying this as a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. Notably, our proposed model achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art solution while demonstrating better inference speed. This highlights the crucial need for enhanced noise robustness in future iSHM models and positions our more efficient attention-based approach as a promising foundation for developing practical onboard anomaly detection systems.</description>

      <title>Optimizing BCI Rehabilitation Protocols for Stroke: Exploring Task Design and Training Duration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability and the second most common cause of death worldwide. Although acute treatments have advanced, recovery remains challenging and limited. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have emerged as a promising tool for post-stroke rehabilitation by promoting neuroplasticity. However, clinical outcomes remain variable, and optimal protocols have yet to be established. This study explores strategies to optimize BCI-based rehabilitation by comparing motor imagery of affected hand movement versus rest, instead of the conventional left-versus-right motor imagery. This alternative aims to simplify the task and address the weak contralateral activation commonly observed in stroke patients. Two datasets, one from healthy individuals and one from stroke patients, were used to evaluate the proposed approach. The results showed improved performance using both FBCSP and EEGNet. Additionally, we investigated the impact of session duration and found that shorter training sessions produced better BCI performance than longer sessions.</description>

Abstract: Efficient radio packet scheduling remains one of the most challenging tasks in cellular networks, and while heuristic methods exist, practical deep learning-based schedulers that are 3GPP-compliant and capable of real-time operation in 5G and beyond are still missing. To address this, we first take a critical look at previous deep scheduler efforts. Secondly, we enhance State-of-the-Art (SoTA) deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms and adapt them to train our deep scheduler. In particular, we propose a novel combination of training techniques for Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and a new Distributional Soft Actor-Critic Discrete (DSACD) algorithm, which outperformed other variants tested. These improvements were achieved while maintaining minimal actor network complexity, making them suitable for real-time computing environments. Furthermore, entropy learning in SACD was fine-tuned to accommodate resource allocation action spaces of varying sizes. Our proposed deep schedulers exhibited strong generalization across different bandwidths, number of Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO) layers, and traffic models. Ultimately, we show that our pre-trained deep schedulers outperform their heuristic rivals in realistic and standard-compliant 5G system-level simulations.</description>

      <title>WaveMax: Radar Waveform Design via Convex Maximization of FrFT Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ambiguity function (AF) is a critical tool in radar waveform design, representing the two-dimensional correlation between a transmitted signal and its time-delayed, frequency-shifted version. Obtaining a radar signal to match a specified AF magnitude is a bi-variate variant of the well-known phase retrieval problem. Prior approaches to this problem were either limited to a few classes of waveforms or lacked a computable procedure to estimate the signal. Our recent work provided a framework for solving this problem for both band- and time-limited signals using non-convex optimization. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach WaveMax that formulates waveform recovery as a convex optimization problem by relying on the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT)-based AF. We exploit the fact that AF of the FrFT of the original signal is equivalent to a rotation of the original AF. In particular, we reconstruct the radar signal by solving a low-rank minimization problem, which approximates the waveform using the leading eigenvector of a matrix derived from the AF. Our theoretical analysis shows that unique waveform reconstruction is achievable with a sample size no more than three times the signal frequencies or time samples. Numerical experiments validate the efficacy of WaveMax in recovering signals from noiseless and noisy AF, including scenarios with randomly and uniformly sampled sparse data.</description>

      <title>SmartUT: Receive Beamforming for Spectral Coexistence of NGSO Satellite Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate downlink co-frequency interference (CFI) mitigation in non-geostationary satellites orbits (NGSOs) co-existing systems. Traditional mitigation techniques, such as Zero-forcing (ZF), produce a null towards the direction of arrivals (DOAs) of the interfering signals, but they suffer from high computational complexity due to matrix inversions and required knowledge of the channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, adaptive beamformers, such as sample matrix inversion (SMI)-based minimum variance, provide poor performance when the available snapshots are limited. We propose a Mamba-based beamformer (MambaBF) that leverages an unsupervised deep learning (DL) approach and can be deployed on the user terminal (UT) antenna array, for assisting downlink beamforming and CFI mitigation using only a limited number of available array snapshots as input, and without CSI knowledge. Simulation results demonstrate that MambaBF consistently outperforms conventional beamforming techniques in mitigating interference and maximizing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), particularly under challenging conditions characterized by low SINR, limited snapshots, and imperfect CSI.</description>

      <title>Objective Features Extracted from Motor Activity Time Series for Food Addiction Analysis Using Machine Learning - A Pilot Study</title>

Abstract: Wearable sensors and IoT/IoMT platforms enable continuous, real-time monitoring, but objective digital markers for eating disorders are limited. In this study, we examined whether actimetry and machine learning (ML) could provide objective criteria for food addiction (FA) and symptom counts (SC). In 78 participants (mean age 22.1 +/- 9.5 y; 73.1% women), one week of non-dominant wrist actimetry and psychometric data (YFAS, DEBQ, ZSDS) were collected. The time series were segmented into daytime activity and nighttime rest, and statistical and entropy descriptors (FuzzyEn, DistEn, SVDEn, PermEn, PhaseEn; 256 features) were calculated. The mean Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) was used as the primary metric in a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) pipeline with five-fold stratified cross-validation (one hundred repetitions; 500 evaluations); SHAP was used to assist in interpretation. For binary FA, activity-segment features performed best (MCC = 0.78 +/- 0.02; Accuracy ~ 95.3% +/- 0.5; Sensitivity ~ 0.77 +/- 0.03; Specificity ~ 0.98 +/- 0.004), exceeding OaS (Objective and Subjective Features) (MCC = 0.69 +/- 0.03) and rest-only (MCC = 0.50 +/- 0.03). For SC (four classes), OaS slightly surpassed actimetry (MCC = 0.40 +/- 0.01 vs 0.38 +/- 0.01; Accuracy ~ 58.1% vs 56.9%). Emotional and restrained eating were correlated with actimetric features. These findings support wrist-worn actimetry as a digital biomarker of FA that complements questionnaires and may facilitate privacy-preserving clinical translation.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of STAR-RIS-Assisted Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems with Electromagnetic Interference and Phase Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous Transmitting and Reflecting Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (STAR-RISs) are being explored for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. A promising configuration for their deployment is within cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, despite the advantages that STAR-RISs could bring, challenges such as electromagnetic interference (EMI) and phase errors may lead to significant performance degradation. In this paper, we investigate the impact of EMI and phase errors on STAR-RIS-assisted cell-free massive MIMO systems and propose techniques to mitigate these effects. We introduce a tailored projected gradient descent (GD) algorithm for STAR-RIS coefficient matrix design by minimizing the local channel estimation normalized mean square error (NMSE). We also derive the novel closed-form expressions of the uplink and downlink spectral efficiency (SE) to analyze system performance with EMI and phase errors, in which fractional power control methods are introduced for performance improvement. The results reveal that the projected GD algorithm can effectively tackle EMI and phase errors to improve estimation accuracy and compensate for performance degradation with nearly 30% NMSE improvement and over 10% SE improvement. Moreover, increasing the number of access points (APs), antennas per AP, and STAR-RIS elements can also improve SE performance. However, the advantages of employing STAR-RIS are reduced when EMI and phase errors are severe. Notably, compared to conventional RISs, the incorporation of STAR-RIS in the proposed system yields better performance and presents less performance degradation in highly impaired environments.</description>

      <title>BRIGHT: A globally distributed multimodal building damage assessment dataset with very-high-resolution for all-weather disaster response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06019</link>

Abstract: Disaster events occur around the world and cause significant damage to human life and property. Earth observation (EO) data enables rapid and comprehensive building damage assessment (BDA), an essential capability in the aftermath of a disaster to reduce human casualties and to inform disaster relief efforts. Recent research focuses on the development of AI models to achieve accurate mapping of unseen disaster events, mostly using optical EO data. However, solutions based on optical data are limited to clear skies and daylight hours, preventing a prompt response to disasters. Integrating multimodal (MM) EO data, particularly the combination of optical and SAR imagery, makes it possible to provide all-weather, day-and-night disaster responses. Despite this potential, the development of robust multimodal AI models has been constrained by the lack of suitable benchmark datasets. In this paper, we present a BDA dataset using veRy-hIGH-resoluTion optical and SAR imagery (BRIGHT) to support AI-based all-weather disaster response. To the best of our knowledge, BRIGHT is the first open-access, globally distributed, event-diverse MM dataset specifically curated to support AI-based disaster response. It covers five types of natural disasters and two types of man-made disasters across 14 regions worldwide, with a particular focus on developing countries where external assistance is most needed. The optical and SAR imagery in BRIGHT, with a spatial resolution between 0.3-1 meters, provides detailed representations of individual buildings, making it ideal for precise BDA. In our experiments, we have tested seven advanced AI models trained with our BRIGHT to validate the transferability and robustness. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/BRIGHT. BRIGHT also serves as the official dataset for the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest.</description>
