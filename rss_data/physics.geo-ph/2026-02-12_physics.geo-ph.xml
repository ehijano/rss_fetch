      <title>Comparison of generative algorithms for conceptual groundwater modeling of coastal volcanic aquifer features with disparate, sparse and extremely imbalanced data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In coastal volcanic aquifers, the reliability of freshwater seawater-exchange simulations are governed by accuracy of the conceptual groundwater model (CGM). The traditional CGMs are constructed by qualitatively combining independent hydrogeophysical features, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of volcanic terrains. To integrate these disparate, sparse, and imbalanced features, we propose an AI-assisted workflow. First, the self-organizing map (SOM) is applied to estimate a deterministic set of transdisciplinary features called the reference model. Second, generative algorithms are applied to the reference model and empirical distributions constructed to obtain sets of stochastic point clouds called the site model. Data quality metrics identify the preferred generative algorithm whose set of stochastic features are mapped using SOM to the groundwater model grid and assigned as the stochastic CGM. The proposed algorithm is applied to extremely imbalanced multiclass features and multiple discrete numerical features observed at the Halawa-Moanalua aquifer, Oahu, Hawaii. At this stie, the Copula Generative Adversarial Network is deemed as the preferred generative algorithm whose set of stochastic transdisciplinary features represent the Halawa-Moanalua CGM. The simulated spatial geologic units correspond to published surface maps; and the simulated conductance, temperature, and barometric pressure profiles correlate with those measured at deep monitoring wells. Inspecting the 3-dimensional conductance models reveal groundwater flow and discharge driven by the aquifer hydraulic gradient, freshwater pumping, seawater intrusion induced by onshore withdrawals, and preferred pathways for freshwater-seawater exchange, such as landward intrusion of seawater and seaward discharge of freshwater.</description>

      <title>Investigation on the inclination angle of undrained shear slip surface in saturated soils based on mixture theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inclination angle of the undrained shear slip surface in saturated soils is analyzed based on mixture theory. First, starting from the property that the bulk strain of soil skeleton is equal to the flow ratio of water discharged from soil skeleton, the energy conservation equation of saturated soil is obtained. According to state variables of energy equation and non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the mechanical mechanism underlying effective stress principle is revealed that Gibbs free energy of saturated soil is only expressed as a function of effective stress under isothermal process. Consequently, the deformation and strength of saturated soil are uniquely determined by the effective stress and not directly related to Newton's equilibrium equations, which governs the movements of solid-fluid two-phase components. The instability of soil skeleton is related to the applied forces and requires analysis based on the Newtonian equilibrium condition. The interaction between the solid-water components and the equilibrium equation of solid component are investigated under two working conditions: when permeability tensor equals zero and when it equals infinity. Combined with the Mohr-Coulomb strength theory, the inclination angle of the undrained shear slip surface is explored under Rankine's passive earth pressure in saturated soil. The results indicate that, when the permeability equals infinity, the uncoupled hydro-mechanical analysis is recommended, and the inclination angle of slip surface is ; when the permeability equals zero, the fully coupled hydro-mechanical analysis is recommended, and the inclination angle of slip surface is . The permeability of actual saturated soil falls between the two extremes, the inclination angle of slip surface must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.</description>

      <title>Field-Deployable Hybrid Gravimetry: Projecting Absolute Accuracy Across a Remote 24km$^2$ Survey via Daily Quantum Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absolute gravimeters deliver drift-free, high-precision measurements but are typically bulky and difficult to deploy, whereas relative gravimeters are lightweight and mobile but intrinsically limited by time-dependent drift. We demonstrate a hybrid quantum-enabled gravimetry approach in which an on-site atomic gravimeter provides routine, $\mu$Gal-level calibration of two mobile spring gravimeters during a field survey spanning 24 km$^2$ of dense tropical terrain. The atomic reference enables high-precision, asynchronous cross-comparison of relative measurements acquired over seven days, effectively suppressing instrumental drift to a level required for demanding geophysical applications. This deployment captures regional gravity gradients with high fidelity under challenging environmental conditions, illustrating how field-operable quantum sensors can extend quantum-grade gravimetry beyond laboratory settings and serve as scalable calibration backbones for large-area, high-precision geophysical surveys in remote or logistically constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Noise is All You Need: rethinking the value of noise on seismic denoising via diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03629v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce SeisDiff-denoNIA, a diffusion-based seismic denoising framework that trains directly on noise extracted from field data, eliminating the dependence on synthetic datasets. Unlike conventional denoising methods that require clean signal labels, our approach uses field noise recorded as training targets, enabling the diffusion model to explicitly learn the true noise distribution. We further demonstrate the framework on a field DAS-VSP survey, where the model effectively suppresses multiple types of noise, including production, instrument, and environment related noise, while preserving key seismic events. By denoising shot gathers with SeisDiff-denoNIA prior to migration, the resulting images exhibit improved event continuity and enhanced reflection visibility without artificial artifacts. In addition, synthetic experiments show that the method substantially outperforms traditional signal-based diffusion models under low-SNR conditions. These results suggest that explicitly modeling noise is not only viable but advantageous for a broad class of seismic denoising tasks, particularly in challenging field environments.</description>

      <title>Large earthquakes follow highly unequal ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was conjectured for a long time that the tectonic plates are in a self-organized state of criticality and that the Gutenberg-Richter law is a manifestation of that. It was recently shown that for a system near criticality, the inequality of their responses due to external driving would sharply rise and show universal behavior that could indicate proximity of the system to a critical point. As a result, measures such as the Gini and Kolkata indices that quantify inequality, can also serve as indicators of imminent criticallity and that of diverging (system spanning) responses. In the context of earthquakes, such a large response would correspond to events of high magnitudes. In this work, we show with numerical simulations and seismic data analysis that large earthquake events have a tendency to follow events that are highly unequal, similar to the case of a system near a critical point. Therefore, a continuous monitoring of the inequality indices of the earthquake time series could be useful for hazard estimates. We have applied this framework to models of earthquakes as well as to the earthquake time series from various tectonically active regions, such as North America, Southern Japan, parts of South-East Asia and Indonesia. The findings also indicate a quantitative estimate of the distance from criticality, when the tectonic plates are viewed as a self-organized critical system.</description>
