      <title>Proton and neutron electromagnetic form factors using $N_f$=2+1+1 twisted-mass fermions with physical values of the quark masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the electromagnetic form factors of the proton and neutron using lattice QCD with $N_f = 2 + 1 + 1$ twisted mass clover-improved fermions and quark masses tuned to their physical values. Three ensembles with lattice spacings of $a$=0.080 fm, 0.068 fm, and 0.057 fm, and approximately the same physical volume allow us to obtain the continuum limit directly at the physical pion mass. Several values of the source-sink time separation ranging from 0.5 fm to 1.5 fm are used, enabling a thorough analysis of excited state effects via multi-state fits. The disconnected contributions are analyzed using high statistics for the two-point functions combined with low-mode deflation and hierarchical probing for the fermion loop estimation. We study the momentum dependence of the form factors using the z-expansion and dipole Ansaetze, thereby enabling the extraction of the electric and magnetic radii, as well as the magnetic moments in the continuum limit, for which we provide preliminary results.</description>

      <title>Quark Transverse Spin-Momentum Correlation of the Nucleon from Lattice QCD: The Boer-Mulders Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD calculation of the quark transverse spin-momentum correlation, i.e., the naive time-reversal-odd Boer-Mulders function, of the nucleon, using large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). The calculation is carried out on an ensemble with lattice spacing $a=0.098$ fm and pion mass $338$ MeV, at various proton momenta up to $2.11$ GeV. We have implemented perturbative matching up to the next-to-next-to-leading order together with a renormalization-group resummation improvement. The result exhibits a decay behavior with increasing transverse separation $b_\perp$. We also compare the results in the nucleon and pion.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD Study of Pion Electroproduction and Weak Production from a Nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations in QCD influence nucleon structure and interactions, with pion production serving as a key probe of chiral dynamics. In this study, we present a lattice QCD calculation of multipole amplitudes at threshold, related to both pion electroproduction and weak production from a nucleon, using two gauge ensembles near the physical pion mass. We develop a technique for spin projection and construct multiple operators for analyzing the generalized eigenvalue problem in both the nucleon-pion system in the center-of-mass frame and the nucleon system with nonzero momentum. The numerical lattice results are then compared with those extracted from experimental data and predicted by low-energy theorems incorporating one-loop corrections.</description>

      <title>Impact of lattice gluon dataset on CTEQ-TEA global PDFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the latest gluon parton results from lattice QCD on the global parton distribution function (PDF) analysis within the CTEQ-TEA framework. The dependence on PDF parameterization is explored using the CT18As variant, incorporating the ATLAS 7 TeV precision $W,Z$ dataset and introducing more flexible parameters to allow strangeness asymmetry at the starting scale $Q_0$. The interplay between lattice input and collider inclusive jet datasets is examined by including the post-CT18 inclusive jet datasets from recent LHC measurements and/or removing all collider inclusive jet datasets. Finally, we demonstrate several phenomenological implications at the LHC, focusing on gluon-gluon parton luminosity and related processes, such as the production of a Higgs-like scalar, top-quark pairs, and their associated production with an additional jet, Higgs, or $Z$ boson.</description>

      <title>Flow-based sampling for multimodal and extended-mode distributions in lattice field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.00734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent results have demonstrated that samplers constructed with flow-based generative models are a promising new approach for configuration generation in lattice field theory. In this paper, we present a set of training- and architecture-based methods to construct flow models for targets with multiple separated modes (i.e.~vacua) as well as targets with extended/continuous modes. We demonstrate the application of these methods to modeling two-dimensional real and complex scalar field theories in their symmetry-broken phases. In this context we investigate different flow-based sampling algorithms, including a composite sampling algorithm where flow-based proposals are occasionally augmented by applying updates using traditional algorithms like HMC.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Freedom at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Transition without Fine-Tuning Using a Qubit Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a two-dimensional hard-core loop-gas model as a way to regularize the asymptotically free massive continuum quantum field theory that emerges at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Without fine-tuning, our model can reproduce the universal step-scaling function of the classical lattice XY model in the massive phase as we approach the phase transition. This is achieved by lowering the fugacity of Fock-vacuum sites in the loop-gas configuration space to zero in the thermodynamic limit. Some of the universal quantities at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition show smaller finite size effects in our model as compared to the traditional XY model. Our model is a prime example of qubit regularization of an asymptotically free massive quantum field theory in Euclidean space-time and helps understand how asymptotic freedom can arise as a relevant perturbation at a decoupled fixed point without fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Numerical determination of the width and shape of the effective string using Stochastic Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flow-based architectures have recently proved to be an efficient tool for numerical simulations of Effective String Theories regularized on the lattice that otherwise cannot be efficiently sampled by standard Monte Carlo methods. In this work we use Stochastic Normalizing Flows, a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture based on non-equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations, to study different effective string models. After testing the reliability of this approach through a comparison with exact results for the Nambu-Got\={o} model, we discuss results on observables that are challenging to study analytically, such as the width of the string and the shape of the flux density. Furthermore, we perform a novel numerical study of Effective String Theories with terms beyond the Nambu-Got\={o} action, including a broader discussion on their significance for lattice gauge theories. The combination of these findings enables a quantitative description of the fine details of the confinement mechanism in different lattice gauge theories. The results presented in this work establish the reliability and feasibility of flow-based samplers for Effective String Theories and pave the way for future applications on more complex models.</description>

      <title>Tensor-network toolbox for probing dynamics of non-Abelian gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18301v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor-network methods enable probing dynamics of strongly interacting quantum many-body systems, including gauge theories, via Hamiltonian simulation, hence bypassing sign problems. They also have the potential to inform efficient quantum-simulation algorithms of the same theories. We develop and benchmark a matrix-product-state ansatz for the SU(2) lattice gauge theory using the loop-string-hadron formulation. This formulation has been demonstrated to be advantageous in Hamiltonian simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories. It is applicable to both SU(2) and SU(3) gauge groups, to periodic and open boundary conditions, and to 1+1 and higher dimensions. In this work, we report on progress in computing static and dynamical observables in a SU(2) gauge theory in (1+1)D, pushing the boundary of existing studies.</description>

      <title>Higher-order gaugino condensates on a twisted $\mathbb T^4$: In the beginning was semi-classics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the gaugino condensates, $\left\langle \prod_{i=1}^k \text{tr}(\lambda\lambda)(x_i) \right\rangle $ for $1$ $\leq$ $k$ $\le$ $N-1$, in $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills theory on a small four-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^4$, subject to 't Hooft twisted boundary conditions. Two recent advances are crucial to performing the calculations and interpreting the result: the understanding of generalized anomalies involving $1$-form center symmetry and the construction of multi-fractional instantons on the twisted $\mathbb T^4$. These self-dual classical configurations have topological charge $k/N$ and can be described as a sum over $k$ closely packed lumps in an instanton liquid. Using the path integral formalism, we perform the condensate calculations in the semi-classical limit and find, assuming gcd$(k,N)=1$, $\left\langle \prod_{i=1}^k \text{tr}(\lambda\lambda)(x_i) \right\rangle = {\bf n}^{-1} \; N^2\left(16\pi^2 \Lambda^3\right)^k$, where $\Lambda$ is the strong-coupling scale and ${\bf n}$ is a normalization constant. We determine the normalization constant, using path integral, as ${\bf n} = N^2$, which is $N$ times larger than the normalization used in our earlier publication arXiv:2210.13568. This finding resolves the extra-factor-of-$N$ discrepancy encountered there, aligning our results with those obtained through direct supersymmetric methods on $\mathbb R^4$. The normalization constant ${\bf n}$ can be understood within the Euclidean path-integral framework as the Witten index $I_W$. From the Hamiltonian approach, it is well-established that $I_W = N$. While the value ${\bf n} = N^2$ correctly reproduces the condensate result, this discrepancy between the Hamiltonian and path-integral formulations calls for reconciliation. We attempt to provide a potential solution we outline in our discussion.</description>

      <title>Finding Interaction Mechanism between Exotic Molecule and Conventional Hadron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An intriguing and important question arises: how do hadronic molecules interact with conventional hadrons? In this work, we propose a novel mechanism to address this issue, focusing on the interactions between hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks ($P_c$) and nucleons ($N$). By applying this mechanism, we derive the corresponding interaction potentials, enabling the prediction of the bound state properties. Our results indicate the possible existence of $P_cN$ bound states-an entirely new form of matter, ripe for exploration in the era of high-precision hadron spectroscopy. Notably, this mechanism extends beyond the $P_cN$ systems and can be applied to any hadronic molecules interacting with conventional hadrons, offering the potential for discovering a variety of novel bound states.</description>

      <title>Decays of the light hybrid meson $1^{\mathrm{-+}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The full width of the light isovector hybrid meson $H_{\mathrm{V}}$ with spin-parities $1^{\mathrm{-+}}$ and content $(\overline{u}gu-\overline{d}gd)/ \sqrt{2}$ is evaluated by considering the decays $H_{\mathrm{V}} \to \rho^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}$, $b_1^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}$, $f_1(1285)\pi$, $f_1(1420)\pi$, $ \eta \pi$, and $\eta^{\prime} \pi$. To calculate the partial widths of these channels, we use QCD three-point sum rule method which is necessary to determine strong couplings at the corresponding hybrid-meson-meson vertices. It turns out that the main contribution to the full width $\Gamma[H_{\mathrm{ V}}]=(109.7 \pm 16.0)~\mathrm{MeV}$ of the hybrid meson comes from the processes $H_{\mathrm{V}} \to \rho^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}$ partial width of which amounts to $\approx 67~\mathrm{MeV}$. The effects of the decays $H_{\mathrm{V }} \to b_1\pi $ and $H_{\mathrm{V}} \to f_1\pi, f_1^{\prime} \pi$ are also sizeable: Their partial widths are equal to $13~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $20~ \mathrm{MeV}$, respectively. The decays to $\eta \pi$ and $\eta^{\prime} \pi$ mesons are subdominant reactions, nevertheless they form $\approx 9\%$ of the full width $\Gamma[H_{\mathrm{V}}]$. Results obtained in this work may be interesting to unravel the tangle of predictions about $H_{\mathrm{V}}$ existing in the literature, as well as useful in analyses of different resonances.</description>
