      <title>Blind Eye: Motion and Obstacle Detection Leveraging Wi-Fi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless Fidelity or Wi-Fi, has completely transfigured wireless networking by offering a smooth connection to the internet and networks, particularly when dealing with enclosed environments. As with the majority of wireless technology, it functions through radio communication. This makes it possible for Wi-Fi to operate effectively close to an Access Point. However, a device's ability to receive Wi-Fi signals can vary greatly. These discrepancies arise because of impediments or motions between the device and the access point. We have creatively used these variances as unique opportunities for applications that can be used to detect movement in confined areas. As this approach makes use of the current wireless infrastructure, no additional hardware is required. These applications could potentially be leveraged to enable sophisticated robots or enhance security systems.</description>

      <title>HAIL: An Efficient Iterative Algorithm for Qubit Mapping via Layer-Weight Assignment and Search Space Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current quantum devices only support interactions between physical qubits and a limited number of neighboring qubits, preventing quantum circuits from being executed directly on the devices. To execute the circuit, SWAP gates must be inserted to adjust the mapping relationships between qubits, which consequently increases runtime and error rates in quantum circuits. To address these challenges, this paper proposes HAIL, an efficient iterative qubit mapping algorithm to minimize additional SWAP gates. First, a layer-weight assignment method integrated with the subgraph isomorphism algorithm is introduced to establish an initial mapping. Next, we propose a SWAP sequence search combined with the post-processing function to identify the optimal SWAP sequences. Finally, the qubit mapping algorithm is refined through iterative forward and backward traversals to further reduce the number of SWAP gates. Experimental results on the IBM Q20 architecture and various benchmarks demonstrate that HAIL-3 reduces the number of additional gates inserted in the $\mathcal{B}_{23}$ by 20.62% compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Additionally, we present a partially extended strategy based on HAIL to reduce the sequence search space, with experiments on the sparsely connected Google Sycamore architecture showing a reduction in both algorithm runtime and additional SWAP gates.</description>

      <title>All-in-One Analog AI Accelerator: On-Chip Training and Inference with Conductive-Metal-Oxide/HfOx ReRAM Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analog in-memory computing is an emerging paradigm designed to efficiently accelerate deep neural network workloads. Recent advancements have demonstrated significant improvements in throughput and efficiency, focusing independently on either inference or training acceleration. However, a unified analog in-memory technology platform-capable of performing on-chip training, retaining the weights, and sustaining long-term inference acceleration-has yet to be reported. In this work, an all-in-one analog AI accelerator is presented and benchmarked, combining these capabilities to enable autonomous, energy-efficient, and continuously adaptable AI systems. The platform leverages an array of filamentary conductive-metal-oxide(CMO)/HfOx redox-based resistive switching memory cells (ReRAM) in one-transistor one-ReRAM (1T1R) configuration, integrated into the back-end-of-line (BEOL) of a 130 nm technology node. The array characterization demonstrates reliable and optimized resistive switching with voltage amplitudes of less than 1.5 V, enabling compatibility with advanced technology nodes. The multi-bit capability of over 32 stable states (5 bits) and record-low programming noise down to 10 nS enable an almost ideal weight transfer process, more than an order of magnitude better than other memristive technologies. The array's inference performance is validated through realistic matrix-vector multiplication simulations on a 64x64 array, achieving a record-low root-mean-square error ranging from 0.06 at 1 second to 0.2 at 10 years after programming. The array is then characterized applying the same conditions used for on-chip training. Training accuracy closely matching the software equivalent is achieved across different datasets, with high-fidelity modelling of the device response based on experimental data.</description>

      <title>Next-Gen Software Engineering. Big Models for AI-Augmented Model-Driven Software Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness of model-driven software engineering (MDSE) has been successfully demonstrated in the context of complex software; however, it has not been widely adopted due to the requisite efforts associated with model development and maintenance, as well as the specific modelling competencies required for MDSE. Concurrently, artificial intelligence (AI) methods, particularly deep learning methods, have demonstrated considerable abilities when applied to the huge code bases accessible on open-source coding platforms. The so-called big code provides the basis for significant advances in empirical software engineering, as well as in the automation of coding processes and improvements in software quality with the use of AI. The objective of this paper is to facilitate a synthesis between these two significant domains of software engineering (SE), namely models and AI in SE. The paper provides an overview of the current state of AI-augmented software engineering and develops a corresponding taxonomy, AI4SE. In light of the aforementioned considerations, a vision of AI-assisted Big Models in SE is put forth, with the aim of capitalising on the advantages inherent to both approaches in the context of software development. Finally, the new paradigm of pair modelling in MDSE is proposed.</description>

      <title>To Be or Not to Be (in the EU): Measurement of Discrepancies Presented in Cookie Paywalls (LONG)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06920v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cookie paywalls allow visitors to access the content of a website only after making a choice between paying a fee (paying option) or accepting tracking (cookie option). The practice has been studied in previous research in regard to its prevalence and legal standing, but the effects of the clients' device and geographic location remain unexplored. To address these questions, this study explores the effects of three factors: 1) the clients' browser, 2) the device type (desktop or mobile), and 3) the geographic location on the presence and behavior of cookie paywalls and the handling of users' data.
  Using an automatic crawler on our dataset composed of 804 websites that present a cookie paywall, we observed that the presence of a cookie paywall was most affected by the geographic location of the user. We further showed that both the behavior of a cookie paywall and the processing of user data are impacted by all three factors, but no patterns of significance could be found. Finally, an additional type of paywall was discovered to be used on approximately 11% of the studied websites, coined the "double paywall", which consists of a cookie paywall complemented by another paywall once tracking is accepted.</description>

      <title>GroupBeaMR: Analyzing Collaborative Group Behavior in Mixed Reality Through Passive Sensing and Sociometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding group behavior is crucial for enhancing collaboration and productivity in mixed reality (MR). This paper introduces a framework for group behavior analysis in MR, or GroupBeaMR for short for analyzing group behavior in MR. GroupBeaMR leverages MR headsets' sensors to analyze group behavior through conversation, shared attention, and proximity, identifying cohesive, fragmented, and competitive interaction patterns. Using social network analysis, GroupBeaMR provides quantitative assessments of group dynamics, offering insights into collaboration structures. A user study with 48 participants across 12 groups validates the framework's ability to distinguish interaction patterns in MR environments. Our analyses show that group behavior is independent of task performance, emphasizing the significance of social interaction patterns. Our group-type assignments indicate that sensor-based assessments in MR can provide meaningful insights into collaborative experiences, supporting the design of systems that adapt and optimize group behaviors.</description>
