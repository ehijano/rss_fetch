      <title>Heuristic Planner for Communication-Constrained Multi-Agent Multi-Goal Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In robotics, coordinating a group of robots is an essential task. This work presents the communication-constrained multi-agent multi-goal path planning problem and proposes a graph-search based algorithm to address this task. Given a fleet of robots, an environment represented by a weighted graph, and a sequence of goals, the aim is to visit all the goals without breaking the communication constraints between the agents, minimizing the completion time. The resulting paths produced by our approach show how the agents can coordinate their individual paths, not only with respect to the next goal but also with respect to all future goals, all the time keeping the communication within the fleet intact.</description>

      <title>On the Use of Abundant Road Speed Data for Travel Demand Calibration of Urban Traffic Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a compute-efficient algorithm to tackle a fundamental problem in transportation: that of urban travel demand estimation. It focuses on the calibration of origin-destination travel demand input parameters for high-resolution traffic simulation models. It considers the use of abundant traffic road speed data. The travel demand calibration problem is formulated as a continuous, high-dimensional, simulation-based optimization (SO) problem with bound constraints. There is a lack of compute efficient algorithms to tackle this problem. We propose the use of an SO algorithm that relies on an efficient, analytical, differentiable, physics-based traffic model, known as a metamodel or surrogate model. We formulate a metamodel that enables the use of road speed data. Tests are performed on a Salt Lake City network. We study how the amount of data, as well as the congestion levels, impact both in-sample and out-of-sample performance. The proposed method outperforms the benchmark for both in-sample and out-of-sample performance by 84.4% and 72.2% in terms of speeds and counts, respectively. Most importantly, the proposed method yields the highest compute efficiency, identifying solutions with good performance within few simulation function evaluations (i.e., with small samples).</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Motion Planning For Differential Drive Robots Through Stationary State Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Motion Planning (MAMP) finds various applications in fields such as traffic management, airport operations, and warehouse automation. In many of these environments, differential drive robots are commonly used. These robots have a kinodynamic model that allows only in-place rotation and movement along their current orientation, subject to speed and acceleration limits. However, existing Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF)-based methods often use simplified models for robot kinodynamics, which limits their practicality and realism. In this paper, we introduce a three-level framework called MASS to address these challenges. MASS combines MAPF-based methods with our proposed stationary state search planner to generate high-quality kinodynamically-feasible plans. We further extend MASS using an adaptive window mechanism to address the lifelong MAMP problem. Empirically, we tested our methods on the single-shot grid map domain and the lifelong warehouse domain. Our method shows up to 400% improvements in terms of throughput compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>ROMAS: A Role-Based Multi-Agent System for Database monitoring and Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in data analytics when integrated with Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). However, these systems often struggle with complex tasks that involve diverse functional requirements and intricate data processing challenges, necessitating customized solutions that lack broad applicability. Furthermore, current MAS fail to emulate essential human-like traits such as self-planning, self-monitoring, and collaborative work in dynamic environments, leading to inefficiencies and resource wastage. To address these limitations, we propose ROMAS, a novel Role-Based M ulti-A gent System designed to adapt to various scenarios while enabling low code development and one-click deployment. ROMAS has been effectively deployed in DB-GPT [Xue et al., 2023a, 2024b], a well-known project utilizing LLM-powered database analytics, showcasing its practical utility in real-world scenarios. By integrating role-based collaborative mechanisms for self-monitoring and self-planning, and leveraging existing MAS capabilities to enhance database interactions, ROMAS offers a more effective and versatile solution. Experimental evaluations of ROMAS demonstrate its superiority across multiple scenarios, highlighting its potential to advance the field of multi-agent data analytics.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Convergence to Equilibrium Prices in Trading Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a decentralized market model in which agents can negotiate bilateral contracts. This builds on a similar, but centralized, model of trading networks introduced by Hatfield et al. (2013). Prior work has established that fully-substitutable preferences guarantee the existence of competitive equilibria which can be centrally computed. Our motivation comes from the fact that prices in markets such as over-the-counter markets and used car markets arise from \textit{decentralized} negotiation among agents, which has left open an important question as to whether equilibrium prices can emerge from agent-to-agent bilateral negotiations. We design a best response dynamic intended to capture such negotiations between market participants. We assume fully substitutable preferences for market participants. In this setting, we provide proofs of convergence for sparse markets ({covering many real world markets of interest}), and experimental results for more general cases, demonstrating that prices indeed reach equilibrium, quickly, via bilateral negotiations. Our best response dynamic, and its convergence behavior, forms an important first step in understanding how decentralized markets reach, and retain, equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal SIR Model of Pandemic Spread During Warfare with Optimal Dual-use Healthcare System Administration using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale crises, including wars and pandemics, have repeatedly shaped human history, and their simultaneous occurrence presents profound challenges to societies. Understanding the dynamics of epidemic spread during warfare is essential for developing effective containment strategies in complex conflict zones. While research has explored epidemic models in various settings, the impact of warfare on epidemic dynamics remains underexplored. In this study, we proposed a novel mathematical model that integrates the epidemiological SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model with the war dynamics Lanchester model to explore the dual influence of war and pandemic on a population's mortality. Moreover, we consider a dual-use military and civil healthcare system that aims to reduce the overall mortality rate which can use different administration policies. Using an agent-based simulation to generate in silico data, we trained a deep reinforcement learning model for healthcare administration policy and conducted an intensive investigation on its performance. Our results show that a pandemic during war conduces chaotic dynamics where the healthcare system should either prioritize war-injured soldiers or pandemic-infected civilians based on the immediate amount of mortality from each option, ignoring long-term objectives. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating conflict-related factors into epidemic modeling to enhance preparedness and response strategies in conflict-affected areas.</description>

      <title>Game susceptibility, Correlation and Payoff capacity as a measure of Cooperative behavior in the thermodynamic limit of some Social dilemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analytically, finding the origins of cooperative behavior in infinite-player games is an exciting topic of current interest. In this paper, we compare three analytical methods, i.e., Nash equilibrium mapping (NEM), Darwinian selection (DS) and Aggregate selection (AS), with a numerical Agent based method (ABM) via the game susceptibility, correlation, and payoff capacity as indicators of cooperative behaviour. While the analytical NEM model shows excellent agreement with the numerical ABM, the other analytical models, like AS and DS, show notable divergence with ABM in the thermodynamic limit for the indicators in question. Previously, cooperative behavior was studied by considering game magnetization and individual players' average payoff as indicators. This paper shows that game susceptibility, correlation, and payoff capacity can aid in understanding cooperative behavior in social dilemmas in the thermodynamic limit. The results obtained via NEM and ABM are in good agreement for all three indicators in question, for both Hawk-Dove and the Public goods games. After comparing the results obtained for all five indicators, we see that individual players' average payoff and payoff capacity serve as the best indicators to study cooperative behavior among players in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>REVECA: Adaptive Planning and Trajectory-based Validation in Cooperative Language Agents using Information Relevance and Relative Proximity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of multi-agent cooperation, where agents achieve a common goal by cooperating with decentralized agents under complex partial observations. Existing cooperative agent systems often struggle with efficiently processing continuously accumulating information, managing globally suboptimal planning due to lack of consideration of collaborators, and addressing false planning caused by environmental changes introduced by other collaborators. To overcome these challenges, we propose the RElevance, Proximity, and Validation-Enhanced Cooperative Language Agent (REVECA), a novel cognitive architecture powered by GPT-4o-mini. REVECA enables efficient memory management, optimal planning, and cost-effective prevention of false planning by leveraging Relevance Estimation, Adaptive Planning, and Trajectory-based Validation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate REVECA's superiority over existing methods across various benchmarks, while a user study reveals its potential for achieving trustworthy human-AI cooperation.</description>

      <title>When LLMs Play the Telephone Game: Cumulative Changes and Attractors in Iterated Cultural Transmissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) start interacting with each other and generating an increasing amount of text online, it becomes crucial to better understand how information is transformed as it passes from one LLM to the next. While significant research has examined individual LLM behaviors, existing studies have largely overlooked the collective behaviors and information distortions arising from iterated LLM interactions. Small biases, negligible at the single output level, risk being amplified in iterated interactions, potentially leading the content to evolve towards attractor states. In a series of telephone game experiments, we apply a transmission chain design borrowed from the human cultural evolution literature: LLM agents iteratively receive, produce, and transmit texts from the previous to the next agent in the chain. By tracking the evolution of text toxicity, positivity, difficulty, and length across transmission chains, we uncover the existence of biases and attractors, and study their dependence on the initial text, the instructions, language model, and model size. For instance, we find that more open-ended instructions lead to stronger attraction effects compared to more constrained tasks. We also find that different text properties display different sensitivity to attraction effects, with toxicity leading to stronger attractors than length. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for multi-step transmission dynamics and represent a first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of LLM cultural dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Scale Cognitive Interaction Model of Instrument Operations at the Linac Coherent Light Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04734v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) is the world's first x-ray free electron laser. It is a scientific user facility operated by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, at Stanford, for the U.S. Department of Energy. As beam time at LCLS is extremely valuable and limited, experimental efficiency -- getting the most high quality data in the least time -- is critical. Our overall project employs cognitive engineering methodologies with the goal of improving experimental efficiency and increasing scientific productivity at LCLS by refining experimental interfaces and workflows, simplifying tasks, reducing errors, and improving operator safety and stress. Here we describe a multi-agent, multi-scale computational cognitive interaction model of instrument operations at LCLS. Our model simulates aspects of human cognition at multiple cognitive and temporal scales, ranging from seconds to hours, and among agents playing multiple roles, including instrument operator, real time data analyst, and experiment manager. The model can roughly predict impacts stemming from proposed changes to operational interfaces and workflows. Example results demonstrate the model's potential in guiding modifications to improve operational efficiency. We discuss the implications of our effort for cognitive engineering in complex experimental settings, and outline future directions for research. The model is open source and supplementary videos provide extensive detail.</description>

      <title>Adaptive bias for dissensus in nonlinear opinion dynamics with application to evolutionary division of labor games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of adaptively controlling the bias parameter in nonlinear opinion dynamics (NOD) to allocate agents into groups of arbitrary sizes for the purpose of maximizing collective rewards. In previous work, an algorithm based on the coupling of NOD with an multi-objective behavior optimization was successfully deployed as part of a multi-robot system in an autonomous task allocation field experiment. Motivated by the field results, in this paper we propose and analyze a new task allocation model that synthesizes NOD with an evolutionary game framework. We prove sufficient conditions under which it is possible to control the opinion state in the group to a desired allocation of agents between two tasks through an adaptive bias using decentralized feedback. We then verify the theoretical results with a simulation study of a collaborative evolutionary division of labor game.</description>
