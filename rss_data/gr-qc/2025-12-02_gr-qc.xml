      <title>Letelier black hole immersed in an electromagnetic universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a static, spherically symmetric black hole solution surrounded by a cloud of strings and immersed in an electromagnetic universe. By deriving the event horizon from the lapse function, we demonstrate that both the string cloud parameter and the electromagnetic background parameter significantly modify the horizon radius compared to the Schwarzschild case. Consequently, thermodynamic quantities-including the Hawking temperature, Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and heat capacity-become explicit functions of these additional parameters, with the heat capacity exhibiting divergences that signal phase transitions. We analyze the motion of massive test particles in this spacetime, deriving the effective potential and calculating the innermost stable circular orbit radius, which governs the inner edge of accretion disks and influences orbital stability. Scalar perturbations are examined through the associated effective potential, and quasinormal mode frequencies are computed using the sixth-order WKB approximation; the negative imaginary parts confirm the stability of the black hole under such perturbations. We also study the photon sphere structure, black hole shadow radius, and photon trajectories, showing how the interplay between string clouds and the electromagnetic background shapes the optical properties of this spacetime. Finally, we investigate weak gravitational lensing phenomena by deriving the deflection angle for both massive particles and photons using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem applied to the optical geometry. The results exhibit notable deviations from the Schwarzschild geometry, with the string cloud enhancing the deflection through a $(1-\alpha)^{-1}$ factor while the electromagnetic parameter introduces competing corrections at second order.</description>

      <title>Enhanced energy extraction via magnetic reconnection in Kerr-AdS spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the energy extraction from Kerr-AdS black holes following the magnetic reconnection process. The parameter space regions that satisfy the energy extraction condition, as well as the efficiency and power of the extracted energy, are analyzed. The study shows that the presence of a negative cosmological constant extends the range of dominant reconnection radial locations where the energy extraction condition is met, and enables energy extraction even from black holes with relatively low spin. Furthermore, the influence of the negative cosmological constant on energy extraction is modulated by the extent of the dominant reconnection radial region: a more negative cosmological constant enhances the extracted energy, efficiency, and power, particularly for smaller dominant reconnection radii. These results demonstrate that the energy extraction from Kerr-AdS black holes is more favorable than that from their asymptotically flat counterparts. Our results highlight the crucial role of the cosmological constant in energy extraction via magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>More on the relativistic images produced in gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational lensing properties and the formation of relativistic images associated with black holes modeled by the Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr space-time geometries. In particular, we perform numerical computations of the deflection angles, image angular positions, magnification factors (including demagnification), and time delays between distinct images, and we systematically quantify the dependence of these observables on the electric charge and spin parameters of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Radiation reaction force for scalar-tensor theories in effective-one-body formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whilst most of the binary configurations in modified theories of gravity are studied under quasi-circular orbit limit, eccentricity effects could play a significant role in future gravitational wave detections. We derive the gravitational radiation-reaction force for nonspinning eccentric orbits within the effective-one-body (EOB) description for the massless scalar-tensor theories up to 1.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order. The effects in such theories start at $1/c^3$ and interestingly, the 1.5PN order effect is due to the radiation reaction square effects which is a conservative effect. The results derived here can be implemented in the quasi-circular EOB-based waveform models to construct waveform templates for generic orbit binaries within massless scalar-tensor theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic charges of a quadrupolar naked singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to compute the asymptotic charges of a vacuum solution to the Einstein field equations describing a naked singularity with a non-vanishing quadrupole moment, known in the literature as the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime (q-metric). In addition to the well-known asymptotic quantities such as the Bondi-Sachs energy-momentum, the BMS charges and NP constants of this spacetime are computed. Explicit calculations of the latter are relatively scarce in the literature. Moreover, it has been proven that the NP constants of asymptotically flat, stationary, vacuum, and algebraically special spacetimes vanish (for instance, those of the Kerr spacetime). A by-product of the present analysis is to show that the algebraically special condition in the aforementioned result appears to be crucial, since the q-metric provides a counterexample to the conjecture that all asymptotically flat, stationary, vacuum, and asymptotically algebraically special spacetimes (a weaker version of the algebraically special condition) have vanishing NP constants.</description>

      <title>Probing the Scalar Hair of Rotating Horndeski Black Holes through Thick Disk Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Horizon-scale images of black holes provide a potential probe of fundamental physics, including tests of gravity and black hole hair. To assess the impact of scalar hair on accretion-flow imaging self-consistently, we construct an analytical model of a geometrically thick, magnetized disk around a rotating hairy black hole in Horndeski theory and analyze its 230 GHz image morphology. We find that scalar hair modestly alters the inflow and magnetic-field structure but strengthens gravitational redshift, markedly reducing the total flux and lensed ring brightness through relativistic transfer and spectral-shift effects. Moreover, we highlight a previously unexplored channel: the maximum interferometric diameter of the first photon ring responds strongly to the hair parameter but shows little dependence on accretion-flow details, making it a promising observable for constraining black-hole hair with future space-based interferometry.</description>

      <title>Non-singular cosmologies matching regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new non-singular cosmological model matched to a Minkowski-core regular black hole by means of a modified Oppenheimer--Snyder framework. Its dynamics is studied in both dust-only and scalar-field scenarios, and compared with that of two other non-singular models as well as the classical standard cosmology. The results show that, although all three non-singular cosmologies share identical late-time behavior and allow for a natural embedding of inflation in the scalar-field setting, they exhibit qualitatively distinct non-singular features at very early times. In particular, the new cosmology approaches Minkowski spacetime in the limits of both the infinite past and the infinite future, thereby manifesting an intriguing symmetry between the two asymptotic regimes.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian gravity with fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermions are coupled to the Einstein-Cartan system in the canonical formulation, including the cosmological, the Barbero-Immirzi, and the non-minimal coupling constants. The resulting ten first-class constraints generate gauge transformations that are on-shell equivalent to spacetime diffeomorphisms and SL(2,C) transformations. The gravitational second-class constraints receive fermionic contributions, which can be implemented by use of Dirac brackets or by solving them directly. Furthermore, we identify new fermionic (second-class) constraints that are necessary to recover the Dirac-fermion theory by relating the momenta to the configuration variables on dynamical solutions; this fermionic phase-space reduction is accomplished by use of corresponding Dirac brackets. The theory remains well-defined off the second-class constraint surfaces with ten additional degrees of freedom - six of which are gravitational and the remaining four are fermionic. Discrete (CPT) symmetries as well as implications for canonical quantization and modified theories of gravity with fermions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Geometric Constraints on Quantum Gravity-Inspired Dispersion Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modified dispersion relations (MDRs) arise in many quantum-gravity approaches, often in non-polynomial or non-analytic form beyond the reach of effective field theory (EFT). Logarithmic, exponential and trigonometric MDRs appear in causal set theory, nonlocal gravity and $\kappa$-Poincar\'e models, while Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) yields polymeric (sine), holonomy, inverse-triad and semiclassical corrections. Using the geometric framework of Ref.~\cite{GRP}, we analyse the intrinsic curvature of the associated energy--momentum surfaces, where negative curvature ensures hyperbolic and stable propagation, and curvature sign changes or critical points indicate kinematical instabilities or new invariant scales. We apply this method exhaustively to all major MDRs derived in LQG and find that they remain strictly hyperbolic in the entire phenomenologically relevant regime, with no elliptic patches or critical branching. The same framework provides universal constraints on representative logarithmic, exponential and trigonometric MDRs beyond EFT. Thus, geometric criteria yield a unified and coordinate-independent assessment of stability, thresholds and invariant scales, and demonstrate the robustness of MDRs emerging from LQG.</description>

      <title>Computing nonlinearity ratios using second order black hole perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit an analytical approximation scheme for computing nonlinearity ratios involving quadratic quasinormal modes (QQNMs). We compute these ratios for the general case when the QQNM is not one of the linear QNMs, for the $(l,m)$ channel $(2,2) \times (2,2) \to (4,4)$. We find an excellent match with numerical simulations. We also discuss where and why the method can fail, for example, for the channel $(2,0) \times (2,0) \to (2,0)$ where we can only get crude estimates for the nonlinearity ratio. Motivated by recent studies on nonlinear ringdown at the horizon, we also compute the nonlinearity ratios at the horizon. We find that the ratio both at the horizon and infinity is insensitive to different choices of regularization of the source term in the second order perturbations. We also discuss amplitudes of QQNMs sourced by linear overtones. Finally, we discuss the issues that must be resolved within this method to do precision analysis of nonlinear ringdown.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scattering of boson-star binaries, taking into account three effects: point-mass gravitational, tidal, and short-range scalar-field interactions. We compare analytic results to the scattering angle extracted from four sequences of numerical-relativity simulations at fixed energy and varying impact parameter. The very good agreement exhibits the attractive (repulsive) effect of in-phase (out-of-phase) binaries, wich dominates at small impact parameters. We thus obtain the first effective-one-body potential, central for the construction of analytic gravitational-wave templates.</description>

      <title>Realistic classical charge from an asymmetric wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell theory, we consider a wormhole solution supported by a complex non-phantom spinor field with a bare mass of the order of the Planck mass (which provides a nontrivial spacetime topology and an intrinsic angular momentum), an electric field (which provides a charge of the system), and a magnetic field. This solution describes an asymmetric wormhole connecting two different asymptotically flat spacetimes (two universes) in which there are in general different observed masses and charges. It is shown that, by suitably adjusting the values of free system parameters, at one end of the wormhole, one can obtain the values of the observed mass and charge typical of the Standard Model particles, whereas at the other end of the wormhole these physical quantities acquire the Planck values. Such a configuration incarnates Wheeler's idea of ``mass without mass'' and ``charge without charge'', and can be thought of as a model of a classical charge possessing a spin.</description>

      <title>Imprints of Dark Matter on the Shadow and Polarization Images of a Black Hole Illuminated by Various Thick Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on two distinct thick accretion flow disk models, such as a phenomenological RIAF-like model and an analytical Hou disk model, we investigate the impact of relevant parameters on the visual characteristics of the Schwarzschild black hole (BH) surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM). We impose a general relativistic radiative transfer equation to determine the synchrotron emission from thermal electrons and generate horizon-scale images. In the RIAF-like model, we notice that the corresponding photon ring and central dark region are expanded with the aid of the PFDM parameter $\eta$, with brightness asymmetries originating at higher inclination angles and closely tied to flow dynamics and emission anisotropy. The fundamental difference between isotropic and anisotropic radiation is that anisotropy introduces vertical distortions in the higher-order images, resulting in an elliptical appearance. For the Hou disk model, the observed images produce narrower rings and dark interiors, while polarization patterns trace the brightness distribution and changes with the variations of the inclination angle and PFDM parameter $\eta$, which reflects the spacetime signature. All these results indicate that the observed intensity and polarization characteristics in the framework of thick disk models may serve as valuable probes of underlying spacetime geometry and the accretion-dynamics close to the horizon.</description>

      <title>Kiselev Black Holes in Anti-de Sitter Spacetime Are Not Viable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the Kiselev black hole solution does not describe a perfect fluid quintessence, it is possible that dark energy fluid is not isotropic, and so one may hope that the solution may still describe at least locally a black hole embedded in such a dark energy fluid environment. Taking into account that the accelerated expansion of the Universe is caused by a dynamical dark energy fluid, and the actual underlying cosmological constant is negative as has been sometimes suggested, we show that the Kiselev solution is untenable as it is unstable against brane nucleation instability.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive analysis of Barrow holographic Chaplygin gas model reconstruction and its cosmological consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current study, we have reconstructed variable modified Chaplygin gas in the Barrow holographic dark energy framework motivated by many recent studies. We have validated the generalized second law of thermodynamics for the reconstructed model. The permissible values of the reconstructed model have been determined by the recent astrophysical and cosmological observational data. The Hubble parameter is presented in terms of the observable parameters and redshift $z$ and other model parameters. From the Stern data set and joint data set of Stern with BAO and CMB observations, the bounds of the model parameters $(B_{0}, \Omega_{bhd0})$ are obtained by the $\chi^{2}$ minimization procedure. The best-fit value of the distance modulus $\mu(z)$ against redshift $z$ is obtained for the reconstructed model and it is consistent with the SNe Ia union2 sample data.</description>

More specifically, we focus on the accretion of the Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG). To incorporate the global features of the GCG into this analysis, we employ the McVittie metric, which describes a black hole embedded in an expanding cosmological background. Within this framework, accretion is studied while consistently accounting for the backreaction on the metric components. Using a perturbative approach, we derive an expression for the effective black hole mass and for the evolution of both the black hole and cosmological apparent horizons under accretion. The analysis is performed in two distinct cosmological regimes: first, a matter-dominated era, and subsequently, a de Sitter era. In both cases, it is possible to determine analytically the instant in which accretion begins. For the matter-dominated era, the analytical expression shows that the greater the amount of matter available for accretion, the longer the accretion takes to start.</description>

      <title>A Model-Independent Framework for Gravitational-Wave Reconstruction of Binary Black Hole Hyperbolic Encounters in Ground-Based Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary black hole hyperbolic encounters represent a dynamical interaction in which two black holes undergo a close fly-by, emitting gravitational-wave bremsstrahlung in the form of a short-duration, single-cycle transient. These events are expected to occur in dense stellar environments such as globular clusters and both active and quiescent galactic nuclei. In this work, we constrain the detection sensitivity for hyperbolic encounters of black hole pairs with a range of asymmetric masses. We employ BayesWave, a wavelet-based morphology-independent algorithm to characterize hyperbolic encounter waveforms in simulated detector noise; for this study, we explore the use of exponential shapelets. We find that a typical hyperbolic orbit with total mass $20 M_{\odot}$ can be detected up to distance $d_L \sim 40 - 200$ Mpc, and we forecast the possibility of detection by ground-based current and future gravitational wave interferometers.</description>

      <title>Consistent Regularization of Signature-Changing BTZ Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spacetime singularities pose a fundamental challenge to classical and quantum gravity. We develop a mathematically consistent framework for signature-changing black holes by revisiting the $(2+1)$-dimensional BTZ metric, which undergoes a Lorentzian-to-Euclidean transition at the horizon. We identify and resolve a critical inconsistency in previous regularization schemes concerning second-order distributional terms $\varepsilon''(r)$, introducing a \emph{modified Hadamard regularization} that is rigorously defined within distribution theory. This yields a vacuum solution without surface layers or impulsive waves. Geodesic analysis shows that infalling observers require infinite proper time to reach the horizon, and curvature remains finite everywhere. Furthermore, we establish the physical viability of the solution by proving its linear stability, demonstrating consistent quantum scalar field propagation across the horizon, and reinterpreting the $r=0$ singularity as a removable topological boundary. Our work places signature change and the associated \emph{atemporality} on a solid foundation as a robust mechanism for singularity resolution.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Memory Effect in the Massless Vector Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the infrared structure and memory effects of a massless vector tensor theory with non minimal curvature coupling in asymptotically flat spacetimes. Using Bondi Sachs expansions, we identify the independent radiative data and derive the effective Bondi mass aspect, whose balance law receives an additional positive definite flux from the vector sector. This leads to modified displacement, spin, and center of mass memory (CM) expressions, where the gravitational contributions retain their General Relativity (GR) form and the vector field enters only through well defined flux terms. We also describe persistent vector memory effects associated with the leading angular vector mode, which are gauge invariant but do not affect the leading tidal observables. The BMS transformations act kinematically as in GR. Tensor vacua remain supertranslation degenerate, whereas the vector vacuum, defined by the vanishing vector field, is nondegenerate. All results reduce continuously to GR when the coupling is removed, isolating the precise channels through which vector curvature interactions modify the infrared dynamics.</description>

      <title>Horizon Data: Existence Results and a Near-Horizon Equation on General Null Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a spacetime $(\mathcal{M},g)$, a horizon is a null hypersurface where the deformation tensor $\mathcal{K}:=\pounds_{\eta}g$ of a null and tangent vector $\eta$ satisfies certain restrictions. In this work, we develop a formalism to study the geometry of \textit{general} horizons (i.e. characterized by any $\mathcal{K}$), based on encoding the zeroth and first transverse derivatives of $\mathcal{K}$ on null hypersurfaces detached from any ambient spacetime. We introduce the notions of \textit{$\mathcal{K}$-tuple} and \textit{non-isolation tensor}. The former encodes the order zero of $\mathcal{K}$, while the latter is a symmetric $2$-covariant tensor that codifies the ``degree of isolation" of a horizon. In particular, the non-isolation tensor vanishes for homothetic, Killing and isolated horizons. As an application we derive a \textit{generalized near-horizon equation}, i.e., an identity that holds on any horizon (regardless of its topology or whether it contains fixed points), which relates the non-isolation tensor, a certain torsion one-form, and curvature terms. By restricting this equation to a cross-section one can recover the near-horizon equation of isolated horizons and the master equation of multiple Killing horizons. Our formalism allows us to prove two existence theorems for horizons. Specifically, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a non-degenerate totally geodesic horizon with any prescribed non-isolation tensor to be embeddable in a spacetime satisfying any (non-necessarily $\Lambda$-vacuum) field equations. We treat first the case of arbitrary topology, and then show how the result can be strengthened when the horizon admits a cross-section.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing inside and outside of a marginally unstable photon sphere in a general, static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically-flat spacetime in strong deflection limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is believed that rays bent inside and outside photon spheres could affect partially the black hole shadow images by the Event Horizon Telescope and the rays near photon spheres would be detected by near-future space observations. The features of the rays near the photon spheres in not only black hole spacetimes but also exotic spacetimes would be important since one will need them to exclude black-hole mimickers. The deflection angles of the rays deflected by photon spheres diverge logarithmically and we can treat them by a strong-deflection-limit analysis. The error of the strong-deflection-limit analysis becomes large if antiphoton spheres exist in the spacetimes and the analysis breaks down when the photon spheres and the antiphoton spheres degenerate to form a marginally unstable photon sphere. This is because the deflection angles of the rays bent by the marginally unstable photon sphere diverge in powers. In this paper, we extend Eiroa, Romero, and Torres's method to gravitational lensing of rays inside and outside of the marginally unstable photon sphere in a general, static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically-flat spacetime in strong deflection limits and we apply it to a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m spacetime and a Hayward spacetime with the marginally unstable photon sphere. We have also confirmed that the deflection angles in the strong deflection limits by the method converge correctly to the deflection angle without approximations, while there are the mismatches of the coefficient of the power-divergent term of the deflection angles of the rays deflected just outside of the marginally unstable photon sphere in a semi-analytic calculation by the author previously.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS black holes under physical field-vanishing boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boundary conditions play a key role in determining the perturbation behavior of a black hole. Motivated by two guiding principles for single-field perturbations -- the non-deformation of the boundary metric and the vanishing of electromagnetic energy flux at the AdS boundary -- we impose a boundary condition for Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS (RN-AdS) black holes requiring both the metric and electromagnetic field-strength perturbations to vanish at the AdS boundary, which we term the physical field-vanishing (PFV) condition. Using the formulas for perturbation reconstruction, we translate the PFV condition into boundary conditions on the master functions: Dirichlet-type for odd-parity modes and Robin-type for even-parity modes. With these boundary conditions, we compute the quasinormal frequencies of RN-AdS black holes and identify new spectral features. The PFV prescription introduced here could be applied to other multifield perturbation systems in asymptotically AdS spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Stellar Objects From Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the theoretical implications of quantum gravity by analyzing compact stellar objects, presenting three distinct models that serve as alternatives to traditional black holes. These models are characterized by their extreme compactness and incorporation of a quantum core, successfully avoiding the curvature singularities typically associated with classical general relativity. Central to these models is the noncommutative parameter, which plays a crucial role in determining stellar properties and enables the exploration of various astrophysical regimes. While pure Planckian effects pose significant challenges for observational detection, our findings suggest that lower energy scales may reveal exotic stellar objects with Earth and Sun-like masses that lack classical counterparts, potentially providing the first experimental evidence of non-classical gravity. We propose that the metrics derived in this study can be tested against known neutron stars, offering promising avenues for future research aimed at understanding the interplay between quantum effects in gravity and stellar evolution, ultimately enhancing our comprehension of the universe's fundamental properties.</description>

      <title>Search for Peak Structures in the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O1-O4a Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dedicated search for gravitational-wave backgrounds with nontrivial peak structures using data from the first three and the initial part of the fourth observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network. The analysis is motivated by a variety of early-Universe models characterized by signals with multiple peaks. We introduce a model independent parameterization of double-peaked spectra based on the superposition of two normalized broken power laws and perform a Bayesian inference study using the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA isotropic cross-correlation data. While no statistically significant evidence for a multi-peak background is found, the analysis provides constraints on the inter-peak slopes in correlation with the signal amplitude. These results exhibit LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's ability to probe signals beyond a single peak structure and establish a foundation for future targeted searches for nontrivial gravitational waves background spectral shapes in future observing runs and the advanced detector era.</description>

Abstract: We construct Cauchy initial data for the Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon (EMKG) system, which evolves in finite time into spacetimes containing multiple trapped surfaces. From a physical perspective, this corresponds to preparing multiple well-separated boson stars, each of which collapses to form a spacelike black hole region. In particular, this extends the result of the second and third named authors on the formation of multiple trapped surfaces in vacuum to the EMKG system.</description>

      <title>On extremal black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We take a fresh look at the viability of physically realistic extremal black holes within our (non-supersymmetric) low energy physics. By incorporating prefactors and volume effects, we show that Schwinger discharge in charge neutral environments is far more efficient than commonly assumed. Using ionization estimates for neutral hydrogen, we obtain a new and robust lower bound on the mass of an extremal electrically charged black hole, exceeding $10^{14} M_\odot$. For magnetic black holes, we compute the Lee-Nair-Weinberg instability and revisit early universe pair creation rates, including singular instantons that substantially enhance production, to demonstrate that the extreme charges required for stability are cosmologically implausible. Finally, we suggest that an extremal Kerr black hole could shed angular momentum via superradiant scattering from the stochastic gravitational wave background. Taken together, our results provide a unified picture that extremal black holes of any type are unlikely to persist in our universe.</description>

      <title>Explicit and universal formula for thermodynamic volume in extended black hole thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In extended black hole thermodynamics, the cosmological constant and other couplings are treated as thermodynamic variables, yielding a first law $\tilde{\delta}M=T\tilde{\delta}S+\Omega\tilde{\delta}J+\mathcal{V}\tilde{\delta}P+\cdots$, where $P\equiv -\frac{\Lambda}{8\pi}$. A long-standing conceptual gap in this framework is that, unlike $M$, $T$, $S$, $\Omega$, and $J$, the thermodynamic volume $\mathcal{V}$ lacks a first-principles definition and can only be deduced from other thermodynamic quantities. This deficiency indicates that the underlying origin of $\mathcal{V}$ has remained poorly understood. In this work, we resolve this issue and provide an explicit universal formula for $\mathcal{V}$. We demonstrate that it universally decomposes into two contributions, one arising from the explicit dependence of the action on the couplings and the other from the response of the fundamental dynamical fields. This clarifies the physical meaning of thermodynamic volume and places it on the same footing as other intrinsic thermodynamic quantities.</description>

      <title>No Love for black holes: tightest constraints on tidal Love numbers of black holes from GW250114</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal Love numbers of black holes, zero in classical general relativity for Kerr black holes in vacuum, become non-vanishing in the presence of exotic matter or in alternative theories of gravity, making them a powerful probe of fundamental physics. The gravitational-wave event GW250114, observed with an unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio, provides a unique opportunity to test this prediction. By analyzing this event, we conclude that the data is consistent with the binary black hole hypothesis, and we place a 90\% upper limit on the effective tidal deformability of $\tilde{\Lambda} &lt; 34.8$. These bounds imply that any environment surrounding the black holes must contribute less than $\sim 7\times 10^{-3}$ of their mass, and they rule out some models of boson stars. Our findings provide the strongest observational constraints yet on black hole tidal deformability and show that the data remain fully consistent with the Kerr black hole prediction of vanishing tidal Love numbers.</description>

      <title>Quantum Recoherence in Presence of Excited States in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum-to-classical transition of primordial perturbations within a two-field inflationary framework where an adiabatic mode interacts with an entropic environment. In the case of a massive entropic environment, the attractor Bunch--Davies vacuum plays a special role: it is the only state that can undergo full recoherence, whereas all excited initial states exhibit persistent loss of purity. To characterize this behavior, we parameterize excited Gaussian initial states by their Bogoliubov coefficients and compute the purity and R\'enyi-2 entropy of the reduced adiabatic state as information-theoretic indicators of decoherence dynamics. We find that excited states display \emph{purity-freezing} at a non-zero plateau, where residual quantum correlations persist indefinitely, a qualitative departure from the complete recoherence observed for the Bunch--Davies vacuum. This sensitivity to initial conditions highlights the non-generic nature of full recoherence in the quantum-to-classical transition of inflationary perturbations.</description>

      <title>Spatial Phonons: A Phenomenological Viscous Dark Energy Model for DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a phenomenological model of dark energy in which space is treated as an elastic brane with uniform tension $T_s$ supporting a longitudinal phonon fluid. The brane tension gives a residual geometric contribution to the vacuum energy, while the phonon sector is described by three scalar fields $\phi^I$ and an invariant $b = \sqrt{\det B_{IJ}}$ entering an effective action $F(b)$. At the background level this reproduces a perfect fluid with energy density, pressure and bulk modulus set by two dimensionless parameters $\varepsilon$ and $\kappa$. These parameters fix the enthalpy and bulk modulus in units of the space tension and determine the phonon sound speed through $c_s^2 = \kappa/\varepsilon$. Dissipative effects are modeled by a bulk viscous pressure obeying a Maxwell type relaxation law with a characteristic time scale $\tau(H)$ that depends on the Hubble rate. Motivated by a Boltzmann suppressed scattering rate at a mass-gap scale $H_\star$, we adopt a simple ansatz for $H\tau(H)$ and obtain a compact expression for the effective dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm eff}(H)$. The viscous correction is transient, is most active around $H \sim H_\star$ and drives a temporary phantom deviation. At the same time, we also show that $w_{\rm eff}$ approaches $-1 + \varepsilon$ at very early and very late times. Using a flat $\Lambda$CDM background for $H(z)$, we scan the parameter space and identify a region with $\kappa \ \simeq \ \varepsilon \ \simeq \ 1/3$ and $H_\star/H_0 \ \simeq \ 2.1$. This choice gives an ultralight phonon with sound speed close to the causal limit and a viscous dark energy history $w_{\rm eff}(z)$ that closely tracks a DESI motivated Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization over the redshift range most relevant for the DESI BAO measurements.</description>

      <title>General-Relativistic Path Effects and the Local Hubble Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an effective mapping for low-redshift photon propagation that captures the leading path-dependent deviations from the standard FLRW redshift. Instead of relying on exact integrations of the Sachs optical equations, we introduce a minimal deformation of the redshift relation z_eff(z) = z minus alpha times f(z), where alpha is a small amplitude and f(z) suppresses the correction at z greater than approximately 0.1. This mapping does not modify the background expansion but encapsulates the leading contribution of inhomogeneous tidal fields to the accumulated Sachs redshift. We derive the implications for the luminosity distance, the low-redshift Hubble relation, and the directional dependence associated with local structure. The framework provides a clean general-relativistic description of path-dependent redshift drift and yields concrete predictions for forthcoming low-redshift surveys.</description>

      <title>Cosmology of Gravi-Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how a mass term for gravitational axions (''gravi-axions'') with a Chern-Simons coupling to gravity can naturally arise due to non-perturbative contributions from Euclidean wormholes, breaking the continuous shift symmetry of the standard theory. The induced mass can be generated in a cosmologically relevant range to be the dark matter or dark energy of the universe for a reasonable and well-motivated range of the symmetry breaking scale. Upon generating the gravi-axion mass term, we discuss the cosmology of the theory. We find that the gravi-axion can be produced to be the dominant dark matter component via misalignment or gravitational particle production, and that in a different regime, the gravi-axion can act as dynamical dark energy. We discuss gravi-axion decay into gravitons as a potential observational window for this theory. Finally, we find that, for late-time, astrophysical compact objects, cosmologically relevant gravi-axions behave as minimally-coupled, massive scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Finite Gauss-Sum Modular Kernels: Scalar Gap and a Pure AdS$_3$ Gravity No-Go Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain closed-form expressions for the $ST^nS$ modular kernels of non-rational Virasoro CFTs and use them to construct fully analytic modular-bootstrap functionals. At rational width $\tau$, the Mordell integrals in these kernels reduce to finite quadratic Gauss sums of $\operatorname{sech}/\sec$ profiles with explicit Weil phases, furnishing a canonical finite-dimensional real basis for spectral kernels. From this basis we build finite-support "window" functionals with $\Phi(0)=1$ and $\Phi(p)&gt;0$ on a prescribed low-momentum interval. Applied to the scalar channel of the $ST^1S$ kernel, these functionals yield a rigorous analytic bound on the spinless gap. As a second application we prove an analytic no-go theorem for pure AdS$_3$ gravity: no compact, unitary, Virasoro-only CFT$_2$ can have a primary gap above $\Delta_{\rm BTZ}=(c-1)/12$, because a strictly positive "Mordell surplus" in the odd-spin $ST$ kernel forces an odd-spin primary below $\Delta_{\rm BTZ}$.</description>

      <title>Existence and bounds of nonlinear singularity-free cosmological solutions in a string-inspired gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous proof for the existence of homogeneous, isotropic and globally singularity-free cosmological solutions in Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) gravity with exponential coupling. While numerical studies suggested such solutions exist, a formal proof remained elusive. By employing a novel ``power identity method'' and overcoming significant challenges posed by the strong nonlinearities of the exponential coupling, which are not present in the quadratic coupling analyzed in our companion paper \cite{he2025proofssingularityfreesolutionsscalarization}, we establish a FLRW solution valid for all time $t\in(-\infty,+\infty)$, where the Hubble parameter remains positive and vanishes asymptotically, while the scalar field evolves monotonically. This result align with numerical simulations and offer a firm mathematical foundation for singularity-free cosmology in a string-inspired setting.</description>

      <title>Instability thresholds for de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes in holographic semiclassical gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stability of $d$-dimensional ($d=3,4,5$) de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes within the framework of semiclassical gravity sourced by a strongly coupled quantum field with a gravity dual. Our stability results are derived from a careful analysis of the $d$-dimensional Lichnerowicz equation with mass-squared $m^2$ and of semiclassical equations involving the dimensionless parameter $\gamma_d$. For $d=3$, we find that Minkowski spacetime is always unstable against perturbations, whereas de Sitter spacetime becomes stable when a dimensionless parameter $\gamma_3$ exceeds a critical value. In $d=4$, both de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes become unstable when the parameter $\gamma_4$ exceeds its critical value. In contrast, in $d=5$, de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes remain stable for almost all values of the parameter $\gamma_5$, except for a regime in which higher-curvature corrections become comparable to the Einstein tensor.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Chiral-Quintom dark energy after DESI DR2 and impact on unifying dark energy with inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent data release DR2 from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has reinforced compelling evidence supporting the dynamical nature of dark energy. In this respect, we here explore a two-scalar field cosmological model, dubbed Chiral-Quintom paradigm, that allows for a unified description of early- and late-time cosmic accelerations, namely inflation and dark energy, respectively. Moreover, we show that it provides a mechanism to cross the phantom divide without instabilities. To do so, we first focus on scenarios where the scalar fields evolve under an exponential potential, leading to distinct cosmological behaviors, including tracking solutions and slow-roll or hyperbolic inflation. Afterwards, by considering a nonlinear potential and a mixing in the kinetic sector, we show that the model can also describe the matter-dominated era, offering a potential unification of the dark sector. Accordingly, we place bounds on this double-field paradigm by employing recent low-redshift observational data, including supernovae from the Pantheon+ and Union3.0 compilations, observational Hubble parameter measurements, and baryon acoustic oscillation data from the latest DESI release. By means of the Akaike information criterion, the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario and the $w_0w_a$CDM model are thus compared with the Chiral-Quintom approach, showing that, in principle, multiple-field dynamics does not seem to be ruled out, ultimately providing a flexible framework for describing late-time dynamics.</description>

      <title>Probing a minimal dark gauge sector via microlensing of compact dark objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a minimal Dark Standard Model (DSM) consisting of a single spin-0 particle with dark $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, and completely decoupled from the visible sector. Characterized only by the scalar mass $\mu$ and the dark charge $q$, this framework naturally gives rise to a rich phenomenology, including stable solitonic configurations that behave as dark "mini-MACHOs". We numerically build and evolve these gauged scalar-field solitons, derive their mass-radius relations, and identify a critical charge beyond which no gravitationally bound configurations exist. By combining these results with microlensing surveys that exclude compact objects heavier than the asteroid-mass scale ($M\lesssim 10^{-11}M_\odot$), we obtain the constraint $\mu\gtrsim 10\,\rm eV$ for viable configurations, depending on $q$. Our results represent a step forward in showing that purely gravitational observations can constrain the internal parameters of a dark gauge sector, and provide a framework for exploring broader DSM scenarios through future probes such as gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>No boundary density matrix in elliptic de Sitter dS/$\mathbb{Z}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elliptic de Sitter (dS) spacetime dS$/\mathbb{Z}_2$ is a non-time-orientable spacetime obtained by imposing an antipodal identification to global dS. Unlike QFT on global dS, whose vacuum state can be prepared by a no-boundary Euclidean path integral, the Euclidean elliptic dS does not define a wavefunction in the usual sense. We propose instead that the path integral on the Euclidean elliptic dS defines a no-boundary density matrix. As an explicit example, we study the free Dirac fermion CFT in two-dimensional elliptic dS and analytically compute the von Neumann and the R\'enyi entropies of this density matrix. The calculation reduces to correlation functions of vertex operators on non-orientable surfaces. As a by-product, we compute the time evolution of entanglement entropy following a crosscap quench in free Dirac fermion CFT. We also comment on a striking feature of free QFT in elliptic dS: its global Hilbert space is one-dimensional, wheres the Hilbert space associated to each observer is a nontrivial Fock space.</description>

      <title>Images of shadow and thin accretion disk around Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the shadow and optical appearance of Bardeen black hole (BH) immersed in perfect-fluid dark matter (PFDM). Using the EHT data, we find that the DM parameter is restricted to a narrow allowed range, confined to values of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1}-10^{-2})$. Additionally, we observed that increasing the DM parameter substantially enlarges the photon sphere, the critical impact parameter, and thus the shadow radius, whereas the magnetic charge $g$ produces only negligible corrections. The DM component also modifies the optical appearance of the accretion disk: higher $b$ systematically suppresses the observed radiation intensity and reduces image brightness, while changes in $g$ yield only marginal effects. Subsequently, using the Novikov-Thorne thin disk model, we analyze primary and secondary images, observed flux, and redshift patterns, showing that PFDM noticeably alters image size and brightness whereas magnetic charge has a negligible influence. No blueshifted regions appear in any configuration. These results highlight several promising observational signatures for testing DM environments and nonlinear electrodynamic effects around BHs.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Orbital Variations in Binary Radio Pulsars from Lense-Thirring Precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A future measurement of Lense-Thirring (LT) precession using a binary radio pulsar is expected to yield the pulsar's moment of inertia ($I_{\rm p}$). However, most of the known pulsar-binary systems expected to provide this opportunity will exhibit linear variations in the orbital elements due to LT precession that are difficult to separate from variations induced by other mechanisms. In this work, we demonstrate that the pulsar-timing signature of LT precession for an arbitrary orbital orientation produces nonlinear orbital variations; if detected, these nonlinear variations provide a means to constrain $I_{\rm p}$ without the need for timing-independent measurements of orbital geometry or distance. We show through simulations that these signatures are indeed detectable in pulsar-binary systems with an appropriate combination of timing precision and orbital geometry. Our simulations also show that nonlinear orbital variations from LT precession are expected to be detectable in PSR J1757$-$1854 after only 15 yr of dedicated timing.</description>

Abstract: Quantum gravity effects are expected to resolve the black hole singularity and the effects may deform the region near but outside the horizon. Applying AdS/CFT correspondence, we see their signatures from the viewpoint of dual conformal field theory. As a regularized geometry, we consider AdS gravastar constructed by gluing AdS-Schwarzschild and de Sitter spacetime. The retarded Green functions of dual conformal field theory have bulk-cone singularities associated with null trajectories in the bulk and we obtain the singularities specific to a horizon-less geometry. We also observe echoes coming from waves reflected behind the photon sphere. The existence of echoes implies the modification of geometry inside the photon sphere.</description>

Abstract: We explore an unusual symmetry in a field theory on a specific (1+1)-dimensional curved spacetime, which has an interesting interpretation as an approximate asymptotic Weyl symmetry. Unlike the conventional Weyl symmetry, the boundary term under the variation plays a crucial role in understanding for its anomaly. After converting a two-dimensional field theory on curved spacetime to an inhomogeneous field theory, we obtain the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor. Then, we show the existence of an Unruh-like effect in the bubble wall expansion at the zero temperature.</description>

      <title>From Black Hole to Galaxy: Neural Operator: Framework for Accretion and Feedback Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling how supermassive black holes co-evolve with their host galaxies is notoriously hard because the relevant physics spans nine orders of magnitude in scale-from milliparsecs to megaparsecs--making end-to-end first-principles simulation infeasible. To characterize the feedback from the small scales, existing methods employ a static subgrid scheme or one based on theoretical guesses, which usually struggle to capture the time variability and derive physically faithful results. Neural operators are a class of machine learning models that achieve significant speed-up in simulating complex dynamics. We introduce a neural-operator-based ''subgrid black hole'' that learns the small-scale local dynamics and embeds it within the direct multi-level simulations. Trained on small-domain (general relativistic) magnetohydrodynamic data, the model predicts the unresolved dynamics needed to supply boundary conditions and fluxes at coarser levels across timesteps, enabling stable long-horizon rollouts without hand-crafted closures. Thanks to the great speedup in fine-scale evolution, our approach for the first time captures intrinsic variability in accretion-driven feedback, allowing dynamic coupling between the central black hole and galaxy-scale gas. This work reframes subgrid modeling in computational astrophysics with scale separation and provides a scalable path toward data-driven closures for a broad class of systems with central accretors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous proof establishing the mathematical equivalence between two independent criteria for the marginal stability of multi-fluid relativistic stars: the dynamical criterion based on the vanishing of the fundamental radial pulsation mode's eigenfrequency, and the static criterion derived from the geometric alignment of mass and particle number gradients in the parameter space. Leveraging this equivalence, we introduce a powerful and computationally efficient framework as an upgraded version of the critical curve method, to systematically map the stability boundaries for multi-fluid mixed stars across the entire parameter space of central pressures. Our analysis, applied to a variety of nuclear and dark matter equations of state, reveals the existence of stable region in the observable mass-radius diagram. By resolving degeneracies with 3-dimensional Mass-Radius-Pressure diagrams, we provide a complete topological view of the ensemble. This work supplies a robust theoretical foundation for interpreting multi-messenger astronomical observations and constraining the properties of dark matter.</description>

Abstract: Concerning the stability of two-fluid star models, we prove the rigorous equivalence of two independent determining methods for mixed stars, after a brief review of the hybrid star case. Our derivations apply to general multi-fluid cases, and here we take dark matter admixed neutron star models for example, demonstrating a stability boundary distinct from the single-fluid case. Stable configurations form a surface in the three-dimensional parameter space of (either) central pressure, mass, and radius, which yields a group containing stable mixed stars. This group includes twin stars with identical masses and radii but different interior structures. These results can help interpret compact star observations and constrain dark matter properties through astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Towards a complete description of multiple D$p$-brane systems: Multiple D$0$ Story</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we address the problem of constructing the complete supersymmetric description of systems of $N$ nearly coincident Dirichlet $p$-branes (multiple D$p$-brane or mD$p$). A particularly important result is a completely nonlinear action for the 10-dimensional dynamical system of nearly coincident multiple D$0$-branes (mD$0$) which is doubly supersymmetric, i.e. it is invariant under both spacetime (target superspace) supersymmetry and the worldline supersymmetry; the latter is a counterpart of the local fermionic $\kappa$-symmetry characteristic of a single D$0$-brane (Dirichlet superparticle). This problem is approached in flat superspace using the (spinor) moving frame formalism, which provides us with a geometric framework to the treatment of supersymmetric particles and extended objects ($p$-branes) in higher dimensions. Furthermore, we have initiated the quantization program aimed at development of a field theory of multiple D$0$-branes. This quantization in its complete form is expected to lead to a novel supersymmetric field theory formulated on a superspace extended by additional bosonic and fermionic matrix coordinates, whose development may offer significant insights into the deeper structure of String/M-theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a string theory realisation of a two-parameter family of Type IIB supergravity solutions of the form ${\rm WAdS}_3 \times {\rm WS}^3 \times M_4$, as near-horizon geometries of supersymmetric backgrounds involving D1-D5 branes, D3-branes and NS5-branes. We show that the full solutions, as well as their near-horizon limits, preserve four supercharges. We end by presenting a new doubly-deformed warped black hole solution and study its thermodynamical properties.</description>

Abstract: Optically levitated particles are used in a wide range of experiments to explore both fundamental physics and to act as sensors to a variety of external forces. One field of particular interest that these particles can be used to investigate is quantum mechanics. Previous research has yet to set an absolute upper bound on the size of objects that can be prepared in a quantum superposition. Exploring this limit involves allowing ever-larger objects to freely and coherently evolve to assess if their behaviour matches quantum or classical theoretical predictions. However, the long free evolution times required for these behaviours to be visible result in the experiments being gravitationally limited. Space based platforms therefore become the next key step in these investigations. In this white paper, we shall discuss our proposal for an optical levitation experiment in space that will explore the fundamental upper size limits of quantum mechanics. We shall cover the scientific motivation behind these investigations, then summarize the current status of our designs for the satellite. We will then review the aspects of the payload that require further development, then summarize the current estimates of the payload's requirements.</description>

      <title>Braneworld Black Bounce to Transversable Wormhole Analytically Connected to an asymptotically $AdS_5$ Boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03528v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the recent approach from reference [1] to obtain complete and analytic solutions (both brane and bulk) of a Simpson-Visser (SV) geometry within a braneworld framework. The embedded geometry can represent a traversable wormhole (TWH), a one-way wormhole (OOWH), or a regular black hole (RBH). The resulting geometry is regular everywhere, eliminating any singularity or local de-Sitter core at the origin and on the brane location, where the regular geometry is given by the SV geometry. The throat of TWHs or OOWHs can extend into the extra dimension. The event horizon of RBH extends along the extra dimension, prompting speculation on the extension of entropy into this dimension. Although the induced geometry is characterized by tension, acting akin to a positive cosmological constant (thus potentially representing empty space), the induced four-dimensional geometry remains regular. There is no need to introduce additional energy sources on the brane to achieve this regularity. Hence, the brane's geometry, which may depict an RBH, TWH, or OWWH, is influenced by the geometric properties of the bulk</description>

      <title>Polytropic Stars in $f(Q) = Q +\xi Q^2$ covariant formulation</title>

Abstract: General Relativity (GR) is not the only way gravity can be geometrised. Instead of curvature, the Teleparallel Theory attributes gravity to torsion $T$, which is related to the antysimmetric part of connection, and the Symmetric Teleparallel theory no longer preserves metricity, describing gravity through the non-metricity tensor $Q_{\alpha\mu\nu}\equiv \nabla_\alpha g_{\mu\nu}.$ These descriptions give form to what is known as geometrical trinity of gravity. Recently, the extensions of GR have been intensively investigated in order to solve the theoretical impasses which have arisen. In this sense, it is also useful to investigate the extensions of alternative descriptions of gravity, which leads us to the so-called $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ gravities. In this paper, we consider a family of $f(Q)$ models and obtain their corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-{Volkoff} equations applied to {polytropic} stars. Using numerical integration, it is possible to solve a system of differential equations and calculate, among other things, the maximum mass and mass-radius relation allowed. In addition, we explicitly show the non-metricity behavior inside and outside the star.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric generalization of zero-scalar-curvature solutions from the Schwarzschild metric via the Newman-Janis algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address a specific issue of the Newman-Janis algorithm: How to determine the general form of the complex transformation for the Schwarzschild metric and ensure that the resulting axisymmetric metric satisfies the zero-scalar-curvature condition, $R=0$. In this context, the zero-scalar-curvature condition acts as a constraint. Owing to this condition, we refer to the class of black holes as the ``Newman-Janis class of Schwarzschild black holes" in order to emphasize Newman-Janis algorithm's potential as a classification tool for axisymmetric black holes. The general complex transformation we derive not only generates the Kerr, Taub-NUT, and Kerr-Taub-NUT black holes under specific choices of parameters but also suggests the existence of additional axisymmetric black holes. Our findings open an alternative avenue using the Newman-Janis algorithm for the construction of new axisymmetric black holes.</description>

      <title>Probing a regular black hole within asymptotically safe gravity via strong gravitational lensings and optical appearances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09513v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the strong gravitational lensing effects and optical appearances around a spherically symmetric regular black hole, whose metric is derived from a non-singular collapsing dust ball model in asymptotically safe gravity. In this regular black hole spacetime, we obtain the analytical expression of the light deflection angle via calculating the strong field limit coefficients, and evaluate the lensing observables in strong field regime by supposing the regular black hole as the candidate of $M87^*$ and $SgrA^*$ supermassive black holes, respectively. Then, we study the optical appearances of an optically and geometrically thin spherical accretion around the regular black hole in this framework. Finally, we compare above results and show how much they differ from those obtained in the Schwarzschild black hole spacetime. We expect our results will be useful in the future to distinguish these non-singular black holes from their classical singular counterparts.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for relating the transition rate of an accelerated Unruh-deWitt detector to the rate of the same detector when stationary in Minkowski space. Furthermore, we show that when using the detector as a model for decay, its transition rate can be related directly to the decay rate obtained from QFT. Combined this provides a straightforward method for calculating the decay rate of accelerated particles to first order in the coupling constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-conservation of dark matter can lead to late-time cosmic acceleration. This mechanism is known as the matter creation theory and this replaces the need of dark energy and modified gravity theories. We consider a two-fluid system consisting of a cold dark matter and a second fluid with constant barotropic equation of state. We performed detailed investigations of such cosmologies using the powerful techniques of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems. Considering a wide variety of the creation rates, we examine the phase space analysis of the individual scenario. According to our analyses, these scenarios predict decelerating unstable dark matter (or second fluid) dominated critical points, accelerating attractors dominated either by dark matter or the second fluid, accelerating scaling attractors in which dark matter and the second fluid co-exist. The regime of late-time accelerating expansion can be classified as either quintessence, phantom or driven by a cosmological constant. This huge variety of critical points makes these scenarios phenomenologically rich, and naturally suggests that such scenarios can be viewed as viable and potential alternatives to the mainstream cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Relational Time as a Stochastic Variable in ADM Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of time in canonical quantum gravity remains one of the most significant challenges, primarily due to the "frozen" formalism emerging from the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. Within the ADM formalism, we introduce a novel approach in which a scalar field is treated as a stochastic clock. By imposing a divergence-free condition on the scalar momentum, we integrate out quantum gravitational fluctuations and derive an effective noise term via the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. This noise drives dynamic adjustments in spacetime foliations, enabling a Schrodinger-like evolution that preserves diffeomorphism invariance and, upon noise averaging, maintains unitary evolution. Interestingly, by introducing stochastic variations in the foliations, the quantum indeterminacy of the clock recasts time as a diffusive process emerging from quantum fluctuations, where correlations between matter and geometry replace an absolute time parameter. This provides a potential pathway for understanding quantum time evolution while maintaining background independence in canonical quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Bumblebee gravity: spherically-symmetric solutions away from the potential minimum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study a vector model of spontaneous spacetime-symmetry breaking coupled to gravity: the bumblebee model. The primary focus is on static spherically symmetric solutions. Complementing previous work on black hole solutions, we study the effects on the solutions when the vector field does not lie at the minimum of its potential. We first investigate the flat spacetime limit, which can be viewed as a modified electrostatic model with a nonlinear interaction term. We study the stability of classical solutions generally and in the spherically-symmetric case. We also find that certain potentials, based on hypergeometric functions, yield a Hamiltonian bounded from below for the case of fixed spatial vector magnitude. With gravity, we solve for the spherically-symmetric metric and vector field, for a variety of choices of the potential energy functions, including ones beyond the quadratic potential like the hypergeometric potentials. Special case exact solutions are obtained showing Schwarszchild-Anti de Sitter and Reissner-Nordstrom spacetimes. We employ horizon and asymptotic analytical expansions along with numerical solutions to explore the general case with the vector field away from the potential minimum. We discover interesting features of these solutions including naked singularities, repulsive gravity, and rapidly varying gravitational field near the source. Finally, we discuss observational constraints on these spacetimes using the resulting orbital behavior.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and gravitational radiation of binaries with spin precession and eccentricity in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Testing parity symmetry constitutes a critical aspect in gravitational physics. As a representative parity-violating theory, dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) gravity has attracted significant attention in recent gravitational wave (GW) studies. Numerous works have constrained the dCS theory through GW observations using quasi-circular waveform templates. Since GW parameter estimation depends critically on waveform template accuracy, improved source modeling and waveform construction are essential for tighter constraints on parity-violating gravity. This work explores the dynamics and gravitational radiation from the binary black hole systems with orbital eccentricity and spin precession. By extending the quasi-Keplerian parameterization, we solve the equations of motion including leading-order dCS corrections and precession effects. Furthermore, the conservative sectors of the gravitational and scalar radiation are presented, the corresponding energy and angular momentum loss are calculated, and the orbital decay is also investigated. Notably, because of the non-zero monopole scalar radiation, carrying energy but not angular momentum, the zero-eccentricity orbit is no longer the final stable state of binaries under radiation reaction. This work provides the theoretical foundation for the complete waveform construction in dCS gravity, benefiting the future gravitational parity-symmetry tests.</description>

Abstract: We consider quantum corrections to a recently obtained perturbative form of Starobinsky model to extract information about the initial conditions of the universe leading to cosmological inflation. Integrating out graviton modes, we find higher-derivative instabilities that are shown to decay into scalarons, causing an effective kinetic-domination stage which is shown to lead naturally to inflation without the need for fine-tuning of initial inflaton amplitude. We find a perturbative upper bound on scalaron magnitude that matches Planck constraints on inflaton energy density near the pivot scale. This modified history also affects observables and resolves other anomalies such as the low-$\ell$ power deficit in the TT spectrum as well as the disfavorment of Starobinsky model based on updated predictions of scalar spectral index accounting for data from Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT).</description>

      <title>Notes on a Gaussian-Based Distribution Algebra for the Non-linear Wave Equation of the Shift Vector in Quantum Foam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00106v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a non-linear distributional renormalisation algebra for Gaussian Quantum Foam, built from sequences of scaled Gaussians on spacelike hypersurfaces of homotopic, globally hyperbolic spacetimes and their distributional limits. The algebra is closed under multiplication and second-order differentiation, with all non-linear operations defined on smooth representatives before taking the limit. Applied to the non-linear scalar-field wave equation for the shift vector, the wave operator converges to a linear combination of the Dirac measure and its second-order derivative, encoding a sharply localised curvature impulse that displaces the vacuum; in the correspondence limit, the equation reduces to the massless Klein-Gordon equation. Classical singularities are replaced by a well-defined distributional structure: the scalar Ricci projection is non-negative on the singular support and converges to a positive linear combination of the Dirac measure and its second-order derivative while away from the support, in the emerging classical spacetime, the strong energy condition is violated on open sets. The trace of the extrinsic curvature, the mean curvature, and the null expansions vanish on the support (no trapped surfaces). For finite values of the sequence index, there exist open neighbourhoods in which both the inward and outward null expansions are strictly negative; thus, locally and in a classical context, trapped surfaces can occur in those regions. The level sets of the global time function, together with their normal, become asymptotically null, yielding a limiting unstable characteristic hypersurface that fixes evolution by null data and forbids any extension into chronology-violating regions. Finally, it is argued that, within this framework, a gravity-induced spontaneous state reduction restores the Equivalence Principle in the emerging classical spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: We study the periapsis shift of timelike bound orbits in the equatorial plane in the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime, which is an exact, static, axisymmetric, and vacuum solution characterized by the deformation parameter $\gamma$, including the Schwarzschild spacetime as $\gamma = 1$. We newly derive the formula for the periapsis shift by the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion and show that the quadrupole moment contributes to the periapsis shift apparently as in the 2PN order. Applying this formula to observational data on S2, a star orbiting closely to Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), we show that the parameter $\gamma$ is constrained to $\gamma \gtrsim 1.9 \times 10^{-2}$ for the gravitational field of Sgr A*. This is equivalent to $\tilde{M}_2 \lesssim 9.7 \times 10^2$ in terms of the dimensionless quadrupole moment $\tilde{M}_2$, that is, the supermassive compact object at Sgr A* cannot be very prolate, whereas $\tilde{M}_2 \geq -1/3$ is required from the solution. Finally, we derive a new series representation in this spacetime using a recently proposed prescription, which shows fast convergence not only in the weak-field regime with not necessarily small eccentricity but also in the strong-field regime with small eccentricity.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions of Electromagnetically Charged Black Holes in Lovelock Gravity with Nonconstant Curvature Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the most general class of charged black hole solutions in third-order Lovelock gravity within even-dimensional spacetimes in the presence of an electromagnetic field. These solutions feature nonconstant-curvature horizons that affect geometry when n&gt;=8. The near-origin behavior of the metric reveals a timelike singularity for electrically charged cases, in contrast to the spacelike singularity found in the uncharged case. We investigate thermodynamic stability in both the grand canonical and canonical ensembles. In the grand canonical ensemble, stability is determined by the positivity of both the Hessian determinant and the temperature. In the canonical ensemble, the sign of the heat capacity governs stability. We identify both first- and second-order phase transitions, including a van der Waals-like behavior characterized by instability at intermediate black hole sizes. Our results reveal a rich phase structure influenced by Lovelock corrections and electromagnetic fields, and demonstrate how conserved charges affect black hole evaporation and stabilization.</description>

      <title>Rigorous calculation of scalar scattering in Schwarzschild background: the convergence of partial-wave series and Poisson spot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black hole (BH) perturbation theory and the scattering models provide a powerful framework for studying gravitational lensing at the wave-optics level. However, conventional calculations encountered two issues: the divergence of the partial-wave series and the divergence of the Poisson spot near the optical axis. These issues hinder the accurate calculation of lensed waveforms and the study of polarization and wave characteristics in the lensing process, especially near the optical axis. This work demonstrates that both divergences stem from the asymptotic expansion of the radial wave function. By computing the scattered wave function at finite radii and avoiding the asymptotic expansion, we naturally obtain convergent results. We compute scalar waves scattered by (1) a weak-gravity body with Newtonian potential and (2) a Schwarzschild BH with Regge-Wheeler potential. In both cases, we analyze the convergence of the partial-wave series and present finite-luminosity diffraction patterns, with a bright Poisson spot. The above calculations are compared with the Kirchhoff diffraction integral in the near-axis regions and give consistent results. Our investigations provide a foundation for studying gravitational wave scattering by BHs and understanding lensing at the wave-optics level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A systematic Hamiltonian formulation of the Einstein-Cartan system, based on the Hilbert-Palatini action with the Barbero-Immirzi and cosmological constants, is performed using the traditional ADM decomposition and without fixing the time gauge. This procedure results in a larger phase space compared to that of the Ashtekar-Barbero approach as well as a larger set of first-class constraints generating gauge transformations that are on-shell equivalent to spacetime diffeomorphisms and SO(1,3) transformations. The imbalance in the number of components between the tetrad and the connection is resolved by the identification of second-class constraints implied by the action, which can be implemented by use of Dirac brackets or by solving them directly. The Hamiltonian system remains well-defined off the second-class constraint surface in an extended phase space with additional degrees of freedom, implying a more general geometric theory. Implications for canonical quantum gravity are discussed.</description>

      <title>Topological Big Bangs: Reflection, Itty-Bitty Blenders, and Eternal Trumpets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss and formalize topological means by which the initial singularity might be mollified, at the level of the spacetime manifold's structure, in classical cosmological models of a homogeneous expanding universe. One construction, dubbed a "reflective" topological big bang, generalizes Schrodinger's elliptic de Sitter space and is built to be compatible with the standard Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) picture of the large-scale universe, only minimally modifying it via some nontrivial topology at an earliest "moment" in the universe's history. We establish a mathematical characterization of the admissible topological structures of reflective topological big bangs, and we discuss implications for a standard concern in cosmology, the horizon problem. We present a nonreflective example that we've christened the Itty-Bitty Blender spacetime: this spacetime and its universal cover, the Eternal Trumpet spacetime, exhibit interesting potential structures of spacetimes avoiding the Hawking and Penrose singularity theorems. While these toy models provide a proof-of-concept picture, several questions remain regarding the capacity to realize these structures under physical energy conditions.</description>

      <title>MHDuet : a high-order General Relativistic Radiation MHD code for CPU and GPU architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present MHDuet, an open source evolution code for general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics with neutrino transport. The code solves the full set of Einstein equations coupled to a relativistic, magnetized fluid with an M1 neutrino radiation scheme using advanced techniques, including adaptive mesh and large eddy simulation techniques, to achieve high accuracy. The Simflowny platform generates the code from a high-level specification of the computational system, producing code that runs with either the SAMRAI or AMReX infrastructure. The choice of AMReX enables compilation and execution on GPUs, running an order of magnitude faster than on CPUs at the node level. We validate the code against benchmark tests, reproducing previous results obtained with the SAMRAI infrastructure, and demonstrate its capabilities with simulations of neutron stars employing realistic tabulated equations of state. Resolution studies clearly demonstrate convergence faster than second order in the grid spacing. Scaling tests reveal excellent strong and weak scaling performance when running on GPUs. The goal of the code is to provide a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of compact objects within multi-messenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>The spacetime geodesy of perfect fluid spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Herein we shall argue for the utility of "spacetime geodesy", a point of view where one delays as long as possible worrying about dynamical equations, in favour of the maximal utilization of both symmetries and geometrical features. This closely parallels Weinberg's distinction between "cosmography" and "cosmology", wherein maximal utilization of both the symmetries and geometrical features of Friedmann--Lemaitre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) spacetimes is emphasized. This "spacetime geodesy" point of view is particularly useful in those situations where, for one reason or another, the dynamical equations of motion are either uncertain or completely unknown. Several specific examples are discussed -- we shall illustrate what can be done by considering the physics implications of demanding spatially isotropic Ricci tensors as a way of automatically implementing the (isotropic) perfect fluid condition, without committing to a specific equation of state. We also consider the structure of the Weyl tensor in spherical symmetry, with and without the (isotropic) perfect fluid condition, and relate this to the notion of "complexity". In closing, we indicate some ways in which these considerations might be further generalized to more physically complicated (and technically very much more complicated) situations such as axisymmetric spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of Acceleration-Induced Excitations in Confined Quantum Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum field excitations in a rigid cavity that undergoes a transition from inertial motion to uniform acceleration while maintaining constant proper length. By constructing exact Bogoliubov transformations between inertial and accelerated mode bases, we analyze the induced excitations and identify a universal power-law decay in the excitation power spectrum and an alternating pattern in particle production. The spectrum's dependence solely on the acceleration, and not on the size of the box or the observer's position, highlights a kinematic universality akin to that seen in horizon thermodynamics. Generalization to time-dependent accelerations reveals a convolution structure for the Bogoliubov coefficients, with resonant oscillations selectively enhancing mode excitations. These results provide new analytical insights into the interplay between acceleration, confinement, and quantum excitations.</description>

Abstract: We analyze quasinormal modes, grey-body factors, and absorption cross-sections of a massive scalar field in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a Hernquist dark-matter halo. The quasinormal spectrum is obtained through the higher-order WKB method and verified by time-domain evolution, showing consistent results. The field mass increases the oscillation frequency and reduces the damping rate, producing longer-lived modes, while variations in the halo parameters lead to moderate shifts in the spectrum. The grey-body factors reveal a suppression of low-frequency transmission and a displacement of their main features toward higher frequencies, resulting in a corresponding shift in the absorption cross-section.</description>

This family generalizes the simple gauge in which most graviton loop computations in de Sitter space have been performed. The resulting propagator has a relatively simple form and will facilitate checks of the gauge dependence of one-loop computations and proposed observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a synchronization-free differential observable for one-way inter-satellite laser ranging, designed to suppress first-order Doppler effects without requiring clock synchronization between spacecraft. The observable is constructed from successive pulse-interval differences, which isolate time-varying signatures while eliminating static and slowly varying biases. Applied to GRACE-FO Laser Ranging Interferometer (LRI) Level-1B data over four seasonal epochs in 2019, the method reveals a stable, spectrally narrow modulation at the orbital frequency. The amplitude and phase of the detected signature remain consistent across all datasets, demonstrating a deterministic, mission-internal origin. The detection is independently confirmed through synthetic-signal injection, shuffle-based significance testing, and cross-comparison with K-band ranging data. These results show that the proposed observable provides a sensitive diagnostic for identifying coherent orbital-period systematics that may remain hidden in conventional range-rate analysis. The method offers a pathway toward improved characterization of instrument and dynamical effects in current and future satellite gravity missions.</description>

Abstract: Ten years ago, the first direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from the merger of two black holes, GW150914, provided the very first opportunity to test Einstein's general theory of relativity (GR) in the extreme gravity regime, where the gravitational field is strong, characteristic speeds are highly relativistic, and spacetime is dynamical. Such a regime is currently accessible only through coalescing compact binaries. In this review, we summarize the status of testing GR with GW observations and discuss the lessons learned. We also touch upon the challenges we currently have in testing GR and the potential path forward to detect a credible violation of GR, should one exist in the data.</description>

      <title>Robust Non-Singular Bouncing Cosmology from Regularized Hyperbolic Field Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a complete and robust framework for non-singular bouncing cosmology in a closed universe, where the scalar field space is endowed with a regularized hyperbolic geometry. The field space metric $g^S_{\chi\chi} = (1 + e^{-2\alpha\phi/M_{\mathrm{Pl}}})^{-1}$ is rigorously derived from fundamental physical principles: (i) exponential suppression during contraction enabling the bounce mechanism, (ii) asymptotic saturation to unity during inflation preserving perturbative unitarity, and (iii) positive-definiteness ensuring ghost-freedom. We prove that the sigmoid function emerges uniquely as the minimal-complexity solution satisfying these boundary conditions, with deep connections to hyperbolic geometry and cosmological $\alpha$-attractors. Through comprehensive numerical validation, we demonstrate that the model achieves 60+ e-folds of inflation following a non-singular bounce without violating the Null Energy Condition. The sigmoid regularization expands the basin of attraction by $\sim 10^{21}$ compared to the pure exponential metric, achieving 100\% success rate across 16 orders of magnitude in initial velocities. The perturbation equations remain regular throughout the bounce, and the comoving curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}$ is conserved on super-Hubble scales. Observable predictions include spectral index $n_s \approx 0.967$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \approx 0.003$, in excellent agreement with Planck 2018 data and testable by next-generation CMB experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel general dynamical metric is derived, sourced by two scalar fields and a nonlinear electrodynamics field. This spacetime explicitly reveals its global causal structure and trapping horizons, leading to the establishment of three possible fates: those without a globally trapped future; those without global trapping but containing bounded, Cauchy-foliated trapped regions; and those with a future that becomes completely globally trapped. This framework is illustrated through the evolution of a geometrically Schwarzschild-like black hole and a horizonless wormhole, thereby establishing the final, globally trapped fate as a novel theoretical possibility.</description>

      <title>Ab-Initio General-Relativistic Neutrino-Radiation Hydrodynamics Simulations of Long-Lived Neutron Star Merger Remnants to Neutrino Cooling Timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform the first 3D ab-initio general-relativistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics of a long-lived neutron star merger remnant spanning a fraction of its cooling time scale. We find that neutrino cooling becomes the dominant energy loss mechanism after the gravitational-wave dominated phase (${\sim}20\ {\rm ms}$ postmerger). Electron flavor anti-neutrino luminosity dominates over electron flavor neutrino luminosity at early times, resulting in a secular increase of the electron fraction in the outer layers of the remnant. However, the two luminosities become comparable ${\sim}20{-}40\ {\rm ms}$ postmerger. A dense gas of electron anti-neutrinos is formed in the outer core of the remnant at densities ${\sim}10^{14.5}\ {\rm g}\ {\rm cm}^{-3}$, corresponding to temperature hot spots. The neutrinos account for ${\sim}10\%$ of the lepton number in this region. Despite the negative radial temperature gradient, the radial entropy gradient remains positive and the remnant is stably stratified according to the Ledoux criterion for convection. A massive accretion disk is formed from the material squeezed out of the collisional interface between the stars. The disk carries a large fraction of the angular momentum of the system, allowing the remnant massive neutron star to settle to a quasi-steady equilibrium within the region of possible stable rigidly rotating configurations. The remnant is differentially rotating, but it is stable against the magnetorotational instability. Other MHD mechanisms operating on longer timescales are likely responsible for the removal of the differential rotation. Our results indicate the remnant massive neutron star is thus qualitatively different from a protoneutron stars formed in core-collapse supernovae.</description>

Abstract: We propose a precise test of two fundamental gravitational constants using a detector concept that exploits the dynamics of quantum phononic excitations in a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), operable at the scale of tabletop experiments. In this setup, the sensitivity is enhanced by approximately 2 orders of magnitude through the use of a tritter operation, which mixes phononic excitations with the BEC's ground state. The BEC exhibits unique sensitivity to the two key components of the gravitational potential in $\Lambda$-gravity: the Newtonian $GM/r$ term and the cosmological constant $\Lambda r^2$, both entering the most general function following from a Gurzadyan's theorem. Using state-of-the-art experimental design, we predict that the gravitational constant $G$ could be measured with an accuracy up to $10^{-17}$ N m$^2$/kg$^2$, representing an improvement by 2 orders of magnitude over current measurements. Moreover, this experiment aims to establish the best Earth-based upper limit on $\Lambda$ at $&lt;10^{-31}$ m$^{-2}$, marking the first laboratory-based probe of the cosmological constant. Additionally, the setup allows for the measurement of the distance-dependent behavior of each term in the gravitational potential, providing a means to test modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Quantum Inhomogeneous Field Theory: Unruh-Like Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a free scalar field in a specific (1+1)-dimensional curved spacetime. By introducing an algebraic state that is locally Hadamard, we derive the renormalized Wightman function and explicitly calculate the covariantly conserved quantum energy-momentum tensor up to a relevant order. From this result, we show that the Hadamard renormalization scheme, which has been effective in traditional quantum field theory in curved spacetime, is also applicable in the quantum inhomogeneous field theory. As applications of this framework, we show the existence of an Unruh-like effect for an observer slightly out of the right asymptotic region, as well as the vanishing of quantum frictional effect in the leading order ($e^{- bx}$) on the bubble wall expansion during the electroweak phase transition in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled Sectors in Inflation: Gapless Theories and Unparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute correlation functions of the primordial density perturbations when they couple to a gapless, strongly coupled sector of spectator fields -- ``unparticles" -- during inflation. We first derive a four-point function of conformally coupled scalars for all kinematic configurations in de Sitter, which exchanges an unparticle at tree-level, by performing direct integration using the Mellin-Barnes method. To obtain inflationary bispectra and trispectra, we apply weight-shifting operators to the conformally coupled scalar correlator. We show that the correlators solve differential equations determined by the additional symmetries enjoyed by the unparticle propagator. Based on these differential equations, we are able to discuss the spinning-unparticle exchanges, focusing on two possible cases where the currents or the stress tensor of unparticles are coupled to inflatons, with the help of spin-raising operators. Finally, we study the phenomenology of the resulting shape functions. Depending on the value of the unparticle scaling dimension, we classify three characteristic shapes for the inflationary bispectra, including near-equilateral, near-orthogonal, and a novel shape which appears when the scaling dimensions are close to half-integers. More generally, we find that the leading order squeezed limits are insufficient to conclusively determine the detection of a light particle or unparticle. Only the full shapes of bispectra and trispectra can break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Quantum Galilei group as quantum reference frame transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum groups have been widely explored as a tool to encode possible nontrivial generalisations of reference frame transformations, relevant in quantum gravity. In quantum information, it was found that the reference frames can be associated to quantum particles, leading to quantum reference frames transformations. The connection between these two frameworks is still unexplored, but if clarified it will lead to a more profound understanding of symmetries in quantum mechanics and quantum gravity. Here, we establish a correspondence between quantum reference frame transformations and transformations generated by a quantum deformation of the Galilei group with commutative time, taken at first order in the quantum deformation parameter. This is found once the quantum group noncommutative transformation parameters are represented on the phase space of a quantum particle, and upon setting the quantum deformation parameter to be proportional to the inverse of the mass of the particle serving as the quantum reference frame. These results allow us to show that quantum reference frame transformations are physically relevant when the state of the quantum reference frame is in a quantum superposition of semiclassical states. We conjecture that the all-order quantum Galilei group describes quantum reference frame transformations between more general quantum states of the quantum reference frame.</description>

      <title>Time as a test-field: the no-boundary universe in motion and a smooth radiation bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08703v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proper time of an observer can be introduced as a degree of freedom in quantum cosmology, additional to the existing fields. We review two arguments for using the Schr\"odinger equation to evolve the corresponding wavefunction. We restrict to solutions in which time acts as a component with negligible backreaction on the metric -- that is, it plays the role of a test field. We apply this idea to various minisuperspace models. In the semiclassical regime we recover expected results: the wavefunction peaks on the classical solution and, in models with a scalar field, the variance of $\zeta$ (a mini-superspace analogue of the comoving curvature perturbation) is conserved. Applied to the no-boundary wavefunction, our model recovers the bouncing behavior of classical global de Sitter space, with small corrections associated to the evolving variance of the wavefunction. Other bouncing solutions do not have any classical analogue. This is the case of a radiation dominated universe, which classically leads to a big-bang singularity but corresponds quantum mechanically to an $s$-wave scattering off a central potential of the form $-r^{-2/3}$. As much as the hydrogen atom, this potential is famously made stable by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. We study the unitary evolution of the wavepacket numerically. During the bounce, the uncertainty and the expectation value of the scale factor become comparable. By selecting a large initial variance, the bounce can be made arbitrarily smooth, the mean value of the Hubble parameter correspondingly soft.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Origin of Quantum-Metric Effects via Momentum-Space Metric Tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reveal a fundamental geometric structure of momentum space arising from the nonadiabatic evolution of Bloch electrons. By extending semiclassical wave packet theory to incorporate nonadiabatic effects, we introduce a momentum-space metric tensor -- the nonadiabatic metric. This metric gives rise to two velocity corrections, dubbed geometric and geodesic velocities, providing a unified and intuitive framework for understanding nonlinear and nonadiabatic transport phenomena beyond Berry phase effects. Furthermore, we show that the nonadiabatic metric endows momentum space with a curved geometry, recasting wave packet dynamics as forced geodesic motion. In this picture, the metric defines distances, the Berry connection acts as a gauge potential, band dispersion serves as a scalar potential, and the toroidal topology of the Brillouin zone imposes periodic boundary conditions. When the nonadiabatic metric is constant, it reduces to an effective mass, allowing electrons to behave as massive particles in flat bands. In a flat Chern band with harmonic attractive interactions, the two-body wave functions mirror the Landau-level wave functions on a torus.</description>

      <title>Detectability of post-Newtonian classical and quantum gravity via quantum clock interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15014v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding physical phenomena at the intersection of quantum mechanics and general relativity remains a major challenge in modern physics. While various experimental approaches have been proposed to probe quantum systems in curved spacetime, most focus on the Newtonian regime, leaving post-Newtonian effects such as frame dragging largely unexplored. In this study, we propose and theoretically analyze an experimental scheme to investigate how post-Newtonian gravity affects quantum systems. We consider two setups: (i) a quantum clock interferometry setup designed to detect the gravitational field of a rotating mass, and (ii) a scheme exploring whether such effects could be used to generate gravity-induced entanglement. Due to the symmetry of the configuration, the proposed setup is insensitive to Newtonian gravitational contributions but remains sensitive to the frame-dragging effect. Furthermore, our scheme allows for testing whether the observed gravity-induced entanglement is consistent with the quantum equivalence principle. While the predicted effects appear too small to detect with current technology, our scheme offers a starting point for future experiments probing post-Newtonian quantum gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass tension or suppressed growth rate of matter perturbations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming a minimal $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with three massive neutrinos, the joint analysis of Planck cosmic microwave background data, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and distance moduli measurements of Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+ sample sets an upper bound on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.06$-$0.07$ eV, that lies barely above the lower limit from oscillation experiments. These constraints are mainly driven by mild differences in the inferred values of the matter density parameter across different probes that can be alleviated by introducing additional background-level degrees of freedom (e.g., by dynamical dark energy models). However, in this work we explore an alternative possibility. Since both $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and massive neutrinos critically influence the growth of cosmic structures, we test whether the neutrino mass tension may originate from the way matter clusters, rather than from a breakdown of the $\Lambda$CDM expansion history. To this end, we introduce the growth index $\gamma$, which characterizes the rate at which matter perturbations grow. Deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM value ($\gamma \simeq 0.55$) can capture a broad class of models, including non-minimal dark sector physics and modified gravity. We show that allowing $\gamma$ to vary significantly relaxes the neutrino mass bounds to $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.13$-$0.2$ eV, removing any tension with terrestrial constraints without altering the inferred value of $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$. However, this comes at the cost of departing from standard growth predictions: to have $\sum m_\nu \gtrsim 0.06$ eV one needs $\gamma &gt; 0.55$, and we find a consistent preference for $\gamma &gt; 0.55$ at the level of $\sim 2\sigma$. This preference increases to $\sim 2.5$-$3\sigma$ when a physically motivated prior $\sum m_\nu \ge 0.06$ eV from oscillation experiments is imposed.</description>

      <title>A unified thermodynamic framework for coextensive dark matter admixed strange stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and physical properties of a strange star admixed with self-interacting bosonic dark matter. The total energy density is modelled as a weighted combination of quark matter and dark matter components regulated by a fixed local volume fraction. The quark component is described by a linear equation of state, while the dark matter follows a mean-field EOS with repulsive self-interactions. By combining these EOSs into a barotropic effective EOS derived from a unified thermodynamic potential, the two-fluid system is reformulated as a thermodynamically closed and mechanically equilibrated configuration. The construction preserves the dynamical distinction between the quark and dark sectors but treats them as a macroscopically unified mixture governed by a single hydrostatic equilibrium equation. This framework identifies the entirely coextensive limit of two-fluid models as a physically meaningful and thermodynamically closed configuration, providing a coherent macroscopic closure that links dark matter-strange matter microphysics to stellar observables. Using the effective EOS, we solve the governing Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations to obtain the mass-radius relationship by varying the model parameters. Our results reveal distinct modifications to the $M-R$ profiles, suggesting observable signatures that could offer insights into the impacts of dark matter in extreme astrophysical environments. We note that even a modest dark matter admixture softens the effective equation of state and shrinks the maximum mass limit. We discuss the relevance of our investigation in the context of recent observational data available for pulsars, such as XTE J1814-338, PSR J0348+0432, PSR J0740+6620 and PSRJ0952-0607.</description>

      <title>Binary Neutron Star Mergers: Multi-Messenger Systematics and Prospects with Next-Generation Facilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-messenger astronomy was galvanized by the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 and electromagnetic (EM) emission from the subsequent kilonova and short gamma ray burst. Maximizing multi-messenger constraints on these systems requires combining models of the progenitors and products of BNS mergers within a single framework. Motivated by GW170817, we create a combined model that relate the progenitor astrophysics of a BNS population with their GW observability and localizability, kilonova light curves, gamma-ray burst afterglow flux, and kilonova remnant evolution. We compute the BNS merger rate by convolving metallicity-dependent star-formation history with population-synthesis predictions, and we sample realistic populations to evaluate their GW and EM observables and joint detection rates. We find that next-generation detectors will typically observe BNS mergers with GW network signal-to-noise ratios of $\sim$ 10 to 20, 90th-percentile sky areas of order $\sim$ 10 deg$^2$, and kilonova $i$-band magnitudes spanning $\sim$ 23 to 33. The variation of the merger rate with respect to the common-envelope efficiency is shown in the GW and EM observables and the resulting multi-messenger detection yield, demonstrating how uncertainties propagate into all stages of joint GW+EM forecasting. Across the models examined, no more than $\sim$ 4% of BNS mergers are detectable simultaneously by a two-Cosmic-Explorer plus one-Einstein-Telescope network and by both Roman (in a $K$-like band) and Rubin ($i$ and $g$ bands). These results show that assumptions underlying the combination of progenitor evolution and source observables will constitute key multi-messenger modeling systematics for inference of astrophysical, nuclear, and fundamental physics from future datasets.</description>

Abstract: The concept of energy lies at the foundation of physical science. In general relativity and quantum field theory, the positivity and conservation of energy are encapsulated by the so-called energy-momentum tensor and the energy conditions. In recent efforts to unify fundamental physics with quantum information, the energy conditions have come to play a crucial role in establishing numerous theorems. In this article, we review the basics of energy conditions in general relativity and their applications in gravitational physics, quantum field theory, and the holographic principle. Through these applications, we explore the profound connection between the energy conditions and quantum information</description>

      <title>The $R^2$-Higgs inflation: $R^3$ contribution and preheating after ACT and SPT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $R^2$-Higgs inflation is one of the simplest yet best-fit models consistent with Planck data. The higher spectral index $n_s$ recently reported by the combined cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), South Pole Telescope (SPT), and Planck, along with baryonic acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), disfavors the single-field-like regime of $R^2$-Higgs inflation at approximately $2\sigma$. Following a doubly covariant formalism, we show that the $R^2$-Higgs inflation, when modified by a dimension-six $R^3$ term, can account for the high $n_s$ reported by CMB+BAO. In this regard, we find that preheating may play a pivotal role. We also show that if the nonminimal coupling between the Ricci scalar $R$ and the Higgs field is $\mathcal{O}(10)$, then preheating via the production of Higgs quanta may help explain the reported observations.</description>

      <title>Heavy Field Effects on Inflationary Models in Light of ACT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), when combined with Planck and DESI datasets, indicate a scalar spectral index $n_s$ larger than that reported in the Planck 2018 baseline, thereby challenging conventional Starobinsky-type ($\alpha$-attractor) inflationary scenarios at the $2\sigma$ level. In addition, the positive running of the spectral index $\alpha_s$ implied by the data provides strong constraints on these models. In this paper, we explore the possibility that the presence of an additional heavy field during inflation, with a mass of order the Hubble scale and a sizable mixing coupling to the inflaton, can reconcile such inflationary models with the ACT results by increasing both $n_s$ and $\alpha_s$, particularly in the strong-mixing regime. Furthermore, we extend this framework to traditional inflation models such as chaotic inflation and natural inflation, which have already been excluded by Planck alone, and show that they can be revived in certain regions of parameter space. Inflationary observables, including the spectral index $n_s$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and the running $\alpha_s$, are computed within the single-field EFT approach, which is applicable even in the presence of a heavy field with large mixing. We also discuss the non-Gaussianity signatures arising from the heavy field, noting that parts of the parameter space are already excluded or can be tested in future observations. Finally, we present concrete model realizations that allow for such a large mixing.</description>

      <title>A Dark Matter Model with Quadratic Equation of State: Background Evolution and Structure Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that dark matter (DM) possesses a quadratic equation of state, which becomes significant at high densities, altering the Universe's evolution during its early stages. We derive the modified background evolution equations for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and the DM density parameter $\Omega_{\text{dm}}(z)$. We then perturb the governing equations to study the linear growth of matter fluctuations, computing the observable growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$. Finally, we compare the model with the latest cosmological data, including Hubble parameter $H(z)$ measurements, and growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$ data, up to $z=3$. Our results indicate that the quadratic model, while remaining consistent with background observations, offers a distinct imprint on the growth of structure, providing not only a new phenomenological avenue to address cosmological tensions but also shedding light on the nature of DM.</description>

      <title>Quantum state spectrum and field theory of D$0$-brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We quantize D$0$-brane, the simplest representative of the family of supersymmetric Dirichlet p-branes, in its spinor moving frame formulation and analyze its quantum state spectrum. Besides being a preparatory stage for quantization of the complete supersymmetric multiple D$0$-brane (mD$0$) model, which is presently known only in the frame of spinor moving frame formalism, this is interesting as its own: despite the covariant quantization of D=10 D$0$-brane was discussed before, its quantum state spectrum was not analyzed and its field theory, describing that, was not studied.
  We show that the quantum state vector of the D$0$-brane is described by an on-shell superfield that collects the fields of the massive counterpart of the linearized type IIA supergravity supermultiplet which can be obtained as massive Kaluza-Klein mode of the dimensional reduction of the eleven dimensional supergravity down to ten dimensions. In conclusion, we briefly discuss a spinor helicity formalism for D$0$-brane which can be used as one of the basic elements for developing type IIA string theory amplitude calculus based on multiparticle generalizations of the on-shell superfields.</description>

      <title>Binary black holes gone MAD: Magnetically arrested minidisks around nonspinning black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the formation of magnetically arrested minidisks (MAM) around equal-mass, nonspinning binary black holes with magnetohydrodynamic simulations of circumbinary disk accretion in full 3+1 general relativity. The initial separation of $d\sim 30\,M$ allows the black holes to host large minidisks that suppress the total rest-mass accretion rate variability, which is modulated primarily at $\sim 1.6 \, f_{\rm orb}$. Each black hole horizon saturates with dimensionless magnetic flux $\phi \sim 30$. Magnetic reconnection near the horizons drives recurrent eruptions which are expected to drive flaring in the infrared and X-ray bands. Our results establish MAMs as a new outcome of circumbinary disk accretion, and a promising source of novel electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves from binary black holes.</description>

      <title>Search for high-frequency gravitational waves via re-analysis of cavity axion data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monochromatic high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGW) provide a distinctive probe of new physics scenarios, most notably axion clouds around rotating black holes formed via superradiance. We reanalyzed data from the CAPP-12T MC (multi-cell) axion haloscope experiment [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133,051802 (2024)]. The study covers a continuous $2\,$MHz frequency span centered at $5.311\,$GHz. No rescan candidates were found, and we set 90% confidence-level exclusion limits on the gravitational-wave strain, reaching $h_0 \approx 3.9 \times 10^{-21}$ in the most sensitive regions of the sky. Interpreted in the context of black-hole superradiance from axion clouds, the results exclude black holes with mass $M_{\mathrm{BH}} \simeq 1.22 \times 10^{-6}\,M_\odot$ within distances of $O(10^{-2})\,$AU from Earth, under benchmark assumptions. This work demonstrates the potential of electromagnetic resonant cavities as novel detectors of monochromatic HFGW and motivates future searches for both long-lived and transient signals.</description>

      <title>Noncritical Conformal Gravity and Four-Dimensional Liouville Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum aspects of the conformal gravity in four dimensions, specifically addressing a known discrepancy in beta functions between general quadratic curvature theories and conformal gravity, which corresponds to two scalar degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that this mismatch is resolved by carefully introducing gauge-fixing and ghost terms via the BRST symmetry, which effectively adds the two scalar modes. Drawing lessons from two-dimensional quantum gravity and Liouville theory, we proceed to integrate the four-dimensional trace anomaly to derive a consistent Liouville action, which is given by a free-field action for the conformal mode with a consistent conformal anomaly. Finally we give the condition that the BRST transformation is anomaly free.</description>

      <title>Fibre Inflation Meets Quintessence: Implications of Perturbative Stabilisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we have discovered a new avenue of fibre inflation in perturbative large volume scenario (pLVS) due to the redefinition of the base modulus. pLVS offers a novel regime where large volume of the internal space is guaranteed without the need of non-perturbative effects. In this setup, we study the possibility where a base redefinition allows to assess different versions of fibre inflation whose spectral index aligns with Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data and produces tensor-to-scalar ratio in the range $0.008\lesssim r\lesssim 0.01$ in different setups we have considered. The leading order flat direction - which in our case is the fibre modulus - is lifted with the combinations of string loop corrections, leading order $\alpha^{\prime 3}$$R^4$-correction, higher derivative $F^{4}$ corrections as well as our new ingredient redefinition of the modulus. Since recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) results appear to favour a dynamical explanation for late-time acceleration over a simple cosmological constant, exploring quintessence offers a more suitable approach. In this lore, we also examine the quintessence sector to complete our model and account for both early- and late-time cosmic acceleration. In this framework, the poly-instanton correction generates a potential along the axionic directions, and we find that the resulting quintessence behaviour and the subsequent cosmological predictions about dark matter closely resemble the predictions of the original fibre inflation scenario studied earlier.</description>
