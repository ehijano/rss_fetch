      <title>Quantum Study of Halogen Substituted anti-B18H22 Borane Clusters for Optoelectronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We offer a quantum chemical analysis of mono-halogenated borane molecules using DFT and TD-DFT theories, applying the PBE0/def2-SVPD and B3LYP/6-311+G(d) methods as implemented in ORCA, and explore how solvent effects influence electronic transition properties. The comparable benchmarks are the archetype anti-\ce{B18H22} denoted as (1) against hypothetical halogenated derivatives: 7-F-anti-\ce{B18H21} (2), 4-F-anti-\ce{B18H21} (3), and the recently synthesized 4-Br-anti-\ce{B18H21} (4). The analysis includes an optimization of the ground and first singlet excited states, vibrational frequency analysis, and a comprehensive spectroscopic profile covering IR, Raman, UV-Vis absorption, and emission spectra.
  The IR spectra of the fluorinated compounds feature a characteristic B-F stretching peak, while the Raman spectra closely resemble the parent molecule. UV-Vis spectral analysis shows a redshift and oscillator strength enhancement for F at position B7, indicating altered electronic properties due to substitution with lighter halogen. Furthermore, solvent effects enhance the probability of electronic transitions. Halogene presence led to a decrease of the energy gap EG(LUMO-HOMO) due to the stabilization of LUMO, which implied a redshift in the emission/absorption wavelength spectra, with the largest EG change at around 14\% occurring for the (4)$^{th}$ benchmark compound.. Notably, all compounds emit light within the visible spectrum, underscoring their potential for optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of close packed structures in large substrate-free Ar-Kr clusters according to THEED data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantitative phase analysis of substrate-free single-component and binary clusters of the Ar-Kr system obtained by adiabatic expansion of gas into vacuum through a supersonic nozzle was performed. The studies were carried out in-situ using transmission electron diffraction technique (THEED) on clusters with an average size ranging from 2000 to 100000 atoms/cluster and across the entire range of component concentrations. The independence of the threshold size of clusters, corresponding to the beginning of the formation of the hcp phase, from the component composition was revealed. It was established that clusters larger than this threshold size have a two-phase fcc-hcp structure with an identical concentration of components in each phase. The fraction of the hexagonal phase increases with the size of the aggregations and depends on the component content, reaching maximum in clusters with an equimolar composition. Arguments are presented in favor of the formation of two-phase clusters in the supersonic jet, rather than separate single-phase fcc and hcp ones. These findings are in good agreement with the previously proposed thermally activated diffusion mechanism for the nucleation and growth of the hcp phase in rare gas clusters.</description>

      <title>Experimental determination of emission cross sections for electron induced processes in a supersonic argon jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article discusses an original spectroscopic method for the study of supersonic argon jets in atomic and cluster flow regimes. The method is based on absolute measurements of the VUV radiation flux from a supersonic argon jet induced by a 1 keV electron beam. The integral radiation flux and spectral distribution of the radiation flux density of a supersonic argon jet in the range of 50-150 nanometers were measured, which made it possible to determine the density of the non-condensed atomic component, the fraction of condensate, and the density of clusters in a supersonic argon jet at given parameters of its flow into vacuum. The obtained parameters also allowed us to estimate the emission cross sections for the argon resonance lines ArI ({\lambda}=104.8 nm, {\lambda}=106.7 nm) and the cluster continuum {\lambda}=127 nm.</description>

      <title>Quantum Study of Dispersion-Corrected Electronic and Optical Properties of syn- and anti- B18H22 Clusters with/without Sulfur Doping for Tunable Optoelectronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a detailed quantum chemical investigation of the electronic and excited-state properties of syn- and anti-isomers of the borane cluster B18H22 and their sulfur-doped derivatives.
  Using the PB86/def2-SVP level of theory with dispersion corrections, the research examines how sulfur substitution and non-covalent interactions influence cluster stability, electronic structure, spectra, and optoelectronic potential. Comparative analysis of the syn- and anti-isomers reveals the impact of molecular conformation on frontier molecular orbitals and related energetic and photophysical properties. Sulfur doping is shown to enhance charge delocalization, stabilize excited states, and improve thermal stability, which form key factors for tunable laser applications.
  The inclusion of advanced dispersion correction methods proves essential for accurately capturing many-body interactions that govern electronic behavior. By elucidating the interplay between structural features, substitution patterns, and computational modeling, the work provides valuable insights into structure-property relationships critical for designing borane-based materials with tailored optoelectronic and thermal characteristics. In addition to doping and dispersion effects, functionals' effects were examined through comparison amidst various ones with different asymptotic exchange on excitation and gap energies. In summary, the computational methodology combined good DFT/Basis/dispersion set to accurately predict geometries, IR/UV spectra, NMR chemical shifts, dipole moments, polarizability and excited-state properties, thereby offering a comprehensive theoretical understanding of syn-, anti- isomers of B18H22 and its sulfur doped variants.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Study of C36 and O@C36 Fullerene Isomers with (C1, C2, Cs, D2, D3h) symmetries: Geometry Optimization, Electrical Properties and Spectroscopic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we conducted a theoretical analysis of specific C36 and O@C36 Fullerene isomers, namely those with (D3h, C1, Cs, C2, D2) symmetries, in the gaseous phase using the DFT method at B3LYP/6-31G* level. We studied geometry optimizations, relative stability, atomization energies, Fermi energy, energy gap, electronic properties, electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, and thermodynamic analysis, along with IR and NMR spectra. Consistently, our findings revealed distinct properties and characteristics among different C36 fullerene isomers. The energetic order of C36 fullerene isomers was established as C36-D3h &lt; C36-C1 &lt; C36-Cs &lt; C36-C2 &lt; C36-D2, a trend unaffected by the encapsulation of oxygen. Notably, the D2 isomer displayed the smallest energy gap, indicating higher electrical conductivity compared to other isomers, while it exhibited the largest gap after encapsulation. Furthermore, we observed that the C1 (D2) isomer exhibited the largest (smallest) Electric dipole moment among the studied C36 isomers, whereas the C2 (D2) isomer demonstrated the largest Electric dipole moment among the O@C36 isomers studied. The encapsulation of oxygen in C36 isomers influenced their properties, including alterations in electronic properties, IR, and NMR chemical shifts. A detailed analysis of BSSE corrections showed the tininess of their impact on the analyzed observables, such that uncorrected and BSSE-corrected calculations led to nearly identical results, confirming the robustness and reliability of the B3LYP/6-31G* approach used in this work and, eventually, in other large and rigid fullerenes systems.</description>
