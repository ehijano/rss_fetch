      <title>An Interoperable Multi Objective Batch Bayesian Optimization Framework for High Throughput Materials Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a groundbreaking framework for materials discovery, we efficiently navigate a vast phase space of material compositions by leveraging Batch Bayesian statistics in order to achieve specific performance objectives. This approach addresses the challenge of identifying optimal materials from an untenably large array of possibilities in a reasonable timeframe with high confidence. Crucially, our batchwise methods align seamlessly with existing material processing infrastructure for synthesizing and characterizing materials. By applying this framework to a specific high entropy alloy system, we demonstrate its versatility and robustness in optimizing properties like strain hardening, hardness, and strain rate sensitivity. The fact that the Bayesian model is adept in refining and expanding the property Pareto front highlights its broad applicability across various materials, including steels, shape memory alloys, ceramics, and composites. This study advances the field of materials science and sets a new benchmark for material discovery methodologies. By proving the effectiveness of Bayesian optimization, we showcase its potential to redefine the landscape of materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Deep-ultraviolet transparent conducting SrSnO3 via heterostructure design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploration and advancements in ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductors are pivotal for next-generation high-power electronics and deep-ultraviolet (DUV) optoelectronics. A critical challenge lies in finding a semiconductor that is highly transparent to DUV wavelengths yet conductive with high mobility at room temperature. Here, we achieved both high transparency and high conductivity by employing a thin heterostructure design. The heterostructure facilitated high conductivity by screening phonons using free carriers, while the atomically thin films ensured high transparency. We utilized a heterostructure comprising SrSnO3/La:SrSnO3/GdScO3 (110) and applied electrostatic gating to effectively separate electrons from their dopant atoms. This led to a modulation of carrier density from 1018 cm-3 to 1020 cm-3, with room temperature mobilities ranging from 40 to 140 cm2V-1s-1. The phonon-limited mobility, calculated from first principles, closely matched experimental results, suggesting that room-temperature mobility could be further increased with higher electron density. Additionally, the sample exhibited 85% optical transparency at a 300 nm wavelength. These findings highlight the potential of heterostructure design for transparent UWBG semiconductor applications, especially in deep-ultraviolet regime.</description>

      <title>Size and Shape Dependence of Hydrogen-Induced Phase Transformation and Sorption Hysteresis in Palladium Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a computational framework to explore the atomic configuration of a metal-hydrogen (M-H) system when in equilibrium with a H environment. This approach combines Diffusive Molecular Dynamics with an iteration strategy, aiming to minimize the system's free energy and ensure uniform chemical potential across the system that matches that of the H environment. Applying this framework, we investigate H chemical potential-composition isotherms during the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of palladium nanoparticles, ranging in size from $3.9$ nm to $15.6$ nm and featuring various shapes including cube, rhombic dodecahedron, octahedron, and sphere. Our findings reveal an abrupt phase transformation in all examined particles during both H loading and unloading processes, accompanied by a distinct hysteresis gap between absorption and desorption chemical potentials. Notably, as particle size increases, absorption chemical potential rises while desorption chemical potential declines, consequently widening the hysteresis gap across all shapes. Regarding shape effects, we observe that, at a given size, cubic particles exhibit the lowest absorption chemical potentials during H loading, whereas octahedral particles demonstrate the highest. Moreover, octahedral particles also exhibit the highest desorption chemical potentials during H unloading. These size and shape effects are elucidated by statistics of atomic volumetric strains resulting from specific facet orientations and inhomogeneous H distributions. Prior to phase transformation in absorption, a H-rich surface shell induces lattice expansion in the H-poor core, while before phase transformation in desorption, surface stress promotes lattice compression in the H-rich core. The magnitude of the volumetric strains correlates well with the size and shape dependence, underlining their pivotal role in the observed phenomena.</description>

      <title>Effect of helium bubbles on the mobility of edge dislocations in copper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helium bubbles can form in materials upon exposure to irradiation. It is well known that the presence of helium bubbles can cause changes in the mechanical behavior of materials. To improve the lifetime of nuclear components, it is important to understand deformation mechanisms in helium-containing materials. In this work, we investigate the interactions between edge dislocations and helium bubbles in copper using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We focus on the effect of helium bubble pressure (equivalently, the helium-to-vacancy ratio) on the obstacle strength of helium bubbles and their interaction with dislocations. Our simulations predict significant differences in the interaction mechanisms as a function of helium bubble pressure. Specifically, bubbles with high internal pressure are found to exhibit weaker obstacle strength as compared to low-pressure bubbles of the same size due to the formation of super-jogs in the dislocation. Activation energies and rate constants extracted from the MD data confirm this transition in mechanism and enable upscaling of these phenomena to high length-scale models.</description>

      <title>2D Nitride Ordered Alloys: A Novel Class of Ultra-Wide Bandgap Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductors are poised to transform power electronics by surpassing the capabilities of established wide bandgap materials, such as GaN and SiC, owing to their capability to operate at higher voltage, frequency, and temperature ranges. While bulk group-III nitrides and their alloys have been extensively studied in the UWBG realm, their two-dimensional counterparts remain unexplored. Here, we examine the stability and electronic properties of monolayers of ordered boron-based group-III nitride alloys with general formula BxM1-xN, where M = Al, Ga. On the basis of ab initio calculations we identify a number of energetically and dynamically stable structures. Instrumental to their stability is a previously overlooked out-of-plane displacement (puckering) of atoms, which induces a polar ordering and antiferroelectric ground state. Our findings reveal the energy barrier between metastable ferroelectric states is lowered by successive switching of out-of-plane displacements through an antiferroelectric state.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen-doping mediated solid state thermal switch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent reports reveal that isothermal chemical doping of hydrogen in correlated complex oxides such as perovskite nickelates (e.g. NdNiO3) can induce a metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) without the need for temperature modulation. In this work, we interrogate the magnitude change in temperature dependence of thermal conductivity upon chemical doping of hydrogen, as any changes to the thermal properties upon doping offer a route to solid-state thermal switches as well as another potential signal to monitor in a diverse set of sensing, electronic, and optical applications. Using frequency-domain thermoreflectance, we demonstrate that a large concentration of hydrogen (~ 0.1 - 0.5 H/unit cell) completely suppresses the electronic contribution to thermal conductivity in NdNiO3 thin films and reduces the phononic contribution by a factor of 2. These results are critical for the design of next-generation solid-state thermal switches, sensors, extreme environment electronics and neuromorphic memory architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To utilize half-metallic Heusler alloys in practical spintronic devices, such as magnetic sensors and magnetic memories, the key is to realize highly textured and structurally ordered polycrystalline thin films. In this study, we fabricated polycrystalline Co2FeGa0.5Ge0.5 (CFGG) Heusler alloy films deposited on a [001]-oriented Ag buffer layer, which was achieved by introducing N2 into Ar during the sputtering process, on a thermally oxidized Si substrate. We obtained strongly [001]-oriented CFGG films with B2 ordering and a high saturation magnetization close to the theoretical value, which can provide highly spin-polarized electric and spin current sources in spintronic devices with industrial viability.</description>

      <title>Dielectric Tensor Prediction for Inorganic Materials Using Latent Information from Preferred Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectrics are materials with widespread applications in flash memory, central processing units, photovoltaics, capacitors, etc. However, the availability of public dielectric data remains limited, hindering research and development efforts. Previously, machine learning models focused on predicting dielectric constants as scalars, overlooking the importance of dielectric tensors in understanding material properties under directional electric fields for material design and simulation. This study demonstrates the value of common equivariant structural embedding features derived from a universal neural network potential in enhancing the prediction of dielectric properties. To integrate channel information from various-rank latent features while preserving the desired SE(3) equivariance to the second-rank dielectric tensors, we design an equivariant readout decoder to predict the total, electronic, and ionic dielectric tensors individually, and compare our model with the state-of-the-art models. Finally, we evaluate our model by conducting virtual screening on thermodynamical stable structure candidates in Materials Project. The material Ba\textsubscript{2}SmTaO\textsubscript{6} with large band gaps ($E_g=3.36 \mathrm{eV}$) and dielectric constants ($\epsilon=93.81$) is successfully identified out of the 14k candidate set. The results show that our methods give good accuracy on predicting dielectric tensors of inorganic materials, emphasizing their potential in contributing to the discovery of novel dielectrics.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Properties of NH$_4$H$_2$PO$_4$ and KH$_2$PO$_4$: Emergence of Multiferroic Salts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe sharp step-down discontinuities in the magnetic susceptibility of NH$_4$H$_2$PO$_4$ and NH$_4$H$_2$PO$_4$-$d$$_{60}$ (60% deuterated) along the $a$ and $c$-axes occurring exactly at their antiferroelectric transition temperatures. For the case of KH$_2$PO$_4$, less pronounced discontinuities occur at the ferroelectric transition temperature. To explain this, we treat the acid protons as individual oscillators that generate current elements which translate to magnetic forces in near resonance with each other. With decreasing temperature, the resonant forces become more commensurate which amplifies a disproportionate drop off of two types of magnetic forces to eventually trigger the structural phase transitions. For the case of NH$_4$H$_2$PO$_4$, the associated internal magnetic field appears to aid the NH$_4$$^+$ to order at higher temperature. At 49 K, a shoulder-like anomaly in both NH$_4$H$_2$PO$_4$ and KH$_2$PO$_4$ is attributed to a possible onset of macroscopic quantum tunneling of protons. Our findings bring forth a new category of intrinsic multiferroic systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic interactions based on proton orbital motion in CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ and CH$_3$NH$_3$PbBr$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microscopic origin of the remarkable optoelectronic properties of one of the most studied contemporary materials remains unclear. Here, we identify the existence of magnetic interactions between intermolecular proton orbitals in CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ and CH$_3$NH$_3$PbBr$_3$. In particular, a unique sharp drop and a pronounced step-up discontinuity in the magnetic susceptibility at the tetragonal-to-cubic phase transitions are identified in CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ and CH$_3$NH$_3$PbBr$_3$, respectively. The magnetic interactions in the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases are dependent on thermal history and lattice orientation while nearly independent of the applied external magnetic field. In CH$_3$NH$_3$PbBr$_3$, the CH$_3$ and NH$_3$$^+$ components reorient in an uncorrelated fashion resulting the cubic phase to also exhibit magnetic anisotropy. Our findings provide a potential link connecting the highly light-absorbing CH$_3$NH$_3$$^+$ and the exceptional properties of the charge carriers of the inorganic framework in hybrid perovskite solar cells.</description>

      <title>Virtual melting and cyclic transformations between amorphous Si, Si I, and Si IV in a shear band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual melting (VM) as alternative deformation and stress relaxation mechanisms under extreme load is directly validated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the simple shear of single crystal Si I at a temperature 1,383 K below the melting temperature. The shear band consisting of liquid Si is formed immediately after the shear instability while stress drops to zero. A thermodynamic criterion for VM, which depends on the ratio of the sample to shear band widths, is derived analytically and confirmed by MD simulations. With further shear, the VM immediately transforms to a mixture of low-density amorphous a-Si, Si I, and IV, which undergo cyclic transformations a-Si to and from Si I, a-Si to Si IV, and Si I to and from Si IV with volume fraction of phases mostly between 0.2 and 0.4 and non-repeatable nanostructure evolution. Such cyclic transformations produce additional important carriers for plastic deformation through transformation strain and transformation-induced plasticity due to volume change, which may occur in shear bands in various material systems but missed in experiments and simulations.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional spin waves measured using propagating spin wave spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dispersion relation of spin waves can vary monotonously about the center of the Brillouin zone, allowing zero-momentum wavepackets to flow unidirectionally, which is of interest for applications. Techniques such as propagating spin wave spectroscopy are inoperative in such cases because of the difficulty to identify the spin wave wavevector at a particular frequency within a spectrum. Here we present a method to analyse this case and apply it to acoustic spin waves in a synthetic antiferromagnet in the scissors state, in which we confirm that propagation parallel to the applied fields is unidirectional. Interestingly, we find that the phase accumulated by the spin waves propagating between two antenna is not proportional to the antenna spacing. It is also a function of the two other lengths of the problem: the antenna width and the spin wave decay length. Accounting for them is required to avoid wavevector errors in the dispersion relations.</description>

      <title>Molecular order induced charge transfer in a C$_{60}$-topological insulator moir\'e heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We synthesize and spectroscopically investigate monolayer C$_{60}$ on the topological insulator (TI) Bi$_4$Te$_3$. This C$_{60}$/Bi$_4$Te$_3$ heterostructure is characterized by excellent translational order in a novel (4 x 4) C$_{60}$ superstructure on a (9 x 9) unit of Bi$_4$Te$_3$. We measure the full two-dimensional energy band structure of C$_{60}$/Bi$_4$Te$_3$ using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We find that C$_{60}$ accepts electrons from the TI at room temperature but no charge transfer occurs at low temperatures. We unravel this peculiar behaviour by Raman spectroscopy of C$_{60}$/Bi$_4$Te$_3$ and density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the electronegativity of C$_{60}$. Both methods are sensitive to orientational order of C$_{60}$. At low temperatures, Raman spectroscopy shows a dramatic intensity increase of the C$_{60}$ Raman signal, evidencing a transition to a rotationally ordered state. DFT reveals that the orientational order of C$_{60}$ at low temperatures has a higher electron affinity than at high temperatures. These results neatly explain the temperature-dependent charge transfer observed in ARPES. Our conclusions are supported by the appearance of a strong photoluminescence from C$_{60}$/Bi$_4$Te$_3$ at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Tunable magnetic anisotropy, Curie temperature and band alignment of two-dimensional ferromagnet VSiSnN4 via non-volatile ferroelectrical control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of multiferroic materials, which possess both ferromagnetic (FM) and ferroelectric (FE) properties, drive advancements in magnetoelectric applications and the next generation of spintronics. Based on first-principles calculations, we investigate an engineered two-dimensional multiferroic van der Waals heterostructures consisting of FM VSiSnN4 monolayer (ML) and fully hydrogenated FE AlN bilayer. We find that the magnetic anisotropy of VSiSnN4 ML is tunable between out-of-plane and in-plane and a phase transition between semiconductor and metal is induced in VSiSnN4/AlN bilayer when the FE polarization direction of AlN bilayer is reversed. Surprisingly, when the FE polarization of AlN bilayer is upward, the Curie temperature of VSiSnN4/AlN bilayer can be significantly increased from 204K to 284K. Such non-volatile and tunable magnetic anisotropy, Curie temperature and band alignment in VSiSnN4/AlN multiferroic heterostructure are highly promising for future low-current operation of data storage and logic devices.</description>

Abstract: The ionic conductivity at the grain boundaries (GBs) in oxide ceramics is typically several orders of magnitude lower than that within the grain interior. This detrimental GB effect is the main bottleneck for designing high-performance ceramic electrolytes intended for use in solid-state Lithium-ion batteries, fuel cells, and electrolyzer cells. The macroscopic ionic conductivity in oxide ceramics is essentially governed by the underlying polycrystalline microstructures where GBs and grain morphology go hand in hand. This provides the possibility to enhance the ion conductivity by microstructure engineering. To this end, a thorough understanding of microstructure-property correlation is highly desirable. In this work, we investigate numerous polycrystalline microstructure samples with varying grain and grain boundary features. Their macroscopic ionic conductivities are numerically evaluated by the finite element homogenization method, whereby the GB resistance is explicitly regarded. The influence of different microstructural features on the effective ionic conductivity is systematically studied. The microstructure-property relationships are revealed. Additionally, a graph neural network-based machine learning model is constructed and trained. It can accurately predict the effective ionic conductivity for a given polycrystalline microstructure. This work provides crucial quantitative guidelines for optimizing the ionic conducting performance of oxide ceramics by tailoring microstructures.</description>

      <title>Formation of Beta-Indium Selenide Layers Grown via Selenium Passivation of InP(111)B Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indium selenide, In2Se3, has recently attracted growing interest due to its novel properties, including room temperature ferroelectricity, outstanding photoresponsivity, and exotic in-plane ferroelectricity, which open up new regimes for next generation electronics. In2Se3 also provides the important advantage of tuning the electrical properties of ultra-thin layers with an external electrical and magnetic field, making it a potential platform to study novel two-dimensional physics. Yet, In2Se3 has many different polymorphs, and it has been challenging to synthesize single-phase material, especially using scalable growth methods, as needed for technological applications. In this paper, we use aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy to characterize the microstructure of twin-free single-phase ultra-thin layers of beta-In2Se3, prepared by a unique molecular beam epitaxy approach. We emphasize features of the In2Se3 layer and In2Se3/InP interface which provide evidence for understanding the growth mechanism of the single-phase In2Se3. This novel approach for forming high-quality twin-free single phase two-dimensional crystals on InP substrates is likely to be applicable to other technologically important substrates.</description>

      <title>Exciton self-trapping in twisted hexagonal boron nitride homostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main interests of 2D materials is their ability to be assembled with many degrees of freedom for tuning and manipulating excitonic properties. There is a need to understand how the structure of the interfaces between atomic layers influences exciton properties. Here we use cathodoluminescence (CL) and time-resolved CL experiments to study how excitons interact with the interface between two twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) crystals with various angles. An efficient capture of free excitons by the interface is demonstrated, which leads to a population of long lived and interface-localized (2D) excitons. Temperature dependent experiments indicate that for high twist angles, these excitons localized at the interface further undergo a self-trapping. It consists in a distortion of the lattice around the exciton on which the exciton traps itself. Our results suggest that this exciton-interface interaction causes a broad optical emission of highly twisted hBN-hBN structures around 300 nm (4 eV). Exciton self-trapping is finally discussed as a common feature of sp2 hybridized boron nitride polytypes and nanostructures due to the ionic nature of the B-N bond and their compact excitons.</description>

      <title>Geminate Exciton Fusion Fluorescence as a Probe of Triplet Exciton Transport after Singlet Fission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geminate annihilation of two triplet excitons created by singlet exciton fission is affected by the dimensionality of transport as determined by typically anisotropic triplet exciton mobilities in organic molecular crystals. We analyze this process using a random-walk model where the time-dynamics of the geminate annihilation probability is determined by the average exciton hopping times along the crystallographic directions. The model is then applied to the geminate fluorescence dynamics in rubrene, where the main channel for triplet-triplet annihilation is via triplet fusion and subsequent photon emission, and we identify the transitions between transport in one, two, and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting first-principles thermodynamics by quasiharmonic approach: Application to study thermal expansion of additively-manufactured Inconel 625</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An innovative method is developed for accurate determination of thermodynamic properties as a function of temperature by revisiting the density functional theory (DFT) based quasiharmonic approach (QHA). The present methodology individually evaluates the contributions from static total energy, phonon, and thermal electron to free energy for increased efficiency and accuracy. The Akaike information criterion with a correction (AICc) is used to select models and model parameters for fitting each contribution as a function of volume. Using the additively manufactured Inconel alloy 625 (IN625) as an example, predicted temperature-dependent linear coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) agrees well with dilatometer measurements and values in the literature. Sensitivity and uncertainty are also analyzed for the predicted IN625 CTE due to different structural configurations used by DFT, and hence different equilibrium properties determined.</description>

      <title>Anderson Impurity Mechanism for a Multi-Level Model in $\delta$-Pu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic correlations and spin-orbit interactions in plutonium create variations in the bonding behavior of each of its allotropes. In $\delta$-Pu, the 5f electrons lie at the tipping point between itinerant and localized behavior which makes the creation of predictive models very difficult. We perform density functional theory calculations to study the effect of correlated descriptions on the mechanical properties of $\delta$-Pu. We find that 7.5% $E_{xx}$ in the HSE functional yields the experimental lattice parameters, moreover, this functional recovers the experimental elastic constants while other approximations fail. The electronic structure of the hybrid functional yields several signatures of strong correlations including orbital-selective bonding of a single 5f electron and a pseudogap-like feature which work in tandem to improve the description of mechanical properties. We show how the emergence of orbital-selective bonding in the hybrid functional can be understood through an Anderson impurity picture which predicts the augmentation of $\pi$-bonding, the decrease of $\sigma$-bonding, and expands the volume of the cell, enabling the accurate description of the mechanical properties of $\delta$-Pu.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The newly emerged two-dimensional (2D) materials family of MSi2N4, where M is a transition metal atom (i.e., Mo, W, etc.), has the potential to be named after the conventional and very popular transition metal di-chalcogenides (TMDC), which got their reputation for having bandgap tunability and high mobility. The HfSi2N4 and HfGe2N4 2D materials are members of the MSi2N4 family and possess very good figure of merit (ZT) and have high mobility, proving their suitability for thermoelectric applications. The HfSi2N4 and HfGe2N4 showed considerable ZT of 0.90 and 0.89, respectively, for p-type and 0.83 and 0.79 for n-type, at 900 K along with high mobility according to the solutions obtained after solving the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE). The HfGe2N4 also showed a ZT of 0.84 at 600 K and 0.68 at 300 K, which is also excellent for low-temperature operation. The bandgaps (BG) obtained for HfSi2N4 and HfGe2N4 according to the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) approximation were 2.89 eV and 2.75 eV. The first absorption peak showed in the blue region of the visible spectrum; from this, their usefulness in visible range photodetectors can also be inferred.</description>

      <title>Phonon Inverse Faraday effect from electron-phonon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phonon inverse Faraday effect describes the emergence of a DC magnetization due to circularly polarized phonons. In this work we present a microscopic formalism for the phonon inverse Faraday effect. The formalism is based on time-dependent second order perturbation theory and electron phonon coupling. While our final equation is general and material independent, we provide estimates for the effective magnetic field expected for the ferroelectric soft mode in the oxide perovskite SrTiO$_3$. Our estimates are consistent with recent experiments showing a huge magnetization after a coherent excitation of circularly polarized phonons with THz laser light. Hence, the theoretical approach presented here is promising for shedding light into the microscopic mechanism of angular momentum transfer between ionic and electronic angular momentum, which is expected to play a central role in the phononic manipulation of magnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the framework of semi-classical Landau-Lifshitz dynamics (LLD), we conduct a systematic investigation of the temperature-dependent spin dynamics in the S = 1/2 Heisenberg square-lattice antiferromagnet (SqAF). By performing inelastic neutron scattering measurements on Zn2VO(PO4)2 (ZVPO) and corresponding finite-temperature spin dynamics simulations based on LLD, we present a comprehensive analysis that bridges quantum and classical spin dynamics over a broad temperature range. First, a remarkable agreement between experimental data and LLD simulations is found in the paramagnetic phase of ZVPO, demonstrating the capability of LLD in accurately determining the spin Hamiltonian of S = 1/2 systems and capturing the quantum-to-classical crossover of their spin dynamics. Second, by analyzing the discrepancies between the experimental data and the LLD simulations at lower temperatures, we determine the experimental temperature dependence of the quantum effects in the excitation spectrum of the S = 1/2 SqAF: the quantum renormalization factor for the magnon energies and the quantum continuum above the one-magnon bands. Notably, the emergence of each quantum effect is found to correlate with the formation of three-dimensional long-range order. This work demonstrates the utility of LLD in gaining experimental insights into the temperature-induced modifications of quantum spin dynamics and their convergence towards classical expectations at higher temperatures. This motivates further applications to more challenging quantum antiferromagnets dominated by stronger quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Investigation of BaTiO$_3$-NiO composite as compact Dielectric Resonator Antenna</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A compact dielectric resonator antenna has been fabricated on a microstrip transmission line for the purpose of C-band wireless communication using a ceramic material made out of a sintered mixture of BTO and NiO. The antenna parameters are optimized using Ansys HFSS software and verified experimentally. Ni replaces both Ba at A site and Ti at B site. Such a solid solution has a limit depending on the amount of NiO provided during sintering. A complete study of the structural changes and the dielectric constant enables the correlation with the resonating property. All the samples retain the ferroelectric tetragonal P4mm phase with a nominal decrease in the c/a ratio. NiO incorporation in BTO decreases the sintering temperature and shows two types of morphology associated with BTO-like and NiO-like phases. It induces prominent reduction in the permittivity and loss tangent (&lt;0.01) in the range 100Hz to 1MHz. These properties make these samples suitable for DRA application in the C-Band range [4-8 GHz]. Experimental and theoretical assessment using HFSS software yields a C-band signal at ~7.27 GHz.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Berry curvature physics and quantum geometric effects have been instrumental in advancing topological condensed matter physics in recent decades. Although Landau level-based flat bands and conventional 3D solids have been pivotal in exploring rich topological phenomena, they are constrained by their limited ability to undergo dynamic tuning. In stark contrast, moir\'e systems have risen as a versatile platform for engineering bands and manipulating the distribution of Berry curvature in momentum space. These moir\'e systems not only harbor tunable topological bands, modifiable through a plethora of parameters, but also provide unprecedented access to large length scales and low energy scales. Furthermore, they offer unique opportunities stemming from the symmetry-breaking mechanisms and electron correlations associated with the underlying flat bands that are beyond the reach of conventional crystalline solids. A diverse array of tools, encompassing quantum electron transport in both linear and non-linear response regimes and optical excitation techniques, provide direct avenues for investigating Berry physics. This review navigates the evolving landscape of tunable moir\'e materials, highlighting recent experimental breakthroughs in the field of topological physics. Additionally, we delineate several challenges and offer insights into promising avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Response Matching for generating materials and molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has recently emerged as a powerful tool for generating new molecular and material structures. The success of state-of-the-art models stems from their ability to incorporate physical symmetries, such as translation, rotation, and periodicity. Here, we present a novel generative method called Response Matching (RM), which leverages the fact that each stable material or molecule exists at the minimum of its potential energy surface. Consequently, any perturbation induces a response in energy and stress, driving the structure back to equilibrium. Matching to such response is closely related to score matching in diffusion models. By employing the combination of a machine learning interatomic potential and random structure search as the denoising model, RM exploits the locality of atomic interactions, and inherently respects permutation, translation, rotation, and periodic invariances. RM is the first model to handle both molecules and bulk materials under the same framework. We demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of RM across three systems: a small organic molecular dataset, stable crystals from the Materials Project, and one-shot learning on a single diamond configuration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Granular materials such as sand, powders, and food grains are ubiquitous in civil engineering, geoscience, agriculture, and medicine. While the influence of friction between the grains on the static structure of these systems is well understood, its impact on the dynamics is an open problem. Here we use particle-based simulations of a granular pack under cyclic shear and discover that the relaxation time of the system is a non-monotonic function of friction. By introducing the concept of dynamic constraints, we reveal that this re-entrant dynamics is due to the competition between increasing frictional coupling and a concurrent change in the structure of the granular pack. Our theoretical approach, which unifies the dynamics of friction-less systems with frictional ones, is applicable to other systems that have a complex free energy landscape and a dynamics which involves time-dependent constraints, thus setting the stage for a description of the dynamic behavior of a large class of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Resonance-Induced Anomalies in Temperature-Dependent Raman Scattering of PdSe$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive Raman study of the phonon behaviour in PdSe$_2$ in the temperature range of 5 K to 300 K. A remarkable change in the Raman spectrum is observed at 120 K: a significant enhancement of the out-of-plane phonon A$^{1}_{g}$ mode, accompanied by a suppression of the in-plane A$^{2}_{g}$ and B$^{2}_{1g}$ modes. This intriguing behavior is attributed to a temperature-dependent resonant excitation effect. The results are supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which demonstrate that the electron-phonon coupling for the phonon modes varies and is strongly associated with the relevant electronic states. Furthermore, nonlinear frequency shifts are identified in all modes, indicating the decay of an optical phonon into multiple acoustic phonons. The study of Raman emission reported here, complemented by linear optical spectroscopy, reveals an unexpected scenario for the vibrational properties of PdSe$_2$ that holds substantial promise for future applications in PdSe$_2$-based optoelectronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For electronic systems with multi-reference (MR) character, Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) with the conventional exchange-correlation (xc) energy functionals can lead to incorrect spin densities and related properties. For example, for H2 dissociation, the spin-restricted and spin-unrestricted solutions obtained with the same xc energy functional in KS-DFT can be distinctly different, yielding the unphysical spin-symmetry breaking effects in the spin-unrestricted solutions. Recently, thermally-assisted-occupation density functional theory (TAO-DFT) has been shown to resolve the aforementioned spin-symmetry breaking, when the fictitious temperature is properly chosen. In this work, a response theory based on TAO-DFT is developed to demonstrate that TAO-DFT with a sufficiently large fictitious temperature can always resolve the unphysical spin-symmetry breaking in MR systems. To further support this, TAO-DFT calculations with various fictitious temperatures are performed for the dissociation of H2, N2, He2, and Ne2 as well as the twisted ethylene.</description>

      <title>Unconventional magnetism mediated by spin-phonon-photon coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic order typically emerges due to the short-range exchange interaction between the constituent electronic spins. Recent discoveries have found a crucial role for spin-phonon coupling in various phenomena from optical ultrafast magnetization switching to dynamical control of the magnetic state. Here, we demonstrate theoretically the emergence of a biquadratic long-range interaction between spins mediated by their coupling to phonons hybridized with vacuum photons into polaritons. The resulting ordered state enabled by the exchange of virtual polaritons between spins is reminiscent of superconductivity mediated by the exchange of virtual phonons. The biquadratic nature of the spin-spin interaction promotes ordering without favoring ferro- or antiferromagnetism. It further makes the phase transition to magnetic order a first-order transition, unlike in conventional magnets. Consequently, a large magnetization develops abruptly on lowering the temperature which \aknew{could} enable magnetic memories admitting ultralow-power thermally-assisted writing while maintaining a high data stability. The role of photons in the phenomenon further enables an in-situ static control over the magnetism. These unique features make our predicted spin-spin interaction and magnetism highly unconventional paving the way for novel scientific and technological opportunities.</description>

      <title>Laser Printing of Silver and Silver Oxide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that direct laser writing (DLW) in aqueous silver nitrate with a 1030 nm femtosecond (fs) laser results in deposition of a mixture of silver oxide and silver, in contrast to the pure silver deposition previously reported with 780 nm fs DLW. However, adding photoinitiator prevents silver oxide formation in a concentration-dependent manner. As a result, the resistivity of the material can also be controlled by photoinitiator concentration with resistivity being reduced from approximately 9e-3 $\Omega m$ to 3e-7 $\Omega m$. Silver oxide peaks dominate the X-ray diffraction spectra when no photoinitiator is present, while the peaks disappear with photoinitiator concentrations above 0.05wt%. While femtosecond pulses are needed to initiate deposition, a continues-wave laser when well overlapped with the previously written material and supplying enough average power can lead to further printing, suggesting thermal deposition can also occur where the photoinitiator molecule also acts as a general reducing agent that prevents oxide formation. We also compare the surface quality of printed lines for different photoinitiator concentrations and laser printing conditions. A THz polarizer and metamaterial are printed as a demonstration of silver oxide printing.</description>

      <title>Comparative Performance of Fluorite-Structured Materials for Nanosupercapacitor Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last fifteen years, ferroelectric and antiferroelectric ultra thin films based on fluorite-structured materials have drawn significant attention for a wide variety of applications requiring high integration density. Antiferroelectric $ZrO_2$, in particular, holds significant promise for nanosupercapacitors, owing to its potential for high energy storage density (ESD) and high efficiency ($\eta$). This work assesses the potential of high-performance $Hf_{1-x}Zr_{x}O_2$ thin films encapsulated by TiN electrodes that show linear dielectric (LD), ferroelectric (FE), and antiferroelectric (AFE) behavior. Oxides on silicon are grown by magnetron sputtering and plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition. ESD and $\eta$ are compared for FE, AFE, and LD samples at the same electrical field (3.5 MV/cm). As expected, ESD is higher for the FE sample ($95 J/cm^3$), but $\eta$ is ridiculously small ($\approx$ 55%), because of the opening of the FE hysteresis curve inducing high loss. Conversely, LD samples exhibit the highest efficiency (nearly 100%), at the expense of a lower ESD. AFE $ZrO_2$ thin film strikes a balance between FE and LD behavior, showing reduced losses compared to the FE sample but an ESD as high as $52 J/cm^3$ at 3.5 MV/cm. This value can be further increased up to $84 J/cm^3$ at a higher electrical field (4.0 MV/cm), with an $\eta$ of 75%, among the highest values reported for fluorite-structured materials, offering promising perspectives for future optimization.</description>

Abstract: The DC photocurrent can detect the topology and geometry of quantum materials without inversion symmetry. Herein, we propose that the DC shot noise (DSN), as the fluctuation of photocurrent operator, can also be a diagnostic of quantum materials. Particularly, we develop the quantum theory for DSNs in gapped systems and identify the shift and injection DSNs by dividing the second-order photocurrent operator into off-diagonal and diagonal contributions, respectively. Remarkably, we find that the DSNs can not be forbidden by inversion symmetry, while the constraint from time-reversal symmetry depends on the polarization of light. Furthermore, we show that the DSNs also encode the geometrical information of Bloch electrons, such as the Berry curvature and the quantum metric. Finally, guided by symmetry, we apply our theory to evaluate the DSNs in monolayer GeS and bilayer MoS$_2$ with and without inversion symmetry and find that the DSNs can be larger in centrosymmetric phase.</description>

      <title>Active learning of effective Hamiltonian for super-large-scale atomic structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first-principles-based effective Hamiltonian scheme provides one of the most accurate modeling technique for large-scale structures, especially for ferroelectrics. However, the parameterization of the effective Hamiltonian is complicated and can be difficult for some complex systems such as high-entropy perovskites. Here, we propose a general form of effective Hamiltonian and develop an active machine learning approach to parameterize the effective Hamiltonian based on Bayesian linear regression. The parameterization is employed in molecular dynamics simulations with the prediction of energy, forces, stress and their uncertainties at each step, which decides whether first-principles calculations are executed to retrain the parameters. Structures of BaTiO$_3$, Pb(Zr$_{0.75}$Ti$_{0.25}$)O$_3$ and (Pb,Sr)TiO$_3$ system are taken as examples to show the accuracy of this approach, as compared with conventional parametrization method and experiments. This machine learning approach provides a universal and automatic way to compute the effective Hamiltonian parameters for any considered complex systems with super-large-scale (more than $10^7$ atoms) atomic structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials that exhibit ferroaxial order hold potential for novel multiferroic applications. However, in pure ferroaxials, domains are not directly coupled to stress or static electric field due to their symmetry, limiting the ability to pole and switch between domains -- features required for real-world applications. Here we propose a general approach to selectively condense and switch between ferroaxial domains with light. We show that circularly polarized light pulses on resonance with infrared-active phonons manifest helicity-dependent control over ferroaxial domains. Nonlinear contributions to the lattice polarizability play an essential role in this phenomenon. We illustrate the feasibility of our approach using first-principle calculations and dynamical simulations for the archetypal ferroaxial material RbFe(MoO$_4$)$_2$. Our results are discussed in the context of future pump-probe optical experiments, where polarization, carrier frequency, and fluence threshold are explored.</description>

      <title>Universal relation between energy gap and dielectric constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04180v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a universal relation between the energy gap and the static dielectric constant for all insulating states. This relation yields an upper bound on the energy gap, which only depends on the electron density and electronic dielectric constant. We identify two types of energy gaps associated with transverse and longitudinal excitations at long wavelength, which correspond to the optical gap and the plasmon energy respectively. Their upper bounds are set by the dielectric constant and its inverse respectively. The transverse gap bound is calculated for a wide range of materials and compared with the measured optical gap. A remarkable case is cubic boron nitride, in which the direct gap reaches \SI{72}{\percent} of the bound.
  Our results are derived from the Kramers-Kronig relation and the $f$-sum rule, and therefore rest on general physical principles.</description>

Abstract: Atomically-thin van der Waals magnetic materials offer exceptional opportunities to mechanically and electrically manipulate magnetic states and spin textures. The possibility of efficient spin transport in these materials makes them promising for the development of novel nanospintronics technology. Using atomistic spin dynamics simulations, we investigate magnetic ground state, magnon dispersion, critical temperature, and magnon spin transport in CrCl$_3$ bilayers in the absence and presence of compressive and tensile strains. We show that in the presence of mechanical strain, the magnon band gap at the $\Gamma$ point and the critical temperature of the bilayer are increased. Furthermore, our simulations show that the magnon diffusion length is reduced in the presence of strain. Moreover, by exciting magnons through the spin Seebeck effect and spin Hall-induced torque, we illustrate distinctions between magnon spin transport in the antiferromagnetic state, under compressive strains, and ferromagnetic states, under tensile strains or in the unstrained case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic interactions in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) Dirac semimetal candidate SrMnSb$_2$ are investigated using \textit{ab initio} linear response theory and inelastic neutron scattering (INS). Our calculations reveal that the first two nearest in-plane couplings ($J_1$ and $J_2$) are both AFM in nature, indicating a significant degree of spin frustration, which aligns with experimental observations. The orbital resolution of exchange interactions shows that $J_1$ and $J_2$ are dominated by direct and superexchange, respectively. In a broader context, a rigid-band model suggests that electron doping fills the minority spin channel and results in a decrease in the AFM coupling strength for both $J_1$ and $J_2$. To better compare with INS measurements, we calculate the spin wave spectra within a linear spin wave theory, utilizing the computed exchange parameters. Although the calculated spin wave spectra somewhat overestimate the magnon bandwidth, they exhibit overall good agreement with measurements from INS experiments.</description>

      <title>Inverted band gap trend through octahedral ordering in Cs$_2$Au$_2$X$_6$ (X=Cl, Br, I)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Double perovskites Cs$_2$Au$_2$X$_6$ (X=Cl, Br, I) are prototypical materials that exhibit charge disproportionation of gold into 1+ and 3+ states. It is known that the disproportionation is resolved under high pressures, and this has stimulated many studies into the pressurization of these materials. At present, the phase changes in these materials are still strongly contested. Here, we use density functional theory to study the pressure-dependent behavior of Cs$_2$Au$_2$X$_6$. We find that a tetragonal--cubic transition occurs directly from the ground state $I4/mmm$ structure. Even so, we also found an intermediate tetragonal $P4/mmm$ structure to be very close in energy, suggesting it to be observable. We also find several other competing metastable phases, which explains some of the controversies in the literature. Focusing on one of the metastable phases, we suggest that Cs$_2$Au$_2$X$_6$ can be prepared in a $P4_2/mnm$ structure, analogous to that of KCuF$_3$. The band gap in the $P4_2/mnm$ structure widened as atomic number of the halide was increased, which is the inverse trend compared to the ground state structure. We explain this by the different octahedral distortion ordering in the two structural phases. Furthermore, we show that the conduction band in $P4_2/mnm$ is three dimensionally connected, which is favorable for opto-electronic applications. We submit that this work demonstrates that octahedral distortion ordering is a promising avenue for developing new double perovskites and suggests it to be particular effective in tuning the electronic structure properties.</description>

Abstract: We present a Raman study of ZrAs_{2} single crystals, a nodal line semimetal with symmetry-enforced Dirac-like band crossings. We identified the symmetry of phonon modes by polarized light measurements and comparison with calculated phonon frequencies. Significant dependence of peak intensities on the excitation wavelength was observed, indicating quantum interference effects. Phonon peaks in the spectra are superimposed on the electronic background, with quasi-elastic scattering observed for the 785 nm excitation. We identified the Fano shape of the 171 cm^{-1} Ag mode due to interference of the phonon state with the electronic continuum. The temperature dependence of phonon peaks linewidth indicates that the electron-phonon coupling plays an essential role in phonon decay.</description>

Abstract: We analyze a class of bound defect states in the continuum of bilayer graphene, which emerge independent of symmetry protection or additional degrees of freedom. A comparative analysis of AA- and AB-stacked bilayer graphene demonstrates that these states originate from the intrinsic algebraic structure of the Hamiltonian rather than any underlying symmetry. This discovery provides a pathway to previously unexplored approaches in defect and band-structure engineering. We conclude with a proposed protocol for observing these states in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments.</description>

      <title>Elementary processes in dilatational plasticity of glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Materials typically fail under complex stress states, essentially involving dilatational (volumetric) components that eventually lead to material decohesion/separation. It is therefore important to understand dilatational irreversible deformation -- i.e., dilatational plasticity -- en route to failure. In the context of glasses, much focus has been given to shear (volume-preserving) plasticity, both in terms of the stress states considered and the corresponding material response. Here, using a recently-developed methodology and extensive computer simulations, we shed basic light on the elementary processes mediating dilatational plasticity in glasses. We show that plastic instabilities, corresponding to singularities of the glass Hessian, generically feature both dilatational and shear irreversible strain components. The relative magnitude and statistics of the strain components depend both on the symmetry of the driving stress (e.g., shear vs.~hydrostatic tension) and on the cohesive (attractive) part of the interatomic interaction. We further show that the tensorial shear component of the plastic strain is generally non-planar and also extract the characteristic volume of plastic instabilities. Elucidating the fundamental properties of the elementary micro-mechanical building blocks of plasticity in glasses sets the stage for addressing larger-scale, collective phenomena in dilatational plasticity such as topological changes in the form of cavitation and ductile-to-brittle transitions. As a first step in this direction, we show that the elastic moduli markedly soften during dilatational plastic deformation approaching cavitation.</description>

      <title>Universal Deformations and Inhomogeneities in Isotropic Cauchy Elasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a given class of materials, \emph{universal deformations} are those deformations that can be maintained in the absence of body forces and by applying solely boundary tractions. For inhomogeneous bodies, in addition to the universality constraints that determine the universal deformations, there are extra constraints on the form of the material inhomogeneities -- \emph{universal inhomogeneity constraints}. Those inhomogeneities compatible with the universal inhomogeneity constraints are called \emph{universal inhomogeneities}. In a Cauchy elastic solid, stress at a given point and at an instance of time is a function of strain at that point and that exact moment in time, without any dependence on prior history. A Cauchy elastic solid does not necessarily have an energy function, i.e., Cauchy elastic solids are, in general, non-hyperelastic (or non-Green elastic). In this paper we characterize universal deformations in both compressible and incompressible inhomogeneous isotropic Cauchy elasticity. As Cauchy elasticity includes hyperelasticity, one expects the universal deformations of Cauchy elasticity to be a subset of those of hyperelasticity both in the compressible and incompressible cases. It is also expected that the universal inhomogeneity constraints to be more strict than those of hyperelasticity, and hence, the set of universal inhomogeneities to be smaller than that of hyperelasticity. We prove the unexpected result that the sets of universal deformations of isotropic Cauchy elasticity and isotropic hyperelasticity are identical, in both the compressible and incompressible cases. We also prove that their corresponding universal inhomogeneities are identical as well.</description>

      <title>Imaging Localized Variable Capacitance During Switching Processes in Silicon Diodes by Time-Resolved Electron Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interference Gating or iGate is a unique method for ultrafast time-resolved electron holography in a transmission electron microscope enabling a spatiotemporal resolution in the nm and ns regime with a minimal technological effort. Here, iGate is used for the first image-based investigation of the local dynamics of the projected electric potential in the area of the space charge region of two different general purpose silicon diodes during switching between unbiased and reverse biased condition with a temporal resolution of 25ns at a repetition rate of 3MHz. The obtained results for a focus-ion-beam-prepared ultrafast UG1A rectifier diode, which shows a decreasing capacitance with increasing reverse bias are in good agreement with an electric characterization of the macroscopic device as well as with theoretical expectations. For a severely modified 1N4007 device, however, time-resolved electron holography revealed a MOSCAP-like behavior with a rising capacitance in the area of the space charge region during the switching into reverse biased condition. Remarkably, a different behavior, dominated by the effective capacitance of the electrical setup, can be observed in the vacuum region outside both devices within the same measurements, clearly showing the benefits of localized dynamic potentiometry.</description>
