      <title>Accurate analytic approximation for a fractional differential equation with a modified Bessel function term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new approximation function is introduced to fit the solution of a fractional differential equation of order one-half. The analyzed case includes a nonhomogeneous term defined by a modified Bessel function of the first kind. The analytical solution of this equation corresponds to the product of two modified Bessel functions. The new fitting function is developed using the multipoint quasi-rational method, which uses both the series expansion of the Bessel function and its asymptotic expansion. Additionally, a significant modification is introduced to the structure of the fitting function to capture two terms of the asymptotic expansion of the Bessel functions. We show an example for fixed values, and the maximum relative error of the fitting function for the solution of the fractional differential equation of order one-half is $0.18\%$, a remarkably low value considering that only six fitting parameters are used</description>

      <title>Newton-Mandelbrot set and Murase-Mandelbrot set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain four extended Newton's methods and three extended Mandelbrot's recurrence formulas from the Wasan (Japanese mathematics in the Edo period (1603-1868)). Furthermore, two extended Newton's methods relate to one of the extended Mandelbrot's recurrence formulas. We lead four types of extended Mandelbrot recurrence formulas. Next, we show that these become the same extended Mandelbrot set, and connected, closed set. These show the originality of Wasan.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and trivial solutions to inverse eigenstrain problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the well-posedness of inverse eigenstrain problems for residual stress analysis from the perspective of the non-uniqueness of solutions, structure of the corresponding null space and associated orthogonal range-null decompositions. Through this process we highlight the existence of a trivial solution to all inverse eigenstrain problems, with all other solutions differing from this trivial version by an unobservable null component. From one perspective, this implies that no new information can be gained though eigenstrain analysis, however we also highlight the utility of the eigenstrain framework for enforcing equilibrium while estimating residual stress from incomplete experimental data. Two examples based on measured experimental data are given; one axisymmetric system involving ancient Roman medical tools, and one more-general system involving an additively manufactured Inconel sample. We conclude by drawing a link between eigenstrain and reconstruction formulas related to strain tomography based on the Longitudinal Ray Transform (LRT). Through this link, we establish a potential means for tomographic reconstruction of residual stress from LRT measurements.</description>

      <title>Definite integrals involving Bessel functions expressed as a series of special functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Series involving hypergeometric functions are used to derive, extend and evaluate integrals involving the product of two Bessel functions of the first kind $J_{u}(a z)$ $J_{v}(b z)$ with order $u,v$, studied by Landau et al. The method used in this work is contour integration.</description>

      <title>Principal Values and Principal Subspaces of Two Subspaces of Vector Spaces with Inner Product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper is studied the problem concerning the angle between two subspaces of arbitrary dimensions in Euclidean space $E_{n}$. It is proven that the angle between two subspaces is equal to the angle between their orthogonal subspaces. Using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of corresponding matrix representations, there are introduced principal values and principal subspaces. Their geometrical interpretation is also given together with the canonical representation of the two subspaces. The canonical matrix for the two subspaces is introduced and its properties of duality are obtained. Here obtained results expand the classic results given in [1,2].</description>
