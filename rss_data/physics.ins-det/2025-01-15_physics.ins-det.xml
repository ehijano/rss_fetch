      <title>LUCAS: A Low-Power Ultra-Low Jitter Compact ASIC for SiPM Targetting ToF-CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present LUCAS (Low power Ultra-low jitter Compact ASIC for SiPM), an analog front-end for Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPM) targeting fast timing detectors in Time-of-Flight Computed Tomography (ToF-CT). LUCAS features a very low input impedance preamplifier followed by a voltage comparator. It is designed in TSMC 65 nm low-power CMOS technology with a power supply of 1.2 V. Our first 8-channel prototype has been sent to fabrication and will be received in August 2023. Post-layout simulations predict less than 40 ps FWHM SPTR jitter and an approximate power consumption of 3.2 mW per channel. The front end is suitable for applications with rigorous jitter requirements and high event rates, thanks to its 3.9 GHz unity-gain bandwidth. The front-end compact form factor will facilitate its incorporation into systems demanding high channel densities.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Multiple Channels Room Temperature Readout Electronics for Large Transition-Edge Sensor Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition-edge sensor (TES) is a highly sensitive device that is capable of detecting extremely low levels of energy. It is characterised by low noise performance and high energy resolution. A mature method for reading out TES signal is through time-division multiplexing (TDM) direct current superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). In a TDM system, the signal readout chain represents a significant source of noise other than the TES intrinsic noise. The noise generated by TES is in the range of several tens to several hundreds of $pA/\sqrt{Hz}$. In order to ensure the high energy resolution of TES, it is necessary to ensure that the noise contribution from the room temperature readout electronics is less than $10$ $pA/\sqrt{Hz}$ above 100 $Hz$. In this work, we have designed a low-noise, high-resolution room temperature readout circuit for TDM. The equivalent current noise contribution of ADC is about $0.05$ $pA/\sqrt{Hz}$ above 100 $Hz$ and $0.46$ $pA\sqrt{Hz}$ under 30:1 multiplexing. The resolution of the analog to digital converter (ADC) is larger than 11.5 bits, which can reconstruct the TES signal without distortion. The readout board, which has eight channels, has JESD204B serial ports, which has greatly simplified the space of room temperature electronics. The readout chain is based on multi-threaded CPU processing and can transfer data at 2 $Gbps$ for each channel in real time. This readout board can be used in a TDM system with smaller size for large TES arrays.</description>

      <title>Resistive Plate Chambers for brain PET imaging and particle tracking and timing (TOF-tracker)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we explore readout architectures for the simultaneous high-resolution timing and bidimensional tracking of charged particles with Resistive Plate Chambers (TOF-tracker) and for the accurate detection of gamma rays for PET imaging. On 625 $cm^2$ of active area we obtained a time resolution of 61 ps $\sigma$ and bidimensional position resolution below 150 $\mu$m $\sigma$ for the tracking and timing of charged particles from cosmic rays. An intrinsic precision of 0.49 mm FWHM was determined for the localization of a small $\beta^+$ source via the detection of its annihilation radiation.</description>

      <title>Compact pulsed laser deposition system for in-situ polarized neutron reflectometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of ferromagnet/heavy metal thin-film structures, such as CoFeB/Mo, with spin-orbit interaction requires advanced methods for their production and study. Polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR) provides unique insights into the evolution of magnetic properties, especially when applied in-situ during the growth process. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a versatile method for producing magnetic thin films, and combining PLD with in-situ PNR measurements offers new possibilities for their investigation. In this work, we developed a compact vacuum chamber integrated into the neutron instrument, enabling step-by-step deposition and in-situ PNR measurements. A multilayer Mo/[CoFeB/Mo]12 structure was grown, and neutron reflectivity curves measured after each cycle revealed the gradual evolution of sample properties. A weak magnetic field response suggested the potential formation of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) at CoFeB/Mo interfaces. Additionally, a single CoFeB film was annealed up to 450{\deg}C, followed by the deposition of a ~5 {\AA} Mo layer. PNR measurements in magnetic fields of 0.01 T and 0.75 T showed a significant increase in in-plane magnetization, confirming PMA formation. Thus, we demonstrate the first successful operation of a combined PLD and in-situ PNR system, showcasing its capabilities for characterizing single-layer CoFeB and multilayer CoFeB/Mo thin-film structures.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the FR4 Microwave Dielectric Properties at Cryogenic Temperature for Quantum-Chip-Interface PCBs Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ad-hoc interface PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards) are today the standard connection between cryogenic cabling and quantum chips. Besides low-loss and low-temperature-dependent-dielectric-permittivity materials, Flame Resistance n.4 (FR4) provides a low-cost solution for fabrication of cryogenic PCBs. Here, we report on an effective way to evaluate the dielectric performance of a FR4 laminate used as substrate for cryogenic microwave PCBs. We designed a coplanar waveguide {\lambda}/2 open-circuit series resonator, and we fabricated the PCB using a low-cost manufacturing process, obtaining in-plane geometric features with maximum variations of 50-100 um compared to the PCB design. Such a geometry allows to exploit the resonance peak of the resonator to measure the variation of the complex permittivity as a function of the temperature. The resonance peak frequency was used to estimate the real permittivity, achieving a sensitivity of -470 MHz and a resolution of 1.2x10^-2. Similarly, the resonance peak magnitude was involved in the extrapolation of the loss tangent, reaching a sensitivity of ~-337 dB and a resolution of 1.6x^10-4. For the FR4 laminate used, we estimated a 9 % reduction of the real permittivity and a 70 % reduction of the loss tangent in the temperature range from 300 to 4 K. The proposed approach can be immediately extended to the detection of cryogenic temperature-dependent dielectric performance of any kind of substrate.</description>

      <title>Demonstrator System Testing and Performance for the ATLAS ITk Pixel Detector for HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A demonstrator for each slice of the ATLAS pixel detector was built to replicate the real detector and provide early solutions for operating and maintaining its components. This system-level testing of the all-silicon Inner Tracker (ITk) pixel detector for the ATLAS experiment at CERN's HL LHC encompasses a wide array of system components, which is essential for managing the increased luminosity and radiation levels expected at HL LHC, thereby enhancing tracking performance. Utilizing advanced silicon sensor technologies, serial powering, and lightweight carbon fiber structures, the demonstrator and assembled components on the support structure will undergo several studies for verification and commissioning. Extensive tests on serial powering, monitoring, and data acquisition were conducted, ensuring the system's robustness and reliability for future high-energy physics experiments. Additionally, three different sub-components will be introduced for the novel ITk pixel detector, specifically designed for the outer barrel (OB), outer end caps (OEC), and inner system (IS) sections.</description>
