      <title>Gradient flows of $(K,N)$-convex functions with negative $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss $(K,N)$-convexity and gradient flows for $(K,N)$-convex functionals on metric spaces, in the case of real $K$ and negative $N$. In this generality, it is necessary to consider functionals unbounded from below and/or above, possibly attaining as values both the positive and the negative infinity. We prove several properties of gradient flows of $(K,N)$-convex functionals characterized by Evolution Variational Inequalities, including contractivity, regularity, and uniqueness.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative complex analytic geometry of a contractive quantum plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper we investigate the Banach space representations of Manin's quantum q-plane for |q| is not 1. The Arens-Michael envelope of the quantum plane is extended up to a Frechet algebra presheaf over its spectrum. The obtained ringed space represents the geometry of the quantum plane as a union of two irreducible components being copies of the complex plane equipped with the q-topology and the disk topology, respectively. It turns out that the Frechet algebra presheaf is commutative modulo its Jacobson radical, which is decomposed into a topological direct sum. The related noncommutative functional calculus problem and the spectral mapping property are solved in terms of the noncommutative Harte spectrum.</description>

      <title>Taylor spectrum of a Banach module over the quantum plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper we investigate the joint spectra of Banach space representations of the quantum q-plane called Banach q-modules. Based on the transversality relation from the topological homology of the trivial modules versus given a left Banach q-module, we introduce the joint (essential) spectra of a Banach q-module. In particular, we have the well defined Taylor joint spectrum of a Banach q-module. The noncommutative projection q-property is proved for the Taylor spectrum, which stands out the conventional projection property in the commutative case. It is provided the key examples of the Banach q-modules, which do not possesses nether forward nor backward projection properties.</description>

      <title>Inequalities and counterexamples for functional intrinsic volumes and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that analytic analogs of Brunn-Minkowski-type inequalities fail for functional intrinsic volumes on convex functions. This is demonstrated both through counterexamples and by connecting the problem to results of Colesanti, Hug, and Saor\'in G\'omez. By restricting to a smaller set of admissible functions, we then introduce a family of variational functionals and establish Wulff-type inequalities for these quantities. In addition, we derive inequalities for the corresponding family of mixed functionals, thereby generalizing an earlier Alexandrov-Fenchel-type inequality by Klartag and recovering a special case of a recent P\'olya-Szeg\H{o}-type inequality by Bianchi, Cianchi, and Gronchi.</description>

      <title>A Choquet theory of Lipschitz-free spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,d)$ be a complete metric space and let $\mathcal{F}(M)$ denote the Lipschitz-free space over $M$. We develop a ``Choquet theory of Lipshitz-free spaces'' that draws from the classical Choquet theory and the De Leeuw representation of elements of $\mathcal{F}(M)$ (and its bidual) by positive Radon measures on $\beta\widetilde{M}$, where $\widetilde{M}$ is the space of pairs $(x,y) \in M \times M$, $x \neq y$. We define a quasi-order $\preccurlyeq$ on the positive Radon measures on $\beta\widetilde{M}$ that is analogous to the classical Choquet order. Rather than in the classical case where the focus lies on maximal measures, we study the $\preccurlyeq$-minimal measures and show that they have a host of desirable properties. Among the applications of this theory is a solution (given elsewhere) to the extreme point problem for Lipschitz-free spaces.</description>

      <title>Stokes-Lagrange and Stokes-Dirac representations of $N$-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems for modelling and control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the port-Hamiltonian framework by introducing the concept of Stokes-Lagrange structure, which enables the implicit definition of a Hamiltonian over an $N$-dimensional domain and incorporates energy ports into the system. This new framework parallels the existing Dirac and Stokes-Dirac structures. We propose the Stokes-Lagrange structure as a specific case where the subspace is explicitly defined via differential operators that satisfy an integration by parts formula. By examining various examples through the lens of the Stokes-Lagrange structure, we demonstrate the existence of multiple equivalent system representations. These representations provide significant advantages for both numerical simulation and control design, offering additional tools for the modelling and control of port-Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>$C^*$-extreme contractive completely positive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to generalize a specific quantized convexity structure of the generalized state space of a $C^*$-algebra and to examine the associated extreme points. We introduce the notion of $P$-$C^*$-convex subsets, where $P$ is any positive operator on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. These subsets are defined with in the set of all completely positive (CP) maps from a unital $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ into the algebra $B(\mathcal{H})$ of bounded linear maps on $\mathcal{H}$. In particular, we focus on certain $P$-$C^*$-convex sets, denoted by $\mathrm{CP}^{(P)}(\mathcal{A},B(\mathcal{H}))$, and analyze their extreme points with respect to this new convexity structure. This generalizes the existing notions of $C^*$-convex subsets and $C^*$-extreme points of unital completely positive maps. We significantly extend many of the known results regarding the $C^*$-extreme points of unital completely positive maps into the context of $P$-$C^*$-convex sets we are considering. This includes abstract characterization and structure of $P$-$C^*$-extreme points. Further, using these studies, we completely characterize the $C^*$-extreme points of the $C^*$-convex set of all contractive completely positive maps from $\mathcal{A}$ into $B(\mathcal{H})$, where $\mathcal{H}$ is finite-dimensional. Additionally, we discuss the connection between $P$-$C^*$-extreme points and linear extreme points of these convex sets, as well as Krein-Milman type theorems.</description>

      <title>Greedy algorithms: a review and open problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Greedy algorithms are a fundamental category of algorithms in mathematics and computer science, characterized by their iterative, locally optimal decision-making approach, which aims to find global optima. In this review, we will discuss two greedy algorithms. First, we will talk about the so-called Relaxed Greedy Algorithm in the context of dictionaries in Hilbert spaces analyzing the optimality of definition of this algorithm and, next, we give a general overview of the Thresholding Greedy Algorithm and the Chebyshev Thresholding Greedy Algorithm with regard to bases in p-Banach spaces with $0 &lt; p \leq 1$. In both cases, we pose some questions for future research.</description>

      <title>Kuroda's theorem for $n$-tuples in semifinite von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a semifinite von Neumann algebra and let $E$ be a symmetric function space on $(0,\infty)$. Denote by $E(\mathcal{M})$ the non-commutative symmetric space of measurable operators affiliated with $\mathcal{M}$ and associated with $E.$ Suppose $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and $E\cap L_{\infty}\not\subset L_{n,1}$, where $L_{n,1}$ is the Lorentz function space with the fundamental function $\varphi(t)=t^{1/n}$. We prove that for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and every commuting self-adjoint $n$-tuple $(\alpha(j))_{j=1}^n,$ where $\alpha(j)$ is affiliated with $\mathcal{M}$ for each $1\leq j\leq n,$ there exists a commuting $n$-tuple $(\delta(j))_{j=1}^n$ of diagonal operators affiliated with $\mathcal{M}$ such that $\max\{\|\alpha(j)-\delta(j)\|_{E(\mathcal{M})},\|\alpha(j)-\delta(j)\|_{\infty}\}&lt;\varepsilon$ for each $1\le j\le n$. In the special case when $\mathcal{M}=B(H)$, our results yield the classical Kuroda and Bercovici-Voiculescu theorems.</description>

      <title>The modulating function method for state estimation and feedback of infinite-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate state feedback and observation for infinite-dimensional linear systems, including a variety of partial differential equations with boundary control and observation. We extend the modulating function approach to infinite-dimensional systems. This approach, simply put, involves reconstructing part of the state by convolving with null controls of the adjoint system. We show how this method aids in state reconstruction, and we also examine distributional solutions of the adjoint system, showing their ability to handle unbounded feedback operators. This enables us to use feedback from spatial point evaluations in partial differential equations.</description>
