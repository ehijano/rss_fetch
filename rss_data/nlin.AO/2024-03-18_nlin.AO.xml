      <title>Implementation of Parallel Process Execution in the Next Generation System Analysis Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The United States DOE Office of Integrated Waste Management program is planning for the transportation, storage, and eventual disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste from nuclear power plant sites across the United States. The Next Generation System Analysis Model is an agent-based simulation toolkit that is used for system level simulation and analysis of the SNF inventory in the United States. This tool was developed as part of a collaborative effort between Argonne National Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The analyst using NGSAM has the ability to define several factors like the number of storage facilities, capacity at each facility, transportation schedules, shipment rates, and other conditions. The primary purpose of NGSAM is to provide the system analyst with the tools to model the integrated waste management system and gain insights on waste management alternatives, impact of storage choices, generating cost estimates, and developing an integrated approach with emphasis on flexibility.</description>

      <title>Preserving Bifurcations through Moment Closures</title>

Abstract: Moment systems arise in a wide range of contexts and applications, e.g. in network modeling of complex systems. Since moment systems consist of a high or even infinite number of coupled equations, an indispensable step in obtaining a low-dimensional representation that is amenable to further analysis is, in many cases, to select a moment closure. A moment closure consists of a set of approximations that express certain higher-order moments in terms of lower-order ones, so that applying those leads to a closed system of equations for only the lower-order moments. Closures are frequently found drawing on intuition and heuristics to come up with quantitatively good approximations. In contrast to that, we propose an alternative approach where we instead focus on closures giving rise to certain qualitative features, such as bifurcations. Importantly, this fundamental change of perspective provides one with the possibility of classifying moment closures rigorously in regard to these features. This makes the design and selection of closures more algorithmic, precise, and reliable. In this work, we carefully study the moment systems that arise in the mean-field descriptions of two widely known network dynamical systems, the SIS epidemic and the adaptive voter model. We derive conditions that any moment closure has to satisfy so that the corresponding closed systems exhibit the transcritical bifurcation that one expects in these systems coming from the stochastic particle model.</description>

      <title>Dynamical complexity in micro-scale disk-wind systems</title>

Abstract: Powerful winds at accretion-disk scales have been observed in the past 20 years in many AGN. These are the so-called ultrafast outflows (UFOs). Outflows are intimately related to mass accretion through the conservation of angular momentum, and they are therefore a key ingredient of most accretion disk models around black holes (BHs). Nuclear winds and outflows can also provide the feedback that regulates the joint BH and galaxy growth. We reconsidered UFO observations in the framework of disk-wind scenarios, both magnetohydrodynamic disk winds and radiatively driven winds. We studied the statistical properties of observed UFOs from the literature and derived the distribution functions of the ratio $\bar \omega$ of the mass-outflow and -inflow rates and the ratio $\lambda_w$ of the mass-outflow and the Eddington accretion rates. We studied the links between $\bar \omega$ and $\lambda_w$ and $\lambda={L_{bol}}/{L_{Edd}}$. We derived the typical wind-activity history in our sources by assuming that it can be statistically described by population functions. We find that the distribution functions of $\bar \omega$ and $\lambda_w$ can be described as power laws above some thresholds, suggesting that there may be many wind subevents for each major wind event in each AGN activity cycle, which is a fractal behavior. We then introduced a cellular automaton to investigate how the dynamical properties of an idealized disk-wind system change following the introduction of feedback rules. We find that without feedback, the system is overcritical. Conversely, when feedback is present, regardless of whether it is magnetic or radiation driven, the system can be driven toward a self-organized critical state.Our results corroborate the hypothesis that AGN feedback is a necessary key ingredient in disk-wind systems, and following this, in shaping the coevolution of galaxies and supermassive BHs.</description>
