      <title>Quantum Mechanics of an Abrikosov Vortex in Nanofabricated Pinning Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A superconducting device is proposed for experimentally investigating whether an Abrikosov vortex can be modeled as a quantum mechanical quasiparticle. The design process of a type-II superconducting device capable of reliably pinning a single Abrikosov vortex is presented, creating a particle-in-a-box-like system. The proposed device consists of a cylindrically symmetric Nb film, 30 nm in diameter and 5 nm thick, with a 14 nm diameter artificial pinning center at its center. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations indicate robust single-vortex pinning under an applied field of 6 T. The presumed quantized energy levels and associated quantum wavefunctions of the vortex quasiparticle are obtained by numerically solving the two-dimensional time-independent Schr\"odinger equation for this system. It is shown that distinguishing the ground and first excited states is experimentally feasible. Beyond fundamental physics studies, the application of the proposed device in cryogenic memory technology and quantum computing warrant further exploration.</description>

      <title>Particle-hole symmetry in the pseudogap phase of moderately underdoped cuprate high temperature superconductors evidenced from joint density of states analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional superconductors, the energy scale associated with the superfluid stiffness is much larger compared to the pairing energy and hence, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is entirely dictated by the superconducting (SC) energy gap. The phase rigidity of the SC condensate in unconventional superconductors, on the other hand, can be low enough to enable destruction of superconductivity via phase incoherence and persistence of an energy gap even at the absence of macroscopic superconductivity above Tc. This is considered a possible mechanism of the pseudogap (PG) state of cuprate high temperature superconductors (HTSCs). We have investigated the electronic energy ({\omega}) and momentum-separation vector (q) dependence of the joint density of states (JDOS), derived from the autocorrelated Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) data, from moderately underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta}HTSC samples at temperatures below and above Tc. We found that q-space structure of the constant {\omega} JDOS intensity maps and the dispersions of the JDOS peaks are essentially the same both below and above Tc. Furthermore, the dispersions of the JDOS peaks above Tc are particle-hole symmetric. These observations evince similarity between the nature of the energy gap below and above Tc, which supports preformed pairing scenario for the PG state at least in the moderately underdoped regime.</description>

      <title>Revealing superconducting gap in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-$\delta$ by Andreev reflection spectroscopy under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of compressed superconductivity at 80~K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-$\delta$ has brought nickelates into the family of unconventional high-temperature superconductors. However, due to the challenges of directly probing the superconducting pairing mechanism under high pressure, the pairing symmetry and gap structures of nickelate superconductors remain under intense debate. In this work, we successfully determine the microscopic information on the superconducting gap structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-$\delta$ samples subjected to pressures exceeding 20~GPa, by constructing different conductance junctions within diamond anvil cells. By analyzing the temperature-dependent differential conductance spectra within the Blonder--Tinkham--Klapwijk (BTK) model, we have determined the superconducting energy gap at high pressure. The differential conductance curves reveal a two-gap structure with $\Delta_{1} = 23~\mathrm{meV}$ and $\Delta_{2} = 6~\mathrm{meV}$, while the BTK fitting is consistent with an $s$-like, two-gap spectrum. The gap ratio $2\Delta_{s1}(0) / k_{\mathrm{B}}T_{c}$ is found to be 7.61, belonging to a family of strongly coupled superconductors. Our findings provide valuable insights into the superconducting gap structures of the pressure-induced superconducting nickelates.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of d-Wave Superconducting Gap Symmetry in Pressurized La3Ni2O7-delta Single Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in pressure-stabilized bulk La3Ni2O7-delta, with a critical temperature (Tc) exceeding 77 K, has opened a new frontier in high-temperature superconductivity research beyond cuprates. Yet, the superconducting gap amplitude and symmetry, the key parameters to characterize a superconductor, remain elusive due to the overwhelming challenges of gap studies under high pressure. Here, we introduce in situ directional point-contact spectroscopy conducted under truly hydrostatic pressure, enabling the direct mapping of the superconducting gap in pressurized La3Ni2O7-delta single crystals. Depending on the junction orientation, differential conductance (dI/dV) spectra exhibit distinct V-shaped quasiparticle features and a sharp zero-bias peak, indicating a predominant d-wave-like pairing symmetry. Measurement of the c-axis gap amplitude Delta yields a gap-to-Tc ratio of 2Delta/kBTc = 4.2(5), positioning La3Ni2O7-delta firmly among unconventional, nodal high-Tc superconductors. These findings set stringent constraints on theoretical models for nickelate superconductors and establish a robust spectroscopic approach for understanding superconductors under extreme pressures.</description>

      <title>Systematic Schrieffer-Wolff-transformation approach to Josephson junctions: quasiparticle effects and Josephson harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation (SWT) to analyze Josephson junctions between superconducting leads described by the charge-conserving BCS theory. Starting from the single-electron tunneling terms, we directly recover the conventional effective Hamiltonian, $-E_J\cos\hat{\varphi}$, with an operator-valued phase bias $\hat{\varphi}$. The SWT approach has the advantage that it can be systematically extended to more complex scenarios. We show that if a Bogoliubov quasiparticle is present its motion couples to that of Cooper pairs, introducing correlated dynamics that reshape the energy spectrum of the junction. Furthermore, higher-order terms in the SWT naturally describe Josephson harmonics, whose amplitudes are directly related to the microscopic properties of the superconducting leads and the junction. We derive expressions that could facilitate tuning the ratio between the different harmonics in a controlled way.</description>

      <title>Ginzburg-Landau Formalism in Curved Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent researches on tilted Dirac cone materials have unveiled an astonishing property, the metric of the spacetime can be altered in these materials by applying a perpendicular electric field. This phenomenon is observed near the Fermi velocity, which is significantly lower than the speed of light. According to this property, we derive the Ginzburg-Landau action from the microscopic Hamiltonian of the BCS theory for the tilted Dirac cone materials. This derivation is performed near the critical point within the framework of curved spacetime. The novelty of the present work lies in deriving a general Ginzburg-Landau action that depends on spacetime curvature, where the curvature is tuned by an external electric field. Furthermore, this finding enables us to apply the Ginzburg-Landau theory at high temperatures by changing the spacetime metric, potentially offering insights into achieving high-temperature superconductivity in these materials.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Gauge Theory of Spin Triplet Superconductivity and Spin Triplet Magnon Spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an SU(2)xU(1) Ginzburg-Landau theory of the spin triplet ferromagnetic superconductivity which could also describe the physics of the spin triplet magnon spintronics, where the SU(2) gauge interaction of the magnon plays an important role. The theory is made of the massive photon, massless neutral magnon, massive non-Abelian magnon, and the Higgs scalar field which represents the density of the Copper pair. It has the following characteristic features, the long range magnetic interaction mediated by the massless magnon, two types of conserved supercurrents (the ordinary electromagnetic current and the spin current made of the magnons) which could explain the conversion between the charge and spin currents, and the non-Abelian Meissner effect generated by the spin current. Moreover, it has non-Abelian topological objects, the quantized non-Abelian magnonic vortex and non-Abelian magnonic monopole, as well as the ordinary Abrikosov vortex. The theory is characterized by three scales. In addition to the correlation length fixed by the mass of the Higgs field it has two different mass scales, the one fixed by the mass of the photon and the other fixed by the mass of the off-diagonal magnon. We compare the theory with the non-Abelian gauge theory of the spin doublet ferromagnetic superconductivity which could also be interpreted as an effective theory of the electron spintronics. We discuss the physical implications of the non-Abelian gauge theories in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Low-energy spin waves as potential driving force for superconductivity in electron-doped cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to fully utilize the technological potential of unconventional superconductors, an enhanced understanding of the superconducting mechanism is necessary. In the best performing superconductors, the cuprates, superconductivity is intimately linked with magnetism, although the details of this remain elusive. In search of clarity in the magnetism-superconductivity relationship, we focus on the electron-doped cuprate Nd1.85Ce0.15CuO(4-delta) (NCCO). NCCO has an antiferromagnetic ground state when synthesized, and only becomes superconducting after a reductive annealing process. This makes NCCO an ideal template to study how the magnetism differs in the superconducting and non-superconducting state, while keeping the material template as constant as possible. Using neutron spectroscopy, we reveal that the as-grown crystal exhibits a large energy gap in the magnetic fluctuation spectrum. Upon annealing, defects that are introduced by the commonly employed synthesis method, are removed and the gap is significantly reduced. While the energy gap in the annealed sample is an effect of superconductivity, we argue that the gap in the as-grown sample is caused by the absence of long-wavelength spin waves. The defects in as-grown NCCO thus play the dual role of suppressing both superconductivity and low-energy spin waves, highlighting the connection between these two phenomena.</description>

      <title>Mixed Triplet-Singlet Order Parameter in Decoupled Superconducting 1H Monolayers of Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence of unconventional superconductivity, where the order parameter deviates from simple isotropic s-wave pairing, is a central puzzle in condensed matter physics. Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), though generally regarded as conventional superconductors, display signatures of this unusual behavior and thus provide a particularly intriguing platform to explore how exotic states arise. Here we investigate the misfit compound (SnS)$_{1.15}$(TaS$_2$), a heterostructure composed of alternating SnS and 1H-TaS$_2$ layers. Using transport, photoemission, and scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the SnS layers effectively decouple the TaS$_2$ into electronically isolated 1H sheets. In this limit, the tunneling density of states reveals a clear two-gap superconducting spectrum with T$_c \sim$ 3.1 K. A theoretical model based on lack of inversion symmetry and finite-range attraction reproduces the observed multi-gap structure as a mixed singlet-triplet state. These results establish misfit compounds as a powerful platform for studying unconventional superconductivity in isolated 1H layers and for realizing multiple uncoupled superconductors within a single crystal.</description>

      <title>Putting a new spin on the incommensurate Kekul\'e spiral: from spin-valley locking and collective modes to fermiology and implications for superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the global phase diagram of magic-angle twisted bilayer and [symmetric] trilayer graphene (MA-TBG/TSTG) in light of recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements on these materials. These experiments both confirmed the importance of strain in stabilizing the predicted incommensurate Kekul\'{e} spiral (IKS) order near filling $|\nu|=2$ of the weakly dispersive central bands in both systems, and suggested a key role for electron-phonon couplings and short-range Coulomb interactions in selecting between various competing orders at low strain in MA-TBG. Here, we show that such interactions $\textit{also}$ play a crucial role in selecting the spin structure of the strain-stabilized IKS state. This in turn influences the visibility of the IKS order in STM in a manner that allows us to infer their relative importance. We use this insight in conjunction with various other pieces of experimental data to build a more complete picture of the phase diagram, focusing on the spectrum of low-lying collective modes and the nature of the doped Fermi surfaces. We explore the broad phenomenological implications of these results for superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) to Simulate Large Atomistic Systems for Fidelity Improvement of Superconducting Qubits and Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials engineering using atomistic modeling is an essential tool for the development of qubits and quantum sensors. Traditional density-functional theory (DFT) does however not adequately capture the complete physics involved, including key aspects and dynamics of superconductivity, surface states, etc. There are also significant challenges regarding the system sizes that can be simulated, not least for thermal properties which are key in quantum-computing applications. The QuantumATK tool combines DFT, based on LCAO basis sets, with non-equilibrium Green's functions, to compute the characteristics of interfaces between superconductors and insulators, as well as the surface states of topological insulators. Additionally, the software leverages machine-learned force-fields to simulate thermal properties and to generate realistic amorphous geometries in large-scale systems. Finally, the description of superconducting qubits and sensors as two-level systems modeled with a double-well potential requires many-body physics, and this paper demonstrates how electron-electron interaction can be added to the single-particle energy levels from an atomistic tight-binding model to describe a realistic double-quantum dot system.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Transport Theory of Cooper-pair fluctuations in a disordered 2D Electron System with Spin-Orbit Scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02117v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A microscopic theory of Cooper-pair fluctuations (CPFs) in a disordered 2D electron system with spin-orbit scatterings under parallel magnetic field is presented in light of the observation, at low temperatures, of large magnetoresistance (MR) above a crossover field to superconductivity in electron-doped SrTiO$_{3}$/LaAlO$_{3}$ interfaces. It is found that in the zero temperature limit the conventional (diagrammatic) microscopic theory of superconducting (SC) fluctuations yields vanishing fluctuation conductivity just above the superconducting transition. However, further analysis of the results of the microscopic theory reveals that due to the diminishing stiffness of the fluctuation modes in a broad range of momentum space, the density of the CPFs, defined consistently with the time dependent Ginzburg-Landau approach, diverges in the zero temperature limit at any finite magnetic field. This field-induced divergence of the CPFs density, within restricted mesoscopic regions in real space, which is relieved by quantum tunneling and pair breaking out of their mesoscopic enclaves, indicates that the grand canonical ensemble underlying the microscopic theory is unsubstantiated. A dynamical equilibrium between the condensed CPFs in real-space mesoscopic puddles and the rarefying system of unpaired electrons controls the residual normal-state conductivity at magnetic fields above the SC transition. It has been, therefore, concluded that under the diminishing fluctuation paraconductivity upon increasing magnetic field the density of the normal-state electrons is also suppressed (due to charge transfer to the localized CPFs) and so, resulting from electron localization, the overall MR is strongly enhanced.</description>

      <title>RECP mechanism is responsible for the phase diagram of high-T_{C} cuprates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our novel strong pairing mechanism for high-Tc cuprates qualitatively explains the whole phase diagram of both electron and hole-doped cuprates, notably the linearly decreasing T* at the pseudogap, presence of spin gap, the Tc=T* at the optimum doping as well as the rest of over-doped regions of superconducting dome, presence of parallel superconducting stripes in CuO plane (spin-polarized and spin-unpolarized channels), and linear-T behavior of strange-metal phase above the overdoped regions of superconducting dome. It also explains experimental spin textures of cuprates. This can be considered a drastic revision of Anderson's resonating valence bonds (RVB) theory. We refer to our new model as a resonating entanglement-confinement pair (RECP) theory. Based on RECP theory, we are able to give a conceptual, phenomenological, qualitative, and comprehensive explanation of the whole phase diagram, thus giving a universal feature of RECP mechanism as responsible for the whole phase diagram of high-Tc cuprates</description>

Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE)- manifested as directional, dissipationless supercurrents - is pivotal for realizing energy-efficient superconducting logic and memory technologies. Achieving high-efficiency SDE without external magnetic fields, however, remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we report a strongly enhanced, field-free SDE in Pt/Co/Nb heterostructures, enabled by the interplay of engineered geometric asymmetry and stray fields from a perpendicularly magnetized Co layer. This configuration promotes directional vortex entry and spatially selective pinning, yielding diode efficiencies that exceed all previously reported field-free values. Temperature- and field-dependent transport measurements, supported by micromagnetic simulations, reveal that the enhanced nonreciprocity stems from three cooperative mechanisms: asymmetric vortex entry, localized magnetic pinning, and Lorentz-force imbalance. These findings establish a scalable, CMOS-compatible platform for high-performance superconducting rectifiers, offering new opportunities for cryogenic spintronics and quantum electronics.</description>
