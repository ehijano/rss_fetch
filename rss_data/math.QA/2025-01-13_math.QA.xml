      <title>Quantum Berezinian for the Twisted Super Yangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by an open problem proposed in Molev's book \cite[Section 2.16, Example 16]{Mo07}, we investigate the quantum Berezinian $\mathfrak{B}^{tw}(u)$ associated with the twisted super Yangian, which is a coideal sub-superalgebra of the super Yangian of the general linear Lie superalgebra. We provide an explicit formulation of $\mathfrak{B}^{tw}(u)$, and we also construct the center of the twisted super Yangian. This construction enables us to define the special twisted super Yangian, which is isomorphic to the quotient of the twisted super Yangian by its center. Moreover, we demonstrate the quantum Sylvester theorem for both the generator matrix and the quantum Berezinian.</description>

      <title>Skein Construction of Balanced Tensor Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of tensor categories has found applications across various fields, including representation theory, quantum field theory (conformal in 2 dimensions, and topological in 3 and 4 dimensions), quantum invariants of low-dimensional objects, topological phases of matter, and topological quantum computation. In essence, it is a categorification of the classical theory of algebras and modules. In this analogy, the Deligne tensor product $\boxtimes$ is to the linear tensor $\otimes_{\mathbb{C}}$ as the balanced tensor product $\boxtimes_C$ is to the tensor over algebra $\otimes_A$, where $\mathbb{C}$ is a field, $A$ is a $\mathbb{C}$-algebra, and $C$ is a tensor category.
  Before this work, several algebraic constructions for balanced tensor products were known, including categories of modules, internal Hom spaces, and generalized categorical centers. In this paper, we introduce a topological construction based on skein theory that offers a better mix of algebra and topology. This approach not only works for products of multiple module categories, but also provides the missing key to proving that the Turaev-Viro state sum model naturally arises from the 3-functor in the classification of fully extended field theories. Building on this result, we establish this long-anticipated proof in an upcoming work.</description>

      <title>Equivalence Relations on Vertex Operator Algebras, II: Witt Equivalence and Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When can two strongly rational vertex operator algebras or 1+1d rational conformal field theories (RCFTs) be related by topological manipulations? For vertex operator algebras, the term "topological manipulations" refers to operations like passing to a conformal extension or restricting to a conformal subalgebra; for RCFTs, topological manipulations include operations like gauging (or orbifolding) a finite subpart of a generalized global symmetry or interpolating to a new theory via a topological line interface of finite quantum dimension.
  Inspired by results in the theory of even lattices and tensor categories, we say that two strongly rational vertex operator algebras are Witt equivalent if their central charges agree and if their modular tensor categories are Witt equivalent. Two RCFTs are said to be Witt equivalent if their central charges agree and if their associated 2+1d topological field theories can be separated by a topological surface. We argue that Witt equivalence is necessary for two theories to be related by topological manipulations. We conjecture that it is also sufficient, and give proofs in various special cases.
  We relate this circle of ideas to the problem of classifying RCFTs, and to lore concerning deformation classes of quantum field theories. We use the notion of Witt equivalence to argue, assuming the conjectural classification of unitary, $c=1$ RCFTs, that all of the finite symmetries of the $SU(2)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model are invertible. We also sketch a "quantum Galois theory" for chiral CFTs, which generalizes prior mathematical literature by incorporating non-invertible symmetries; we illustrate this non-invertible Galois theory in the context of the monster CFT, for which we produce two Fibonacci lines. Finally, we discuss $p$-neighborhood of vertex operator algebras, which is a special topological manipulation related to $\mathbb{Z}_p$-orbifolding.</description>
