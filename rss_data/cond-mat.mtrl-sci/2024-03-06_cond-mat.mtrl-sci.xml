      <title>Tuning charge density wave of kagome metal ScV6Sn6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compounds with a kagome lattice exhibit intriguing properties and the charge density wave (CDW) adds an additional layer of interest to research on them. In this study, we investigate the temperature and magnetic field dependent electrical properties under a chemical substitution and hydrostatic pressure of ScV6Sn6, a non-magnetic charge density wave (CDW) compound. Substituting 5 % Cr at the V site or applying 1.5 GPa of pressure shifts the CDW to 50 K from 92 K. This shift is attributed to the movement of the imaginary phonon band, as revealed by the phonon dispersion relation. The longitudinal and Hall resistivities respond differently under these stimuli. The magnetoresistance (MR) maintains its quasilinear behavior under pressure, but it becomes quadratic after Cr substitution. The anomalous Hall-like behavior of the parent compound persists up to the respective CDW transition under pressure, after which it sharply declines. In contrast, the longitudinal and Hall resistivities of Cr substituted compounds follow a two-band model and originates from the multi carrier effect. These results clearly highlight the role of phonon contributions in the CDW transition and call for further investigation into the origin of the anomalous Hall-like behavior in the parent compound.</description>

      <title>Direct visualization of defect-controlled diffusion in van der Waals gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion processes govern fundamental phenomena such as phase transformations, doping, and intercalation in van der Waals (vdW) bonded materials. Here, we quantify the diffusion dynamics of W atoms by visualizing the motion of individual atoms at three different vdW interfaces, BN/vacuum, BN/BN, and BN/WSe2, using scanning transmission electron microscopy movies. Supported by density functional theory calculations, we infer that in all cases diffusion is governed by intermittent trapping at electron beam-generated defect sites. This leads to diffusion properties that depend strongly on the number of defects. These results suggest that diffusion and intercalation processes in vdW materials are highly tunable and sensitive to crystal quality. Furthermore, the demonstration of atomic resolution imaging of materials inside vdW heterostructures offers possibilities for direct visualization of diffusion and atomic interactions, as well as for experiments exploring atomic structures, their in-situ modification, and electrical property measurement.</description>

      <title>Layered-to-Spinel Phase Transformation in Li$_{0.5}$NiO$_2$ from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase transition layered Li$_{0.5}$NiO$_2$ to spinel Li(NiO$_2$)$_2$ is a potential degradation pathway in LiNiO$_2$-based lithium-ion battery cathodes. We investigated the mechanism of this phase transformation from first principles. Consistent with experimental observations reported in the literature, our results indicate a high energy barrier for the transformation due to high defect-formation energies, a complex charge-transfer mechanism, and electronic frustration. Our results suggest that partially inverse spinel phases are unlikely to form for Li$_{0.5}$NiO$_2$, a qualitative difference from the chemically similar Li$_{0.5}$MnO$_2$, in which the transformation occurs at room temperature. We show that Ni and Li atoms migrate concertedly towards their respective spinel sites for the layered-to-spinel transformation to occur. We investigated the charge ordering in layered phases along the LiNiO$_2$-NiO$_2$ composition line, finding a pronounced impact of the symmetry and space group on the layered-to-spinel transition in Li$_{0.5}$NiO$_2$. Finally, we evaluated the relative stability of different spinel space groups, finding that previously reported experimental observations are consistent with a temperature-averaged structure rather than the 0 Kelvin ground-state structure of Li(NiO$_2$)$_2$ spinel.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Magnetocaloric Material Discovery: A Machine Learning Approach Using an Autogenerated Database by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic cooling based on the magnetocaloric effect is a promising solid-state refrigeration technology for a wide range of applications in different temperature ranges. Previous studies have mostly focused on near room temperature (300 K) and cryogenic temperature (&lt; 10 K) ranges, while important applications such as hydrogen liquefaction call for efficient magnetic refrigerants for the intermediate temperature 10K to 100 K. For efficient use in this range, new magnetocaloric materials with matching Curie temperatures need to be discovered, while conventional experimental approaches are typically time-consuming and expensive. Here, we report a computational material discovery pipeline based on a materials database containing more than 6000 entries auto-generated by extracting reported material properties from literature using a large language model. We then use this database to train a machine learning model that can efficiently predict magnetocaloric properties of materials based on their chemical composition. We further verify the magnetocaloric properties of predicted compounds using ab initio atomistic spin dynamics simulations to close the loop for computational material discovery. Using this approach, we identify 11 new promising magnetocaloric materials for the target temperature range. Our work demonstrates the potential of combining large language models, machine learning, and ab initio simulations to efficiently discover new functional materials.</description>

      <title>Revealing the EuCd_{2}As_{2} Semiconducting Band Gap via n-type La-Doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EuCd_{2}As_{2} has attracted considerable interest as one of the few magnetic Weyl semimetal candidate materials, although recently there have been emerging reports that claim it to have a semiconducting electronic structure. To resolve this debate, we established the growth of n-type EuCd_{2}As_{2} crystals, to directly visualize the nature of the conduction band using angle resolve photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We show that La-doping leads to n-type transport signatures in both the thermopower and Hall effect measurements, in crystals with doping levels at 2 - 6 x 10^{17} e^{-} cm^{-3}. Both p-type and n-type doped samples exhibit antiferromagnetic ordering at 9 K. ARPES experiments at 6 K clearly show the presence of the conduction band minimum at 0.8 eV above the valence band maximum, which is further corroborated by the observation of a 0.71 - 0.72 eV band gap in room temperature diffuse reflectance absorbance measurements. Together these findings unambiguously show that EuCd_{2}As_{2} is indeed a semiconductor with a substantial band gap and not a topological semimetal.</description>

      <title>Globally-stable and metastable crystal structure enumeration using polynomial machine learning potentials in elemental As, Bi, Ga, In, La, P, Sb, Sn, and Te</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become essential tools for accelerating accurate large-scale atomistic simulations and crystal structure predictions. The polynomial MLPs, which are described by polynomial rotational invariants, have been systematically developed for many elemental and alloy systems. This study presents an efficient procedure for enumerating global minimum and metastable structures using robust polynomial MLPs. To develop MLPs that can handle the structure enumeration, performing random structure searches and updating MLPs are iteratively repeated. The current procedure is systematically applied to the elemental systems of As, Bi, Ga, In, La, P, Sb, Sn, and Te, with many local minimum structures competing with the global minimum structure in terms of energy. This procedure will significantly accelerate global structure searches and expand their search space.</description>

      <title>Review of Nanolayered Post-transition Metal Monochalcogenides: Synthesis, Properties, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanolayered post-transition metal monochalcogenides (PTMMCs) stand out as promising advanced two-dimensional (2D) materials. Beyond inheriting the general advantages associated with traditional 2D materials, they exhibit unique properties, including a wide bandgap range covering the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared spectral ranges, thickness-dependent bandgap behaviors, good nonlinear optical performance, high thermoelectric coefficients, and ferroelectricity. Consequently, these materials hold significant potential in diverse applications such as photodetectors, field effect transistors, thermoelectrics, ferroelectrics, photovoltaics, and electrochemical devices, especially in the manufacturing of nanoscale devices. However, there is still a lack of systematic understanding of the PTMMC family. This study provides a broad overview of the crystal structures, bandgap structures, synthesis methods, physical properties, and state-of-the-art applications of PTMMC materials with a motif of X-M-M-X (M=Ga, In, Ge, Sn; X=S, Se, Te). An outlook for the development trends is emphasized at the end, underscoring the critical importance of this work to the future exploration of nanolayered PTMMCs.</description>

      <title>Orbital torque switching in perpendicularly magnetized materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbital Hall effect in light materials has attracted considerable attention for developing novel orbitronic devices. Here we investigate the orbital torque efficiency and demonstrate the switching of the perpendicularly magnetized materials through the orbital Hall material (OHM), i.e., Zirconium (Zr). The orbital torque efficiency of approximately 0.78 is achieved in the Zr OHM with the perpendicularly magnetized [Co/Pt]3 sample, which significantly surpasses that of the perpendicularly magnetized CoFeB/Gd/CoFeB sample (approximately 0.04). Such notable difference is attributed to the different spin-orbit correlation strength between the [Co/Pt]3 sample and the CoFeB/Gd/CoFeB sample, which has been confirmed through the theoretical calculations. Furthermore, the full magnetization switching of the [Co/Pt]3 sample with a switching current density of approximately 2.6x106 A/cm2 has been realized through Zr, which even outperforms that of the W spin Hall material. Our finding provides a guideline to understand orbital torque efficiency and paves the way to develop energy-efficient orbitronic devices.</description>

      <title>Magnetothermopower of nodal line semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for materials with large thermopower is of great practical interest. Dirac and Weyl semimetals have recently proven to exhibit superior thermoelectric properties, particularly when subjected to a quantizing magnetic field. Here we consider whether a similar enhancement arises in nodal line semimetals, for which the conduction and valence band meet at a line or ring in momentum space. We compute the Seebeck and Nernst coefficients for arbitrary temperature and magnetic field and we find a wealth of different scaling regimes. Most strikingly, when a sufficiently strong magnetic field is applied along the direction of the nodal line, the large degeneracy of states leads to a large, linear-in-$B$ thermopower that is temperature-independent even at low temperatures. Our results suggest that nodal line semimetals may offer significant opportunity for efficient, low-temperature thermoelectrics.</description>

      <title>Discovering Melting Temperature Prediction Models of Inorganic Solids by Combining Supervised and Unsupervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The melting temperature is important for materials design because of its relationship with thermal stability, synthesis, and processing conditions. Current empirical and computational melting point estimation techniques are limited in scope, computational feasibility, or interpretability. We report the development of a machine learning methodology for predicting melting temperatures of binary ionic solid materials. We evaluated different machine-learning models trained on a data set of the melting points of 476 non-metallic crystalline binary compounds, using materials embeddings constructed from elemental properties and density-functional theory calculations as model inputs. A direct supervised-learning approach yields a mean absolute error of around 180~K but suffers from low interpretability. We find that the fidelity of predictions can further be improved by introducing an additional unsupervised-learning step that first classifies the materials before the melting-point regression. Not only does this two-step model exhibit improved accuracy, but the approach also provides a level of interpretability with insights into feature importance and different types of melting that depend on the specific atomic bonding inside a material. Motivated by this finding, we used a symbolic learning approach to find interpretable physical models for the melting temperature, which recovered the best-performing features from both prior models and provided additional interpretability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study one- and two-dimensional periodic tight-binding models under the presence of a potential that grows to infinity in one direction, hence preventing the particles to escape in this direction (the soft wall). We prove that a spectral flow appears in these corresponding edge models, as the wall is shifted. We identity this flow as a number of Bloch bands, and provide a lower bound for the number of edge states appearing in such models.</description>

      <title>On the onset of slip at adhesive elastic interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition from static to dynamic friction when an elastic body is slid over another is now known to result from the motion of interface rupture fronts. These fronts may be either crack-like or pulse-like, with the latter involving reattachment in the wake of the front. How and why these fronts occur remains a subject of active theoretical and experimental investigation, given its wide ranging implications for a range of problems in tribology. In this work, we investigate this question using an elastic lattice-network representation; bulk and interface bonds are simulated to deform and, in the latter case, break and reform dynamically in response to an applied remote displacement. We find that, contrary to the oft-cited rigid body scenario with Coulomb-type friction laws, the type of rupture front observed depends intimately on the location of the applied boundary condition. Depending on whether the sliding solid is pulled, pushed or sheared -- all equivalent applications in the rigid case -- distinct interface rupture modes can occur. We quantify these rupture modes, evaluate the interface stresses that lead to their formation, and and study their subsequent propagation dynamics. A strong analogy between the sliding friction problem and mode II fracture emerges from our results, with attendant wave speeds ranging from slow to Rayleigh. We discuss how these fronts mediate interface motion and implications for the general transition mechanism from static to dynamic friction.</description>

      <title>Strain tunable electronic ground states in two-dimensional iridate thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum phases of matter such as superconducting, ferromagnetic and Wigner crystal states are often driven by the two-dimensionality (2D) of correlated systems. Meanwhile, spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is a fundamental element leading to nontrivial topology which gives rise to quantum phenomena such as the large anomalous Hall effect and nontrivial superconductivity. However, the search for controllable platforms with both 2D and SOC has been relatively overlooked so far. Here, we control and study the electronic ground states of iridate ultrathin films having both 2D and SOC by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) calculations. The metallicity of SrIrO$_3$ ultrathin films is controlled down to a monolayer by dimensional and strain manipulation. Our results suggest that the iridate ultrathin films can be a controllable 2D SOC platform exhibiting a variety of phenomena for future functional devices.</description>

      <title>Shear-enhanced Liquid Crystal Spinning of Conjugated Polymer Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conjugated polymer fibers can be used to manufacture various soft fibrous optoelectronic devices, significantly advancing wearable devices and smart textiles. Recently, conjugated polymer-based fibrous electronic devices have been widely used in energy conversion, electrochemical sensing, and human-machine interaction. However, the insufficient mechanical properties of conjugated polymer fibers, the difficulty in solution processing semiconductors with rigid main chains, and the challenges in large-scale continuous production have limited their further development in the wearable field. We regulated the pi - pi stacking interactions in conjugated polymer molecules below their critical liquid crystal concentration by applying fluid shear stress. We implemented secondary orientation, leading to the continuous fabrication of anisotropic semiconductor fibers. This strategy enables conjugated polymers with rigid backbones to synergistically enhance the mechanical and semiconductor properties of fibers through liquid crystal spinning. Furthermore, conjugated polymer fibers, exhibiting excellent electrochemical performance and high mechanical strength (600 MPa) that essentially meet the requirements for industrialized preparation, maintain stability under extreme temperatures, radiation, and chemical reagents. Lastly, we have demonstrated logic circuits using semiconductor fiber organic electrochemical transistors, showcasing its application potential in the field of wearable fabric-style logic processing. These findings confirm the importance of the liquid crystalline state and solution control in optimizing the performance of conjugated polymer fibers, thus paving the way for developing a new generation of soft fiber semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>Stretch-independent magnetization in incompressible magnetorheological elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we perform a critical examination of the phenomenon where the magnetization is stretch-independent in incompressible hard-magnetic magnetorheological elastomers (h-MREs), as observed in several recent experimental and numerical investigations. We demonstrate that the fully dissipative model proposed by Mukherjee et al. (2021) may be reduced, under physically consistent assumptions, to that of Yan et al. (2023), but not that of Zhao et al. (2019). In cases where the h-MRE solid undergoes non-negligible stretching, the model of Zhao et al. (2019) provides predictions that are in disagreement with experimental observations, given that, by construction, that model produces a magnetization response that is not stretch-independent. By contrast, the other two models are able to describe this important feature present in h-MREs, as well as in incompressible magnetically soft s-MRES. Note that in cases where stretching is negligible, such as for inextensible slender structures under bending deformation, the Zhao et al. (2019) model provides accurate predictions despite its underlying assumptions. Additionally, our analysis reveals two key points about the magnetization vector in the context of the more general, fully dissipative model. First, the magnetization can be related to an internal variable in that theory. However, it cannot be formally used as an internal variable except in the special case of an ideal magnet, and, as such, it is subject to constitutive assumptions. Furthermore, we clarify that the magnetization vector alone is insufficient to describe entirely the magnetic response of an MRE solid; instead, the introduction of one of the original Maxwell fields is always necessary for a complete representation.</description>

      <title>Surface and sub-surface modifications of copper electrodes exposed to high-field conditioning at cryogenic temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to investigate the dependence of conditioning and field-holding on temperature, three pairs of copper electrodes underwent high voltage conditioning with direct current (DC) pulses while kept at a single temperature, unique for each set (300~K, 30~K and 10~K), until saturation field for each set was found. The sets conditioned at cold showed a significant increase in the field holding capability, reaching fields up to 147 MV/m after tens of millions of pulses and very few breakdowns (BDs). We interpret this as an indication of the conditioning effect being due to high field pulsing rather than exposure to BDs. The effect of the warm and cold conditioning was investigated with high-resolution microscopy, characterizing the BD spots on the anode and cathode according to their morphology and with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analyzing the changes in the sub-surface regions. Atypical BD spot features were found on the cryogenically conditioned cathode surfaces, with very shallow craters of a star-like shape. The number of atypical spots increased with decreased temperatures, reaching 26 and 53 percent of the total number of spots at 30~K and 10~K, respectively. A hypothesis explaining the formation of these features is also presented. The very different morphology of the anode and cathode BD spots is presented in detail that suggesting an unknown shielding mechanism that prevents the center of the anode spot from melting. These results provide important experimental input for the development of quantitative theories and models for BD initiation and inter-electrode plasma formation.</description>

      <title>Anomalous continuum scattering and higher-order van Hove singularity in the strongly anisotropic S = 1/2 triangular lattice antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The S = 1/2 triangular lattice antiferromagnet (TLAF) stands out as a paradigmatic example of frustrated quantum magnetism. An ongoing challenge involves understanding the influence of exchange anisotropy on the collective behavior within such systems. Using inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and advanced calculation techniques, we have studied the low and high temperature spin dynamics of Ba2La2CoTe2O12 (BLCTO): a Co2+-based Jeff = 1/2 TLAF that exhibits 120 deg order below TN = 3.26 K. The spin Hamiltonian was determined by fitting the energy-resolved paramagnetic excitations measured at T &gt; TN, revealing an exceptionally strong easy-plane XXZ exchange anisotropy. Below TN, the excitation spectrum exhibits a high energy continuum having a larger spectral weight than the single-magnon modes. Combined with advanced theoretical calculations of magnetic excitations based on magnons and spinons, this observation suggests a scenario characterized by a spinon confinement length that markedly exceeds the lattice spacing. We conjecture that this phenomenon arises due to the proximity to a quantum melting point, which persists even in the presence of strong easy-plane XXZ anisotropy. Finally, we highlight characteristic flat features in the excitation spectrum, which are connected to higher-order van Hove singularities in the magnon dispersion and are directly induced by easy-plane XXZ anisotropy. Our results provide a rare experimental insight into the nature of highly anisotropic S = 1/2 TLAFs between the Heisenberg and XY limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ca$_2$FeMnO$_6$ (CFMO) double perovskite was studied using first principles density functional theory and tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonian modeling using extended Hubbard model. We have shown by electronic structure analysis that charge- and magnetic-ordering are driven by charge disproportionation at low temperature caused by partial localization of O-$2p$ ligand holes at alternate Fe sites that creates Jahn-Teller distortion, which leads to metal to insulator transition (MIT) in CFMO. Our results suggests MIT was triggered by negative charge-transfer energy of self-hole doping, responsible for symmetry lowering transitions. Notably, the band-gap was found to fundamentally controlled by the strength of the charge-transfer energy, and not by the Mott-Hubbard interactions, which can be modeled by composition, pressure or stoichiometry modulations. The fundamental insights presented in this work will help understand similar physics and mechanisms in other class of perovskites and correlated metals.</description>

      <title>Revealing process and material parameter effects on densification via phase-field studies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sintering is an important processing step in both ceramics and metals processing. The microstructure resulting from this process determines many materials properties of interest. Hence the accurate prediction of the microstructure, depending on processing and materials parameters, is of great importance. The phase-field method offers a way of predicting this microstructural evolution on a mesoscopic scale. The present paper employs this method to investigate concurrent densification and grain growth and the influence of stress on densification. Furthermore, the method is applied to simulate the entire freeze-casting process chain for the first time ever by simulating the freezing and sintering processes separately and passing the frozen microstructure to the present sintering model.</description>

      <title>Impact of strain on the SOT-driven dynamics of thin film Mn$_3$Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mn$_3$Sn, a metallic antiferromagnet with an anti-chiral 120$^\circ$ spin structure, generates intriguing magneto-transport signatures such as a large anomalous Hall effect, spin-polarized current with novel symmetries, anomalous Nernst effect, and magneto-optic Kerr effect. When grown epitaxially as MgO(110)[001]$\parallel$ Mn$_3$Sn($0\bar{1}\bar{1}0$)[0001], Mn$_3$Sn experiences a uniaxial tensile strain, which changes the bulk six-fold anisotropy landscape to a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with two stable states. In this work, we investigate the field-assisted spin orbit-torque (SOT)-driven response of the order parameter in single-domain Mn$_3$Sn with uniaxial tensile strain. We find that for a non-zero external magnetic field, the order parameter can be switched between the two stable states if the magnitude of the input current is between two field-dependent critical currents. Below the lower critical current, the order parameter exhibits a stationary state in the vicinity of the initial stable state. On the other hand, above the higher critical current, the order parameter shows oscillatory dynamics which could be tuned from the 100's of megahertz to the gigahertz range. We obtain approximate expressions of the two critical currents and find them to agree very well with the numerical simulations for experimentally relevant magnetic fields. We also obtain unified functional form of the switching time versus the input current for different magnetic fields. Finally, we show that for lower values of Gilbert damping ($\alpha \leq 2\times 10^{-3}$), the critical currents and the final steady states depend significantly on the damping constant. The numerical and analytic results presented in our work can be used by both theorists and experimentalists to understand the SOT-driven order dynamics in PMA Mn$_3$Sn and design future experiments and devices.</description>

Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures are promising for adding new functionalities to two-dimensional materials. In this study, we focus on single photon emitters hosted in one layer and adjacent to other insulating two-dimensional material. Specifically, we show how the emission energy is modified by such a heterostructure. We developed a general approach to elucidate the mechanisms affecting the emission energy and studied the particular case of carbon substitutions in the hexagonal boron nitride bilayer.</description>

      <title>Training-set-free two-stage deep learning for spectroscopic data de-noising</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: De-noising is a prominent step in the spectra post-processing procedure. Previous machine learning-based methods are fast but mostly based on supervised learning and require a training set that may be typically expensive in real experimental measurements. Unsupervised learning-based algorithms are slow and require many iterations to achieve convergence. Here, we bridge this gap by proposing a training-set-free two-stage deep learning method. We show that the fuzzy fixed input in previous methods can be improved by introducing an adaptive prior. Combined with more advanced optimization techniques, our approach can achieve five times acceleration compared to previous work. Theoretically, we study the landscape of a corresponding non-convex linear problem, and our results indicates that this problem has benign geometry for first-order algorithms to converge.</description>

      <title>Half-Metallic Ferromagnetic Weyl Fermions Related to Dynamic Correlations in the Zinc-blende Compound VAs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The realization of 100\% polarized topological Weyl fermions in half-metallic ferromagnets is of particular importance for fundamental research and spintronic applications. Here, we theoretically investigate the electronic and topological properties of the zinc-blende compound VAs, which was deemed as a half-metallic ferromagnet related to dynamic correlations. Based on the combination of density functional theory and dynamical mean field theory, we uncover that the half-metallic ferromagnet VAs exhibit attractive Weyl semimetallic behaviors with twelve pairs of Weyl points, which are very close to the Fermi level. Meanwhile, we also investigate the magnetization-dependent topological properties; the results show that the change of magnetization directions only slightly affects the positions of Weyl points, which is attributed to the weak spin-orbital coupling effects. The topological surface states of VAs projected on semi-infinite (001) and (111) surfaces are investigated. The Fermi arcs of all Weyl points are clearly visible on the projected Fermi surfaces. Our findings suggest that VAs is a fully spin-polarized Weyl semimetal with many-body correlated effects for spintronic applications.</description>

Abstract: The Toffoli gate is the essential ingredient for reversible computing, an energy efficient classical computational paradigm that evades the energy dissipation resulting from Landauer's principle. In this paper we analyze different setups to realize a magnetic implementation of the Toffoli gate using three interacting classical spins, each one embodying one of the three bits needed for the Toffoli gate. In our scheme, different control-spins configurations produce an effective field capable of conditionally flipping the target spin. We study what are the experimental requirements for the realization of our scheme, focusing on the degree of local control, the ability to dynamically switch the spin-spin interactions, and the required single-spin anisotropies to make the classical spin stable, showing that these are compatible with current technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The doped Hubbard model is one of the paradigmatic platforms to engineer exotic quantum many-body states, including charge-ordered states, strange metals and unconventional superconductors. While undoped and doped correlated phases have been experimentally realized in a variety twisted van der Waals materials, experiments in monolayer materials, and in particular 1T transition metal dichalcogenides, have solely reached the conventional insulating undoped regime. Correlated phases in monolayer two-dimensional materials have much higher associated energy scales than their twisted counterparts, making doped correlated monolayers an attractive platform for high temperature correlated quantum matter. Here, we demonstrate the realization of a doped Mott phase in a van der Waals dichalcogenide 1T-NbSe$_2$ monolayer. The system is electron doped due to electron transfer to a monolayer van der Waals substrate via proximity, leading to a correlated triangular lattice with both half-filled and fully-filled sites. We analyze the distribution of the half-filled and filled sites and show the arrangement is unlikely to be controlled by disorder alone, and we show that the presence of competing non-local many-body correlations would account for the charge correlations found experimentally. Our results establish 1T-NbSe$_2$ as a potential monolayer platform to explore correlated doped Mott physics in a frustrated lattice.</description>

Abstract: Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (CXDI) technique offers unique insights into the nanoscale world, enabling the reconstruction of 3D structures with a nanoscale resolution achieved through computational phase reconstruction from measured scattered intensity maps. Computational demands of 3D CXDI, however, limit its real-time application in experimental settings. This work presents a carousel phase retrieval algorithm (CPRA) that enables the real-time, high-resolution reconstruction of computationally complex 3D objects. CPRA is based on representing the 3D reconstruction problem as a set of 2D reconstructions of projected images corresponding to different experimentally collected angles via the Fourier slice theorem. Consistency between the 2D reconstructed images is based on an iterative procedure, in which each 2D reconstruction accounts for the adjacent 2D reconstructed images in a periodic (carousel) manner. Demonstrations on complex systems, including a lithium-rich layered oxide particle and a Staphylococcus aureus biological cell, demonstrate that CPRA significantly enhances the reconstruction quality and enables the reconstruction process to be completed in real time during experiment.</description>

      <title>A-15 type superconducting hydride $La_4H_{23}$: Nanograined structure with low strain, strong electron-phonon interaction, and moderate level of nonadiabaticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For seven decades by A-15 superconductors we meant metallic $A_3B$ alloys (where A is a transition metal, and B is groups IIIB and IVB element) discovered by Hardy and Hulm (Phys. Rev. 89, 884 (1953)). Nb3Ge exhibited the highest superconducting transition temperature, $T_c = 23 K$, among these alloys. One of these alloys, $Nb_3Sn$, is primary material in modern applied superconductivity. Recently Guo et al (arXiv:2307.13067) extended the family of superconductors where the metallic ions arranged in the beta tungsten (A-15) sublattice by observation of $T_{c,zero} = 81 K$ in $La_4H_{23}$ phase compressed at $P = 118 GPa$. Despite the $La_4H_{23}$ has much lower $T_c$ in comparison with near-room-temperature superconducting $LaH_{10}$ phase ($T_{c,zero} = 250 K$ at $P = 200 GPa$) discovered by Drozdov et al (Nature 569, 531 (2019)), the $La_4H_{23}$ holds the record high $T_c$ within A-15 family. Cross et al (Phys. Rev. B 109, L020503 (2024)) confirmed the high-temperature superconductivity in the compressed $La_4H_{23}$. In this paper, we analyzed available experimental data measured in $La_4H_{23}$ and found that this superconductor exhibits nanograined structure, 6 nm &lt; D &lt; 27 nm, low crystalline strain &lt; 0.005, high electron-phonon coupling constant, 1.5 &lt; $\lambda_{e-ph}$ &lt; 2.7, and moderate level of the nonadiabaticity $\Theta_{D}/T_{F}$. We found that derived $\Theta_{D}/T_{F}$ and $T_c/T_F$ values for the $La_4H_{23}$ phase are similar to the ones in cuprates, pnictides, and near-room-temperature superconductors $H_3S$ and $LaH_{10}$, which implies that the $La_4H_{23}$ phase falls to unconventional superconductors band in the Uemura plot.</description>
