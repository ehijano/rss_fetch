      <title>Unveiling Saving and Credit Dynamics: Insights from Financial Diaries and Surveys among Low-Income Households in Unauthorized Colonies in Delhi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents findings from a comprehensive study examining the saving and credit behaviors of low-income households residing in unauthorized colonies within a metropolitan area. Utilizing a dual approach, the study engaged in prolonged fieldwork, including repeated fortnightly interviews with selected households and a one-time primary survey with a larger sample size. The research meticulously analyzed the financial lives of these households, focusing on their saving and credit behaviors and assessing the accessibility and intensity of usage of financial instruments available to them. Through suitable regression models, the study identified key factors influencing the usage of financial instruments among low-income households. Transaction costs, convenience, and financial knowledge emerged as significant determinants impacting both usage decisions and the intensity of usage. The research underscores the importance of addressing demand side factors to ensure widespread financial services usage among low-income groups. Efforts to reduce time costs, enhance product accessibility and liquidity, and augment financial literacy are essential for fostering financial inclusion in unauthorized colonies. The findings highlight the imperative of moving beyond mere financial access towards promoting universal usage to realize the full benefits of financial inclusion.</description>

      <title>The Value of Solving Pains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework aimed at identifying and quantifying the value of customer pains as a critical element in service innovation. The proposed approach enhances existing end-to-end frameworks by offering a structured method to elaborate on and measure the value derived from solving these customer challenges. The effectiveness of the framework is validated by operationalizing it in an industrial case study, where the model parameters were captured specifically and the value of solving various operational and structural pains was evaluated numerically.</description>

      <title>Social media and suicide: empirical evidence from the quasi-exogenous geographical adoption of Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media usage is often cited as a potential driver behind the rising suicide rates. However, distinguishing the causal effect - whether social media increases the risk of suicide - from reverse causality, where individuals already at higher risk of suicide are more likely to use social media, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we use an instrumental variable approach to study the quasi-exogenous geographical adoption of Twitter and its causal relationship with suicide rates. Our analysis first demonstrates that Twitter's geographical adoption was driven by the presence of certain users at the 2007 SXSW festival, which led to long-term disparities in adoption rates across counties in the United States. Then, using a two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression and controlling for a wide range of geographic, socioeconomic and demographic factors, we find no significant relationship between Twitter adoption and suicide rates.</description>

      <title>Never-ending Search for Innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a model of investment in innovation that is dynamic, features multiple heterogeneous research projects of which only one potentially leads to success, and in each period, the researcher chooses the set of projects to invest in. We show that if a search for innovation starts, it optimally does not end until the innovation is found -- which will be never with a strictly positive probability.</description>

      <title>A Global Minimum Tax for Large Firms Only: Implications for Tax Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Global Minimum Tax (GMT) is applied only to firms above a certain size threshold, permitting countries to set differential tax rates for small and large firms. We analyze tax competition among multiple tax havens and a non-haven country for heterogeneous multinationals to evaluate the effects of this partial coverage of GMT. Upon the introduction of a moderately low GMT rate, the havens commit to the single uniform GMT rate for all multinationals. However, gradual increases in the GMT rate induce the havens, and subsequently the non-haven, to adopt discriminatory, lower tax rates for small multinationals. Our calibration exercise shows that the implementation of a 15% GMT rate results in a regime where only the havens adopt split tax rates. Upon GMT introduction, welfare and tax revenues fall in the tax havens but rise in the non-haven, yielding a positive net gain worldwide.</description>

      <title>Distilling Data from Large Language Models: An Application to Research Productivity Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08030v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a method for assigning high-quality labels to unstructured text, based on fine-tuning an open-source language model with data extracted from a proprietary large language model. We apply this method to construct a census of published clinical trials. With these data, we revisit a literature that contends that pharmaceutical research productivity is declining. Measurements of substantial increases in the quantity of clinical trials are central to this conclusion. In our data, the quantity and composition of trials are stable since 2010. Previous measurements are an artifact of biases driven by shifts in the composition of other forms of research.</description>

      <title>Simulating Liquidity: Agent-Based Modeling of Illiquid Markets for Fractional Ownership</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research investigates liquidity dynamics in fractional ownership markets, focusing on illiquid alternative investments traded on a FinTech platform. By leveraging empirical data and employing agent-based modeling (ABM), the study simulates trading behaviors in sell offer-driven systems, providing a foundation for generating insights into how different market structures influence liquidity. The ABM-based simulation model provides a data augmentation environment which allows for the exploration of diverse trading architectures and rules, offering an alternative to direct experimentation. This approach bridges academic theory and practical application, supported by collaboration with industry and Swiss federal funding. The paper lays the foundation for planned extensions, including the identification of a liquidity-maximizing trading environment and the design of a market maker, by simulating the current functioning of the investment platform using an ABM specified with empirical data.</description>
