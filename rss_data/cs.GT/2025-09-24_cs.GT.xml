      <title>On Sybil-proofness in Restaking Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Restaking protocols expand validator responsibilities beyond consensus, but their security depends on resistance to Sybil attacks. We introduce a formal framework for Sybil-proofness in restaking networks, distinguishing between two types of attacks, one in which other Sybil identities are kept out of an attack and one where multiple Sybil identities attack. We analyze marginal and multiplicative slashing mechanisms and characterize the conditions under which each deters Sybil strategies. We then prove an impossibility theorem: no slashing mechanism can simultaneously prevent both attack types. Finally, we study the impact of network structure through random graph models: while Erd\"os-R\'enyi networks remain Sybil-proof, even minimal heterogeneity in a two-block stochastic block model makes Sybil attacks profitable. These results reveal fundamental limits of mechanism design for restaking and highlight the critical role of network topology.</description>

      <title>Fair Decisions through Plurality: Results from a Crowdfunding Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss an algorithmic intervention aimed at increasing equity and economic efficiency at a crowdfunding platform that gives cash subsidies to grantees. Through a blend of technical and qualitative methods, we show that the previous algorithm used by the platform -- Quadratic Funding (QF) -- suffered problems because its design was rooted in a model of individuals as isolated and selfish. We present an alternative algorithm -- Connection-Oriented Quadratic Funding (CO-QF) -- rooted in a theory of plurality and prosocial utilities, and show that it qualitatively and quantitatively performs better than QF. CO-QF has achieved an 89% adoption rate at the platform and has distributed over $4 Million to date. In simulations we show that it provides better social welfare than QF. While our design for CO-QF was responsive to the needs of a specific community, we also extrapolate out of this context to show that CO-QF is a potentially helpful tool for general-purpose public decision making.</description>

      <title>Group Formation through Game Theory and Agent-Based Modeling: Spatial Cohesion, Heterogeneity, and Resource Pooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a game-theoretic model and an agent-based model to study group formation driven by resource pooling, spatial cohesion, and heterogeneity. We focus on cross-sector partnerships (CSPs) involving public, private, and nonprofit organizations, each contributing distinct resources. Group formation occurs as agents strategically optimize their choices in response to others within a competitive setting. We prove the existence of stable group equilibria and simulate formation dynamics under varying spatial and resource conditions. The results show that limited individual resources lead to groups that form mainly among nearby actors, while abundant resources allow groups to move across larger distances. Increased resource heterogeneity and spatial proximity promote the formation of larger and more diverse groups. These findings reveal key trade-offs shaping group size and composition, guiding strategies for effective cross-sector collaborations and multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Proximately Envy-Free and Efficient Allocation of Mixed Manna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of fair and efficient allocations of indivisible items is a central problem in fair division. For indivisible goods, the existence of Pareto efficient (PO) and envy free up to one item (EF1) allocations was established by Caragiannis et al. In a recent breakthrough, Mahara established the existence of PO and EF1 allocations for indivisible chores.
  However, the existence of PO and EF1 allocations of mixed manna remains an intriguing open problem. In this paper, we make significant progress in this direction. We establish the existence of allocations that are PO and introspective envy free up to one item (IEF1) for mixed manna. In an IEF1 allocation, each agent can eliminate its envy towards all the other agents by either adding an item or removing an item from its own bundle. The notion of IEF1 coincides with EF1 for indivisible chores, and hence, our existence result generalizes the aforementioned result of Mahara.</description>

      <title>Approximating Electoral Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much research in electoral control -- one of the most studied form of electoral attacks, in which an entity running an election alters the structure of that election to yield a preferred outcome -- has focused on giving decision complexity results, e.g., membership in P, NP-completeness, or fixed-parameter tractability. Approximation algorithms on the other hand have received little attention in electoral control, despite their prevalence in the study of other forms of electoral attacks, such as manipulation and bribery. Early work established some preliminary results with respect to popular voting rules such as plurality, approval, and Condorcet. In this paper, we establish for each of the ``standard'' control problems under plurality, approval, and Condorcet, whether they are approximable, and we prove our results in both the weighted and unweighted voter settings. For each problem we study under either approval or Condorcet, we show that any approximation algorithm we give is optimal, unless P=NP. Our approximation algorithms leverage the fact that Covering Integer Programs (CIPs) can be approximated within a factor of $O(\log n)$. Under plurality, we give an $O(m)$-approximation algorithm, and give as lower bound $\Omega(m^{1/4})$, by using a known lower bound on the Minimum $k$-Union (M$k$U) problem. To our knowledge, this is the first application of M$k$U in computational social choice. We also generalize our $O(m)$-approximation algorithm to work with respect to an infinite family of voting rules using an axiomatic approach. Our work closes a long list of open problems established 18 years ago.</description>

      <title>A Coopetitive-Compatible Data Generation Framework for Cross-silo Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (CFL) enables organizations (e.g., hospitals or banks) to collaboratively train artificial intelligence (AI) models while preserving data privacy by keeping data local. While prior work has primarily addressed statistical heterogeneity across organizations, a critical challenge arises from economic competition, where organizations may act as market rivals, making them hesitant to participate in joint training due to potential utility loss (i.e., reduced net benefit). Furthermore, the combined effects of statistical heterogeneity and inter-organizational competition on organizational behavior and system-wide social welfare remain underexplored. In this paper, we propose CoCoGen, a coopetitive-compatible data generation framework, leveraging generative AI (GenAI) and potential game theory to model, analyze, and optimize collaborative learning under heterogeneous and competitive settings. Specifically, CoCoGen characterizes competition and statistical heterogeneity through learning performance and utility-based formulations and models each training round as a weighted potential game. We then derive GenAI-based data generation strategies that maximize social welfare. Experimental results on the Fashion-MNIST dataset reveal how varying heterogeneity and competition levels affect organizational behavior and demonstrate that CoCoGen consistently outperforms baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Fair and Efficient Public Transportation: A Bus Stop Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a stylized formal model of public transportation, where a set of agents need to travel along a given road, and there is a bus that runs the length of this road. Each agent has a left terminal and a right terminal between which they wish to travel; they can walk all the way, or walk to/from the nearest stop and use the bus for the rest of their journey. The bus can make a fixed number of stops, and the planner needs to select locations for these stops. We study notions of efficiency and fairness for this setting. First, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a solution that minimizes the total travel time; our approach can capture further extensions of the base model, such as more general cost functions or existing infrastructure. Second, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm that outputs solutions with provable fairness guarantees (such as a variant of the justified representation axiom or $2$-approximate core) as long as the agents' costs only depend on the distance they need to walk. Our simulations indicate that our algorithm almost always outputs fair solutions, even for parameter regimes that do not admit theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>A Vision for Trustworthy, Fair, and Efficient Socio-Technical Control using Karma Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control systems will play a pivotal role in addressing societal-scale challenges as they drive the development of sustainable future smart cities. At the heart of these challenges is the trustworthy, fair, and efficient allocation of scarce public resources, including renewable energy, transportation, data, computation, etc.. Historical evidence suggests that monetary control -- the prototypical mechanism for managing resource scarcity -- is not always well-accepted in socio-technical resource contexts. In this vision article, we advocate for karma economies as an emerging non-monetary mechanism for socio-technical control. Karma leverages the repetitive nature of many socio-technical resources to jointly attain trustworthy, fair, and efficient allocations; by budgeting resource consumption over time and letting resource users ``play against their future selves.'' To motivate karma, we review related concepts in economics through a control systems lens, and make a case for a) shifting the viewpoint of resource allocations from single-shot and static to repeated and dynamic games; and b) adopting long-run Nash welfare as the formalization of ``fairness and efficiency'' in socio-technical contexts. We show that in many dynamic resource settings, karma Nash equilibria maximize long-run Nash welfare. Moreover, we discuss implications for a future smart city built on multi-karma economies: by choosing whether to combine different socio-technical resources, e.g., electricity and transportation, in a single karma economy, or separate into resource-specific economies, karma provides new flexibility to design the scope of fairness and efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Game theory provides a framework for studying communication dynamics and emergent phenomena arising from rational agent interactions. We present a model framework for the Volunteer's Dilemma with four key contributions: (1) formulating it as a stochastic concurrent nn n-player game, (2) developing properties to verify model correctness and reachability, (3) constructing strategy synthesis graphs to identify optimal game trajectories, and (4) analyzing parameter correlations with expected local and global rewards over finite time horizons.</description>

      <title>Global Convergence of Multi-Agent Policy Gradient in Markov Potential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.01969v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Potential games are arguably one of the most important and widely studied classes of normal form games. They define the archetypal setting of multi-agent coordination as all agent utilities are perfectly aligned with each other via a common potential function. Can this intuitive framework be transplanted in the setting of Markov Games? What are the similarities and differences between multi-agent coordination with and without state dependence? We present a novel definition of Markov Potential Games (MPG) that generalizes prior attempts at capturing complex stateful multi-agent coordination. Counter-intuitively, insights from normal-form potential games do not carry over as MPGs can consist of settings where state-games can be zero-sum games. In the opposite direction, Markov games where every state-game is a potential game are not necessarily MPGs. Nevertheless, MPGs showcase standard desirable properties such as the existence of deterministic Nash policies. In our main technical result, we prove fast convergence of independent policy gradient to Nash policies by adapting recent gradient dominance property arguments developed for single agent MDPs to multi-agent learning settings.</description>

      <title>The ICML 2023 Ranking Experiment: Examining Author Self-Assessment in ML/AI Peer Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conducted an experiment during the review process of the 2023 International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), asking authors with multiple submissions to rank their papers based on perceived quality. In total, we received 1,342 rankings, each from a different author, covering 2,592 submissions. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of how author-provided rankings could be leveraged to improve peer review processes at machine learning conferences. We focus on the Isotonic Mechanism, which calibrates raw review scores using the author-provided rankings. Our analysis shows that these ranking-calibrated scores outperform the raw review scores in estimating the ground truth ``expected review scores'' in terms of both squared and absolute error metrics. Furthermore, we propose several cautious, low-risk applications of the Isotonic Mechanism and author-provided rankings in peer review, including supporting senior area chairs in overseeing area chairs' recommendations, assisting in the selection of paper awards, and guiding the recruitment of emergency reviewers.</description>
